Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, good afternoon and welcome back to Washington, D.C. I am sure, like me, you spent some time back in your district this weekend. Every year, on Memorial Day, this country pauses to honor and remember those soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms and liberties. If I could, I would like to share a story from my own district, from my own State of Kansas, which I got to participate in this past weekend. For over 30 years now, Vietnam veterans have participated in the ‘‘Run for the Wall.’’ I am sure this is something that many of us are all familiar with. Starting in California, some 1,500 Vietnam veterans hop on their motorcycles and they take three different routes across the country, with the goal to end up in Washington, D.C. at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial over Memorial Day weekend. Every year, one of their stops is in Goodland, Kansas, which is in the northwest corner of my State. I was allowed to participate in the hospitality extended by those folks in Goodland. If you could, imagine a small city of 4,000 to 5,000 people and having 600 motorcycles show up on a Saturday afternoon. They had been driving all the way from Albuquerque, New Mexico, through 30mileanhour winds and rain, so they were starving by the time they got to Goodland, Kansas. And when they get there, we have a welcome reception for them with a complete dinner: a hot meal, fresh fruits, vegetables, the whole works. With one simple Facebook message, over 600 homemade deserts were brought from across Goodland to feed and recognize those Vietnam veterans. Then Sunday morning, the veterans wake up, after having been provided housing at Northwest Technical College for free, they wake up to a hot pancake and sausage breakfast, provided by the local Rotary Club. Then those veterans hop on their motorcycles, and they drive on the interstate across Kansas. At every interstate where there is an overpass, there are Kansas citizens waving at them and giving them the heroes welcome that they never got some, I guess, 40 years ago. They end up at Fort Riley, ‘‘Home of the Big Red One,’’ and there, Fort Riley makes a super welcome for those soldiers, and again, gives them a hero’s welcome. These soldiers are going to show up here on Friday and they are going to get together at the Pentagon. At that point, over 500,000 motorcycles will be going across the mall of the United States Capital and on to Arlington Cemetery. I hope and pray that our news media will share that story of all those soldiers who are now trying to close the chapter, trying to honor those who went before them, to honor their fellow soldiers who never made it back from that war. I just ask that the House and this country pause to remember our Vietnam veterans, and all of our veterans going back to the Civil War, all those soldiers that have made the ultimate sacrifice. f 
SUPPORTING THE HONOR FLIGHT IN EPHRATA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MARSHALL ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on May 19, we recognized Armed Forces Day. This is a day set aside to honor the brave men and women serving in the U.S. military across the country. In central Washington, this day was celebrated by the Ephrata community at an event put on by the American Legion. The annual Nacho/Taco Feed and Dessert was first started by 9yearold Justin Pederson, who wanted to help veterans in the area take the Honor Flight to Washington, D.C. I have had the distinct honor to welcome Honor Flight veterans from central Washington, and it was an opportunity that I will never forget. The Honor Flight enables veterans from World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war, to visit the memorials that have been erected for their service. 
I want to thank Justin and the American Legion in Ephrata for their work to support the Honor Flight. Spending the afternoon learning about the once in a lifetime experiences from local veterans is an excellent way to recognize military members. I look forward to greeting more veterans from Washington in the future.

SUPPORTING THE PROTECT LIFE RULE (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to applaud President Trump for issuing the Protect Life Rule, delivering on his promise to ensure that the government is not involved in the abortion business—either directly or indirectly. When Title X was created in 1970, Congress intended for these funds to go toward family planning programs, explicitly barring abortion providers from receiving funds by stating: ‘‘None of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.’’ Since then, the will of Congress and those we represent has been undermined as Title X funds have routinely contributed to employee salaries, facility costs, and medical supplies for abortion providers. The Protect Life Rule is a victory for the majority of Americans who are fundamentally opposed to taxpayerfunded abortion without decreasing funding for other Title X beneficiaries, and I stand by our prolife President’s decision. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio). Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 3 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 7 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. DUNN.

The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1972 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material into the RECORD on H.R. 1972, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1972, as amended, the VA Billing Accountability Act. This bill would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs to waive copayment requirements if veterans are not notified of their need to pay a copayment for a given service in a timely manner. VA’s untimely processing of claims is welldocumented. The negative impact those challenges have on recruiting and retaining community providers is also welldocumented. However, those challenges also have a negative impact on our veterans. Three years ago this June, the VA Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, initiated a review of past processes on veteran inpatient copayment charges for the years 2011 to 2015. Following that review, thousands of veterans in Minnesota and Wisconsin were charged copayments for services that they had received as much as 4 years earlier. Receiving a large bill out of the blue for care that was received, in some cases years ago, understandably caused great concern and upset among veterans. The VA Billing Accountability Act would prevent that. The VA MISSION Act that the House passed last week included several provisions that would make it easier for the VA to process and pay claims accurately and on time. This bill would protect veterans by setting specific notification procedures that the VA must abide by when a veteran is going to be charged a copayment for a VA service and by authorizing the VA to waive a copayment if an error committed by the VA caused a delayed notification. I am grateful to my colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative LLOYD  SMUCKER , for introducing this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 1972, but I would once again like to note we are here again with the most productive committee in the United States Congress, the most bipartisan committee, the most open, and it is fitting, going into Memorial Day, that the question of the shared commitment to this Nation’s veterans is never in question. So I am grateful. I would also like to extend thanks to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), for his work on this piece of legislation, bringing it to light and continuing to carry this until we got it to the floor. This committee has heard from veterans across the country that have experienced harassment from debt collectors or experienced adverse credit reporting through no fault of their own. The bill simply requires VA to waive any of those copayments due by a veteran when VA makes an error that causes significant delay in notification of the copayment. It is a very simple solution to a problem that can significantly impact nearly every aspect of a veterans’ life. This can add unnecessary stress for veterans when they are trying to pay their medical expenses and make ends meet. Veterans shouldn’t be hung out to dry when the VA is at fault. This legislation would mitigate the harm a delayed copayment notification could create for a veteran. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for this bill being brought up today by the gentleman, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ), my friend and classmate. He is also the gentleman who introduced this bill. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his tireless work on behalf of our veterans to improve their lives and the lives of their families. I rise today in support of my bipartisan legislation to relieve veterans of financial burdens caused by delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Over the past decade, Federal oversight of the VA has uncovered cases where the VA delivered delayed or inaccurate bills to our Nation’s veterans, causing financial stress and debt for military families—some bills going back as far as 5 years. In fact, last August, the VA Inspector General published a report that said the VA issued 1.7 million improper bills to veterans in 2015. What exactly does that mean? It means that the VA collected nearly $14 million from improper bills sent to veterans for their servicerelated care. That is simply unacceptable. Our servicemen and women should not have to pay for errors or delays caused by the VA. Many veterans live on fixed incomes and may not have the resources to cover unexpected costs caused by mistakes of Washington bureaucrats. That is why I introduced the VA Billing Accountability Act with my colleagues from Minnesota, Mr. EMMER  and Mr. PETERSON . My district is home to more than 38,000 veterans. Each one of them, and all those across the country, deserve the highest quality medical care and assurances that they will be billed in a timely and appropriate manner. This bipartisan legislation gives the VA the authority to waive a veteran’s copayment if the veteran received a bill more than 180 days after they received their care at the VA or 18 months after they received care at a nonVA facility. This bill is supported by AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of American, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign War, and the Association of the United States Navy. Our Nation’s veterans and their families have sacrificed so much in defense of our Nation. We should be doing all that we can to make their transition to civilian life as easy as possible, and that starts with making sure the VA not only delivers highquality care, but also issues timely bills that our veterans and their families can count on. Ultimately, this bill will help bring more stability and financial security to their postmilitary lives. I am proud to have introduced this legislation on behalf of the veterans and military families that I represent, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get it signed into law. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), who has been working very hard on this bill. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for his leadership, as well. There seems to be a lot of Minnesotans very concerned about this issue. I rise today in support of H.R. 1972, the VA Billing Accountability Act, authored by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative LLOYD SMUCKER . I am proud to cosponsor this important legislation. During my time in Congress, I have been privileged to meet with many of our Nation’s veterans. Far too often, our Nation’s heroes do not get the treatment and care they deserve. During my early days in Congress, nearly 1,500 instances of the delayed payment of veterans’ medical bills were uncovered at a local VA in my home State of Minnesota. Without notification or explanation, veterans were seeing their monthly statement increase by hundreds of dollars, understandably causing panic and worry. After Congress got involved, the VA helped our veterans by outlining explanations for the charges, repayment options, and above all, offering them reassurance and relief from the stress and anxiety they were experiencing. This story is one of the many illustrating the need for the VA Billing Accountability Act. This issue is not unique to Minnesota. In 2015, 1.7 million improper bills were issued by the VA, leading to $13.9 erroneously collected from our Nation’s heroes. Veterans and their loved ones have sacrificed so much in defense of our Nation. Unacceptable delays in payment and billing errors intensify the care disparity veterans already face. The VA must be held accountable, and H.R. 1972 is the first step in creating a more transparent Veterans Administration. Specifically, the bill will authorize the VA to waive payment for delayed bills that veterans receive due to VA error. Minnesota is home to 337,362 veterans, each of whom deserves quality care without the stress and anxiety caused by unexpected or incorrect billings. Our Nation’s servicemembers should not have to pay for errors or delays caused by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Representative SMUCKER  for his leadership on this issue; as well as Chairman ROE; my colleague, the ranking member from Minnesota’s Seventh District, and the entire staff of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee for their hard work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1972. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, again, I too, would like to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Representative SMUCKER , and Representative E MMER  for their tireless work for care of veterans not just in Minnesota, but across the country. I also thank the gentleman from Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in passing H.R. 1972, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ranking Member WALZ. I once again encourage all Members to support H.R. 1972, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1972, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
MILITARY SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS EMPOWERMENT ACT Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3642) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to improve the access to private health care for veterans who are survivors of military sexual trauma, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material into the RECORD on H.R. 3642, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3642, as amended, the Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment Act. It is a tragic fact that there are an increasing number of veterans who report experiencing sexual harassment or assault while serving on Active Duty in our Armed Forces. These veterans deserve the very best care and treatment that we can offer them for the psychological trauma that they may be feeling as a result of that experience. This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to furnish care in the community to veterans who have experienced military sexual trauma. This would ensure the veterans in pilot locations are able to choose a provider that best meets their specific needs and that they are most comfortable with. This bill is sponsored by Representative ANDYBARRfrom Kentucky, and I thank him for his tireless advocacy to ensure access to care for veterans who have experienced this trauma. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of highquality, accessible treatment options for survivors of military sexual trauma. I want to thank the gentleman. His concern is exactly in the right place. It is focusing our attention on this issue. There are some things in the bill, though, that I would like to point out, and these concerns have been shared by some of the veterans service organizations. I do this in the spirit of the gentleman is exactly right on what needs to be done. This is about a process of trying to improve upon a piece of language. The VA was unable to submit views on this bill because of timing on how it was brought up. For this reason, I would like to read just a few quotes from a statement the VA submitted on this bill to reflect the concerns shared by our staff and the VSO community. These are VA quotes: ‘‘Aspects of the bill could jeopardize patient safety and wellbeing and create the ethically problematic situation of VA condoning and supporting a substandard level of care for program participants.’’ ‘‘It is possible some veterans would even choose to leave VA care entirely to avoid the study.’’ 
While I certainly appreciate the effort, I am of the belief that this study could misallocate VA’s limited resources to define a problem to which the RAND Corporation and the National Academy of Sciences have already offered potential solutions. b1515 I am supporting today’s amendment in the nature of a substitute but warning against future efforts to erode the high quality of care that VA is providing. In order to better reflect VA’s position on improving access to military sexual trauma, I am excited to work with our VSO partners on legislation that would implement some of the recommendations made in previous assessments and increase access to highquality care. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to join us in drafting legislation that continues to heal military sexual trauma victims. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), who is the sponsor of this bill. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this legislation, H.R. 3642, the Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment Act, also known as the Military SAVE Act, which would help the Department of Veterans Affairs identify deficiencies and vulnerabilities in their care for survivors of military sexual trauma and take corrective actions to improve those services. According to the findings of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ National Screening Program, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 100 men reported that they have been victims of military sexual assault during their time serving in the military. This problem was made personal to me by a group of women in the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, led by MST survivor Karen Tufts. Sadly, due in part to this emotional stress, two of these women have since committed suicide. To the ranking member’s concern about quality of care, the problem with some of these women was that they were revictimized at the VA. In fact, according to an independent nationwide study, research has found that female victims of MST are 14 times more likely to commit suicide than women who have never been assaulted, so we are all about improving the care of these women. And while Congress has recently taken several actions to better protect survivors of MST within the military justice system, many survivors have expressed concern that services available within the VA healthcare system are insufficient to address their specific postMST needs. That is exactly why we have been working closely with the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, veteran service organizations, as well, and my VA Pilot Program Development Task Force to improve medical care for survivors of MST in order to help those survivors get the care that best fits their unique physical and psychological needs. Specifically, this legislation would allow survivors the ability to seek treatment, specifically tailored to their MST injuries, by a community care provider of their choice during a 3 year pilot program. This pilot program would study the results that direct access care provides that the VA does not and would help the VA take the necessary corrective actions to improve its care for survivors of MST. In fact, our experience is that just the introduction of this legislation has focused the mind at the VA to improve the care that the VA provides. As I mentioned before, I did not create this legislation alone. It has been through the dedicated support and trusted advice of MST survivors who are members of our Pilot Program Development Task Force, and I thank them for their contributions, including former commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Veterans Affairs, Heather French Henry. In conclusion, I would like to especially thank Chairman ROEand his staff for their hard work in support of this legislation and for his longstanding leadership on veterans issue. Chairman ROEtruly cares about improving the lives of veterans, and this legislation is a testament to that devotion. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman’s commitment to this issue. I appreciate the work that has been spent to continue to evolve to get this right, because I do think there is, obviously, no disagreement in the scourge and the horrific crimes committed against servicemembers that we must deal with and the treatment of those victims afterwards. With that, I encourage my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. WALZ. Once again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 3642, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3642, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
VETERANS OPIOID ABUSE PREVENTION ACT Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3832) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the executive director of a national network of Statebased prescription monitoring programs under which Department of Veterans Affairs health care providers shall query such network, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3832 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material into the RECORD on H.R. 3832, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.R. 3832, as amended, the Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act. More than 140 individuals every day are dying from opioid abuse in the United States, and opioids have resulted in the deaths of more Americans than the Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam wars put together over the same period of time. Unfortunately, the news is even worse for our veterans. Former VA Secretary McDonald stated: Veterans are 10 times more likely to abuse opioids than the average American, and that is among the leading cause of homelessness among veterans. In 2016 alone, the VA treated 66,000 veterans for opioid addiction. Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we are failing our Nation’s heroes, and, frankly, that is unacceptable. That is why I introduced the Veterans Opioid Prevention Act, to ensure that no veteran slips through the cracks. My bill increases opioid prescribing transparency at the VA and allows Veterans Administration doctors to do what most private sector doctors are already doing. They access State databases listing all opioid prescriptions from all providers. This allows physicians to easily identify patterns of opioid use that puts patients at risk for addiction. Once physicians are able to accurately identify patterns of use and abuse, we can curb this epidemic and ensure our veterans are getting the best possible care. Mr. Speaker, as a veteran and a doctor, I take my responsibility to serve those who fought for our freedoms very seriously. We can do more for our veterans, and we must do more to support them and to protect them. I believe my Veterans Opioid Prevention Act does exactly that. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the gentleman’s Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act. It was about 10 years ago to the day that we stood on this floor when I had a piece of legislation, one of the first ones I authored as a Member of Congress, the steppedcare pain management for the prescription of opioids in the VA, and I remember delivering a speech right here that if we don’t do something about what is happening with the overprescription, we are going to be in a situation of crisis, I think, were the terms that I used. At that time, we started talking about multiple approaches to pain management. At the time we brought it up, the VA did not even want to consider things like acupuncture and yoga, and now we are at a situation where the gentleman is exactly right. Even with that, moving forward, according to the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law, between 2010 and 2015, the number of veterans addicted to opioids rose 55 percent to a total of roughly 68,000. This represents about 13 percent of all veterans currently prescribed opioids. Various published studies have found that there is a significant increased risk of suicide among our veterans and the general U.S. population when opioid use disorders are apparent. H.R. 3832, as amended, will require VA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with a Statebased prescription drug monitoring program in order to further reduce opioid misuse and dependency. By requiring VA to partner with the prescription drug program, the VA can better ensure veterans are receiving the most appropriate treatment available while significantly reducing the likelihood of abuse. We have an ethical responsibility to do everything we can in this country to reduce the opioid epidemic, certainly amongst our veterans. It is a step in the right direction to prevent the overprescription of opioids to veterans so that we can start preventing those veterans becoming addicted in the first place. I stand in strong support of this. Mr. Speaker, as stated, this is a good piece of legislation, smart move forward, and I encourage my colleagues to vote for it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 3832, as amended. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3832, the Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act. Mr. Speaker, it is undeniable that our military veterans deserve our deepest gratitude for the courage and valor they demonstrate while defending the United States of America. H.R. 3832 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the executive director of a national network of Statebased prescription monitoring programs under which Department of Veterans Affairs health care providers shall query the network in order to prevent opioid abuse. Veterans are truly heroes walking among us and they deserve our utmost respect as well as assistance in any recovery or treatment they require. Mr. Speaker, our veterans bravely put their lives on the line to defend our freedoms and to keep our nation safe. There are over 20 million veterans in the United States, with a large number residing in my home state of Texas. Texas has more than 1.4 million veterans, making it the state with the second largest veteran population. Harris County, the county which contains my district, is home to over 187,000 veterans, the most of any county in the state. There is no doubt that these fearless men and women suffering from burdensome health problems deserve not only our gratitude, but also our support throughout recovery and treatment. By passing H.R. 3832, health care providers will receive additional information so they may provide veterans with assistance which will enhance their rehabilitation. This bill would enable the VA to monitor drug prescriptions in order to ensure that veterans’ risk of addiction is minimized. The Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act would allow VA providers to better track and prevent excess opioid prescribing. The provisions of this bill will serve as a vital resource to our veterans and their health care providers as they overcome burdensome health problems. These provisions would help prevent opioid abuse by allowing for greater information sharing between VA and statebased prescription drug monitoring programs. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3832 to show their support and gratitude for the sacrifices made by our service men and women, and to ensure that veterans battling health problems receive the care and rehabilitation they deserve. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3832, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
RAY HENDRIX VETERANS CLINIC Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3946) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs communitybased outpatient clinic in Statesboro, Georgia, the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3946 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITYBASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC, STATESBORO, GEORGIA. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs communitybased outpatient clinic in Statesboro, Georgia, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as the ‘‘Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic’’. Any reference to such clinic in any law, regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the United States shall be considered to be a reference to the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3946, to name the Department of Veterans Affairs communitybased outpatient clinic in Statesboro, Georgia, the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic. This bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague, Congressman RICK ALLEN , and I am grateful to him for introducing this legislation in honor of an American hero. Robert Ray Hendrix joined the Army National Guard in 1949. He was stationed in Europe during the Korean conflict and served honorably until his retirement in 1992. In his 42 years of service, Mr. Hendrix rose to the rank of command sergeant major. Mr. Hendrix also served in the American Legion for over 60 years, holding many State and national posts. Along with many accomplishments for veterans, Mr. Hendrix was instrumental in obtaining 5,000 signatures throughout the community to demonstrate the need for a VA clinic in Statesboro. Four years later, Mr. Hendrix’s effort paid off when a VA officially dedicated a new clinic. In addition to his work with the American Legion, Mr. Hendrix served in a Governorappointed position to the State Veterans Board through the VA Service Board for three 7year terms. Mr. Hendrix’s outstanding service to his country and his fellow veterans shall serve as an inspiration to us all, and it is my great pleasure to support H.R. 3946, which would name that very clinic he worked so hard to establish, the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic. This legislation satisfies all the committee’s naming criteria and is cosponsored by the entire Georgia congressional delegation and supported by many VSOs. Once again, I thank Congressman RICKALLEN for introducing this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice to those supporting H.R. 3946, which does name the VA communitybased outpatient clinic in Statesboro, Georgia, the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic. I would like to say at this time, I often hear from people, and they talk about things going on here. And they say: Oh, yeah, they are naming another post office, or VA clinic. That is right, we are. Today, we are naming a VA clinic after someone who gave their life serving this Nation, coming back doing the things that build our community, and I think, when people think is this just an exercise we go through, I would encourage, Mr. Speaker, for everyone, when they go by one of these buildings and they see a name on the side of it and wonder what it is after—we can now google those things pretty easy. I will guarantee you, every time you google that name, you will come away amazed at what your fellow citizens did, what they gave to this country, and in this case, you heard it from the gentleman, about Ray Hendrix’s service, 42 years in uniform, back in that, and I will guarantee you that Statesboro, Georgia, is a better place because of what Sergeant Major Ray Hendrix did. So I don’t think these are things to fill time. I think these are things that we honor what is right about the country. We honor people that put country first, and it is very obvious to me, having never met Ray Hendrix, or until this bill was brought forward, I sure wished I had known him, and I would have loved to have been in a unit where Sergeant Major Hendrix served because it is obvious that he cared. With that, I strongly support this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN ), the sponsor of this bill. b1530 Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support of this important bill that I am providing here to the House today. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a great gentleman, one who fought for his community and who is so deserving to have the Statesboro VA clinic named after him, as was stated, Sergeant Major Ray Hendrix. For those of you who are not aware of the life and legacy of Ray Hendrix, I would like to take some time here today to recognize the impact he had on so many lives in the State of Georgia and nationwide. Ray Hendrix spent his entire life serving this great country. After 42 years of putting his life on the line in the U.S. Army, where he fought in the Korean war, his service was long from over. As an active member of the American Legion, Ray continued to find ways to help his country and community, serving in several leadership posts at local, State, and national levels. While working with the American Legion, Ray handed out wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, and flags to public schools in his community. He also organized an efficient bus system in Augusta and Dublin, both located in Georgia’s 12th District, that would transport veterans to the Charlie Norwood VA and Carl Vinson VA to receive needed treatment. Continuing his work, Ray saw a need for a VA clinic right in his hometown of Statesboro. He worked diligently to collect 5,000 signatures from folks in his community to demonstrate the need for a VA clinic close to home. Ray then took his actions a step further by advocating for this cause to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs right here in Washington, D.C. He was also appointed to the Veterans Service Board by three consecutive Georgia Governors: Governor Roy Barnes in 2001, Governor Sonny Perdue in 2008, and Governor Nathan Deal in 2015. He served three terms as the board chairman and is survived by his wife, Mary, three children, 10 grandchildren, and 9 greatgrandchildren. As a veteran, public servant, and Bulloch County native for over 75 years, it is my hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the effort to rename the VA clinic in Statesboro, Georgia, after a man who is truly deserving. With the support of Georgia Senators and Representatives, as well as the Georgia Southern Student Veterans Association, and many others, I cannot think of a better or more worthy man to have his service to our Nation and his community honored at the top of the VA clinic in Statesboro, Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing my bill, H.R. 3946, to rename the Statesboro VA the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic. 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the RECORD on H.R. 3946. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for taking the time to tell us about Sergeant Major Hendrix. This is exactly the point I’m making: If you want to exemplify what this Nation is about, we are a Nation of people, we are a Nation of patriots; and when they rise above it, like Ray Hendrix did, I think it is appropriate. Of all of the things that we do on this floor, I make a case that these namings are a pretty important piece of what 
we do. So I thank the gentleman for this, and encourage my colleagues to enthusiastically support this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Sergeant Major Walz for his comments. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3946. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
VETERANS’ ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD MODERNIZATION OVERSIGHT ACT OF 2017 Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4245) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress certain documents relating to the Electronic Health Record Modernization Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the RECORD on H.R. 4245. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4245, the Veterans’ Electronic Health Record Modernization Oversight Act of 2017. This is not just a transition to a commercial EHR. If successful, it will be a transformation of how the VA delivers and manages healthcare to 9 million veterans. But the path to achieving a seamless, interoperable health record is far from clear. Much has already been said about the program’s price tag: nearly $16 billion over 10 years. It is a gigantic management exercise, involving thousands of people. It is also an immense challenge to document clinical processes, maybe for the first time, that doctors and nurses have been performing for years, and reengineer them. H.R. 4245 would ensure that the committee gets access to this program’s key performance reports and contractual documents. It would also require the VA to notify us when significant negative events occur. The time to enact legislation is now. The VA awarded its primary contract to the Cerner Corporation at the end of last week. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member WALZfor spearheading this effort. I also appreciate JACKBERGMAN and A NN KUSTER , the chairman and ranking member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, for their work on H.R. 4245, and the oversight spade work that they do every day. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4245, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4245, the Veterans’ Electronic Health Record Modernization Oversight Act of 2017. When I first came to Congress back in 2007, as a veteran myself, one of the questions we asked was—Electronic medical records had been out there for quite some time. The VA was a pioneer in their VistA System, on VistA, on 
managing health, and it is not just a database. As Dr. DUNN knows well, these are important diagnostic tools and they have to be right. But the thing that every veteran for 20 years was saying was: Why do we have one medical record in the Department of Defense, so when we leave the Army, the Navy, the Marines, or the Air Force, we drop off a cliff—we all carry around a paper file they print out to us—and then we try to get back into the VA and it is an entirely different system that doesn’t talk to one another? It seems pretty selfevident that from the time you raise your hand until the time you are buried with honors, it would make sense that we had a joint electronic medical record. That was the genesis of this. I am proud to say that it was a long road, but we had the signing of the Cerner contract. What this piece of legislation does is—and I want to be very careful about—we do this many times here, we pass a piece of legislation, pat ourselves on the back, and send it away, only to watch it die a horrible death in the executive branch, not be implemented correctly, or not provide our oversight. This simply says—and Dr. DUNNwas exactly right—this is a $16 billion 10 year project. I want to be clear, though: that is our current projection. Everyone in here knows that if we get a 10 percent delay and a 10 percent cost overrun, we will probably be relatively happy with that. That is over a year, and it will be a nearly $2 billion addition. That money will have to come from somewhere. It will slow down implementation. We saw reports early last week that there were serious concerns in the pilot program that are out there. So what this does—and I, once again, thank the chairman and the majority staff for recognizing this is our responsibility. We will not shirk that here—it asks them to report to us. It let’s us stay on top of this before it becomes a crisis. Because every single one of us here knows that it is coming some day—that we are going to hear about misinformation, something dropping through, a cost overrun—and this just gives us that added security. This is a project that cannot fail. I have witnessed in my time in Congress too many IT failures, specifically at the VA: a contract is signed, it is going to happen, and it is a good thing. It has the potential to, as again the gentleman said, revolutionize how we deliver care. But it has the potential to go in the wrong direction if we are not doing our constitutional right of oversight. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I think this is, once again, the legislative branch, as it was meant to be, taking back its oversight responsibility. We are going to authorize this and we are going to appropriate the funds. I think it is only prudent that we have another layer of oversight to make sure that this huge, huge project, nearly unprecedented, upgrade in integration of electronic health records of anywhere in the world, happens correctly. Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 4245, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4245, the Veterans’ Electronic Health Record Modernization Oversight Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, one way the nation can express its deepest appreciation for our service men and women is to ensure that their health records are handled appropriately. H.R. 4245 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit certain documents to Congress relating to the Electronic Health Record Modernization Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs. More than 20 million brave Americans are veterans of our nation’s armed services including more than 1.5 million women, 2.4 million African American men and women, 1.4 million Hispanic men and women, 320,000 Asian Americans, and 145,000 American Indians. Of these veterans, more than 1.4 million reside in my home state of Texas. Harris County, the county which contains my home district, has over 187,000 veterans which is the largest veteran population of any county in Texas. More than 9 million veterans and their families are enrolled in the VA health care system, making it the largest health care system in the nation. This system employs more than 306,000 full time health care professionals and support staff at 1,240 health care facilities, including 170 VA Medical Centers and 1,061 outpatient sites. Mr. Speaker, our veterans bravely put their lives on the line to defend our freedoms and to keep our nation safe. By passing H.R. 4245, the modernization of veterans’ health records will receive the attention it deserves in order to enhance their rehabilitation and quality of life. The Veterans’ Electronic Health Record Modernization Oversight Act of 2017 requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit documentation to Congress regarding the agency’s efforts to modernize its health record system. This will serve as a vital resource to enable us to assist our veterans as they overcome burdensome health problems. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4245 to show their support and gratitude for the sacrifices made by our service men and women, and to ensure that veterans receive the care and rehabilitation they deserve. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4245. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
SERVICEMEMBERS IMPROVED TRANSITION THROUGH REFORMS FOR ENSURING PROGRESS ACT Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4830) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the disapproval of any course of education for purposes of the educational assistance programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs unless the educational institution providing the course permits individuals to attend or participate in courses pending payment by Department, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4830 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Servicemembers Improved Transition through Reforms for Ensuring Progress Act’’ or the ‘‘SITREP Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DISAPPROVAL FOR PURPOSES OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OF CERTAIN COURSES OF EDUCATION THAT DO NOT PERMIT INDIVIDUALS TO ATTEND OR PARTICIPATE IN COURSES PENDING PAYMENT. 
Section 3679 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ‘‘(e)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, beginning on August 1, 2018, a State approving agency, or the Secretary when acting in the role of the State approving agency, shall disapprove a course of education provided by an educational institution unless the educational institution has adopted the following policies: ‘‘(A) A policy that permits any covered individual to attend or participate in the course of education during the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution a certificate of eligibility for entitlement to educational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 of this title and ending on the earlier of the following dates: ‘‘(i) The date on which the Secretary provides payment for such course of education to such institution. ‘‘(ii) The date that is 90 days after the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution such certificate of eligibility. ‘‘(B) A policy that ensures that the educational institution will not impose any penalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered individual because of the individual’s inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the institution as a result of the delayed disbursement of any payment to be provided by the Secretary. ‘‘(2) For purposes of this subsection, a covered individual is any individual who is entitled to educational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 of this title. ‘‘(3) The Secretary may waive such requirements of paragraph (1) as the Secretary considers appropriate.’’. 
SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION REGARDING APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY TO USE EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO PURSUE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS AT CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. 
The section heading for section 302 of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–48) is amended to read as follows (and the table of contents for such Act is conformed accordingly): 
‘‘SEC. 302. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE UNDER ANY OF THE EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO PURSUE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS AT CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material into the RECORD on H.R. 4830, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4830, as amended, the SIT–REP Act, the Servicemembers Improved Transition through Reforms for Ensuring Progress Act. Mr. Speaker, the Post9/11 GI Bill provides generous education benefits, including a monthly living stipend to veterans and eligible dependents. In order for a student to utilize this benefit, they must provide a certificate of eligibility to the school or training program and then the institution certifies the student’s attendance to the Department of Veterans Affairs. After this process, the school receives tuition payment and the veteran receives their monthly housing allowance. Mr. Speaker, if all goes well, those claims are supposed to be processed within 12 to 14 days for original claims, and between 6 to 8 days for supplemental claims. However, there are times when delays do occur, and they can have a significant impact on a school’s and a student’s bottom line. These delays typically occur at the beginning of a semester, or when a school doesn’t do their part to certify a student’s attendance quickly. Mr. Speaker, we have been told that some schools and training programs have, essentially, taken these delays out on their student veterans, dependents and surviving spouses by placing students on payment plans, blocking access to school facilities; and, in some cases, have been barring students from registering for classes. Mr. Speaker, I believe these practices are incredibly unfair, as students should not be held accountable for bureaucratic delays and hiccups that are outside their control. I am pleased that H.R. 4830, as amended, would address this issue and say that in order for schools and training programs to be eligible for the GI Bill, they must adopt a policy that doesn’t punish students in any way for delays in tuition fees and payments that are not their fault. Mr. Speaker, I thank Vice Chairman BILIRAKIS and the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, TAPS, a great organization that helps survivors of all ages deal with loss, for bringing this important bill forward. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4830, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for, once again, bringing up a really important piece of legislation. I believe the gentleman is also the longest serving member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Any piece of important legislation over the last decadeplus has had his hand in it. H.R. 4830, as amended, is a bill that we have worked on in a bipartisan basis with TAPS, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. TAPS came to the committee and to Mr. BILIRAKIS , after they heard from many surviving spouses that with all of the changes that were being implemented on August 1, there will be delayed payments and processing times for payments for veterans and survivors enrolled for the fall 2018 semester. b1545 The Forever GI Bill that we are all in this body proud of passing and proud of updating contains several largescale changes the VA is currently working very hard to implement. Some of those changes went into effect in the fall of 2017, and TAPS reported to the committee that, because of delays in VA payments, many schools demanded payment from students. There were stories of students who were not allowed to attend class, register for classes, or use campus facilities only because the VA payment was delayed. In some cases, students were even put on a payment plan they could not afford or forced to take out student loans with egregious orientation fees in order to continue their education. This bill will provide students receiving VA payments with the same protections as those who receive title IV funding, such as Pell Grants and Federal student loans. These title IV students are allowed to attend classes, participate in extracurricular activities, and use campus facilities as long as their school knows payment is forthcoming. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4830, as amended, will give the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the ability to disapprove any course of education unless the educational institution providing the course permits individuals to attend or participate in courses pending payment by the VA and accept a certificate of eligibility as a promise. As such, the bill will serve as a preventive measure to discourage schools from engaging in shutting out VA beneficiaries simply because of an administrative delay. This is a really good step toward ensuring that our student veterans and other GI Bill beneficiaries are not unnecessarily prevented from getting the most of their benefits due. To be very clear about this, there are very few benefits that are really earned in the way a GI Bill benefit is earned. Those of us who have used the GI Bill to get an education know how important it is. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for continuing to show care for these veterans. This is a great, smart piece of legislation. I encourage its adoption. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ), the vice chairman of the committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. DUNN, my fellow Floridian, a great Member of Congress, and also my good friend Mr. WALZ, who has done an outstanding job over the years supporting our veterans. I also thank Mr. WALZfor his service. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 4830, the Servicemembers Improved Transition through Reforms for Ensuring Progress Act, or the SIT–REP Act, which will hold student veterans harmless from bureaucratic red tape and delays at higher education institutions at the VA. I am proud of the work my colleagues and I conducted on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee last year to pass the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act, or the Forever GI Bill. This historic legislation expanded access to education and improves and modernizes the GI Bill for our veterans. This is one of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, we came to Congress: to do something like this, to help our veterans get their education. In our committee hearings on implementation of the Forever GI Bill, we heard concerns about the delays in processing of tuition payments between the schools and the VA. I also had roundtables in my district with veterans, and this was a concern of theirs. So while the average timelines for processing these benefits are 25 days for new claims and 9 days for supplemental claims, oftentimes the processing timelines spike higher at the beginning of each school year upon a surge in claims. We heard concerns from our VSO stakeholders—I thank them—regarding delayed payments resulting from either slow VA processing or a mistake or tardiness by the school certifying official. In some cases, the delays meant schools putting a hold on a student’s 
account or forcing the student to begin payment of tuition and fees on a payment plan until they received money from VA. My bill, the SIT–REP Act, would give the Secretary the authority to disapprove courses of education for the GI Bill unless the educational institution adopts a policy ensuring that it will not impose a fee on the veteran or deny the veteran’s access to education. This policy would be applied for the first 90 days of the school term. The SIT–REP Act is a commonsense bill that protects student veterans and their families who, through no fault of their own, are denied access to education because the school made a mistake or the VA made a late payment. It is not the veteran’s fault, and they should not be punished for the actions of others. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of my practical and bipartisan legislation, which will help ensure our student veterans have full access to the educational benefits they have earned and deserve. I hope that the Senate takes up this bill quickly. Again, I urge passage of this great bill. We have got to get it to the President’s desk as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, I thank the committee staff as well. They did a great job on this bill. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his great work on this. I encourage its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 4830, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4830, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
VETERANS AFFAIRS PURCHASE CARD MISUSE MITIGATION ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5215) to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to prohibit employees found to have knowingly misused Department of Veterans Affairs purchase cards from serving as purchase card holders or approving officials. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5215 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Affairs Purchase Card Misuse Mitigation Act’’. 
SEC. 2. MISUSE OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PURCHASE CARDS BY DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Chapter 7 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ‘‘§ 727. Misuse of Department purchase cards ‘‘(a) INGENERAL .—The Secretary shall prohibit any employee of the Department who the Secretary or the Inspector General of the Department determines has knowingly misused a purchase card from serving as a purchase card holder or approving official. Such a prohibition shall be in addition to any other applicable penalty. ‘‘(b) MISUSE .—For purposes of this section, the term ‘misuse’ means— ‘‘(1) splitting purchases; ‘‘(2) exceeding applicable purchase card limits or purchase thresholds; ‘‘(3) purchasing any unauthorized item; ‘‘(4) using a purchase card without being an authorized purchase card holder; or ‘‘(5) violating ethics standards.’’. (b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT .—The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 725 the following new item: ‘‘727. Misuse of Department purchase cards.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material into the record on H.R. 5215. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5215, the Veterans Affairs Purchase Card Misuse Mitigation Act. This legislation is sponsored by my Veterans’ Affairs Committee colleagues JACK BERGMAN , K ATHLEEN  RICE, MIKEBOST, Dr. N EALDUNN, and MIKECOFFMAN . H.R. 5215 would implement an additional safeguard in VA’s multibillion dollar government purchase card program, which has too often lacked adequate controls and has periodically been abused. The legislation directs the Secretary to revoke the purchase card from any employee who is found to have intentionally misused it. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5215, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5215, the Veterans Affairs Purchase Card Mitigation Act. I have often said I am the VA’s staunchest supporter, but I will be their harshest critic. On this one, I will be their harshest critic. Time and again when we hear reports of VA employees misusing purchase cards, that cannot stand. Every dollar that is misused, whether it is through fraud, waste, or abuse, is one less dollar that is not being used towards veterans, and it is the taxpayers’ dollars that need to be guarded. This misuse erodes Congress’ ability to oversee the VA budget and the use of the money. Employees who misuse purchase cards should be held accountable and should be prevented from being a purchase card holder or authorizing official, because they can’t be trusted to follow the regulations or be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. This legislation will ensure that taxpayer dollars are protected from purchase card misuse. If you are doing it right, you can still use the card and it can serve veterans. If you choose to ignore the rules, you are not going to be able to do it anymore. It is pretty simple. It is a smart piece of legislation. I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ), our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee chair. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, government purchase cards are issued to Federal employees to make small, simple purchases. Their transaction limit was $3,500, but the fiscal year 2018 NDAA increased that limit to $10,000. This increase will cause purchase card usage to go up, thereby increasing the chance for misuse. Purchase card transactions already total roughly $4 billion annually in the VA, and the program has been found repeatedly to lack adequate controls related to waste, fraud, and abuse. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, it is my job to monitor programs involving taxpayer dollars and veterans. That is why I introduced the Veterans Affairs Purchase Card Misuse Mitigation Act. It will mitigate the potential for misuse of purchase card spending by requiring the VA Secretary to revoke a purchase card from any employee found to have knowingly misused their card or approval authority. Currently, penalties are applied slowly, if at all, and employees are very rarely terminated for purchase card misuse or abuse. H.R. 5215 creates a safeguard to stop purchase card misuse once it begins and holds bad actors accountable for all of their actions. Mr. Speaker, being a good steward of taxpayers’ dollars is my top priority, and this bill brings accountability to the necessary but problematic purchase card structure. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman whether he has any further speakers. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I would like to note, on this, there are other issues at hand here. There are certainly some of these cases where people are just blatantly misusing them. That is a small percentage. The vast majority is of leadership not implementing policies. Especially we were talking about the medicalsurgical supply formulary, and people are taking the shortcut to getting things instead of getting—we had this conversation on contracts and the way it should be done. The part about this is it isn’t somebody going out and buying themselves a new phone or something; it is them going out and buying things that are actually going to be used, but it is a stupid way to do it because we end up paying more money. We don’t have certain contracts. It is just is not the way to budget. So I think this has a lot of really good things that it can do. One of them that it should continue to do is force VA leadership to have a better plan in place. We see it right here in the D.C. VA, not having this supply management piece down right. Mr. Speaker, I encourage support of this piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5215, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5215. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL SURGICAL PURCHASING STABILIZATION ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5418) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program using multiple prime vendors, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5418 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Affairs MedicalSurgical Purchasing Stabilization Act’’. 
(a) V ENDORS .—In procuring certain medical, surgical, and dental supplies or laboratory supplies for medical centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall carry out the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program, or successor program, in a manner that— (1) requires the Secretary to award contracts to multiple regional prime vendors instead of a single nationwide prime vendor; and (2) prohibits a prime vendor from solely designing the formulary of such supplies. (b) CLINICALLY DRIVEN SOURCING .— (1) EXPERTISE .—In carrying out the formulary of supplies under the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program, or successor program, the Secretary shall ensure that each employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs who conducts formulary analyses or makes decisions with respect to including items on the formulary has medical expertise relevant to the items for which the employee conducts such analyses or makes such decisions. (2) LISTS.—Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and quarterly thereafter with respect to any updates, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate a list of each employee described in paragraph (1) and the relevant medical expertise of the employee, listed by the categories of items in the formulary described in such paragraph. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material into the RECORD on H.R. 5418, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5418, as amended, the Veterans Affairs MedicalSurgical Purchasing Stabilization Act. This legislation was introduced by General Bergman and is cosponsored by Representatives PETERS , BANKS , DUNN, and K USTER . VA’s medicalsurgical prime vendor program is an ambitious effort to save money by establishing a medicalsurgical formulary in leveraging the Department’s massive buying power. Unfortunately, the results have fallen far short of expectations. I held a hearing on this subject last December and continue to monitor it closely. The formulary was originally created with little clinical input, and it does not contain what clinicians need. b1600 Over the past year, physicians, surgeons, and nurses have been organized into teams to reevaluate the formulary. At one point, a group of clinicians was essentially put in a room for a week to concentrate on the task, but the formulary remains troubled. Now, VA is restructuring the program to put the prime vendors in charge of negotiating the supplier contracts, but it remains crucial that VA get the formulary right. This is a matter of safety as well as finances. H.R. 5418, as amended, would put clinicians with appropriate expertise back in charge of the formulary, which is the first step toward stabilizing the MedicalSurgical Prime Vendor Program. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5418, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5418, as amended. The Veterans Affairs MedicalSurgical Purchasing Stabilization Act ties into what we were just discussing. For many years, we have heard complaints that the VA formulary did not meet the needs of VA healthcare providers, thus making the delivery of healthcare to our Nation’s heroes even more challenging. As VA worked toward a solution, the Government Accountability Office recommended that clinicians who treat veterans should be at the center of the decision making. Involving clinicians at every step of building a medical supply formulary is the same best practice employed by other private sector and nonprofit hospitals. We have got wonderful physicians on this committee. It makes sense that they should be there. I have heard it time and time again over the years that we get better results when we do that. That is why this committee was concerned when VA proposed that it would outsource the development of its medicalsurgical supply formulary to vendors who had no experience treating patients. This proposal goes against best practices in the private and nonprofit healthcare industry. This legislation would prevent VA from outsourcing formulary development. It would also ensure VA follows best practices and sticks to a timeline so that VA facilities and vendors have a predictable, functional medical supply. Now VA must demonstrate it is willing to put the right leadership and resources in place to appropriately manage the project and ensure the actual end users of the formulary, the clinicians treating veterans, have the supplies as needed. Mr. Speaker, again, another good piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ), the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee chairman. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, the MedicalSurgical Prime Vendor Program is VA’s system of contracts to 
purchase and distribute medical and surgical supplies. VA attempted to create a centralized MSPV formulary to standardize the products its clinicians can buy as an idea to concentrate VA’s buying power to extract savings from fewer suppliers. But the formulary was developed with inadequate input from experienced clinicians, and as a result, it contains unwanted supplies while omitting necessary products. Because of these problems, usage of MSPV has failed to meet its objectives, putting some of the prime vendors and suppliers under financial strain, and threatening the stability of the program. H.R. 5418 preserves the MSPV’s current structure, consisting of multiple regional prime vendors, and it prohibits a move to a single nationwide prime vendor. The bill also requires that each VA employee making decisions related to the structure have medical expertise relevant to those items. H.R. 5418 ensures medical professionals have the tools and resources they need to deliver worldclass care to our veterans. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation, I support its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, it is hard for me to believe we are going to pass a piece of legislation that has this much common sense in it. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5418, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. REED). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5418, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
VETERANS’ COMPENSATION COST OFLIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4958) to increase, effective as of December 1, 2018, the rates of compensation for veterans with service connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4958 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans’ Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act of 2018’’. SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION. 
(a) R ATE ADJUSTMENT .—Effective on December 1, 2018, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November 30, 2018, for the payment of disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions specified in subsection (b). (b) AMOUNTS TOBEINCREASED .—The dollar amounts to be increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following: (1) WARTIME DISABILITY COMPENSATION .— Each of the dollar amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.

(d) SPECIAL RULE.—The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85–857 (72 Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code. 
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as increased under that section, not later than the date on which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to be published by reason of a determination made under section 215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2019. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4958. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4958, the Veterans’ Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act of 2018. This bill was introduced by the subcommittee chairman, MIKEBOSTof Illinois, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue. VA provides compensation to help fulfill our obligation to take care of the brave men and women who have been injured during their service to our Nation. This money can be a lifeline for veterans who have serviceconnected disabilities that may affect their earning ability. These veterans often have families to support, and they should not be worried about how they are going to pay their bills when prices go up. This bill will help ensure that the value of veterans’ benefits are not eroded by inflation by giving veterans a costofliving increase if Social Security recipients receive one this year. The amount of the increase will be determined by the consumer price index, which establishes the COLA for Social Security beneficiaries. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4958, the Veterans Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act. As the chairman said, it is our responsibility to make sure the guarantee of these benefits is not eroded by inflation. It provides for a simple cost ofliving adjustment at the same rate as set for Social Security benefits. It may seem like a small amount in any one year, but without the adjustment for inflation, the impact on veterans’ finances is significant when compounded over time. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the subcommittee chairman, MIKEBOST, for his work, and ELIZABETH ESTY, both for cosponsoring the bill and bringing it to us today. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROE and his staff for their work clearing this bill. It is an important one. Our veterans have been waiting for word on this. I think I am happy to report it looks like we have taken that step moving it forward. It will make a lot of folks happy. I hear about this one a lot, so you know it is on their minds. It just makes sense, and doing it before Memorial Day sends a really strong message. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 4958, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), our Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee chairman. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, this is a mustpass bill. Many disabled veterans and their families depend on their veterans’ benefits to pay for things like food and medicine. For many of these veterans, these payments are a lifeline. In some cases, these benefits may even be the only income these veterans have. It is only 
fair that we ensure that the benefits paid to veterans who were injured during their military service do not lose value because of inflation. If we don’t, it could become hard for people who were injured while serving this Nation in uniform to keep their heads above water. H.R. 4958 would financially protect the veterans who protected us by providing a costofliving increase. The amount of the COLA will be the same increase that Social Security beneficiaries will receive. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs ranking member, Ms. ESTY, for being the lead cosponsor of this bill with me. This bill has also enjoyed bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4958 and help disabled veterans and their families keep up with the rising costs of basic necessities. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation. I thank the gentleman for bringing it up. The taxpayers understand that this is exactly what we are supposed to be doing. I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the subcommittee chairman and Marine veteran, MIKEBOST, for bringing this up. It is a great piece of legislation. I encourage all Members to support H.R. 4958, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4958, the Veterans’ Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act of 2018. H.R. 4958 directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to increase, as of December 1, 2018, the rates of veterans’ disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans, and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children. The bill increases the rates of compensation for veterans with serviceconnected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans. For the brave military men and women serving our country, this will help offset the cost of living in higher cost areas of the country. Our nation owes a great debt to these fearless men and women defending our nation. Providing cost of living adjustments to keep up with inflation is an effective way to honor their sacrifice. Many of our veterans rely on the disability benefits they receive from the Department of Veterans Affairs to merely make ends meet. While Social Security benefits are automatically adjusted annually to keep pace with inflation, Congress must pass legislation every year to increase the rates of veteran disability compensation. Unfortunately, it requires an act of Congress to make this same adjustment for our nation’s veterans. Passing H.R. 4958 ensures that our nation’s veterans are able to receive the same annual cost of living adjustment of Social Security recipients. The communityintegrated rehabilitation treatment provided by the pilot program will serve as a vital resource to our veterans as they overcome burdensome health problems. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4958 to show their support and gratitude for the many sacrifices made by our service men and women. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4958. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SERVICEDISABLED VETERANS SMALL BUSINESS CONTINUATION ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5044) to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the treatment of certain surviving spouses under the contracting goals and preferences of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5044 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ServiceDisabled Veterans Small Business Continuation Act’’. 
SEC. 2. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT REGARDING TREATMENT OF CERTAIN SURVIVING SPOUSES UNDER CONTRACTING GOALS AND PREFERENCES OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
Effective on the date specified in subsection (e) of section 1832 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328; 130 Stat. 2660), section 8127(k)(3) of title 38, United States Code, as amended by such section 1832, is further amended by inserting after the period at the end the following new sentence: ‘‘A surviving spouse of such a veteran who is not covered by subparagraph (C)(i) of such section by reason of the disability rating of the veteran being less than 100 percent shall be treated as being so covered during the period beginning on the date of the death of the veteran and ending on the date that is three years after such death, the date on which the surviving spouse remarries, or the date on which the surviving spouse relinquishes an ownership interest in the small business concern, whichever occurs first.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5044. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5044, ServiceDisabled Veterans Small Business Continuation Act. Current law authorizes a special set aside program at the Department of Veterans Affairs for veteranowned small businesses and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses called Vets First Program. This program has been highly successful in providing VOSBs and SDVOSBs more opportunities, so much so that VA spent almost 20 percent of all contracting dollars with these firms in 2017. While we should all laud the success of the program, there has been concern that current law did not appropriately address concerns of what happens to awards and contracts of VOSB and SDVOSB when the veteran owner dies. The sudden death of a veteran could bring significant upheaval for a small business as they lose their VA contracts, which can impact not only the veteran’s family, but employees as well. H.R. 5044 would clarify and authorize the spouses of veterans who died with less than a 100percent disability rating to maintain VOSB and SDVOSB status for up to 3 years following the veteran’s death. I believe this change to current law is an appropriate way to continue the success of the Vets First Program without hurting other veteran firms. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Chairman CHABOT , for introducing this bill, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5044, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 5044. The gentleman has brought a really important point forward. Currently, if a veteran’s death results in their small business becoming less than 51 percent owned by a service disabled veteran, the surviving spouse can acquire the veteran’s ownership interest if the veteran had a 100percent disability rating. This allows the surviving spouse to keep their loved one’s small business status. However, the surviving spouse of a deceased veteran who had less than a 100percent disability is not allowed to do the same. This is a clearcut case, I think, of spirit and intent of the law. I don’t think anyone intended for a 60percent servicedisabled veteran who maybe lost a limb in combat, and then who dies, for their spouse to lose their eligibility. It is a really important point to bring up. This bill will now permit a surviving spouse to maintain a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business status 
for a period of 3 years after the veteran’s death, or until the spouse remarries. This simply allows a Gold Star spouse a bit more time after a loved one’s death to settle any business affairs of the deceased spouse it had. It is the right thing to do to ease the burden that comes with the loss of a spouse in expression of our gratitude for their family’s service. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio’s willingness to point this out, I strongly support this, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ). This is his piece of legislation. I appreciate him being here on the floor today. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROEand Ranking Member WALZfor their leadership. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5044, the ServiceDisabled Veterans Small Business Continuation Act. This bill ensures that the surviving spouses of Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses are able to retain the Service Disabled Veteran Owned status of their small business for 3 years, as was mentioned, after the passing of the veteran spouse. This policy is already codified in title 38 of the United States Code. However, there is a lack of parity between title 38 and the Small Business Act. I have heard from several small businesses about this issue, including one in my district, that this discrepancy creates legal uncertainty and confusion in the application of this important policy. What we are trying to do is clear it up. To guarantee clarity and certainty for the administration of these Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, the Small Business Act must conform with the policy prescribed in title 38. b1615 H.R. 5044 dispels any legal uncertainty, ensuring that these important policy changes to the law are sustained. Most importantly, this bill provides peace of mind for surviving spouses of veteran business owners. And one of the main things a veteran is always looking out for is making sure that his or her spouse is taken care of after they are gone. So this will not only give the surviving spouse peace of mind, but the veteran himself or herself peace of mind ahead of time. Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member and members of the House Veterans Affairs’ Committee for their leadership in clearing this up and, again, giving peace of mind to veterans and their spouses all over America. I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5044. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation. I am grateful for the gentleman bringing it up. I encourage its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 5044, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5044, the ServiceDisabled Veterans Small Business Continuation Act. H.R. 5044 amends title 38, of the United States Code to clarify the treatment of certain surviving spouses under the contracting goals and preferences of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Nearly 1 in 10 small businesses are owned by veterans and among these veteranowned businesses, they collectively have generated over $1 trillion in sales. When the owner of a ServiceDisabled VeteranOwned Small Business passes away, his or her spouse is permitted to inherit the business and retain priority status to obtain VA contracts in the federal procurement marketplace. In obtaining goods and services, the VA provides a special preference to firms owned and controlled by veterans with serviceconnected disabilities. Surviving spouses of veterans with service connected disabilities rated at 100 percent are eligible to retain this preferential contracting status for up to 10 years after the veteran’s death. Passing H.R. 5044 would authorize similar treatment for surviving spouses of veterans whose serviceconnected disabilities are rated less than 100 percent and it would enable these spouses to retain priority status for obtaining contracts for up to three years. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5044 protects widows and widowers from any major disruptions to their businesses during one of the most difficult times in their lives, the passing of a loved one who bravely served our country. Mr. Speaker, our veterans bravely put their lives on the line to defend our freedoms and to keep our nation safe. For those who end up making the ultimate sacrifice for our nation, it is crucial that we honor their sacrifice any way we can by honoring the widows and widowers. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5540 to show their gratitude for the sacrifices made by our service men and women, and to maintain the livelihood of their spouses. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5044. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REDESIGNATING CERTAIN CLINICS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS LOCATED IN MONTANA Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1282) to redesignate certain clinics of the Department of Veterans Affairs located in Montana. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 1282 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add extraneous material on S. 1282. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1282, to designate certain clinics 
in the Department of Veterans Affairs located in Montana. This bill is sponsored by Senator DAINES from Montana, and I am grateful to him for introducing this legislation in honor of three American heroes. The first is Sergeant David J. Thatcher, who was born in Bridger, Montana, and joined the U.S. Army in 1940. Following the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Sergeant Thatcher volunteered for a secret mission, the Doolittle Raid. He was the engineer and tail gunner for crew number 7, the Ruptured Duck. The crew successfully carried out the mission and attempted to fly to China. The aircraft ran out of fuel and was forced to make an emergency landing on a beach. The violent landing caused serious injury to all crew members besides Sergeant Thatcher. Thankfully, he was able to drag his men from the wreckage and lead them to safety after avoiding several Japanese patrols. For his bravery in saving the lives of his crew, Thatcher was awarded the Silver Star. His other decorations included the Distinguished Flying Cross; Air Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters; and the Chinese Army, Navy, and Air Corps Medal, Class A, First Grade. S. 1282, would further honor him by naming the clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs, located at 2687 Palmer Street in Missoula, Montana, the David J. Thatcher Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic. I can think of no better name after reading that. The second American hero who would be honored by this bill is Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow, who was born on the Crow Indian Reservation near Lodge Grass, Montana. Dr. Medicine Crow went on to get his bachelor’s degree from Linfield College and master’s degree in anthropology from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles in 1939. He was the first member of the Crow Tribe to obtain a master’s degree. After the war broke out, Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow joined the Army and became a scout in the 103rd Infantry Division. While at war, he completed all four tasks required to become a war chief: touching an enemy without killing him, taking an enemy’s weapon, leading a successful war party, and stealing an enemy’s horse. He is the last member of the Crow Tribe to become a war chief. After serving in the Army, Dr. Medicine Crow returned to the Crow Agency and was appointed Tribal historian and anthropologist. He was appointed the keeper of memories of his Tribe and published many historical books. Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow continued to write and lecture at universities and public institutions until his passing at the young age of 102. I am truly honored to rename the VA clinic located 1775 Spring Creek Lane in Billings, Montana, the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic. The final hero to be recognized by this bill is Ben Steele. Mr. Steele was born in Billings, Montana, and graduated from Billings Senior High School. In 1941, Mr. Steele enlisted in the Army Air Corps, where he was assigned to the 7th Material Squadron, 19th Bombardment Group. His group was assigned to the Philippine Islands, and during the ensuing Japanese invasion, Mr. Steele fought to defend his base on Bataan. After his capture, Mr. Steele was forced to endure the horrendous Bataan Death March and was a Japanese prisoner of war for 3
1⁄2years. After the war, Mr. Steele was a true renaissance man, consulting for the Department of Defense, serving as the crafts director of the Military District of Washington, D.C., chairing the art department of Eastern Montana College, and giving workshops, demonstrations, and lectures at museums, schools, and civic centers. As a survivor of the Bataan Death March, Mr. Steele was devoted to his Creator, his family, his country, and his art. In his memory, I am privileged to support this bill to rename the clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs at 1766 Majestic Lane in Billings, Montana, the Benjamin Charles Steele Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic. This legislation satisfies all of the committee’s naming criteria, is cosponsored by the entire Montana congressional delegation, and is supported by many VSOs. I am proud to support it as well, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in strong support of S. 1282, which names three veterans clinics in Montana. Again, I will reiterate what I said earlier, that sometimes I hear people disparagingly talk about how we are not doing anything in Congress except naming VA clinics and post offices. That is right. We are naming three VA clinics for three American heroes again. You just heard Chairman ROE give the stories of David Thatcher, Ben Steele, and Dakaak Baako and what they did for this Nation. These are movie scripts in any other world, except this is real life, real American heroes who did exactly what was asked of them and then, in each one of these cases, returned back home to build this Nation. I oftentimes, and I will continue to say it, when you drive by a VA clinic and there is a name on it, google it, because you will be amazed at what your fellow citizens can do. Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, as I close, I can’t encourage my Members enough to vote for this. My history professor in college was a survivor of the Bataan Death March. He wrote a book, ‘‘Apocalypse Undone: My Survival of Japanese Imprisonment During World War II,’’ and told me he had never slept through the night until he wrote that book. I wonder if these two gentlemen, Mr. Steele and my professor, knew each other. I hope they did. They both lived to have successful lives, and this truly was and is the Greatest Generation. There is no question about what these men did when they returned home. So once again, I encourage everyone to support this, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1282. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
HERSHEL ‘‘WOODY’’ WILLIAMS VA MEDICAL CENTER Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3663) to designate the medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Huntington, West Virginia, as the Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams VA Medical Center. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3663 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF HERSHEL ‘‘WOODY’’ WILLIAMS VA MEDICAL CENTER IN HUNTINGTON, WEST VIRGINIA. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Huntington, West Virginia, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as the ‘‘Hershel ‘Woody’ Williams VA Medical Center’’. (b) REFERENCE .—Any reference in any law, regulation, map, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the medical center referred to in subsection (a) shall be considered to be a reference to the Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams VA Medical Center. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3663, to designate the medical center of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs in Huntington, West Virginia, as the Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams VA Medical Center. This bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague EVANJENKINS , and I am grateful to him for introducing this legislation in honor of an American hero. Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams enlisted in the Marine Corps on May 26, 1943, in Charleston, West Virginia. Following his training, Corporal Williams was deployed to participate in the invasion of Iwo Jima. On February 23, 1945, a system of enemy pill boxes pinned down his unit. With a 70pound flamethrower and covering fire from only four riflemen, Corporal Williams braved the viscous barrage and charged forward alone. He fought 4 hours, successfully destroying several enemy strongholds and saving the lives of countless marines. Corporal Williams fought the entirety of the 5week battle for the island despite suffering a wound for which he was awarded a Purple Heart. For his actions and his heroism in the face of brutal combat, President Truman awarded Corporal Williams a Medal of Honor on October 5, 1945. After 20 years of service, he retired from the Marine Corps Reserve and worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Now he serves on the Governor’s West Virginia Military Advisory Board and runs the Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams Medal of Honor Foundation, a notforprofit that erects monuments to honor Gold Star families and provides scholarships to eligible Gold Star children. Today, Corporal Williams is the only surviving marine to have received the Medal of Honor during the Second World War, and I am privileged to support H.R. 3663 in his honor. This legislation satisfies all of the committee’s naming criteria and is sponsored by the entire West Virginia congressional delegation, and is supported by many VSOs. As an aside, Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of attending an event in Kingsport, Tennessee, where Corporal Williams was the sponsor for our memorial that is there in Kingsport, Tennessee. I want to thank my West Virginia colleagues for bringing this up. I thank Congressman EVAN JENKINS for introducing this bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, too, rise in support of designating the VA medical center in Huntington, West Virginia, the Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams VA Medical Center. You are going to hear more detail from the gentleman from West Virginia, but it is once again proving the point that these are not exercises in futility. This is how America honors and remembers. Our children need to know who these people were when their name shows up on the VA medical center. On this one, I think the gentleman from West Virginia knows this, but we were discussing this over here, all of us in Minnesota got to know who he was last February when the world was watching. Some of us remember the moment when people said: ‘‘Who is that marine who walked out and tossed the coin at the Super Bowl?’’ It was this gentleman. I remember the sense of pride and the sense of awe, and we kind of got things into perspective because they told a little background on his story: that we were going to watch a game, and this gentleman was out there fighting for the freedoms to allow that game to happen. It was a wonderful moment. I am certainly proud and grateful to encourage people to cast a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ). Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. Today, we are voting on H.R. 3663, which would rename the Huntington VA Medical Center in honor of Corporal Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams. I first met Woody more than 20 years ago when I was elected to the State legislature. Over the more than two decades I have known him, Woody has never stopped fighting for his fellow veterans. I am honored to call him a constituent and a friend. At 94 years young, Woody is still a vocal advocate for our veterans and their families. Whether it be at countless legislative committee hearings, veterans recognition and appreciation events, or Veterans Day and Memorial Day commemorations, Woody is there fighting for our veterans. Woody is an unbelievably brave and kind man. Not only did he demonstrate extraordinary heroism at Iwo Jima, but he has dedicated his life to serving veterans and our community. Each year our local Boy Scouts—our local Scout council—gets all newly elected Eagle Scouts together and Woody is invited to come and spend time with the boys to share a few thoughts. When my two sons became Eagles, Woody shook their hands. He looked them in the eye and challenged them to conduct their life according to the Scout oath and motto, to do their duty to God and country, which is exactly how he has lived his life. Throughout West Virginia and the Nation, Woody is best known for his brave efforts in the Pacific Theater during World War II. b1630 Corporal Williams was a demolition sergeant serving with the 21st Marines, 3rd Marine Division when American troops landed on Iwo Jima. I would like to read now from Corporal Williams’ Medal of Honor citation: ‘‘Quick to volunteer his services when our tanks were maneuvering vainly to open a lane for the infantry through the network of reinforced concrete pillboxes, buried mines, and black volcanic sands, Corporal Williams daringly went forward alone to attempt the reduction of devastating machine gun fire from the unyielding positions. ‘‘Covered only by four riflemen, he fought desperately for 4 hours under terrific enemy small arms fire and repeatedly returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flamethrowers, struggling back frequently to the rear of hostile encampments to wipe out one position after another. ‘‘Corporal Williams’ aggressive fighting spirit and valiant devotion to duty throughout this fiercely contested action sustain and enhance the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.’’ Woody Williams believed in something greater than himself. His country asked, and he answered. Corporal Williams was there, in that place, at that time, when his country needed him the most. Following his military service, Woody continued to serve our Nation as a veterans service representative for the Department of Veterans Affairs. He also founded the Hershel Woody Williams Medal of Honor Foundation to recognize the sacrifices of our Nation’s Gold Star families. Woody is an example of the best that West Virginia and our Nation have to offer, and he is, quite simply, an American hero. Renaming the Huntington VA Medical Center to honor his service would be a fitting tribute for all he has done for our veterans and their families. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ), who is my good friend. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3663, which would name the VA medical center in Huntington, West Virginia, after a true American hero and my personal friend, Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams. Woody is recognized as the last living Medal of Honor recipient from the notoriously horrific Battle of Iwo Jima; but in West Virginia, Woody is known far more for his work on behalf of veterans. Upon his retirement from the Marines, Woody served 33 years as a counselor with the Department of Veterans Affairs. He served as the commandant of the veterans nursing home in Barboursville, West Virginia, for years, providing care to aging veterans. Then, in 2012, he helped start a Medal of Honor foundation dedicated to honoring Gold Star families and their fallen loved ones. The foundation has erected monuments in 36 States, like Tennessee, and offers scholarships to children in Gold Star families. Woody frequently travels to Washington to participate in special ceremonies at Arlington National 
Cemetery in honor of our fallen heroes. Earlier this year, as my colleague had mentioned, he received national recognition for his service to our country when he was asked to perform the coin toss for the Super Bowl. It is often said that the character of a person isn’t measured by their actions while in the limelight, but rather by the work they do when they are not being in the light, when no one is looking. Woody’s life is a manifestation of working behind the scenes. He has been unwavering in his support for our veterans, and Congress has an opportunity to offer him our heartfelt thanks and gratitude. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 3663, and I thank my colleague, EVANJENKINS , for this introduction of the bill and his support for Woody Williams. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ), who is my good friend. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation, as well as legislation I introduced along with the Montana Senate delegation to honor three Montana veterans by renaming three Department of Veterans Affairs facilities in their honor. These three veterans have shown the true spirit and dedication all Montanans and Americans should aspire to. Ben Steele from Roundup, Montana, joined the Army Air Corps and was stationed at Clark Field in the Philippines in 1941 when he was 24. Following the Japanese invasion, Ben fought on Bataan and survived the Bataan Death March. He was held prisoner for 3
1⁄2 years, and sketched with charcoal scenes on concrete and secret scraps of paper. Some of his work is still on display in the MacArthur Museum in Norfolk. After the war, he continued his passion for art and taught at MSUBillings for 33 years. Mr. Steele passed away in September of 2016 at the age of 98. The only thing he liked more than art was fishing. I am proud that the Billings Community Based Specialty Clinic will be renamed in honor of Benjamin Charles Steele. David Thatcher enlisted in the Army Air Corps in December of 1940. Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Thatcher volunteered for a secret mission joining Jimmy Doolittle in a bombing mission over Tokyo. Serving as a B–25 tail gunner on the Ruptured Duck, Thatcher saved the lives of his crew when the plane crashed into the sea trying to make landfall in China after the raid. For his actions, Thatcher was awarded the Silver Star. The Ruptured Duck was piloted by Lieutenant Ted Lawson, who wrote ‘‘Thirty Seconds over Tokyo.’’ Robert Walker played Thatcher in the movie. Thatcher flew in the African and European theaters for the rest of the war. Thatcher worked for the Postal Service for 30 years following his Army career and was an avid outdoorsman. He passed away in June, 2016, at the age of 94. The communitybased outpatient clinic in Missoula will be designated in his honor. The communitybased outpatient clinic on Spring Creek Lane in Billings will be designated in honor of Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow. Dr. Medicine Crow was born in the Crow Indian Reservation in 1913 and was the first member of the tribe to receive a master’s degree, graduating from the University of Southern California in 1939. After working in the naval shipyard in Bremerton, Medicine Crow joined the Army in 1943 and served as a scout in the 103rd Infantry Division in Europe. He became the last surviving war chief of the Crow Nation, having successfully led a war party, stolen horses from the Nazi SS, disarming an enemy and capturing him without killing him. For his service in World War II, he received the Bronze Star and the French Legion of Honor. After the war, he worked for the Crow Agency and the Bureau of Indian Affairs as well as the Little Big Horn College. He has served on numerous boards and educational commissions. He even addressed the United Nations. He passed away in April of 2016. Mr. Speaker, while their friends and families know their great deeds, I am honored to share this story with you and the rest of the country. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, once again, Mr. Speaker, I would just remind everyone here that these are not just naming bills. This is our history; it is important. The four stories told today are an amazing testament to what bill we can do as a people, and these individuals deserve this honor. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ What I say to Woody is: thank you, thank you, thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MARSHALL ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3663. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT A message in writing from the President of the United States was communicated to the House by Ms. Gabrielle Cuccia, one of his secretaries. HOMELESS VETERANS’ REINTEGRATION PROGRAMS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4451) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for a fiveyear extension to the homeless veterans reintegration programs and to provide clarification regarding eligibility for services under such programs, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4451 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
(a) F IVEYEAREXTENSION OF HOMELESS VETERANS REINTEGRATION PROGRAMS .—Section 2021(e)(1)(F) of title 38, United States Code, is amended by striking ‘‘2018’’ and inserting ‘‘2022’’. (b) FIVEYEAR EXTENSION OF HOMELESS  WOMEN VETERANS AND HOMELESS VETERANS  WITHCHILDREN REINTEGRATION GRANT PROGRAM .—Section 2021A(f)(1) of such title is amended by striking ‘‘2018’’ and inserting ‘‘2022’’. (c) CLARIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICES UNDER HOMELESS VETERANS REINTEGRA TION PROGRAMS .—Section 2021(a) of such title is amended by striking ‘‘reintegration of homeless veterans into the labor force.’’ and inserting the following: ‘‘reintegration into the labor force of— ‘‘(1) homeless veterans (including veterans who were homeless but found housing during the 60day period preceding the date on which the veteran begins to participate in a program under this section); ‘‘(2) veterans participating in the Department of Veterans Affairs supported housing program for which rental assistance is provided pursuant to section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(19)) or the Tribal HUD–VA Supportive Housing (Tribal HUD– VASH) program; ‘‘(3) Indians who are veterans and receiving assistance under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.); ‘‘(4) veterans described in section 2023(e) of this title or any other veterans who are transitioning from being incarcerated; and ‘‘(5) veterans participating in the Department of Veterans Affairs rapid rehousing and prevention program authorized in section 2044 of this title.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material into the RECORD on H.R. 4451, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? 
There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4451, as amended. This bill would reauthorize the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program, known as HVRP, and Homeless Women Veterans and Homeless Veterans With Children Reintegration Grant Program, through fiscal year 2022. These are grant programs managed by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Veterans Employment and Training Service. Grants are made generally to nonprofit, communitybased organizations to fund efforts to train and place homeless veterans in jobs. This has been a highly successful program that puts homeless veterans back on the path to selfreliance and sustainability and is worthy of Congress’ continued support and funding. This bill would also clarify that homeless veterans who are eligible for other federally funded homeless veteran programs are also eligible to receive training and employment services provided by grantees through HVRP and HVRPW. I believe that expanding eligibility for HVRP and HVRPW will provide participants in these programs better access to job training programs that can help homeless veterans on their path to sustainable employment and positive outcomes. This expansion would also occur without impacting current authorization levels for this program. I want to thank Congressman WENSTRUP and Congresswoman BROWNLEY for introducing this must pass bill, which has my full support. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4451, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4451, and thank the gentleman and everyone involved in this piece of legislation. Veteran homelessness, combating it and reducing it to zero, has been a focus of this committee for many years. Direct services provided by HVRP include placement, skills training, job development, career counseling, and resume writing. It is the only nationwide program focused on assisting homeless veterans in reintegrating into the workforce. This is incredibly important because reintegrating homeless veterans into the workforce is the best way to ensure that they do not reenter homelessness again. This would reauthorize the program for 5 years. Reducing veteran homelessness remains our priority. I believe this piece of legislation will get us there. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ), who is my Health Subcommittee chair. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague and Chairman ROEfor yielding. In November of last year, I joined my colleague and the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee, Representative BROWNLEY , in reintroducing H.R. 4451, the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act. This bill would provide muchneeded services to our veterans transitioning out of homelessness and ensure no veteran falls through unintended legislative gaps in programs. We do this by reauthorizing through fiscal year 2022 the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program, along with programs designed for female homeless veterans and homeless veterans with children. Additionally, the bill would clarify that those eligible for housing assistance from either a Federal or nonFederal entity are also eligible for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. Currently, a gap arises because the Department of Labor considers veterans participating in these housing assistance programs to no longer be defined as homeless. As such, they are unable to participate in the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Program, a program that provides vital employment assistance and training. By prioritizing the reintegration of homeless and recently homeless veterans, we will empower our veterans to reenter the workforce and help them regain selfsufficiency. b1645 Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country, and we must ensure that they have the tools to succeed in civilian life. I am proud of Chairman ROE’s and the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee’s commitment to reducing veteran homelessness, and I believe that this legislation only further supports this committee’s goals. I urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ), my good friend. She is a true champion of veterans and is the conscience on this issue in our committee of alleviating veterans’ homelessness. Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4451, the Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act. I thank the gentleman from Ohio, the chair of the House Veterans’ Affairs Health Subcommittee, for partnering with me to introduce this important legislation. Our Nation’s servicemembers undertake enormous sacrifices every day to keep us safe, and we must ensure they can smoothly transition back into civilian life when they come home. Unfortunately, however, too many of our returning servicemembers are struggling with homelessness. In 2017, HUD’s annual survey found that veteran homelessness increased by 1.5 percent after years of declining percentages. Los Angeles County, which I represent a part of, saw a 57 percent increase in the number of homeless veterans just in the past year. While our local partners are committed to working together with the VA and other Federal agencies to ensure all veterans have access to safe and affordable housing, clearly, we need to be using every tool in our toolbox to end veteran homelessness completely. That means supporting both the housing programs and wraparound services necessary to heal and to house our veterans. Today’s legislation will allow veterans who have struggled with homelessness to remain eligible for job services while utilizing VA housing programs. This will help more veterans break the cycle of homelessness, support themselves and their families, and get back on their feet. Again, I thank the chairman for championing this issue together, and the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans for highlighting this problem in testimony before the committee, and for their support of the bill. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio and the gentlewoman from California for addressing this. It is a smart move to do this, continuing to keep our focus. While our numbers are improving in areas, we know this is a zero sum proposition. Any veteran on the street is one too many. So I appreciate any effort that is made. This is a good piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. When I came to Congress in 2009, there were over 100,0000 homeless veterans in the United States. General Shinseki, our Secretary at that time, set out to eliminate veteran homelessness in the next 6 or 7 years. It was a very ambitious task. Great progress has been made. I have visited the West L.A. campus and seen what they are doing in Los Angeles and Los Angeles County. As my good friend, TIMWALZ, said, one homeless veteran is one too many. For people who may be watching this today, we as a country are providing HUDVASH vouchers for veterans who can use these, along with a case manager. But that is only part of it. Many of these veterans have many other issues and there are other programs that need to be available for these men 
and women who find themselves in this situation. This is one of them where you can access job training so you can get a meaningful job and take care of yourself. Actually, I think this program and the other one end up paying for themselves over time. Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage my colleagues to support this, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4451, Homeless Veterans’ Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2017. H.R. 4451 proposes an amendment to Title 38 of the United States Code to provide for a fiveyear extension to homeless veterans reintegration programs and to provide clarification regarding eligibility for services under such programs. This bill includes the reauthorization of reintegration programs among those for whom job training, counseling, and placement services are to be provided to expedite their reintegration into the labor force. These services provided to homeless veterans include the VA supported housing program, assistance under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996, transitioning from being incarcerated, and participating in the VA’s rapid re housing and homelessness prevention program. Mr. Speaker, our United States veterans bravely put their lives on the line to defend our freedoms and to keep our nation safe. Without the brave efforts of all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guardsmen and women and their families, our country would not live so freely. Homelessness among the American veteran population is on the rise in the United States and we must be proactive in giving back to those who have given so much to us. We as a nation have a responsibility to our veterans to provide programs that aid in their reintegration back into the labor force. Nearly 230,000 veterans and their families have been able to come back from homeless and find permanent homes since 2010. By passing H.R. 4451, homeless veterans will receive assistance to enhance their quality of life and community integration. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 4451. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4451, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
IMPROVING OVERSIGHT OF WOMEN VETERANS’ CARE ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4334) to provide for certain reporting requirements relating to medical care for women veterans provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and through contracts entered into by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with nonDepartment medical providers, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4334 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act of 2018’’. 
SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORT ON VETERAN ACCESS TO COVERED SEXSPECIFIC SERVICES UNDER COMMUNITY CARE CONTRACTS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material into the RECORD on H.R. 4334, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4334, as amended, Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act of 2018. While VA has vastly improved its capacity to care for genderspecific needs of women veterans, many are still referred to the community when VA cannot provide the appropriate services. Mr. Speaker, last week, the House overwhelmingly approved the VA MISSION Act by a vote of 347–70. The MISSION Act will, among other things, improve the ability for eligible veterans to seek care from community providers when VA cannot meet strict access standards. With more veterans becoming eligible to seek care in the community, it is incumbent upon us as members of the House VA Committee to provide oversight over the care delivered within the community as well. This bill, offered by my friend and fellow committee member from California (Mr. CORREA ), would help us do just that. H.R. 4334 would require VA medical centers to report to the Secretary on the compliance of contracted community providers with standards of care for women veterans, as established by VA. The Secretary would also be required to report to Congress on the accessibility of genderspecific medical care for women with community providers, as well as to develop a plan to strengthen standards of care within the facilities. Mr. Speaker, as we await Senate passage of the VA MISSION Act, I urge 
my colleagues to support this complementary piece of legislation, H.R. 4334, as amended, Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of Congressman CORREA ’s and Chairman R OE’s bill, H.R. 4334, the Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act. The gentleman from California has proven over the course of his time in Congress that he is a dedicated advocate for our fastest growing population of veterans: female veterans. His experience working on behalf of veterans in the State of California in the legislature has translated into an informed compassion that has earned the respect of the committee. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4334 does require VA to exercise proper oversight of community care providers it contracts with in order to provide sexspecific healthcare to women when its facilities do not have the equipment or the specialists necessary to care for them. The latest study by the RAND Corporation confirms that VA delivers superior healthcare to veterans, when compared to the private sector. Previous independent studies confirm this. For this reason, VA should better monitor the quality of care received by women in the community, and this bill would require that careful monitoring so that women veterans receive high quality care. VA should always remain at the center of managing veterans’ healthcare. And managing the care veterans receive in the community by only contracting with highquality providers with the competence to provide treatment to veterans is a major part of ensuring that they receive the highest quality care. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ), the chief author of this bill and a good friend to veterans across the country. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 4334, the Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act. Women are the fastest growing cohort of veterans. There are currently 2 million women veterans in the United States and Puerto Rico, almost 10 percent of the overall veteran population. According to some projections, women veterans are expected to grow to represent 15 percent of all veterans by 2030. Therefore, it is important that we ensure that women veterans receive quality care in a safe and dignified environment, as well as in a timely manner, in and outside the Department of Veterans Affairs. Specifically, this bill will require an annual report on veteran access to genderspecific care under community care contracts and quarterly reports on environment of care standards for women veterans. In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleague and friend, Ranking Member WALZ, and Health Subcommittee Ranking Member BROWNLEY  for the support of this legislation. I thank Chairman ROEas well. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4334. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. CORREA ’s legislation. I, too, was, an OB/GYN physician who saw VA patients. I would like to think that Mr. CORREA had all these ideas himself, but I have had the opportunity to find out that he definitely married above himself. His wife is an OB/GYN, so I think he probably got most of those ideas from her. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ), a champion of veterans—a champion in many areas— and on this issue of treating our female veterans with the dignity, respect, and services that they have earned. Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4334, the Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act. I want to thank my colleague on the committee, the gentleman from California, for introducing this important legislation to improve the care we deliver for women veterans. During my time on this committee, I have made it a special priority to ensure women veterans have access to highquality, genderspecific care in a safe and welcoming environment. This bill will advance that goal in two important ways. First, it requires the VA to practice additional oversight on the community care providers that the VA contracts with and report on the access women veterans have to genderspecific medical care in the community. This is especially timely, as the House recently passed a bipartisan update to the VA’s community care programs. As we stand up the new community care program, we need to do a better job tracking the quality of care provided to women veterans. Second, this bill requires the VA to report to Congress on their compliance with environment of care standards for women veterans. Too often, we have heard reports of women veterans who experience issues at VA clinics. A VA Inspector General’s report last year found that up to 20 percent of VA clinics did not meet the VA’s own requirements for protecting the privacy of women veterans. This is unacceptable. We need to ensure that women veterans are well served, no matter where they get their care, and this bill will help us get closer to that goal. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I thank the gentleman from California for his efforts. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I would certainly encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I also concur with my colleague: I urge support of H.R. 4334. I just want to say, right before Memorial Day, it is obviously next week, and many people will go home to picnics and families. We have just heard this afternoon on the House floor the sacrifice of many, many of our veterans and really amazing people that live in our country. In the past week, the Veterans’ Affairs Committee—and I want to thank members on both sides of the aisle— have put together 15 bills: one was a major bill, the VA MISSION Act, which will be taken up by the Senate this week, and 14 bills this afternoon to improve both the care and services provided to our Nation’s heroes. For me, it is a true privilege to get up every day and come to this House, to this body, the U.S. House of Representatives, and to advocate for those men and women that I have so much respect for. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy Memorial Day to everyone, and I encourage everyone to vote for this today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4334, the Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act of 2017. H.R. 4334 provides for certain reporting requirements relating to medical care for women veterans provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and through contracts entered into by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with nonDepartment medical providers. By passing this bill ensuring these requirements, we are ensuring equitable attention to health care for veteran men and women. Such requirements include an annual report to Congress on veteran access to covered sexspecific services such as mammography, maternity care, and gynecological care under community care contracts. Our United States veterans bravely put their lives on the line to defend our freedoms and to keep our nation safe. I want to thank all of our armed serviceman and women for their selfless dedication to our nation. The debt that we owe to them is immeasurable because their sacrifices, and those of their families, are our freedom’s foundation. Mr. Speaker, of the nation’s 21.6 million brave veterans, more than 2 million are women. Further, 20 percent of veterans who have served on active duty since September 2001 are women. 
Male and female veterans alike deserve access to health care, and this bill will ensure that discrepancies in care among male and female veterans can be identified and addressed. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 4334. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4334, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 6:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 5 p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. BOST) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m.

REPORT ON H.R. 5894, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 Mr. SIMPSON, from the Committee on Appropriations, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–696) on the bill (H.R. 5894) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, which was referred to the Union Calendar and ordered to be printed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1, rule XXI, all points of order are reserved on the bill. 
REPORT ON H.R. 5895, ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 Mr. SIMPSON, from the Committee on Appropriations, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–697) on the bill (H.R. 5895) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, which was referred to the Union Calendar and ordered to be printed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1, rule XXI, all points of order are reserved on the bill. f 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow for morning hour debate and 11 a.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Idaho? There was no objection. 
PERMISSION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT ON H.R. 5515, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Armed Services be authorized to file a supplemental report on the bill, H.R. 5515. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. 
MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of May as National Mental Health Awareness Month, an important time to share resources for individuals and families that cope with any number of mental health challenges, because about 1 in 5 Americans experience mental illness, and 1 in 25 struggle with a serious mental health condition. Serious mental health illnesses are now costing Americans nearly $200 billion in lost earnings each year, and 16 million Americans have had at least one major depressive episode in the last year. That is why it is more important than ever to ensure that people and individuals who need help are able to get it. The good news is that now individuals in need of help can call a 24hour national help line, operated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, for a confidential conversation. Mr. Speaker, it may be the difference between life or death for someone who is in need. 
A MOMENT OF SILENCE IS NOT ENOUGH (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, a moment of silence is not enough. I did not respond to the invitation of the gentleman from Texas to come and stand here. I lost a young woman at Great Mills High School in my district. I visited with her parents, I went to her funeral, and I grieved with our community, but coming to this well and spending but a moment for the thousands who have lost their lives is not enough. We need to act. The Governor of Texas thinks we ought to do something. The Governor of Florida thought we should do something, and he did something. We should bring to this floor legislation to try to stem this violence. We will have disagreements as to what that may be, but a moment of silence is not enough. 
COMMUNITY BANKS ARE THE CENTER OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN SMALL TOWNS (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, probably the most ironically named piece of legislation outside of the Affordable Care Act would be DoddFrank’s Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection. Wall Street banks have only gotten bigger, and we have had more concentration of assets in fewer banks, making for greater systemic risk. Meanwhile, the small community banks on Main Street have been pummeled with a mountain of unnecessary rules and regulations. We are putting a community bank out of business one a week since 2010. 170 community banks have gone away in Texas alone. Consumer protection? There is no such thing as consumer protection with respect to DoddFrank. They have only had more complexity. Consumers have had to deal with more burden and higher costs and fewer choices. I support S. 2155 because I support Main Street, because I support rural America; and I support community banks, the center of economic activity in small towns all across these United States. 
FOSTER CARE MONTH/SHADOW DAY (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, as co chair of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, I rise to recognize May as National Foster Care Month and to acknowledge the 437,000 foster youth across the country. On Wednesday, I will be joined by Yolanda Washburn, a former foster youth from Providence, Rhode Island. Yolanda is a vocal advocate for children in care. She is committed to making positive change, and she is on track to become a counselor. As someone who has aged out of foster care, Yolanda has overcome immense odds to find such success. I look forward to hearing her recommendations for improving the foster care system. No one understands the system better than those who have lived in it. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend, Congresswoman BASS, for organizing Shadow Day again this year and for her tireless work as the leader of our caucus. I am thrilled by this opportunity to amplify her voice and the voices of foster youth everywhere. 
135TH ANNIVERSARY OF STRUTHERS LIBRARY THEATRE (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Struthers Library Theatre in Warren, Pennsylvania, on its 135th anniversary. It has been a community treasure since it opened in 1883. In 1882, local citizen Thomas Struthers generously offered to erect a building that would house a library. It included a public hall and rental space where the profits would be used by the Library Association. The Struthers building would eventually become the center of the town’s cultural activity, and Thomas Struthers would long be remembered as a visionary. It has celebrated many milestones over the years: In 1919, the new Library Theatre opened, after a complete gutting and remodeling of the auditorium, with a popular Broadway play. In 1983, the Library Theatre celebrated an extensive renovation and its 100th birthday with a gala reopening featuring various performances throughout the night. In 1984, the Library Room was restored to its original splendor and outfitted for special events and gatherings. Mr. Speaker, the Struthers Library Theatre continues to be a cultural gem in Warren that is enjoyed by all. It maintains the fantastic legacy of its founder, Thomas Struthers, who would certainly be so proud today. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN THE SWAMP (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, President Trump promised to drain the swamp, but the Financial Times reports his paytoplay scheme catering to Chinese investors sure looks like he is in the swamp. Vox reports this week President Trump has a direct financial interest in a major real estate development project essentially underwritten by a stateowned Chinese bank in Indonesia called Lido City and secured a $500 million loan from the Metallurgical Corporation of China, billing it as Asia’s first Trump community, featuring a resort golf course, condominiums, and private villas. According to the Financial Times, the President and the Republican Party are soon to host a $150,000a plate dinner in Dallas, where a Chineseowned bank is now encouraging its top investors to attend so they can get face time with the President and key members of his team at $150,000 a plate. Meanwhile, the American workers still don’t know what is in President Trump’s trade deal to increase Chinese purchases of American goods, but we do know we need a guard dog to protect American economic and security interests from the President’s apparent conflict of interest on his personal dealings, not in the national interest. f 
FINDING A COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPASSIONATE SOLUTION TO THE OPIOID CRISIS (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my bipartisan bill, the Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act of 2018, which passed unanimously in the House Ways and Means Committee last week. As a member of the bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I am committed to finding a comprehensive and compassionate solution to reverse the tide of the growing opioid addiction plaguing our communities and families. With 115 people dying each day—and 635 in my own district in 2016 alone— from an opioid overdose, we must find ways to prevent this abuse from happening in the first place. My bipartisan bill requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to evaluate and report on adverse incentives that lead to the overprescription of opioids and underutilization of nonopioid alternatives for postsurgery recovery and the treatment of chronic pain. This is commonsense legislation that will enable Congress to identify and eliminate perverse incentives that are fueling the opioid epidemic, the epidemic that is destroying our families and our communities. I have personally known individuals in the 22nd District whose lives were taken too early because of this scourge. This bipartisan bill is a step in the right direction to helping our families and communities combat this crisis that is tearing families apart. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my bipartisan cosponsors, Representative 
SUZAN DELBENE and Representative DAVID MCKINLEY , for joining me in this important legislation. 
b1930 REMEMBERING TOM WOLFE (Mr. MCEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in remembrance of a literary giant and Richmond, Virginia, native, Tom Wolfe. Mr. Wolfe was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, in 1930, and attended my own alma mater, St. Christopher’s School. A pioneer of the New Journalism movement, he worked for the Springfield Union, The Washington Post, the Herald Tribune, Esquire, and also wrote influential novels. His multitude of subjects ranged from the hot rod and custom car culture of Southern California, to the interactions of famous actors and Black Panthers at a Park Avenue fundraiser, to the meteoric rise and fall of a fictional New York bond trader. In an interview, Bryon Dobell, Wolfe’s editor at Esquire, said this about him: ‘‘He has this unique gift of language that sets him apart as Tom Wolfe. It is full of hyperbole; it is brilliant; it is funny, and he has a wonderful ear for how people look and feel.’’ With his passing, we have lost an important and deeply gifted writer. I am truly saddened by this great Virginian’s passing, and I send my condolences to his friends and to his family. 
SECRETARY POMPEO DIDN’T MINCE WORDS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commend our Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, for his first major foreign policy speech this morning. Secretary Pompeo didn’t mince words, saying Iran would be hit with the strongest sanctions in history if their government does not change their aggressive behavior in the Middle East. After rightly pulling the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal, this administration has made it clear: They are willing to actually solve the Iran problem, unlike the previous administration or those before that. Secretary Pompeo laid out the conditions Iran must meet: cease their nuclear program; end support for terrorist groups such as Hamas, al Qaida, and Hezbollah; and withdraw from Syria, among others. It is a long list of actions, but as Secretary Pompeo noted, it is a list of Iran’s own creation, not ours. I want to see a peaceful Middle East as well, a solution for the people of Iran themselves—next year will be 40 years under this type of regime. Before that, they had freedom—especially for the women of Iran that would like to enjoy the freedoms to associate as they see fit. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Secretary Pompeo for his commitment to researching an agreement and holding Iran accountable. f 
RECOGNIZING EMANCIPATION DAY IN FLORIDA (Mr. LAWSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Emancipation Proclamation in Florida. On May 20, 1865, 11 days after the end of the Civil War and 2 years after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Union General Edward M. McCook arrived in Tallahassee and read President Lincoln’s words from the steps of the Knott House. I was there yesterday for a ceremony. It is very significant. Slavery is one of the dark sides of American history, but it is a part that we can never forget. It is important that it will be forever recorded in the history books. Today, while African Americans are free, basic humans rights are still denied to many of them at this time. If all men are equal, then we must maintain our commitment to treat them equally. We must continue to move our country forward if we truly wish to be ‘‘one Nation, under God.’’ There are major jobs that we need to create, our children need to be more protected, their families need to be fed. The time is now to help build a more perfect Union for all of us. 
PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE CONSIDERED AS PRIMARY SPONSOR OF H.R. 548 Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter be considered the primary sponsor of H.R. 548, a bill originally introduced by Representative DENTof Pennsylvania, for the purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF QUINTON ROBBINS (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Quinton Robbins. Quinton attended the Route 51 festival in Las Vegas on October 1. He was a student at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, UNLV. He looked forward to going to dental school after receiving his bachelor’s degree. When he wasn’t in school, he spent his time either working as a recreational assistant at the Arroyo Grande Sports Complex or playing on a softball team. Quinton had a passion for softball, and would occasionally coach youth tball teams. Quinton was loved by everyone he met. All those who knew him remember him for being a kind and loving soul. Quinton was a leader who welcomed everyone with a smile that could light up a room. Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Quinton Robbins’ family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. f 
CONTINUATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO VENEZUELA—MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–129) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order with respect to Venezuela that takes additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13808 of August 24, 2017, and Executive Order 13827 of March 19, 2018. The Executive Order I have issued today prohibits transactions related to, provision of financing for, and other dealings in (i) the purchase of any debt owed to the Government of Venezuela, including accounts receivable; (ii) any debt owed to the Government of Venezuela that is pledged as collateral after the effective date of the Executive Order, including accounts receivable; and (iii) the sale, transfer, assignment, or pledging as collateral by the Government of Venezuela of any equity interest in any entity in which the Government of Venezuela has a 50 percent or greater ownership interest. I have authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including promulgating rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the Executive Order. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued today. DONALD J. T RUMP .THEWHITE HOUSE , May 21, 2018. 
THE PROPOSED PROTECTING LIFE RULE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor and privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. NOEM), an extremely effective Member of the House of Representatives, the former assistant majority leader of the South Dakota House of Representatives, and a distinguished member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and his work protecting life in this Nation. Mr. Speaker, taxpayers should not have to bear the abortion industry’s financial burden directly or indirectly, and yet, every single year, the American people are forced to deposit $60 million into the bank account of Planned Parenthood, an organization that performs more than 300,000 abortions annually. Now, I understand that this money cannot be directly spent on abortions, and we have been successful in protecting taxpayers from funding these procedures through the Hyde amendment. But by subsidizing organizations like Planned Parenthood, which promote and perform abortions, taxpayers are propping up the abortion industry, and that is just not right. That is a burden that they should not have to bear. I know some will try to claim this move as damaging women’s health, but that is false. The President’s decision will not take a penny from women’s health. Instead, it redirects those funds to clinics and centers that offer comprehensive lifeaffirming care to women from the moment of conception on. And in many areas, health centers like this far outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics. For example, in my home State of South Dakota, there are six federally qualified health centers operating in 45 service sites, but just one Planned Parenthood center. For decades, the abortion industry has tried to normalize this operation. But I want to be clear: Abortion is not healthcare, and it is not family planning either. Abortion is the intentional ending of an unborn baby’s life. There is nothing more fundamental to our society than our kids. Our founding documents speak on behalf of us and our posterity. The American Dream itself rests on the idea that our children will have more opportunity than we do, and that is how America works. And no matter how small they are, whether they are born or unborn, we should never stop passionately arguing for their life and their liberty. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for her very eloquent statement. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the Trump administration announced its intention to reassert and promulgate portions of President Ronald Reagan’s modest but necessary lifeaffirming title 10 rule; a policy designed to ensure that taxpayers don’t fund, facilitate, or promote abortion in America’s $286 million per year family plan program. This new old policy comes at a time when huge majorities of Americans, over 60 percent, according to major polls, strongly oppose the use of taxpayer funds for abortion. The Trump/Reagan policy, now called the Protect Life Rule, comes at a time when the high utilization of ultrasound imaging of the child in the womb has provided spectacular clarity and empathy, and even love, for the baby. First baby pictures today, the kind you put on the door of your refrigerator, are of unborn babies. Seeing is believing. No one can seriously deny anymore that unborn children are alive, dynamic, precious, a miracle, and defenseless. Title 10 was intended to be about family planning, prevention, not the hideous dismemberment or chemical poisoning or deliberate starvation and forced expulsion of a defenseless unborn baby. There is nothing benign or compassionate about killing a defenseless child. Mr. Speaker, created by Congress in 1970, title 10 of the Public Health Service Act authorized taxpayer funds to assist ‘‘voluntary family planning projects,’’ but made absolutely clear in the status that Federal funds were prohibited from being spent on ‘‘programs where abortion is a method of family planning.’’ As title 10 was administered, however, that didn’t happen. So to faithfully implement both the spirit and the letter of the law, President Ronald Reagan issued a rule in 1988 that included physical separation of abortion activities from federally funded family planning projects. In response, the American abortion industry sued to get hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollar subsidies, and they lost. On May 23, 1991, 27 years ago this Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Rust v. Sullivan, affirmed the constitutionality of the Reagan title 10 rule. Tragically, President Bill Clinton, by executive order, reversed the Reagan policy. He not only authorized abortion clinics and family planning activities under the same roof, colocation, but went further, mandating, made it a condition of receiving title 10 funds, that title 10 recipients refer for abortion, an egregious violation of conscience rights protected under Federal law. Thus, by requiring abortion referrals, family planning service providers who oppose abortion, were and are today, precluded from all participation in the Federal program. Today, hundreds of abortion clinics are colocated as title 10 family planning facilities. For example, 266 of Planned Parenthood’s abortion clinics are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers in the title 10 program, to the tune of $56 to $60 million each year. b1945 Planned Parenthood is an organization, let’s not forget, that is directly responsible for over 7 million deaths of unborn children—a staggering loss of children’s lives. Mr. Speaker, if past is prologue, I fully expect an organized, aggressive, willful distortion of the Protect Life Rule. Nevertheless, in the spirit of honest debate and civil discourse, I urge opponents and the news media to be clear what this rule actually does and what it doesn’t do. According to the White House, the new Protect Life Rule will: one, physically and financially separate family planning clinics from abortions, and will make other important reforms. It will also safeguard the conscience rights of providers by eliminating the egregious illegal mandate that requires all participants in the program to refer pregnant women to abortion. The Protect Life Rule will not, however, prohibit counseling that may include conversations about abortion. This would be in keeping with guidance issued by George H.W. Bush’s administration that affirmed that: 
Nothing in these regulations is to prevent a woman from receiving complete medical information about her condition from a physician. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, chairman of the Committee on ProLife Activities, really summed it up when he said: ‘‘For too long, title X has been used to subsidize the abortion industry. We need to draw a bright line between what happens before a pregnancy begins and what happens after a child has been created.’’ He goes on to say: ‘‘Abortion always takes the life of a child and often harms the mother, her surviving children, and other family and friends as well.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ), my good friend. He serves on the Committee on Ways and Means and is a former member of the Butler City Council. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, who has been a longstanding and committed champion of life. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, the Trump administration proposed cutting title X funding for organizations like Planned Parenthood that perform abortions. Now, the proposed rule does not cut funds from the title X family planning program. Instead, the funds 
are directed to community health centers like The Primary Health Network in Sharon, Pennsylvania. Countrywide, there are 20 times more community health centers than Planned Parenthoods. In fact, there are absolutely no Planned Parenthood offices in my district, but there are 37 federally funded health centers. Planned Parenthood receives $56 million a year in taxpayer dollars through title X. One of the things I wanted to just talk about for a minute, if I can, today we again grieve at the loss of innocent life, and I just would ask people to look at the loss of innocent life that we see every day in the United States. There are approximately 3,000 abortions performed daily in the United States. So as we grieve so much for the loss of innocent life, I think sometimes we forget about all of the other life that is being lost and we kind of push that aside because we say: The Supreme Court made a ruling that allows that to take place. Regardless, it still is a loss of innocent life, and we see this every day, but somehow as a nation, we have a deaf ear and a blind eye to that loss of innocent life. To me, it just would seem that at some point we look at this and realize it for what it is. I can’t tell the other gentleman how much I appreciate the battle that he has continued, and it shouldn’t be a battle. We are all trying to do the same thing, and it is to make sure that innocent life is protected. So this piece, it doesn’t take any money at all away from the title X family planning program. It does take a look at Planned Parenthood and says, you cannot use this taxpayer funded money, this $56 million to $60 million a year to provide abortions. I would just ask the country as a whole, and the Nation, and we, as a people, to please take a look at what is going on. This loss of innocent life is so tragic and so unnecessary, and I say that because I know a lot of the pregnancies are unintended, but there are loving families waiting for children who are there, who are willing, and who are wanting to provide a loving home for children. So I would like to see if we can somehow come to an agreement or come to an understanding about what is being lost every day—3,000 innocent lives a day. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what the gentleman is doing. I know how hard it has been. It is so hard for some people to weigh in on it, but I just think there is a conscience that we all need to have, and preserving life is one of those. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman KELLY  so much for his comments and his leadership for many, many years. I deeply appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES), a good friend and colleague, who is a distinguished member of the Education and the Workforce Committee and also serves on Homeland Security. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the new title X regulations announced by the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services. Title X is a family planning program authorized in 1970 to provide family planning services to lowincome women. Currently, Congress approves $286 million a year to provide these family planning services like: education, counseling, health screenings, and healthcare. For years, prolife protections like the Hyde amendment sought to ensure tax dollars, including title X funds, would not go to abortion providers. However, the Clintonera title X regulations have sadly mandated that all grantees refer abortions as part of their family planning services and created loopholes allowing title X funding to flow to organizations which provide abortions, such as Planned Parenthood. Under these Clintonera regulations, Planned Parenthood has been able to receive an average of $56 million in taxes each year from title X. Clearly, that is not in line with the intent of the title X family planning program and it is past time to change. I was proud to help lead the effort in Congress to urge the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to update title X guidelines with those similar to regulations in place during the Reagan era. These Reagan regulations—which were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991— were rolled back by the Clinton administration and have remained in place since then. However, today, thanks to President Trump and his administration, we turn this page and mark a historic victory for life. This week the Trump administration will unveil new regulations called the Protect Life Rule which will prohibit any organization that performs or refers abortions from receiving title X family planning funds. The Protect Life Rule will mandate that title X grant recipients be physically and financially separate from facilities that provide abortions, closing for good that loophole that has allowed organizations like Planned Parenthood to receive title X funding. Currently, Planned Parenthood conducts 320,000 abortions every year and receives nearly $60 million in tax dollars annually. Implementing the Protect Life Rule will save thousands of innocent lives and ensure that title X funding supports actual family planning, not abortions. The Protect Life Rule will also increase safeguards for victims of sexual assault, these victims who have already been abused. Implementing the Protect Life Rule will not cut any funds that go toward family planning to support mothers and families every day. In fact, it will provide more money net for legitimate family planning activities. To suggest otherwise, would be a politically motivated lie to the American people. Contrary to the doomsday rhetoric used by proabortion advocates, this is a great day for life and families across America. I want to thank dozens of prolife grassroots organizations and more than 150 of my colleagues from the House and Senate who joined this effort to push back for the new title X regulations—especially Representatives BLACK , HARTZLER , and S MITH. I also want to thank President Trump and his administration for issuing the Protect Life Rule, heeding our calls and the calls of millions of Americans who have long demanded that tax dollars not go to abortion providers, just as the law was intended. President Trump ran as a prolife candidate, and the Protect Life Rule is just the latest example of how the President and Republicans in Congress believe in keeping our promises to the American people. The Protect Life Rule is a win for millions of Americans who have marched for life in our Nation’s Capital and the millions more who have marched throughout our country, including in my home State of Kansas. I look forward to the implementation of the Protect Life Rule. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for his comments and his leadership, especially on this important issue. I deeply appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the distinguished gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING), a member of the Agriculture Committee, the Small Business Committee, and a force on the Judiciary Committee. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and appreciate him yielding, and also appreciate CHRIS SMITH’s leadership on the prolife issue here in the United States Congress. It takes a strong and committed force to constantly be on top of every component of the life issue every day and night. I am convinced that CHRIS SMITH misses sleep over this, as I do and many of us do. But today, we have got something to be happy about, Mr. Speaker, and that is that the $286 million that goes into family planning and is under title X, the purpose of those funds is to help plan the number and the spacing of children. And I think that God should be in charge of that. I have long said that a solution for our society is good people need to have a lot of babies and raise them right. And once we get our social agenda right, if we get our faith right, if we get our families right, if we understand the Constitution, if we have a work ethic that is right, and if our integrity is there, all the rest will automatically take care of itself. I see these little babies when I look around in my church. Our church is just full of little ones. I had a little newborn in front of me last Sunday and I watched how the family passed that little newborn along. I saw a granddaughter shoot across the aisle to grandparents. Nobody worries. I don’t 
worry because those kids there are going to be all right. This country always takes care of its little ones. There has never been a time where we could have more confidence in taking care of our little ones, but we have got to get them born. We are seeing money borrowed from China to supplement a national debt to go into a title X family planning program. Abortion is not family planning. Abortion is ending a significant component of the family. This program also has statutory prohibition on abortion. So this policy that is unfolding here—thankfully, from the Trump administration—will restore the statutory provisions and Planned Parenthood themselves—you have heard the number, Mr. Speaker, 56 million—and my math came out to 60 million. It is in that category—that is used to advocate for abortion and to actually commit abortions. Some people aren’t moved by the utter immorality. I have looked at some things that I saw today as I was flying in this morning, and I looked around on the internet and picked up some things. One of them that caught my eye was that the U.S. birth rate has hit a record low. Now, that record low consists of this: There were only 60.2 babies born per thousand women in this past year in 2017. That is the women between the ages of 15 and 44, the fertility years, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes it—only 60.2. That is the lowest it has ever been since we have been keeping records, and we have been keeping records for decades. Also, the total fertility rate is the lowest it has been since 1978—and I think we had an anomaly in 1978—but that total fertility rate, Mr. Speaker, I point out that in order to sustain our population as it is, just a level population, it takes 2.1 babies per woman in order to sustain our population. And that is rated in the total fertility rate. That is 1.764 today, babies per woman, the lowest it has been since 1978, and well below—hundreds and hundreds below—what it needs to be able to sustain our population. And here is another record that is the lowest in 30 years. Now think of this: The population of the United States of America is as high as it has ever been— about 326 million or more. With 326 million people, you would think the higher the population is, the more babies would be born into that population—at least you would set a record on babies born into the population because our population is as large as it has ever been. But here is the real data on it. There were 3,853,472 births in 2017. That is the lowest number of births in 30 years. The lowest number of births in 30 years, and we also need to add to that, there are roughly 1 million abortions that took place in America in 2017. So if those babies had been born, we would have had 4,853,472 little ones here rather than the 3.8 million that is in the data that we have. b2000 According to this data, 21 percent of the babies conceived in America’s lives are ended by abortion, Mr. Speaker, and I am seeing an administration that is moving around on the side of life. I am seeing a society that is moving along on the side of life. I am watching the 4–D ultrasounds where now we can hear the heartbeat and we can watch them move and squirm in the womb. I am encouraged that America’s society and America’s civilization is moving toward the side of life. Eventually, we will see the end of Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. We will get there, Mr. Speaker. And the work that is done by Mr. SMITH and others and, thankfully, the President and the administration get us closer to that day. Mr. Speaker, I applaud this decision, and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for this Special Order hour. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, it is now an honor and privilege to introduce a former member of the Colorado General Assembly and a member of the House Armed Services and Natural Resources Committees, DOUGLAMBORN . Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s leadership. The Trump administration is set to announce proposed regulations regarding the title X family planning funding stream, very similar to Reaganera rules, to clearly separate family planning from abortion services. This is good news and something I have been strongly urging President Trump and Secretary Azar to do. I think it is important to remind ourselves of something very basic: Family planning should determine when to begin new lives. Abortion ends lives. Abortion should never be considered an ethical method of family planning. Under the new proposed rule, counseling or referral for abortion would no longer be required for family planning grantees, and colocation with abortion providers would no longer be allowed. The Trump administration is doing the right thing, as President Reagan did, to ensure that taxpayer money goes to family planning centers that are not in the abortion business. For too long, Planned Parenthood has used title X as their personal slush fund. I will continue to work to find legislative solutions to end taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, but until we are able to get legislation through the Senate—and we have gotten it through the House—this will be a significant step forward. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Trump administration. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, DOUGLAMALFA is the distinguished gentleman representing California’s First District. He serves on the Committees on Agriculture and Natural Resources. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ). Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) and the rest of my colleagues who have spoken up here as well. This is a great opportunity to, I think, shed light on some truth on what this really means with title X, what has gone on in the last couple decades, really. The proposed Protect Life Rule used to be the way of doing business in this country for the way funding would be directed to those providing health services. In recent years, a significant portion of that has been now allowed to go towards those who are providing abortions. A key element to always remember is abortion is not family planning. This rule we are talking about here that I urge President Trump to move forward with would draw, indeed, a very bright line between abortion and family planning, as was clearly intended in the statute. Currently, 266 Planned Parenthood abortion centers are also funded under Federal title X locations. So what is the general opinion of the public on this? Nearly twothirds of Americans do not believe that their dollars should be funding abortions. America’s taxpayers don’t want this. They don’t want to be complicit in it. They don’t want to be a part of it. So what is the effect? Family planning funding will not be reduced by a single dollar. It is just which services will be provided by which locations is the question here. The Protect Life Rule would not decrease title X funding by a single dollar but, instead, will be directing those dollars to the sites willing to comply. Less than 500 of the roughly already 4,000 title X services under the current rule are Planned Parenthood facilities, less than 500 out of 4,000. So for those claiming that only Planned Parenthood provides these, in some cases, so called services, there are plenty of those places that are already doing that without Planned Parenthood’s help. Indeed, this will provide more opportunities for women and girls to find locations that will provide health services with the dollars going where they are so desperately needed—rural America, especially. It doesn’t have to be just Planned Parenthood, as we would hear so much from the other side of the aisle who desperately defends them at every turn. Clintonera regulations allowed funding for abortion centers and required all grantees under title X to refer for abortions. What about those centers and those facilities that have a conscience on this issue? They don’t want to have that. We are going through that in California right now. It is going in front of the Supreme Court, whether it is right or not or constitutional to force prolife centers to refer for abortions. Clintonera regulations require that as well. 
In the new Protect Life Rule being put forward, I hope President Trump and his administration follow through on it to help protect those freedoms to decide if those centers want to be part of that or not. Indeed, centers that don’t promote and push abortion will be the ones that come forward and receive this type of funding that is so necessary and the right thing that the American people and the majority want to see happen. So I commend this effort. I commend the administration for contemplating and pushing through with this. I thank my colleague, Mr. SMITH, for always being that strong voice for what is right. Well done, sir. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for his eloquence and his principled and very courageous stand. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. CLARKE ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to anchor the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. I would like to thank the Congressional Black Caucus chairman, CEDRIC  RICHMOND , for his leadership in this effort. For the next 60 minutes, we have an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus and the millions of constituents whom we represent. Tonight’s Special Order hour topic is gun violence and gun violence prevention. Mr. Speaker, how many more lives? Mr. Speaker, there are 13,000 gun homicides a year in the United States. On an average day, 96 Americans are killed by guns. Sadly, our children are not untouched by this senseless violence. On an average day, seven children and teens are killed with guns, and since 2013, there have been 311 school shootings. Kyle McLeod; Angelique Ramirez; Chris Stone; Jared Black; Kimberly Vaughan; Sabika Sheikh; Cynthia Tisdale; Glenda Ann Perkins; Shana Fisher; Christian Garcia. On Friday, eight children and two of their teachers were slaughtered during the early morning hours of the schoolday, and those were their names. Many students thought it was a drill when a fellow student wearing a ‘‘Born to Kill’’ shirt opened fire at his school. Throughout the weekend, witnesses and survivors recounted the sheer terror of the shooting and its frenzied aftermath. This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. Enough is enough. We know that there are ways to reduce gun violence in our communities and in our schools. There are solutions. Today, the movement is being led by young people from around our country, including the Ninth Congressional District of New York that I am honored to represent. In April, I met with students from March for Our Lives NYC. In my hands are the postcards. I have nearly 100 letters from my constituents calling for us to take up some of these solutions. My constituents are calling on me, their Representative in this esteemed body, and upon all of us to do something now. One student wrote: We shouldn’t have to be marching for this. Children are dead, lots of them. Do something. Anything. 
‘‘Please help,’’ wrote another. Mr. Speaker, that meeting was nearly 2 months ago, and this President and this Congress have done absolutely nothing. Since the Parkland shooting, countless numbers of children have died in their schools and in their communities because of our inaction. Our inaction puts our children in danger. One student wrote: 
It is time to serve the American people and not the gun lobby. 
One teacher stressed the need to protect kids and staff. Another said: 
Schools and teachers need more funding for books, salaries, social support programs, and counseling, not more guns. 
One letter came from someone who had actually been shot: 
One in three people in the U.S. knows someone who has been shot, and I am one of them. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, am a survivor of gun violence. While serving in the New York City Council during the year 2003, all colleagues were coming back from a recess period, and we were excited to see one another. One of my dearest and closest colleagues, the Honorable James E. Davis, came to work that day as we all did, excited about doing the work for the people of the City of New York. Unfortunately, James E. Davis had befriended his assailant. His assailant walked into the chambers of the New York City Council and unleashed a violent attack on Mr. DAVIS that took his life. That attack took place in the workplace in front of all his colleagues. To this very day, I need to just close my eyes, and I can transport myself back into that moment where members had to scramble to the floor, where members ran out of the chambers and barricaded themselves in the speaker’s office waiting to be rescued, not knowing whether we were being attacked or it was a lone assailant, not knowing whether our colleague would survive or whether he would perish. Mr. Speaker, since 2003, we have continued to see senseless death due to uncontrolled unwillingness in this body to do what we know we can do: to do background checks, to make sure that we provide a pathway for those who have mental health concerns to receive treatment, and to ban AK–47s and AR– 15s. If you are 18 and have to be registered to drive in the United States of America, you should also have to be registered to carry a firearm. We know there are plenty of stories of gun violence that are not shared on the House floor, and many more receive no media coverage. The gun epidemic has hit underserved communities of color particularly hard. Gun homicide rates in these neighborhoods have reached a critical point, where homicide rates often reach 10 times the national average. b2015 While gunrelated deaths have fallen in New York, in parts of my district, the death toll has risen since last year. In Brownsville, Brooklyn alone, murders are up. Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a national crisis. Urban violence has too often been left out of the national conversation about guns, gun running, and gun trafficking, and instead, too often, the epidemic in urban centers is used by many as a misguided, misdirected distraction so that our conversations on gun reform, racial justice, or police tactics are disregarded. But gun violence intervention programs have been shown to be effective at breaking the cycle of violence and impacting communities. The question is: Will Congress truly get serious about supporting these programs? Will we get serious about universal background checks? Will we get serious about limiting access to weapons of war? Nine out of 10 Americans agree that we should have universal background checks, including three out of four NRA members. But this Republican Congress has shown to be spineless. In the East Room of the White House, the President expressed his solidarity with the people of Santa Fe and said his administration would do everything in its power to protect schools and keep guns away from those who should not have them. Just earlier this year, he also vowed to take action after the Parkland shooting. At that time, the President said he would look at stricter background checks and raising the minimum age for buying an assault weapon. But Donald Trump did not press for 
any action on any of those initiatives. Lies, once again, to the American people. Congress did not follow through. Shame on us for our inaction. We are well past time for action, Mr. Speaker. The time is now. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Second District of Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ) to address this Special Order hour of the Congressional Black Caucus, our chairman. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Congresswoman CLARKE from New York for those very insightful and passionate words. Just a few moments ago, we listened to Republicans talk about the sanctity of life and how they want to protect everyone. They will protect anyone, as long as they don’t have to go up against the NRA. What we have here is, we are protecting our children. We always say our children are our future. We should act like it. This weekend, I was speaking at Baker High School’s graduation and I realized that while we were celebrating those 139 kids’ graduation, there were families from Santa Fe that were preparing homegoing celebrations for their children. Dr. King once said that there comes a point where silence is betrayal. We have passed that point in this body, in this Congress, a long time ago. Our silence is betraying our future. It is betraying our children. It is betraying their parents. So, when we take a moment of silence and we ask to pray, let us not pray to end school violence. Let’s pray for the courage to actually do something about it. I know all my friends on the right like to claim they are the Christian right. But if they were the Christian right, they would pray for some courage and they would do something. But there is an old gospel song that says: ‘‘Lord, don’t move my mountain. Give me the strength to climb. ‘‘Lord, don’t move my stumbling blocks, but lead me all around.’’ What it is saying is: Lord, give me the strength to fight my battles. Give me the strength to help myself. So, if we are going to pray as a body, if we are going to pray as a Nation, we should be praying that this body musters up some courage to do something about it. I am not saying that there are not any good suggestions on the other side. I am saying they won’t address the hard suggestions about access to highcapacity cartridges, guns that shoot over and over and over and over again. I am talking about weapons of mass destruction in our community. We don’t have to go look in Iraq or Afghanistan for weapons of mass destruction. Go look at your nearest sporting goods store, your nearest pawn shop. We are selling them right here in this country. Everyone doesn’t have to get a background check. So I would just say that the time is now. The time was yesterday. I will just leave the body with this fact. When we had more people killed in school shootings than we have lost in the military this year, that should say something about this country, that should say something about where we are headed, and I would just hope that the two sides could come together, although I don’t have much belief that we will get action from the other side until the NRA gives them a permission slip. But our children are far too fragile. When our children start to believe that this is the norm, as opposed to the exception, we all need to go home and take a look in the mirror and say that this is not about the next election. We should muster up the courage, because this is absolutely about the next generation. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for those very thoughtful words. I hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will heed his admonition because, indeed, action needs to be taken, and it needs to be taken now. Without further ado, it is my honor and privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from the Second District of Illinois, Ms. ROBIN KELLY , who has been an ardent defender, an outspoken advocate for gun violence prevention. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Congresswoman CLARKE  leading this gun violence session. I will tell her, it is sickening to me that I am here again. I cannot believe I have been here 5 years and we have not brought one gun violence prevention piece of legislation to the floor. There is legislation that a variety of people want to bring to the floor, but for some apparent reason, Speaker RYANand Speaker Boehner before him, I guess they don’t care enough about our kids dying not only in schools, not only in mass shootings, but dying in the streets of various cities in our Nation. It is absolutely ridiculous. American children are being massacred. They are being massacred in city parks and in classrooms, at movie theaters, concerts, and even in their car seats, because of this Congress’s criminal—that is what I said, criminal—inaction on gun violence. Last week, instead of debating broadly supported legislation to ensure a background check on every gun sale, we spent hours debating a deeply flawed farm bill that would take food out of the mouths of hungry American children. I don’t think we care about children in this Congress, at least my colleagues on the other side. This disaster of a farm bill failed because it didn’t meet the needs of American farmers and families, just like we are failing to meet the needs of American families on gun safety. Mr. Speaker, couldn’t we have better spent our time debating and advancing a bill to save lives? Shouldn’t we be more interested in protecting the lives of American children? Instead of working to take food away from hungry children, perhaps we should work to take guns away from dangerous individuals. Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say last week’s events in Santa Fe, Texas, were unusual. I wish I would say this never happens, that it that was unusual or a freak accident. But that is not true. In fact, one of the young ladies said she was not surprised. It has been happening all over and she knew it would come to her school. That is an absolute shame that that young lady said that. I wish I could say that about Palmdale, California, or Mobile Alabama; Parkland, Florida, or Raytown, Missouri. But I can’t and I won’t because, again, it is not true. School shootings are no longer unusual, no longer shocking. They happen nearly every week in our Nation. It is only May 21 and we have already had 22 school shootings this year. Twentytwo school shootings in a matter of 5 months. Yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle see no problem with this. The GOP offers thoughts and prayers, but nothing in the order of solutions or actions. Do you hear what the people are saying? They don’t want any more thoughts and prayers. They shun TV and radio interviews about this crisis, while mothers and fathers cry themselves asleep in an empty house. They speak about investing in mental health and expanding school security, while people who should never have guns walk into gun shows and walk out with the latest in militarygrade weapons. They produce a budget that really takes away from mental health. We are better than that and the American people certainly deserve better than that. Every single day, Mr. Speaker, there is a mother burying her child because of gun violence. Every single day, dreams of college, a career, and a family get packed into tiny pine boxes because of House Republicans’ gross negligence and inaction. One thing is crystal clear: While the House majority may not have pulled the trigger, it is a blind embrace of inaction that makes it just as guilty— guilty for the murder of Bailey Holt, 15, in Benton, Kentucky; guilty for the murder of Jaelynn Willey, 16, in Lexington Park, Maryland; and guilty for the murder of Martin Duncan, 16, of Chicago, Illinois. Mr. Speaker, you have heard us say it over and over: How many more? When is enough enough? How much more guilt will you bear? How many more times will we hold moments of silence with no followthrough on action? When will this Congress have a fraction of the courage that Scott Beigel showed at Parkland? When will House Republicans follow the example of Victoria Leigh Soto in Newtown and actually protect kids’ lives? When will Speaker RYANshow the slightest bit of courage that Aaron Feis had? 
Instead of finding the courage to act, this House, this Speaker, the majority have stood on the sidelines while kids die, and all because of those big, fat NRA checks and because they don’t have the courage. That is disgusting and it is wrong. As we look to assign responsibility for these mass shootings, as we ask ourselves: Why all the violence? Where did it come from? As we ask ourselves: Why does this keep happening? We need to look no further than Longworth 1233, Speaker RYAN’s office, for the responsibility of inaction, the responsibility of omission, and the responsibility of being too beholden to the NRA to save lives, instead of beholden to the people of this country, to the mothers and fathers who have lost their kids, to the future kids going to school. When will it end? Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for her words and for really laying out the framework for which this Congress needs to act. She said that it is a shame and a disgrace. I agree wholeheartedly. But I think that even more, our Republican colleagues need to search their souls, particularly those who claim to be of the Christian faith, which is the faith that I practice. Indeed, they are going to be called to account for their inaction. All I would ask is that the Lord have mercy on their souls, because there is blood on their hands. Mr. Speaker, having said that, I yield to the gentlewoman from the Third District of Ohio, Mrs. JOYCE BEATTY , an outspoken advocate, one who comes from a State where, again, gun rights are something that people pride themselves in. Commonsense gun measures are something that everyone is crying out for. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York, but more importantly, I thank her for anchoring tonight’s message against gun violence. Mr. Speaker, I come here tonight with a heavy heart. I don’t have a written script, but I was so touched when I listened to Congresswoman CLARKE ’s opening statement and then when my classmate and colleague, Congresswoman ROBIN KELLY , spoke. b2030 I wanted to come tonight because I want everyone listening to us to know to ask the question, Mr. Speaker: Why are we lagging behind? To ask the question: When are we going to do more than one moment of silence when there has been an unnecessary shooting? We do it when there is national attention. But what happens when that young person in their backyard, what happens when that person is killed by a gun in their home? All lives matter, Mr. Speaker. So, tonight, our message is clear. Americans have asked us to do something. I had the opportunity to witness thousands and thousands and thousands of young folks who came together to March for Our Lives because this is their way of life, and they felt that they should do something, and they did. And at the end of the program in the Third Congressional District, they looked to us as leaders and said: What are you going to do for us? What are you going to do about this? So I thought about it, and I went to my office, and I thought maybe I can take all of these commonsense gun laws and roll it into a bill that is called the Safer America for Everybody Right Now Act. It won’t solve the entire problem, but this is what we are called to do. We are called to come here and try to make a difference. We come to this floor just tonight talking about saving lives, talking about how much we care for families. We run on a platform of caring about our children and family and saving lives, and, yet, we come here and can’t get a piece of legislation put before the Congress to vote on it. Mr. Speaker, that is not right, and it is not fair, and the American public deserves more. Lastly, let me just say, I can remember sitting in that church when nine innocent churchgoing lives were taken. I can remember going to Ferguson and being at the site where a young African American boy’s life was taken with a gun. I can tell you about being with the mothers in the movement and the pain and the agony in their voices when they talked about the loss of their child. I was here as a freshman with Sandy Hook, and you know, I was at the nightclub in Florida. What more does it take, Mr. Speaker, than us coming here tonight asking you to do more than sit in that chair; asking you to put fair legislation on this floor so we can vote on it? That is my ask tonight. Please support some of the bipartisan legislation that we have. Please look at putting funds in for mental health. Just do something to help us have a safer America now. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ) for bringing her plea to the floor. She is absolutely correct. The inaction of the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the matter of gun violence in America is appalling. So we call on him to bring bipartisan legislation to the floor. We have the votes to pass it. The question is: Do we have the will? Do we have the spine? Do we have the courage to do what needs to be done in the 21st century to protect our communities from this onslaught of gun violence? Having said that, it is now my honor and my privilege to to yield to my coanchor to share his thoughts with us this evening, none other than the gentleman from Pennsylvania, DWIGHT  EVANS . Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman CLARKE , for leading this critical Special Order to speak about the national epidemic of gun violence, an important topic to all of us. Sadly, though, Mr. Speaker, it seems that most Members only need to dust off their talking points from the last mass shooting, which was in Florida at Parkland. As the Grammywinning artist, Kelly Clarkson, noted over the weekend, the same script plays out: vigils are held and the dead children are in our thoughts and prayers and life goes on, with most of the rest of us hoping and praying that our loved ones will not become a victim. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. The same old script, which we play the same old game over and over again, we have these vigils, we come to this floor, we make these prayers, and the reality of it is, we hope and pray that someone will not become a victim. Yet nothing gets done because the GOP leadership refuses to do anything about gun violence. The Black community is at a critical time because we have a lot to lose, because too many of our neighborhoods, unfortunately, have been subject to gun violence at a consistent rate, crimes which often goes unpunished because of unreliable and reluctant witnesses. And the same President who asked what do we have to lose, twitters away his time in a tunnel. It seems like he has no conscience when it comes to these children dodging bullets, because he does nothing but cower and duck responsibility. On February 14, this Nation once again witnessed a horrific tragedy that took place at a high school in Florida. Seventeen lives were taken at the hands of a gunman with too much firepower. And now, another shooting, 3 months later after Florida and 7 months after Las Vegas in October. The horror and the tragedy that shook the Florida high school should have been the last. Yet, tragically, our Nation has lost too many loved ones at the hands of gun violence, at the point where we often see the same reaction: hand wringing, blaming going around, but nothing is being done to stop the violence. And now in a small town in Texas, it is being done again. The city of Philadelphia knows all too well the lives lost at the hands of gun violence. In 2017, we saw our city experience its largest homicide epidemic since 2012. There were over 317 homicides in Philadelphia, according to data from the Philadelphia Police Department. And with the continued surge of gun violence in Philadelphia, last year I handed a letter to the Pennsylvania attorney general, Josh Shapiro, outlining our Commonwealth needs to use all resources possible to advocate for commonsense gun reform. Since I handed that letter to our Commonwealth’s attorney general, we have had more heartbreak in America, 
including the unspeakable tragedy at a church, a place of worship and refuge in Texas, and a mass shooting at a concert in Las Vegas, Florida, and now Texas. Too often these tragedies occur because there is unimpeded access to guns. There are over 300 million guns in America. Most are owned by law abiding citizens without harmful or dangerous intent, yet a gun in the wrong hands can lead to the horrific situations witnessed most recently in Las Vegas, Texas, and Florida. Nearly 1.7 million children live in a home with a loaded, unlocked gun. Every year, thousands of kids are killed by firearms as a result. Our goal here in Congress must be to make sure our communities and our churches and our children are safe. When we hear from the President on these matters, you listen to a voice that does not sound like the Commander in Chief or the soother in chief, but a President who, frankly, does not understand his job and too often lacks empathy, which was the case shown last week. We are in the business of doing no harm. As elected officials, we are here to help move our neighborhoods forward, not backwards. I stand before you today to tell you, just as I have always done, I will continue to advocate for commonsense gun reform to keep everyone in our neighborhoods safe. It is evident that we must do more than the current status quo. I say to you, Mr. Speaker, today, under the leadership of our chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and the leader of this Special Order, Congresswoman CLARKE , that we are determined—we are determined to stay as long as we have to and continue to be in everyone’s face about this issue. Enough is enough. You have heard Members this evening say it about their districts, but it is not just in our districts. It is all across the country. Enough is enough. We all have to collectively recognize that this is not Democrat or Republican, but this is about the people in America. So, Mr. Speaker, I say to you and to my colleague, who is leading this effort—and I thank her for showing the kind of leadership that is necessary in this effort, and she is doing a fantastic job in the great State and city of New York—in Brooklyn, that is. I want to make it very clear. She is leading this effort. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for his words of wisdom and for his statistical data. And just to add to the conversation is that we have not counted those who were injured in all of these gun violence episodes across this Nation, those who have been traumatized by exposure to such carnage that is unfolding right before their very eyes. There are individuals in hospitals right now, as we speak, trying to recover from the most horrific gun violence that has ever hit their communities. We don’t know that all of them will heal, and, you know, this should be motivation to everyone in this Chamber to act. We are all just a moment away from a tragic occurrence. And as a matter of fact, it wasn’t that long ago that our colleagues were set upon at a Congressional Baseball Game practice. It boggles the mind. You have to ask yourself, where is the sanity when individuals who were gunned down at a Congressional Baseball Game practice have not mustered up the courage to bring a bill to the floor? Unbelievable. Unforgivable. Having said that, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, ALMA ADAMS , the 12th District, who is an advocate as well for commonsense gun measures in this Nation to come and bring her comments at this time. Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York and the gentleman from Pennsylvania for organizing this event tonight. Thank you for allowing me some time. Like many of my colleagues, I have come to the floor to speak on this topic too many times. In the last year, we witnessed dozens of school shootings, and each time we say it is too soon to discuss a solution to the violence. Instead, we call for a moment of silence. Mr. Speaker, it is not too soon, but it will soon be too late. Thoughts and prayers and silence, they just aren’t enough. We need action, and we need it now. In 2018, there have been more than 20 school shootings, which have resulted in more deaths than lives lost in military combat. Students and their parents shouldn’t have to wonder whether they are safe in school. They shouldn’t have to fear going to school. As a grandmother and mother and retired educator, that shocks me. As an American, that infuriates me. It is time Congress has the moral courage to act. Like Fannie Lou, I am sick and tired of being sick and tired of the same old 1 minute, 1 minute, 1 minute rhetoric. We owe the students and families of Santa Fe and Stoneman Douglas and Sandy Hook and Columbine and all of our children all over this country so much more. No more executions. Let’s pass some legislation to help end this tragic epidemic immediately. We must not wait. Our Nation can’t wait any longer and our children can’t either, so let’s do the right thing because it is the right thing. You know, the time is always right to do what is right. b2045 Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the 12th District of North Carolina, the Honorable ALMA ADAMS , for bringing her comments to the floor. At this time, clearly across this Nation, we represent very different districts, but there is one thing that we all have in common, and that is a reverence and a real concern about the human condition; and the fact that here we are, once again, coming to the floor to plead with the leadership of this body to bring commonsense gun violence prevention laws to the people of this country. We won’t stop until that occurs. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ), an outspoken advocate, who has done everything within her power to bring a voice to the voiceless, particularly those who are trying to come to grips with the violence that is unleashed in this Nation, and the lack of action coming from the leadership here in the House of Representatives. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for leading us in this Special Order hour on such an important topic. It is safe to say that we are past the point of enough is enough because, apparently, enough is not enough. Every time we face down another mass shooting, we have another moment of silence. The United States has more gun deaths than any other developed nation, and it has far higher levels of gun ownership than any other country in the world. The U.S. has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data. Mass shootings constituted less than 2 percent of gun deaths in 2013. However, the U.S. makes up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, but holds 31 percent of global mass shooters. We can go on and on and on and on and on with statistics. We know what researchers have found. Researchers have found that when there is commonsense gun safety legislation, the number of deaths associated with guns decreases. We know that there was a 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published by Epidemiologic Reviews, which found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence, a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives. Since 2012, there have been 46 moments of silence on the floor of the House of Representatives addressing the tragic deaths in mass shootings. And what have we done? We get up for 46 moments of silence and we do nothing. I have but a few comments left, and I would like to direct those comments to the chair behind the microphone because the person that holds that chair holds all of the power in determining what our agenda will be in this House. The person who sits in that chair makes a determination whether or not we value those innocent lives we are losing every single solitary day because people who shouldn’t have guns have access to guns, or whether or not we should just have one more moment of silence. And it is the person who sits 
in that chair that is the biggest problem between doing what makes sense, what people expect from us, what we need to be doing, and doing nothing. I am the grandmother of a 5yearold child. She will be going to public school for the first time in her life. When her father went to school, they had fire drills. When she goes to school, she will be having active shooter drills. Do you have any idea what that means to a next generation; what that will do to their mind, their personal sense of security? They won’t even want to go to school because they will be afraid that they will not be protected. The person sitting in that chair right now can give us an opportunity to respond to the majority of the people in this country and bring before this House commonsense gun safety legislation. There are hundreds of bills in the hopper, languishing to be brought up. We don’t have the courage. No, not we. I have the courage. My colleagues, in my caucus, have the courage. The person who sits in that chair represents the majority of the Members in Congress, and they have demonstrated that they lack the courage, the will, or the desire. But do you know what? The next child who experiences death at the hands of someone who shouldn’t have a gun could very easily be one of their children. We better get sensible about what we are doing. Screw the NRA. They are screwing us. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for those comments. I feel her sense of frustration, I feel her outrage, and I think many Americans—as a matter of fact, the majority of Americans—do when they hear the outcries of the parents who have learned that their children have been gunned down in school; when they see their children on lifesaving equipment in hospitals because they are hanging on to life by a thread; when they see their children duck down under their beds because they hear a car backfire, having flashbacks from the trauma they experienced in school, hearing mass gunfire taking place before their very eyes; when they don’t want to go to school because they remember the rivers of blood that they witnessed as children and teachers’ lives were being sucked out of them, due to the gun violence that was unleashed in a place that is supposed to be safe for them to learn, to grow, and to mature. Mr. Speaker, we can’t hear you. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), someone who the Congressional Black Caucus looks to for a lot of our legislation when it comes to criminal justice, and when it comes to understanding the role that we can play in advancing progressive legislation. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak on this very important issue, and I thank her for leading this Special Order on this important topic, which is gun safety, especially as it relates to school safety. Keeping all students and educators safe is a top priority. On Friday, we had another tragedy. A small town that few could point out on a map is now infamous. Santa Fe High School, near Galveston, Texas, experienced a mass shooting, leaving 10 dead: Eight students, two teachers. Several students said to the media, they knew this would eventually happen to them. Our thoughts and prayers are with those students and with the families suffering from acts of gun violence, but enough is enough. This shooting marks at least 16 shootings in schools just this year. Using the same metrics, there have been hundreds of school shootings since the April 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado: Marjory Stoneman Douglas; Sandy Hook; Columbine; Virginia Tech; and now Santa Fe. We watch, year after year, as students and educators lose their lives to gun violence, both in and out of school. Yet, in the decades since Columbine, Congress has taken virtually no action. Instead of ignoring these tragedies, Congress must have some hard conversations about guns, about mental health, about bullying, and about policies that contribute to the schoolto prison pipeline. And more than just conversation, Congress must act with policies built on evidencebased research, not slogans and sound bites. We all agree that we must do all that we can do to protect our students and prevent violence of all forms, including gun violence. In the wake of Columbine, the knee jerk reaction was to put more police in schools, invest in security infrastructure such as metal detectors, and turn our schools into fortresses. The research, based on such policies, is clear that more guns and schools built like Fort Knox will not make our students and teachers safer, and likely will negatively impact vulnerable students. There is evidence that with more police in schools, they will be more likely to arrest the children than to protect the children. After Columbine, we passed legislation providing services for those caught up in the juvenile justice system, but, unfortunately, over the years, that funding has evaporated. After Sandy Hook, no action was taken either. The Democratic Gun Safety Task Force made a list of recommendations of actions we could take, like an assault weapons ban, limiting the size of magazines, closing loopholes in background checks, more investments in mental health, and funding evidencebased policies that reduce crime. Unfortunately, no action has been taken on this list of initiatives. Yet, we have seen virtually no action, even after the situation in Parkland, Florida. Instead, we have seen calls to arm teachers, allow racial discrimination in the name of safety, and equip every school with more armed police officers. These measures have created a culture of fear and anxiety that actually makes the schooltoprison pipeline worse, and it does nothing to increase school safety. We know what needs to be done to address school shootings. We need to equip our school leaders, teachers, and parents with the resources necessary to ensure access to schoolbased mental health services; we need to prevent bullying and harassment; and we need to achieve safe and welcoming learning environments for all students. Comprehensive and collaborative interventions will help address school violence, improve school climate, and keep students safe. Students desperately need the staff and resources to better meet the mental health needs of students. We must invest in hiring more school counselors, psychologists, and social workers. Traumainformed care is a framework that helps all stakeholders recognize the signs of trauma and provides training on how to support children coping with trauma. And we need proactive, not reactive, approaches to handling school discipline. Unfortunately, far too many schools today do not utilize the prevention interventions and, instead, rely heavily on suspensions and expulsions. The evidence is clear: the overuse of exclusionary discipline and the disparate treatment of students of color and students with disabilities robs our most vulnerable students of the opportunity to learn and to achieve. In 2014, the Obama administration released a guidance package that focused on clarifying schools’ obligation under Federal civil rights law to identify and address racial bias in discipline policies and practices. Those guidelines showed localities how to reduce those disparities without jeopardizing school safety. The guidance has recently been under attack from the administration and congressional Republicans, who are actually trying to claim the guidance has contributed to the school shooting in Parkland. Not only is this claim exploiting a tragedy to advance previous priorities, it is also factually false. The guidance package, in no way, required schools to change discipline policies if disparities did not exist; and if the disparities did exist, they were not required to take any action that reduced school safety. Further, the guidance rightly pointed out that research shows suspensions and expulsions are ineffective and, actually, a harmful means of handling school discipline. Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to take action because what we have done so far is not enough. We must enact commonsense gun violence prevention measures, and we must provide resources to educators and students to increase access to mental health services. I hope that as we move forward from yet another tragedy, that we can 
stand together, ready to support our teachers, students, and families with real, evidencebased solutions. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Third District of Virginia, the Honorable BOBBY SCOTT, for those comments. Mr. Speaker, I neglected to mention that he is the ranking member on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and has really brought forth to us the real tangible information that we have about what happens to our young people in school when such tragedies occur, and what all of the fallout and byproducts can be when we institute nonsensical policies, like having teachers arm themselves in the classroom, or the overreliance of law enforcement in the school environment. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for bringing those facts to the floor and really laying out for the American people what it really means for our students to have to experience this violence within what is supposed to be the sanctity of their classrooms. b2100 Having said that, let me just close this evening’s Special Order hour by expressing sort of the collective outrage of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus for the inaction of our Speaker and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the Republican Party who are not stepping up to show courage and determination to really bring an end to what we see as a violent epidemic in our Nation at this time. Our colleague called upon colleagues in the body today to stand with him if they had witnessed or have experienced gun violence in their communities, to stand with the families whose names he read off today of children who perished in Texas. I found it interesting, when I looked at the floor—I didn’t go to the floor because I knew it was just a ploy. But when I looked and saw how many colleagues were standing there with him, I said, if only they brought some legislation to the floor to end all of this, it would pass, because just about every colleague has been impacted by this outbreak in horrible gun violence across this Nation. We need our legislation to be brought to the floor. Not doing so is really an affront to the American people, and it is certainly uncivilized and, some would even say, barbaric, because we have the knowledge, the wherewithal, and the ability to make a difference in the lives of the American people. It is up to us, the people who they have elected, to do the work that must be done on their behalf. Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. Lives are being lost minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, month by month, year by year in America because of the inaction of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH ). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Dr. BURGESS , for all the hours of work. It is not just a lot of fun up there on the Rules Committee, but I appreciate the work on behalf of our Conference. Mr. Speaker, it has been a tragic number of days emanating from Santa Fe, Texas, due south of my home in east Texas, down in RANDY WEBER ’s district. It truly is tragic. It is tragic, as well, when people in this country have become so comfortable persecuting Christians, demeaning Christians, that they put no stock, in fact, belittle anyone’s mentioning of praying for the families or even praying for the country, which is where we have got to be. There is a God. It is the same God that is referenced above my head and behind me, that same God in whom a lot of us trust. It just says: ‘‘In God we trust.’’ That is the national motto, but I guess it would be more accurate to say, ‘‘In God, whom a lot of us trust’’ because of the condescending, demeaning comments made about Christians, about praying. Prayer does work, it does matter, but not when a majority of the country is prevented from discussing Christianity publicly. I mean, this was a country where Christians from different parts of the world fled to. It was a destination, a glorious destination where people could come and live as Christians and not be persecuted, because Jesus himself said we would be hated, but he said: Remember, they hated me first. We were told we would suffer for His sake, and He has certainly shown how brutal that could be. But as the oligarchs in black robes have taken over legislating, executive activities, as well as their own judicial activities, they have walked our country to the brink of despair. They have taken prayer—and I am talking about the oligarchs in black robes, the judges. I was once a judge, felony judge, then a chief justice of a court of appeals, and I know how easy it is to think so highly of oneself. When a black robe is donned, our imperfections are covered up. And by our office, we are supposed to have some higher form of reason than our fellow people. It is just not so. It is not so. People have had it forced down their throats that, when it comes to education, it can’t be education about religion, particularly Christianity. Oh, you can talk about Islam. You can talk about Buddhism. You can give glowing reports about such things and what it takes to believe about the four pillars of Islam, but you don’t dare talk about Christianity, because that is when the courts go nuts, say you have exceeded your bounds. Schools have been told that they need to reinforce in a child’s mind the relativism of different positions, where right to some may be wrong for others, and wrong for some may be right for others. There is no black and white, right or wrong. There is simply relativism. John Adams, in 1797, as our second President of the United States, gave a warning that cries through over 200 years, over 220 years. He said it clearly: This Constitution is intended for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other. He was a very wise man. This Constitution of ours, the one we took an oath to follow here in this very Chamber, it doesn’t work in a country where the people are not taught morality. When John Adams said morality and religion, he was particularly talking about Christianity and JudeoChristian morals as one finds in the Ten Commandments, as symbolically evidenced by the fact that Moses’ supposed likeness directly above and in front of me is the only face of all of those profiles that is full face and not the side, because at one time he was considered to be the greatest lawgiver of all times. At the time, it was the Ten Commandments that were considered to be so vital that those who came before us believed were the greatest laws ever given. But through the oligarchs across the street in black robes, they have said: Don’t mention God. It is okay to use ‘‘Jesus’’ as long as you use it as a oneword exclamatory statement. It is fine to take God or Jesus’ name in vain, that is fine, that is okay, but don’t use it in a statement that you have sincerely with all your heart chosen to follow Jesus. That is just too inappropriate. So Adams, he was right. Whether you call them oligarchs, multiple monarchs, they have helped lead this country in a direction it really didn’t want to go, been ahead of the country forcing us down this road to the dustbin of history. It is just so clear. If you are not going to teach the JudeoChristian morality on which this country was founded, on which the revolution came about—without the churches of the day and the Great Awakening of the 1700s, there would not have been a revolution. Without a Second Great Awakening in the 1800s and some of the churches’ leadership, we would never have seen the end of slavery in America. The world will never see the end of slavery. There will always be slavery in the world, but it is such a hideous form of people mistreating other people, I literally pray that it will not revisit this Nation, this once great Nation. 
I do believe we can be great again, but not when we fail to bow our head in reverence to the God that we once trusted, most of us. b2115 But if we are not going to teach the morality that would lead to a revolution, that would lead to an end to slavery, that would lead an ordained Christian minister to bring about another peaceful revolution of civil rights— read letters from the Birmingham jail. This man, Martin Luther King, Jr., was an ordained Christian minister. It was the biggest part of who he was and whose he was. And as we have removed those things that motivated a country toward freedom and motivated a Nation toward freedom for everyone, and an end to slavery, and then motivating them yet again through the words of the Bible through leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., we are headed in a moral declination that ends in the dustbin of history. I just caught a few things that were said by my colleagues across the aisle before I came up. My friend BOBBY  SCOTT from Virginia indicated something to the effect that the lack of discipline robs students. We have come a long way from the days where students got paddlings. I have been paddled. I was an A student, honor student, head of the National Honor Society. I still got paddled. I had friends on the football team and other athletic teams, who had coaches that cared about them enough to take the time out of their busy schedule, not to give a time out to the offending student, but actually apply the board of education to the seat of knowledge. And I really believe that I had friends, both white and black, in sports that would have headed for prison if not for a coach caring enough to paddle them when they got out of line, even though they were grown; not adults by law, but certainly fullbodied adults. They got them on the path that would lead them away from prison and lead them to being productive. So when we claim, well, we have a Second Amendment right to bear arms, we have a First Amendment, very first amendment we have, a right to freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, but when we have forsaken God and the teachings found in the Bible that were such a foundational part of our Nation’s founding, then the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, don’t work. You have got to give up the freedom of speech because some things you say motivate others to commit acts of violence. So instead of condemning and punishing the violence, we silence the offending speaker, because those days when we defended what others said that we disagreed with them, those appear to be a distant memory. Not only do we disagree with what others say, but we will offend to their death to try to prevent their right to say them. It is a long far cry from the calls during the Revolution often attributed to Voltaire, maybe it was him, maybe it was some other, but ‘‘I disagree with what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it.’’ They thought this would be a country where that could happen. But schools, public schools at least, are not allowed to teach the kind of morality that was taught for at least the first half of our country’s existence. Yes, Thomas Jefferson had slaves. I have often pondered the incredible irony how Thomas Jefferson could have slaves, and yet in the first draft of the Declaration of Independence, put on paper how offensive slavery was and make that as an enumerated grievance against King George for ever allowing slavery to begin here in the United States. That was taken out before the Declaration of Independence was finally agreed to and signed. But the only discussion, it seems, about the Bible in public schools is when it is demeaned and belittled. So are we shocked that there is violence? Yes, we are still shocked. We still grieve for the families that have lost loved ones that will never be there again. Put ourselves in their places. Think what could have been done differently. Well, everybody is pretty safe in this building. Going back to 1998, when two law officers were killed, when it was so easy to come into the Capitol, they were by the majority leader’s office, and one was able to shoot the shooter, though it cost him his life. So we have had metal detectors. We have had people screened to come in here, but not in the schools. It is unfortunate, but if we are not going to teach biblical morality, then to be free, we just can’t be. We have got to give up freedoms of speech, religion, assembly. We have got to give up our right to bear arms. Not only give up our right to keep and bear arms, but we have got to give up our right to keep pressure cookers, our right to have fertilizer that could be used for bombs. We have got to give up knives. It is amazing to me. I went to school in elementary school where we prayed most days, said the pledge of allegiance every day, were not afraid to talk about lessons from the Bible, and I carried a pocketknife to school. There probably weren’t 5, 10 days in all my growing up where I didn’t carry a pocketknife to school. And I just noticed in my bedside stand I have got three knives that belonged to my grandfather that he carried for much of his life, because they didn’t have a problem with kids having knives in school. But when you don’t teach Judeo Christian morality, then you better take people’s knives, guns, anything that might be used as a weapon. Vans. We will have to make it tougher to ever get a van. Maybe have a cooling off period before you can apply for and get a van or something that can run people down. Eventually we will have to have cars that are driverless that only the government can set in motion so that we can protect ourselves and only go where the government will allow us to go. That is where we are headed. And it is where you have to go if you are not going to teach the morality and the religion that John Adams spoke of as our second President in 1797. But that has also seen its way into our Federal Government. It is okay to lie if it helps your political team. It is okay to violate the law if it is for your team. It is okay to violate the Constitution and your oath to the Constitution if you are the head of the CIA or are intelligence and you want to stop the opposing party’s candidate from winning or remove that candidate from office after he has fairly won. This May 12 article from Andrew McCarthy, National Review, he points out that ‘‘The Steele dossier author told Fusion GPS’ Glenn Simpson about a human source. ‘‘Something tells me Glenn Simpson did not make a mistake. Something tells me the cofounder of Fusion GPS was deadon accurate when he testified that Christopher Steele told him the FBI had a human source, i.e., a spy inside the Trump campaign, as the 2016 Presidential race headed into its stretch run. ‘‘When he realized how explosive this revelation was, Simpson walked it back: He had, perhaps, ‘mischaracterized’ what he had been told by Steele, the former British spy and principal author of the antiTrump dossier he and Simpson compiled for the Clinton campaign. ‘‘Simpson gave his testimony about the FBI’s human source at a closed Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on August 22, 2017. He did not try to retract it until the uproar that followed the publication of his testimony on January 9, 2018. The latter date is significant for reasons we will come to. ‘‘Simpson’s testimony on this point is worth revisiting because of a pitched battle between the House Intelligence Committee and the Justice Department. Essential reporting on the controversy has been done by The Wall Street Journal’s Kim Strassel. On Thursday, she related that, yet again, Congress had faced down a DOJ/FBI attempt to stonewall the committee’s probe of investigative irregularities during the 2016 election season—particularly, abuse of government surveillance powers, which the Obamaled agencies used to monitor the Trump campaign. ‘‘Unable to get voluntary cooperation, committee chairman DEVIN NUNES issued a subpoena demanding the Justice Department disclose information by the top secret intelligence source who is said to have assisted the 
Russian investigation. That investigation is now being run by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But more interesting is how it got started. On that question, officials have been surprisingly fuzzy in their explanations, and hilariously inconsistent in their leaks: initially settling on an origination story that hinged on the Steele dossier and a trip to Moscow by the obscure Trump campaign adviser Carter Page; later pivoting to a tale of boozy blathering by an even more obscure Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, when the first story proved embarrassing—the dossier allegations having been unverified when the Justice Department included them in warrant applications to the FISA court.’’ Mr. Speaker, it has become clear to me, as a former judge, that the FISA courts have got to go. For some reason, these judges that have been nominated by a President, confirmed by the Senate, do an okay job when their court proceedings are open, obvious, and they have some accountability, reaction from the American public. But apparently, when they act in secret, they don’t care so much about the Constitution. They have no pride in their own courts so that people can come in, take an oath, lie to them, create a fraud upon the court, and we don’t hear a peep out of those judges. Not one lawyer or witness has been held to account by the courts that they offended by their fraud and deception. b2130 And that includes Rosenstein and, apparently, at least the fourth application to renew the warrant that should never have been issued in the first place—and surely would not have been if the FISA court had not been meeting in secret away from public eyes. Is there any secret this country has that is worth the destruction of our judicial system as we have seen through the fraud and the misrepresentations that have been allowed with no consequence? No offended judge is offended. It tells me that this pitiful little gathering we have allowed to be called the FISA court needs to stop. They are doing more damage to our country than they could ever possibly help by their secrecy. And the more we find out about what has been kept secret, the darker it appears for this country and for our future. We have Brennan and Clapper who perjured themselves multiple times before Congress and didn’t seem bothered by it in the least. And then Brennan makes clear that, if you come up against them, you can do so at your own peril because they have ways of making you pay the price. That is exactly what our Founders were concerned about. The King had his ways, too, King George III. And, apparently, that is the kind of kingdom we have come into here in the 21st century when an opposition campaign for President can pay for a warrant to be issued for no just cause, no probable cause, and no consequences. We have seen the Justice Department, these career people, they weren’t interested in ensuring that justice was done. If they had been, they would have gotten some Republicans to investigate. They were interested in being political to the damage of this country and our judicial system. It has got to stop. Mueller needs to resign, and Rosenstein needs to be fired. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
