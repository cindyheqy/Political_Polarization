Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mackenthun’s Fine Foods in Waconia, Minnesota, for 100 years of business success. At the beginning of the 20th century, August Mackenthun began a family tradition of making homemade sausage. This tradition was commercialized in 1917 when his son, Arthur, bought a sausage maker from Germany and opened Mackenthun’s Meat Market in Waconia. What began as a modest business quickly transformed into a booming success as Mackenthun’s developed a reputation for producing quality meats. Today, the business is run by Kim and Laurie Mackenthun and their family. While it is now a fullservice supermarket, they have maintained the family tradition by offering their signature homemade sausage in the meat department. Congratulations to the entire Mackenthun family for their 100year commitment to the family business, for upholding their longstanding tradition, and for exemplifying the American Dream. We wish you another century of success. A LEGEND LOST  
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and career of a legendary Minnesotan who passed away just last week. Ray Christensen was a renowned sportscaster in the North Star State and best known for his radio playbyplay for the Minnesota Golden Gophers. A nativeborn Minnesotan, Ray grew up in Minneapolis and bravely served our country in World War II. After returning from the war, Ray attended the University of Minnesota where he lettered in baseball. Upon graduation, Ray began his career announcing Gopher football games for WCCO in 1951 and basketball games in 1956. Ray worked for WCCO as a sportscaster until 2001 and was inducted into the Minnesota Broadcast Hall of Fame in 2002. Ray was the voice that we all grew up with. His voice was the one that we listened to every game day, and Minnesota athletics will certainly not be the same without him. I speak for all Minnesotans when I say that he will truly be missed. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Delano Elementary School in my district for being recognized as a Reward School for the fourth time in the past 5 years. In order to be categorized as a Reward School, the school must be in the top 15 percent of the highest performing schools in the State. Delano Elementary School’s updated curriculum, improved physical education program, and new music classes are the best. b1015 A good education opens all of life’s doors, and I would like to thank Delano Elementary School for giving Minnesota students the key. Your dedication to our children deserves recognition, and I am proud to congratulate your work here today. 
HONORING CLINTON COLLEGE AND MORRIS COLLEGE IN CELEBRATION OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as part of the observation of Black History Month, to continue my series of remarks recognizing HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I am asking my colleagues to join me in celebrating Clinton College, in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and Morris College, in my hometown of Sumter. Clinton College was founded in 1894 by the A.M.E. Zion Church, under the leadership of Presiding Elder Nero A. Crockett and Reverend W.M. Robinson to combat illiteracy of former slaves. The institution was named for Bishop Caleb Clinton, then the presiding bishop of the Palmetto Annual Conference of the A.M.E. Zion Church. Originally named Clinton Institute, in 1909, it was renamed Clinton Normal and Industrial Institute, and was authorized to grant State teaching certificates. In the late 1940s, the school was again reorganized as Clinton Junior College, offering various associate degrees in religion and other liberal arts. Still affiliated with the A.M.E. Zion Church, the college has grown and expanded under its current president, Dr. Elaine J. Copeland, who has led the institution since 2002. In 2013, the college, for the first time, was accredited to offer two bachelor’s degree programs, a bachelor of arts in religious studies, and a bachelor of science in business administration. Subsequently, it has changed its name to Clinton College, and enrollment is at a 15year high. For the past 120 years, Clinton College has been providing academic excellence, as well as instilling moral and spiritual growth into their students. The college takes pride in being, and I quote its motto, ‘‘A Beacon of Light for Today’s Scholars and Tomorrow’s Leaders.’’ I thank all of my colleagues for joining me in honoring Clinton College today. Morris College was established in my hometown of Sumter, South Carolina, by the Baptist Educational and Missionary Convention of South Carolina in 1908, to provide religious and educational training to African Americans. Originally, the college featured elementary and high school education, as well as a college curriculum. Its college offered teaching certificates and degrees in liberal arts and theology. In the 1930s and 1940s, Morris dropped its elementary and high school programs and became solely a liberal arts and religious college. Morris’ graduates include First Lieutenant Leroy Bowman, who was part of the original class of Tuskegee Airmen. These AfricanAmerican pilots trained in a segregated complex near Tuskegee, Alabama, and the Walterboro Army Air Field in Colleton County, South Carolina. First Lieutenant Bowman served in World War II, flew 36 combat missions over Germany, and had a decorated service record. He was among 300 surviving Tuskegee Airmen honored with the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007 by President George W. Bush. My mother graduated from Morris College in 1953, when I was 12 years old. My father studied theology at Morris in the early 1940s for 3 years, but was not allowed to finish his studies because he had not graduated high school. Having been born in 1897, in segregated South Carolina, he was not 
allowed to advance beyond the seventh grade. But because he continued to selfteach and study, he was able to pass the college entrance exam. Though he was not allowed to graduate in 1945, as he should have, he was posthumously awarded his bachelor of theology degree 58 years later, in 2003. Having been led by Dr. Luns Richardson for the past 43 years, Morris College has grown to an enrollment over 1,000. Under President Richardson, Morris has established an Army ROTC unit, joined the United Negro College Fund, and has constructed 18 new campus buildings. Reverend Dr. Charles Jackson, president and chairman of Morris’ board of trustees, recently announced that President Richardson will retire this summer, leaving Morris wellpoised for the future. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Clinton and Morris Colleges in celebration of Black History Month. 
RECOGNIZING MARY GROSSE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Mary Grosse, from Tybee Island, Georgia. At 85 years young, she remarkably set a USA Track & Field Masters Outdoor 10K record. She accomplished this during the 2016 Enmarket Savannah Bridge Run, where she finished with a time of 1 hour, 35 minutes, and 59 seconds. Not only did that time win her the 80 to 98 age group, but it also placed her in the top 10 of the women’s 65 to 69 age group. With her passion for exercise, Ms. Grosse has gained local celebrity status on Tybee Island, where the locals greet her as she walks her daily 6mile route. In 1964, Ms. Grosse moved to Tybee Island after working as an FBI secretary in Washington for several years. In 1971, Ms. Grosse and her family opened The Sugar Shack, which is now a staple of the Tybee Island community. Her daily walks, for the past 30 years, have been a positive outlet for her and kept both her body and mind young over the years. Her dedication serves as inspiration for her family and the community. I am proud to congratulate Ms. Grosse on her new record, but also recognize her for her positive attitude, her dedication, and her contributions to Tybee Island. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss how ObamaCare has impacted families in the First District of Georgia. I want to share the story of the Joiner family from southeast Georgia. Bob Joiner is an independent wealth adviser. His wife, Kim, works at a small practice as an audiologist. They have a 28yearold son named Wesley. Bob, Kim, and Wesley are healthy individuals who exercise regularly and eat healthy. Before ObamaCare, the Joiner family’s annual premium was $7,428 for the whole family. At that time, the Joiners had the ability to choose from multiple providers and dozens of healthcare plans. Unfortunately, thanks to ObamaCare, this is no longer the case for the Joiners. In 2016, Bob’s monthly healthcare premium skyrocketed 134 percent, and Wesley’s increased an incredible 190 percent. In total, the family’s 2016 annual premiums were $4,285 for Wesley, and $19,026 for Bob and Kim. Let me repeat that. In total, the family’s 2016 annual premiums were $4,285 for Wesley, and $19,026 for Bob and Kim. The Joiners had hoped to change their plan in 2017 to something more affordable but found only one ObamaCarecompliant plan to choose from. Now, the family worries about their ability to pay down their mortgage and save for retirement because of increasing healthcare costs. And the Joiners aren’t alone. I hear similar stories all the time as I travel the district, because ObamaCare has brought chaos into our healthcare system. Patients in south Georgia and across America deserve better. That is why we are on a mission to resuscitate our healthcare system. f 
CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about one of the consequences of Donald Trump’s refugee ban that has so far been ignored. The day after Donald Trump issued his executive order to ban refugees and all citizens from seven Muslim majority countries, four children from El Salvador landed in Miami International Airport. It is a short flight from El Salvador, but the children had been waiting a long time to come here. In 2015, they applied to come here through the Central American Minors program that was started in 2014 as a safe and legal way for a limited—a very small—number of children from Central America. After submitting to DNA tests, screenings, and a long application process, they were finally given visas, and they were on their way here. However, after landing at Miami and passing through the Customs and Border Protection screening, and on their way to their connecting flight, they were stopped and pulled into a secondary inspection. For six long hours, these children were detained in a cold room without food or water. These children had done everything right, and waited a long time to flee a very traumatic situation. They came here, and their first experience was to be treated like criminals. This is just one example of how Trump’s hasty, harmful executive order is undermining our American values. It is just one more reason why, instead of rewriting it, as he says that he is doing, he should rescind it altogether. But, of course, these children are the lucky ones, the fortunate few who got a chance to come here legally. Many of my colleagues will recall that, in the summer of 2014, thousands of children from Central America arrived at our southern border. Those children were fleeing gangs and violence. Many of them turned themselves in to the Border Patrol. They were not trying to sneak in to our country. They were asking for asylum. They were asking for relief and protection. We knew that if we were going to stop kids from making that dangerous journey to come here, some of them walking over 1,000 miles to our southern border, that we would have to tackle the root causes that compelled them to leave. So the leaders of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, with some help from General John Kelly, came up with a plan to bring some stability to those three countries. And Congress, working on a bipartisan basis, provided some financial support. But even as we make longterm investments in the Northern Triangle, we need to deal with the fact that children from these countries still need our protection in the shortterm. That is why the Obama administration created a few programs to help a very small number of those children. Those children did what we asked them. They didn’t come across our border. They didn’t cross Mexico. They waited in line as they were told, even if waiting in line meant staying in harm’s way. Because of Donald Trump’s executive order, those children now face a very uncertain future. Lost in the media coverage of this order is the suspension of the refugee program, blockage of these vulnerable children as well. I am glad that the judge has stayed the order. I hope that the President will respect the judge’s order. But more than that, I hope that the President will take a real look at all the harm that he has already caused for so many people, including so many innocent children. I hope that he puts an end to his cruel, counterproductive executive order once and for all. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
b1030 RECOGNIZING SMC MANUFACTURING SERVICES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a cuttingedge aerospace and defense company located in the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, SMC Manufacturing Services. 
For more than 30 years, the Coats family has been the epitome of Kentucky ingenuity and progress. In 1978, they began Southland Manufacturing Company, which has evolved into SMC Manufacturing Services, and now employ more than 140 people at its Nicholasville, Kentucky, headquarters. Recently, I had the chance to visit SMC and tour their 45,000squarefoot facility, which helps to build components for the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station, or CROWS. This product is a stabilized mount that contains a sensor suite and fire control software, allowing onthemove target acquisition and firstburst target engagement. This facility has increased by 20,000 square feet in 2016 and has the ability to house more than 300 employees, drawing its employees from counties in the Sixth District and surrounding counties. However, SMC not only supplies companies in Kentucky, but across the United States and abroad. One example of where SMC supports the defense of this Nation is their partnership with Kongsberg Protech Systems, KPS, of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, which is located in the district of my friend and colleague Congressman KEITH ROTHFUS . Today, with more than 15,000 CROWS in service, this weapon system can be found on more than 25 different platforms in the United States arsenal, including the Stryker, MRAP, Abrams, and Amphibious Combat Vehicle. It is a tested, proven system that is relied on by the Army, the Navy, and the Marines. I applaud SMC for being a veteran friendly workplace and a manufacturing company that is proud to employ about an equal number of men and women. I am pleased to support job creating manufacturing companies like SMC and KPS which positively impact States like Kentucky and help to strengthen our national security capabilities while supporting our veterans. 
THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF EL PASO, TEXAS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today out of deep concern about the safety and security of the community that I represent and of this country. El Paso, Texas, the city that I am so fortunate to serve and represent in Congress, happens to be the safest city not just in the State of Texas, but in the entire United States. There are a number of reasons for that: We have outstanding local law enforcement, whether it is the Sheriff’s Department or El Paso City Police, State DPS troopers or Federal law enforcement, Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border Protection officers, and the agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A big part of the explanation for our safety is the fact that 24 percent of the people that I represent were born in another country. They have come to this country to do better, to get ahead, and to contribute to our success and to the American Dream. It is also because everyone in the community of El Paso feels comfortable and safe in reporting crime, in testifying and coming forward—especially in cases of domestic abuse—to local authorities. That is why I am so concerned after I received a call last night from the El Paso County judge, Veronica Escobar, to share with me an incident that happened last week in the El Paso County Courthouse, where a woman, undocumented Mexican national, had gone to the Center Against Sexual and Family Violence out of fear for her life after being abused, she alleged, by her boyfriend. The Center Against Sexual and Family Violence escorted her to the El Paso County Courthouse to receive a protection order. The judge granted that order. But in that courtroom where the judge granted the order were, according to the county attorney, the county judge, and the judge who presided over that trial, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement who escorted the domestic abuse survivor out of the courthouse and into detention and perhaps deportation to Mexico. We will not continue to be the safest city in America. We will not continue to contribute to the safety of the United States and to the State of Texas if people don’t feel comfortable reporting domestic abuse, reporting crimes, serving as witnesses, and working with law enforcement. I urge this President, this administration, to send an unequivocal message to the Federal agents working in El Paso and every single one of our communities that it is imperative for the safety and security of this country and every person who is in this country that we respect all people of all communities regardless of their immigration status. (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:) We are the safest community in the United States because every person in our community feels safe. They feel safe because they can report crime to the authorities; they can report cases of domestic abuse to the authorities. And, through our work together, we are the safest city. We are going to lose this if we can’t continue on this manner. If anyone has a question or problem about this, please contact my office at (915) 541–1400. Somos la comunidad ma´s segura de los Estados Unidos porque cualquier persona en nuestra comunidad se siente segura. Se siente segura porque puede reportar el crimen a las autoridades, pueden reportar los casos de abuso dome´stico a las autoridades. Y trabajando juntos, somos la ciudad ma ´s segura. Vamos a perder esto si no podemos continuar en esta manera. Si alguien tiene pregunta o problema con esto, por favor lla´menos a nuestra oficina (915) 541–1400. Mr. Speaker, if anyone in the community of El Paso is concerned, fears that they will not be able to come forward to report crime or domestic abuse, has a question and wants my help, I want to be there for them. They need to call me: (915) 541–1400. Mr. Speaker, we will continue to be the safest city in America when every member of our community feels safe, can work with law enforcement, and when law enforcement respects every single member of our community. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas will provide a translation of his remarks to the Clerk. f 
THE IMPACT OF REPEALING TITLE X REGULATIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROYBAL ALLARD ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the title X resolution of disapproval that will be on the floor later today. This misguided resolution will limit access to critical healthcare services by allowing States to cherrypick which family planning providers they want to participate in the title X program. Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans rely on family planning clinics for cancer screenings, wellwoman exams, birth control, and sexually transmitted disease screenings and treatment. Eightyfive percent of the people served by these clinics have incomes below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, and 48 percent of them are uninsured. Furthermore, at least half of family planning clinics are located in rural and underserved communities already with limited access to health care. If this resolution passes, politicians in any State or community will be able to interfere with eligible and competent title X providers who care for the most vulnerable and underserved in our country. The only factors that should ever dictate eligibility to provide family planning health services are professional competency and State licensure. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.J. Res. 43 and protect healthcare access for 4 million Americans who rely on the title X clinics for their care. 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS DURING WORLD WAR II The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for 5 minutes. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I include in the RECORD the names of the men and women who died in World War

TEC 5 Daniel Wyatt from Louisiana of the 364 ENGR GEN SV REGT. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, every year when we celebrate and reflect on Black History Month, we learn the stories of some of America’s greatest scientists, actors, writers, entertainers, scholars, workers, and ordinary people who made major contributions to this great country. As a member of the Military Construction, Veteran Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, I want to share the unsung stories of the valiant Black men and women who served their country dutifully during World War II even in the face of adversity. We know about the brave Tuskegee Airmen—Red Tails—who flew fighter and bomber planes during World War II, but many do not know that the Red Tails were only a few of the nearly 1 million African Americans who served during the war. These courageous men and women fought bravely to protect the democratic ideals of freedom and equality. Sadly, the country they served did not live up to those ideals. When they returned from victory in Europe and the Pacific, many did not receive a hero’s welcome because of the color of their skin. My dad, the late Lieutenant Colonel Garvin Tutt, was one of those heroes. He served in the 92nd Battalion in Italy supporting the Normandy invasion, was in World War II, the Korean war, and served in the Army for 25 years. Only recently have the contributions of AfricanAmerican men and women during World War II been recognized as our country has attempted to acknowledge its sad and dark past. That is why I am taking time on the floor today to honor the 138 AfricanAmerican men and women buried in Normandy American Cemetery and the 5 men who remain missing. It is my hope that, by sharing these stories today and entering their names into the RECORD , more people will come to appreciate the sacrifices of these brave men and women who served this country with distinction during World War II. Now, most people know that on June 6, 1944, approximately 2,000 soldiers landed on the beaches of Normandy for what would be a major turning point in the war, but far fewer know that the allBlack 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion served with distinction during the Dday invasions. The 320th was the only Black unit to take part on Dday and the only balloon battalion dedicated to protecting troops from intense German aircraft attacks on Omaha and Utah beaches. This was unique because Black units were usually kept from combat and fulfilled essential support services instead. As part of their mission to protect Allied troops, the men of the 320th implemented innovative ideas to ease transportation to shore of barrage balloons that weighed half a ton. In addition to defending American soldiers during Dday invasions, the battalion also secured its own successful offensive strikes. The battalion’s ingenuity and service was later recognized as an important element of the air defense team by Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was Supreme Allied Commander General at the time. Sadly, no sacrifice comes without the loss of human life. During the Dday invasion, the 320th suffered two casualties. Corporal Brooks Stith and Corporal Henry J. Harris from the 320th are both buried at the Normandy American Cemetery. Each of these men was decorated with the Purple Heart, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal for their valiant service. There is James M. McLean of the 320th, who died on July 16, 1944. He was also buried at the cemetery. African Americans who were buried at the cemetery, the men from the 320th, were buried with their White peers. Even though units were segregated until President Harry Truman changed official Department of Defense policies in 1948, Black and White soldiers who died in Normandy were buried together. At the Normandy American Cemetery, 135 AfricanAmerican men and 3 AfricanAmerican women were laid to rest from 1944 to 1945. Mr. Speaker, there are five Black men who remain missing in action while posted in Normandy. They are honored on the Walls of the Missing at Normandy with more than 1,700 others. While women were not allowed in combat during World War II, three Black women from the 6888th Postal Directory Battalion of the Women’s Army Corps are also buried at the cemetery. They were killed during an accident with a jeep. Now, this was an allwomen, all Black unit that helped process mail in Europe during World War II. They were the first Black battalion deployed after First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and civil rights leader Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune advocated for Black women to join the Women’s Army Corps, the WAC, for nearly a year and a half. The women received basic training and were trained in jujitsu because they were not allowed to carry firearms. They successfully helped clear massive mail backlogs in various cities across Europe. While the women of the 6888th were celebrated for their work in Europe, some historians speculate that inspectors would sometimes give unsatisfactory reviews because of their prejudices. Unit commander Major Charity Adams was courtmartialed once for pushing back when a general threatened to send a ‘‘white first lieutenant’’ to show her how to command her unit. We are indebted to these women for their exemplary work processing mail efficiently to 
keep up the morale of our troops during WWII. But more importantly, we owe them the respect they never received. Mr. Speaker, these men and women lost their lives too soon for a country that hasn’t done a great job of remembering their bravery and their sacrifices. An analysis conducted by the Army showed that the average age of African American service members buried at the NAC is 27 years—the prime age when a young person is starting their life. That is why it is so important for us to remember and tell their stories during Black History Month. As Black History Month continues, I hope my colleagues will consider joining me in honoring their memories by also speaking on the Floor about other allBlack battalions who fought during WWII. As the daughter of a WWII and Korean Veteran, I am very honored to be on the Military Veterans Appropriations Subcommittee to ensure our veterans receive the care and recognition they deserve. Let me close by thanking our MilitaryVeterans Chair, Congressman CHARLIE DENTand then Ranking Member SANFORD BISHOP and then full Committee Chair ROGERS and Ranking Member LOWEY , for their support in the Appropriations Committee and the commission for helping bring these great heroes and sheros to the attention of the American people and by properly recognizing their sacrifices and their legacies. Hopefully this effort will help us locate their descendants and families to and thank them and honor them as part of yes—Black History but of course this is American History that all Americans should recognize and learn from. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chair of our subcommittee, Mr. DENT, Ranking Member LOWEY , Mr. B ISHOP , and you, Mr. ROGERS , for your support in the Appropriations Committee and for the American Battle Monuments Commission’s very dedicated work in helping us bring these great heroes and sheroes to the attention of the American people by properly recognizing their sacrifices and their legacies.

PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. The Psalmist cannot find enough words to express trust in You. Personal experience of Your presence, care, and abiding guidance gives rise to his song: ‘‘O Lord, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer. My God, my rock of refuge, my shield, the fullness of my salvation, my stronghold.’’ Stir in our hearts today Your Holy Spirit. Touch the soul of this Nation, that we may see Your saving work in our work, Your strength behind our weakness, Your purpose in our efforts at laws of justice, Your peace drawing all of us and the world to lasting freedom. You are ever faithful, O Lord, worthy of all our trust. May all that is done in the people’s House be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f

RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER laid before the House the following resignation from the House of Representatives: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , February 16, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: This letter is to inform you, in your role as Speaker, that I have today sent a letter to my Governor resigning my seat in Congress. A duplicate of that letter is attached. I am truly honored that President Trump has given me the opportunity to lead the Office of Management and Budget. The opportunity to work with such a talented and intelligent group of people—in an effort to try to restore our country’s fiscal security—was too good to pass up. It does, however, come at the price of leaving the House. I am thankful for the efforts you made on my behalf in this effort. I am thankful for the leadership you have shown during my time in the House. But, more than all of that, I am thankful for your friendship over the last six years. Working with you—as a Chairman and the Speaker—will forever be one of the highlights of my career. I sincerely hope my resignation is not the end of that relationship. Indeed, I choose to see it as simply the next chapter of our mutual effort to try to serve the nation. All the best. Thanks again. And God Bless. Sincerely, MICKMULVANEY . 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, February 16, 2017. Hon. HENRY MCMASTER , Governor, State of South Carolina, Columbia, SC. DEARGOVERNOR MCMASTER : Earlier today I was confirmed by the United States Senate to serve as President Trump’s Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Assuming this office requires me to resign my position as the United States Representative for the 5th Congressional District of South Carolina. It has been a great honor and personal privilege to represent the people of South Carolina in Congress. The people of my district, and of our state, are some of the nicest, hardest working people I’ve ever met. They care deeply about our state and our nation, and I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to have been able to serve them. However, the opportunity to work directly with the President in his Cabinet to shape our nation’s budget and ensure financial stability for generations to come is a call to service I simply cannot ignore. I am truly honored that President Trump has given me this opportunity. So, in hopes that I can better serve our nation, the President, the people of the 5th Congressional District, and the state of South Carolina, I hereby tender my resignation as United States Representative, effective immediately. Thank you for your service to our state and your continued friendship. Respectfully, MICKMULVANEY , Member of Congress. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of my dear friend, and fellow WSU alumnus, Mr. Gary Petersen. Following his graduation in 1965, Gary began a distinguished career on behalf of our country and notable Washington institutions, such as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Hanford, Energy Northwest, the State Department, and, recently, as vice president of the TriCity Development Council. For 5 decades, Gary has been a devoted advocate for the TriCities, and his efforts have been critical to the area’s growth and development. He is also an unwavering proponent of PNNL and the defense nuclear waste cleanup mission at Hanford. In Congress, Gary has provided me with critical counsel, while generously serving on my Hanford Working Group. His integrity and distinguished career were recognized with his 2013 induction into WSU’s Murrow Alumni Hall of Achievement. I am honored to call Gary a friend, and will be forever grateful for his patriotism and dedicated service to the TriCities and our great Nation. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF BOB OLIVER (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, today I have the personal pleasure and honor of saying a few words about a leader in our community who has dedicated his life to the betterment of others. Bob Oliver is the president and CEO of Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc., which is a healthcare company based in my district in Princeton, New Jersey. Bob’s strategic leadership over the last 7 years has been instrumental in developing a diverse portfolio of marketed products, specifically focusing on neuroscience, cardiorenal, and oncology. He is personally passionate about helping others and those who care for them. He has worked for over 40 years helping others navigate the healthcare system more easily and has publicly addressed mental health stigma, disparity in healthcare treatment, and the future of health care using technology advancements. He has worked closely with local advocacy groups to aid veterans and other individuals struggling with homelessness, mental illness, addiction, and poverty. In addition to being a community partner, through his leadership role at Otsuka, he has been instrumental in driving economic growth in the pharmaceutical sector, as well as creating job opportunities in my State. Most recently, he was featured as one of Ebony Magazine’s Power 100, an esteemed panelist with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, and a featured leader in Forbes Magazine. The journey is just beginning as he closes this chapter in Otsuka and proceeds to move forward in his life. He has made us very proud. We are proud to take this moment to address his accomplishments and to thank him for his lifetime of achievement. We wish him the best of luck and Godspeed. f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF BILL COOPER (Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the life of Bill Cooper. Bill was a leader, innovator, philanthropist, and a friend, and he lived the American Dream. He grew up in Detroit, where he worked as a police officer while earning a degree in accounting. His career in banking brought him to Minnesota in 1985, when he became CEO of Twin Cities Federal. He transformed this small savings and loan into a thriving national bank. Bill worked to ensure that all children also had access to a quality education by founding the Friends of Education, which sponsors 15 schools and serves more than 9,000 children. Bill was a defining force as well in Minnesota politics. He always stood up for conservative principles and served as chairman of the State Republican Party from 1997 to 1999. Bill Cooper left his mark on Minnesota, and he will be deeply missed by all of us who knew him. 
ALL PERPETRATORS OF CHILD ABUSE MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE (Ms. DELBENE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing important legislation to ensure that all perpetrators of child abuse are held accountable. It closes a Federal loophole that wrongly denies justice for some survivors, like Penny Saum from Washington State. Last month, I heard from Penny directly about the horrific abuses she faced at the hands of her father. He was convicted, sentenced to prison, and ordered to pay $5 million in damages. But because he is a military retiree, Federal law has shielded him from paying a cent of the restitution that he owes. It is unacceptable. Congress already passed a law in 1994, holding Federal retirees accountable for abusing a child. Now it is our responsibility to apply the same standard to all perpetrators. I am honored to be working with my colleague from Washington State, Congresswoman HERRERA BEUTLER , to close this heartbreaking loophole. In these challenging times, this is exactly the kind of bipartisan solution we can all work together on. f 
RARE DISEASES ARE NOT A RARE PROBLEM (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the 30 million Americans affected by a rare disease. An astounding 95 percent of rare diseases have no approved treatments or cures. My bill, the OPEN Act, seeks to change that. The OPEN Act provides incentives for drug makers to repurpose major market treatments for rare disease patients. It could open the door for a surge in biotechnology jobs and investment. Most importantly, the OPEN Act would help make sure those suffering from a rare condition can finally find safe, effective, affordable medication. I was inspired to write the OPEN Act after meeting with folks who live with rare diseases, like Ashleigh Pike, Candace Lerman, and Kelly Freeman from Florida. The ideas that shaped this legislation came from those who it will help most, rare disease patients. After all, rare diseases are not a rare problem. The OPEN Act has the potential to bring hope to millions of patients and their families. 
NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the new market tax credits have helped inject new economic viability into my western New York community. The program continues to help revitalize economically distressed cities throughout America; in western New York, more than $300 million in private investment in the past decade that would not have occurred without the tax credit program. Historically and architecturally significant buildings like the Electric Tower and Asbury Hall in downtown Buffalo are buzzing with new residential and commercial life. Most recently, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, the Nation’s first cancer center, opened their new clinical sciences building with the help of the new market tax credit program. I urge my colleagues to support my legislation to make the new market tax credits permanent. 
OBAMACARE IS FAILING PATIENTS (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, many of us have come here to the floor to share with the country and our colleagues statistics and data demonstrating how ObamaCare is failing patients. We have shown the numbers related to skyrocketing premiums and deductibles and reduction of patient choice. Today, I want to share what my constituents are saying about their firsthand experiences with ObamaCare. From comments we have received: My deductible went from $250 to $2,500. Our deductible skyrocketed to double the amount we were paying. Plus, it provided fewer options. Our premiums have skyrocketed. We had few options from plans. We had to switch doctors. We own a pharmacy. We see many with high premiums who can’t afford the very things they need. Cost of insurance keeps going up. It has never gone down. I don’t have insurance. It is too expensive, and I have kids to feed. Mr. Speaker, the status quo under ObamaCare is unacceptable. It would be irresponsible and unethical not to act. Our plan, House Republicans, will bring families relief by repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with reforms that lower costs and expand access to quality affordable health care to all of our citizens. 
b1215 BLACK HISTORY MONTH (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. As an AfricanAmerican woman and a Member of Congress, I know I stand on the shoulders of giants. My election would not have been possible without the efforts of Maya Angelou, Shirley Chisholm, Fannie Lou Hamer, Sojourner Truth, Rosa Parks, and many other sheroes who came before me. These women championed civil rights and women’s rights and fought oppression so that African American women could have a voice in politics. When I was elected, I became the 100th woman to serve in the 114th Congress, the 20th woman in the Congressional Black Caucus, and only the second AfricanAmerican woman to represent North Carolina in Congress. That night was a historic win for women, but it was particularly special for AfricanAmerican women. Shirley Chisholm once said: ‘‘Women must become revolutionary. There cannot be evolution but revolution.’’ At a time when the President’s Cabinet does not include a single African American woman and just one African American woman in the Senate, we are reminded that there is still much work to do. If this administration will not make a place for us, we will make one for ourselves. It is time to stand up, speak up, and make our voices heard. f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING QUENTIN MOSES (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Quentin Moses, a 10th District native, a star athlete, and a dedicated coach who tragically passed away in a house fire this past Sunday morning. I pray and grieve for the family and friends of Quentin, as well as the family of Andria Godard and her daughter, Jasmine, who also lost their lives. Mr. Speaker, Quentin Moses grew up in my home district in Athens, Georgia. He attended Cedar Shoals High School, starting his career as a defensive standout. He went on to play for the University of Georgia, was named firstteam AllSEC on the Bulldogs’ 2005 SEC Championship team. Following that, he spent 4 years in the NFL as a linebacker. He returned to our community in 2012, where he started coaching studentathletes at Reinhardt University in Waleska, Georgia. Mr. Speaker, Quentin’s positive impact on the community was evident by the outpouring of love and condolences by coaches, players, and fans. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to rise and join me for a moment of silence to honor the lives of Quentin Moses and Andria and Jasmine Godard—precious lives lost too soon. 
GENERAL FLYNN (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, this week, after news came out that General Flynn lied to the people and even to the Vice President, Donald Trump was forced to fire yet another adviser because of their inappropriate ties to Russia. That brings the total since he first launched his campaign to at least three. This includes former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who resigned after secret records showed he worked with, and profited from, the corrupt proRussian Government in Ukraine before it was ousted. As we suspected, it turns out that Trump’s campaign was in near constant contact with Russia. Now we ask the questions: Why? Did Trump know? How will these secret talks influence our foreign policy? We deserve answers. Republicans have said that they don’t want to politicize this, and I agree. That is why I support an independent investigation conducted by experts who will provide a more public report. We have a responsibility to the people to unearth the truth. OPIOID ABUSE EPIDEMIC (Mr. MAST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the opioid abuse epidemic continues to worsen across this country. In Florida alone, heroin and fentanyl deaths have risen by nearly 80 percent. Local governments in Florida are responding as best they can with their limited resources, but they cannot solve the problem alone. The 18th District of Florida includes parts of Palm Beach County, where my colleague, LOISFRANKEL , resides, which is one of the hardest hit counties in the State. In 2016, the county received more than 4,000 overdose calls, and there were approximately 500 opioidrelated deaths. Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s veterans are uniquely vulnerable to this crisis. We must never forget our responsibility to these brave men and women to ensure that, when they leave the battlefield overseas, they aren’t left to fight their personal battles here at home all alone. I commend Congress for passing legislation last year to combat this epidemic, but we have to do more. I urge my colleagues to pass the bipartisan STOP Act to crack down on illicit opioid shipments into the U.S., and I also hope that we can continue to work together in other ways to fight this epidemic. Only by working together at the Federal, State, and local government levels can we defeat this terrible scourge that is creating new tragedies daily. 
WE MUST HAVE AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, Russia is an alarming force in the world, a nuclear power with an authoritarian President, menacing our European allies with invasion into Ukraine and threats of incursion into other Baltic states, lifting mass murderer Assad in Syria, interfering in democratic elections around the world and here in our country, and now evidence is mounting that the White HousePutin connections run deep. Michael Flynn’s shady dealings and lies to the Vice President and the public—what did the President know? When did he know it? Answers to these and other questions are critical to our national security. We must have an independent investigation. The American people deserve nothing less. 
DUCKS UNLIMITED’S 80TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ducks Unlimited on its 80th anniversary. Over the past eight decades, Ducks Unlimited has partnered with local communities and Members of Congress to support conservation of millions of acres of waterfowl habitats across North America. As a lifelong outdoorsman, I know the value of these habitats and the benefits that they provide to countless Americans who enjoy these areas for a wide array of recreational and scientific activities. We must ensure the preservation of these habitats for future generations, and I know that Ducks Unlimited will work to ensure this goal for another 80 years. I would like to extend my thanks and congratulations to DU and wish them continued success for many generations to come. 
HONORING MARK HAWKINS (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and congratulate Mark Hawkins, who will retire tomorrow after 29 years as chief executive officer of Altura Credit Union in Riverside, California. After nearly three decades, Mark’s greatest contribution is likely not to the credit union, which grew significantly under his leadership, but to the members of our community who have benefited so much from his commitment to supporting the Inland Empire. Whether it is academia, athletics, the arts, or charitable organizations, Mark has been a fixture in promoting the institutions that define and enrich our community. His work with organizations, including the United Way, the Kiwanis Club, and the University of CaliforniaRiverside, has strengthened our community and expanded opportunities to thousands of Inland Empire residents. I know he will continue that work for many years to come. Once again, I congratulate Mark on his wellearned retirement, and I thank him for his continued service to our community. 
CONGRATULATING QUINCY NOTRE DAME HIGH SCHOOL (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Quincy Notre Dame High School on 150 years of academic excellence and service to the community of Quincy, Illinois. Quincy Notre Dame Catholic High School originally opened as a school serving young women. Mother Caroline and the school sisters of Notre Dame answered the call to meet the growing need for primary studies in 1859. The school opened its doors in 1867 and quickly exploded in growth. Throughout the past 150 years, Quincy Notre Dame has always sought to serve the needs of the Quincy community and adapt to the changing times. QND remains steadfast in its mission to educate lifelong learners in a strong faithbased environment. I am certain that Mother Caroline and her Sisters would be humbled to know their simple act of faith and service resulted in a legacy that has impacted thousands of lives for 150 years. To each educator, administrator, and individual who has helped build Quincy Notre Dame into the stellar institution it is today, congratulations. I wish you another successful 150 years. f 
GENERAL FLYNN, PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND RUSSIA (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, the question that I have heard many times from my constituents deserves to be answered: With respect to General Flynn and Trump campaign aides, what did President Trump know, and when did he know it? How high does this go up? Now he is calling this fake news. Mr. President, this is not fake news. This is real. The American people deserve a transparent, independent investigation into Russia’s involvement with the White House and President Trump. President Trump continually says he wants to protect our national security, but he ignores the real security threats within his administration. Even my colleagues across the aisle would rather focus on taking away health care from millions of Americans and thousands of Nevadans instead of investigating the clear and present danger in the Trump administration. Enough is enough. Protecting our national security is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an American priority. 
GENERAL FLYNN, PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND RUSSIA (Miss RICE of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, Michael Flynn’s resignation and reports of constant contact between Russia and the Trump campaign raise serious questions, and the American people deserve answers. President Trump was informed weeks ago that Flynn lied about his discussions with the Russian Ambassador and might be vulnerable to blackmail. Why did the President take no action until that lie became public? President Trump has reportedly been briefed about contact between his campaign and Russian intelligence officers. Why does he continue to insist that there was absolutely no communication with Russia? These questions cannot go unanswered. We need to put politics aside, do what is right for our democracy, and create an independent commission to fully investigate Russia’s influence on the Trump administration and the Presidential election. f 
GENERAL FLYNN’S RUSSIAN CONNECTION (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to echo concerns by my colleagues. I am concerned, but not surprised, about the growing revelations from the intelligence community of the Trump campaign’s contact with Russian officials. Russia’s involvement in our elections undermines American democracy. General Flynn’s resignation is no substitute for answers to grave concerns and questions over President Trump’s involvement in secret communications with the Russians and Vladimir Putin’s hand in our elections. I believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is not just about leakers, but this is about the Trump Russia ties. We need a full, bipartisan investigation. It is our duty. 
TRUMP’S MUSLIM BAN AND TOWN HALL IN THE DISTRICT (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I hosted a community listening session where my fellow citizens and I listened to the personal experiences of Muslims, refugees, and other immigrants in the aftermath of the President’s Muslim/immigrant ban and ICE dragnet crackdown on Latinos. It was a safe place for Muslims, refugees, and immigrants to come and share their experiences, values, and love for this country, and it provided an opportunity for us to embrace our fellow citizens in love. We insist that these valuable members of our community and their children be able to live without fear, and to thrive. Unlike the Muslim/immigrant ban, the people of Georgia’s Fourth Congressional District welcomed those of all backgrounds and religions and those fleeing persecution and facing war and bloodshed. Trump’s immigration executive order is contrary to our values and dangerous to our security. Americans who respect the Constitution must oppose these kinds of acts, the injustice they represent, and the suffering that they impose upon the innocent. 
b1230 RECOGNIZING PRINCE GEORGE’S COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Prince George’s County Public Schools for achieving a record high school graduation rate. Prince George’s schools are living up to their motto of being Great By Choice. Eight schools have met the goal of graduating 90 percent of seniors within 4 years, including three schools in the Fourth Congressional District: Charles Herbert Flowers High School, DuVal High School, and the Academy of Health Sciences at Prince George’s Community College. Many schools in the Fourth District, including Suitland, Potomac, and Forestville high schools have demonstrated real progress, with graduation rate gains of more than 4 percentage points. Mr. Speaker, these gains have been made possible by the incredible dedication of educators and parents who are focused on policies that improve student success like expanding mentoring programs, effectively using data to target student needs, and emphasizing core reading and math skills. Mr. Speaker, we must prepare students for successful lives and careers once they graduate from high school. That is why I am committed to working during this Congress to ensure every student has access to rigorous, relevant, and resultsdriven career technology education programs to equip them with the skills to succeed in the 21st century. 
STRANGER THINGS (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, like the main characters in ‘‘Stranger Things,’’ we are now stuck in the ‘‘Upside Down.’’ Right is wrong. Up is down. Black is white. The White House deceives the American public for weeks about their contacts with Russia, but an Attorney General who followed her conscience is fired. Executive orders are signed to ban Muslims in order to keep us safe, while top secret national security conversations are held out in the open. President Trump showers praise on a thug like Vladimir Putin, while threatening and bullying our longstanding allies. President Trump signs an executive order to spend $20 billion on a border wall, while Flint, Michigan, still goes without clean drinking water. Mr. Speaker, mornings might be for coffee and contemplation, but Chief Jim Hopper is not coming to rescue us. This is not a TV show. This is real life. We have a President unlike any we have ever known. And like Mike, Dustin, Lucas, and Eleven, we must remain focused on the task at hand and hold this administration accountable so we can escape from our own version of the ‘‘Upside Down.’’ f 
INTEGRITY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the United States of America is known for many things. It is known for its integrity, its honesty, and its high moral compass. We are well aware that the United States intelligence community is united in its assessment that Russia attacked our Nation in 2016, and interfered in our elections. In response, President Obama imposed sanctions on the Russian Government and personnel entities, including intelligence services. He also expelled dozens of Russian officials from the United States. Now, we know that General Flynn, in violation of many laws, intruded and discussed these issues with the Russian Ambassador. His departure does not end this investigation. Who knew what, when? When did the President know it? The integrity of this country is higher and more superior than one individual. Why, when other Presidents have used Camp David and the White House for international diplomacy most often, did we have, over the past weekend, the embarrassment of international and national security issues, and personnel being filmed in an ordinary restaurant owned by the President? Finally, let me say, with the many hundreds of thousands of DACA children who need relief, the question is: Can the President attend to serious business fighting for these young people and saving lives? 
WE DESERVE TO KNOW (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, we live in a dangerous world, and the President needs a National Security Adviser who isn’t under a cloud of suspicion. But this resignation isn’t the end. Americans now deserve to know if General Flynn was operating under anyone else’s authority. The American people deserve to know if Russia has financial, personal, or political grip on President Trump or his campaign. I am urging the agencies involved in the investigation to continue their important work vigorously. I also ask my colleagues in House leadership to launch a bipartisan, independent congressional investigation into Russia’s influence on the election and the new administration. Lastly, I once again am calling on President Trump to remove his cheap political strategist, Steve Bannon, from the National Security Council and reinstate the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to restore some semblance of respectability to the organization’s structure. f 
RESIGNATIONS AS MEMBER OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY AND COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PALMER ) laid before the House the following resignations as a member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Education and the Workforce: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, February 16, 2017. Speaker PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN: Due to my election to the Committee on Ways and Means, this letter is to inform you that I resign my seats on the House Judiciary committee and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Sincerely, MICHAEL D. B ISHOP . 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the resignations are accepted. There was no objection. 
ELECTING MEMBERS TO CERTAIN STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Republican Conference, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 131 Resolved, That the following named Members be, and are hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the House of Representatives: COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET : Mr. Smith of Missouri, to rank immediately after Mr. Johnson of Ohio. COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE : Mr. Russell, to rank immediately after Mr. Grothman. COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS : Mr. Bishop of Michigan. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be considered as read and printed in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF FINAL RULE OF DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 123, I 
call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 69) providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule of the Department of the Interior relating to ‘‘NonSubsistence Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation and Closure Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska’’, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 123, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
H.J. R ES. 69 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of the Interior relating to ‘‘NonSubsistence Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation and Closure Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska’’ (81 Fed. Reg. 52247 (August 5, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 69. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ), the only Member of Congress in the House from Alaska, the dean of the Republican side. (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP ) for bringing this legislation to the floor. H.J. Res. 69 is very simple. It overturns an illegal rule by the Obama administration—an illegal rule. This House created the State of Alaska in 1959, under the Statehood Act. It clearly granted Alaska full authority to manage fish and game on all lands in the State of Alaska, including all Federal lands. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980 further, in fact, verified what the Statehood Act did: protecting the right of the State to manage fish and game. Mo Udall was chairman of the Interior Committee at that time, and he agreed that this was the right thing to do. The thing that we had to do was make sure there was no misinterpretation of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and the Statehood Act. What occurred under the Obama administration is that—your administration, on that side—in the wee hours of the night, they passed a rule that took that away from the State. And it is huge, if you think about it: 16 refuges, 76.8 million acres. That is bigger than most of the States in this Union. They took the right away from the State to manage fish and game. There has been a lot of interest groups and some Members of Congress that have been conveying falsehoods, flat out dishonesty on what the taking back of the management of fish and game will do. They talk about killing puppies and grizzly bears. That does not happen, nor, in fact, is it legal in the State of Alaska under our management. The opposition will claim there was consultation with the State of Alaska. If that is the case, why did Alaska file suit to overturn this rule? There was no consultation. Yesterday, I met with most of the leaders of the Alaskan Native community that live in this area in the refuges and around the refuges. Not one of them support the rule passed by the Obama administration. The other side says they are all for helping the American Indians, the first people, yet they are supporting a rule that is illegal. Illegal. I want to stress that. This rule passed by the Obama administration is opposed by the total delegation, the Governor, all the elected officials in the State of Alaska, and it is an infringement upon the State of Alaska, and it should be an infringement upon your States. Maybe we ought to go back to every State in the Union, maybe even Virginia, and see how we might change the right of Virginia when the Federal lands were involved in the State of Alaska. You stood up in front of this body and held your hand and said: I swear to uphold the Constitution of America and laws pertaining to it. Every one of you took that oath. Every one of you. Yet, you stand on this floor, and some of you will say: Oh, we have to protect the wolf puppies. That is not what this is about. It is about the law. It is the Statehood Act, the right of Alaskans, and the right of Alaska to manage all fish and game. If you vote against this resolution, you are saying the Congress does not count, nor can we keep our word. We will do whatever is popular at the time. I say: Shame on you. You said you would uphold the Constitution. Let’s pass this legislation that Mr. BISHOP has brought to the floor. Let’s turn back that illegal law that they are trying to impose upon the people of Alaska and the American people. If you don’t believe in that, then I suggest you resign from the body, because you are not upholding the law that you swore you would do. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Members of this House for their support of the legal aspects of the State of Alaska. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am dismayed to be part of this discussion of H.J. Res. 69. Day in and day out, we have meaningful debate in committees and the House floor that reflect very real philosophical differences about the responsibilities and the limits of the Federal Government. These differences and world views inevitably reflect differences in values. Today, I can’t understand how my Republican friends can defend values that allow and promote the cruelest possible killing methods. Humans have hunted for millennia. This hunting traditionally requires patience, skill, cunning and encourage, but not sugar doughnuts, helicopters, gasses, or leg traps. Today’s House joint resolution would overturn this incredibly fair and reasonable U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service regulation that would rightly prohibit controversial and scientifically justified killing methods on 76 million acres of Federal wildlife refuge lands—76 million acres that belong to the American people. b1245 The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act authorize—and, in fact, require—the Fish and Wildlife Service to maintain the natural diversity of refuges in Alaska, regardless of State wildlife laws. This includes protecting healthy populations of apex predators like wolves and bears. So this rule would prohibit the inhumane and indiscriminate killing of keystone species in the national wildlife refuges. This does not interfere with fair chase hunting methods. It doesn’t even prevent inhumane and indiscriminate killing on State and private lands. Anyone voting to support this Congressional Review Act resolution today is tacitly supporting using airplanes and helicopters to scout land and shoot grizzly bears, killing wolves, black bears, coyote mothers and their pups and cubs in dens, actually gassing them, and the trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steeljawed leg hold traps and wire snares, where they are trapped, bleeding, frightened, slowly dying of thirst and starvation. Statewide polls show that Alaskans strongly support eliminating these cruel and unsporting practices. Alaska also gains over $2 billion in economic activity for wildlife viewing, which is five times what it earns from hunting. This makes economic sense. It is a huge driver of tourism. Many come to Alaska for the unique opportunity to see bears, wolves, and other keystone species. They are the very ones at risk if we pass this resolution. I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution, to oppose these cruel and 
inhumane practices. They are not sporting practices, and they violate any understanding of humane values and respect for nature. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ). Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his time and his leadership on this issue. I come to the floor today as the co chair of the largest bipartisan caucus in the United States Congress: the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus. On behalf of the millions of sportsmen and women around the country, I say to the Federal Government, enough is enough. We will not be intimidated; we will not be strongarmed; and we will not be silent. States have enjoyed a cooperative relationship with the Federal Government for years on wildlife management, and this is a disturbing shift that we have seen in the last administration. Though I come to the floor today in defense of Alaska’s management rights of national wildlife refuges, this sets a disturbing precedent for the lower 48 States. It is a disturbingly brazen power grab by the Federal Government against the law, in spite of loud and widespread opposition at the local level. The rule removes Alaska’s authority to manage fish and wildlife for both nonsubsistence and subsistence uses in Federal wildlife. The action by the last administration violated the clear letter of the Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act. I encourage my colleagues to support what we are doing today and stand in support of the good men and women, the outdoorsmen in the great State of Alaska. I know you have heard from the gentleman from Alaska who has very clearly articulated the position of the people he represents in that great State. I applaud the chairman. I applaud the action that we are taking today. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS ). Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, for the third week in a row, Republicans are back on the floor of the House of Representatives seeking to overturn environmental protections for our Nation’s deeply valued public lands, this time attacking wildlife protections for iconic species living in national wildlife refuges in Alaska. This is not a new issue for me or my constituents. My late husband, Senator Paul Tsongas, helped write the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980. He worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska to craft legislation that balanced conservation with responsible economic development for Alaskans, including oil exploration, mining, timber harvesting, and sport hunting. But he also stated on the Senate floor, back in 1980: ‘‘Nature made the wilderness and wildlife in Alaska majestic during hundreds of thousands of years. Man’’—and, I would add, woman—‘‘is challenged merely to respect and preserve that natural majesty.’’ He also spoke on the Senate floor about conversations at the dinner table with our then 6yearold daughter, who asked what her father was doing to protect endangered species. Well, our daughter has grown now, but here we are 37 years later in Congress debating if that bipartisan law crafted with my late husband allows hunters to shoot bear cubs and wolf pups in their den on a national wildlife refuge. My colleagues are correct that ANILCA, as that law is known, and other Federal laws give the State of Alaska unique privileges and responsibilities to oversee wildlife management on public lands; however, this is not a carte blanche. There has never been a right to set policies on national wildlife refuges that are inconsistent with bedrock environmental laws or ANILCA’s mandate to conserve species and habitats in their natural diversity on wildlife refuges. I fully support the Fish and Wildlife Service’s decision to no longer turn a blind eye to harmful practices that are detrimental to nationally significant species and are not rooted in science based wildlife management practices. If my colleagues so desperately want to authorize a right to shoot bears from a helicopter in a wildlife refuge, I would be happy to recommend some video games. I hear virtual reality headsets these days make it just like the real thing. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this resolution. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ), the ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, today House Republicans are taking a short break from their crusade to make our air and water dirtier so they can now take the time to make it easier to kill bear cubs and wolf pups on our national wildlife refuges in Alaska. The rule that this resolution seeks to repeal does not infringe upon the State of Alaska’s bizarre campaign to destroy wildlife populations on State lands nor does it prohibit the State from conducting scientifically valid predator control measures on refuge lands. The massive Federal overreach and trampling of states’ rights being claimed by the sponsor of this resolution and its supporters is nothing more than the latest statement of alternative facts by Republicans here in Washington. The truth is both the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act authorize—and, in fact, require—the Fish and Wildlife Service to maintain the natural diversity of refuges in Alaska, regardless of State wildlife laws. This includes protecting healthy populations of apex predators like wolves and bears. Instead, the rule prevents the use of methods that hunters in our own country agree violate the ‘‘fair chase’’ ethical standard that separates sports hunting from pleasure killing. I don’t hunt, but no hunter that I know would ever think of catching a bear in a steel trap or luring it in with bait and then shooting it or blowing away a mother wolf and her pups in their den. These are the types of practices this rule bans, and it only prohibits them on national wildlife refuge areas that are owned and maintained by the American people, not the State of Alaska. These tactics are not part of any sciencebased wildlife management strategy, and despite what Trump’s new Education Secretary might think, these measures are not necessary to protect schoolchildren from grizzlies. This resolution is just another piece of the Republican agenda to hand our public lands over to States and private interests as well as a distraction from the things House Republicans aren’t doing. Where is your infrastructure package? Where is your solution to make technical education and college more affordable? Where is your plan to combat climate change? The answer is that they do not exist. So, instead, we are wasting time on yet another Congressional Review Act resolution, standing idly by without putting people to work fixing our roads, bridges, and energy grid; without training Americans to do the job of today’s economy, not to mention tomorrow’s; and without lifting a finger to protect people, many of whom are our own constituents, from the worst impacts of global warming. The only difference between Trump and the House Republicans is that he distracts the public to try to move his agenda, and they distract the public to hide the fact that they can’t move theirs. I urge you to stop the distractions and vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Lands in our full committee. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, in the dying days of the Obama administration, and over vigorous protests by many wildlife and user groups, not to mention the State of Alaska itself, the National Fish and Wildlife Service imposed the rule that Congressman YOUNG ’s resolution overturns. In violation of the Alaska Statehood Act, the 
Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service removed Alaska’s authority to manage the fish and wildlife populations within its own borders on 76 million acres. That is a land area larger than 45 States. As part of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, the State agreed to several national wildlife refuges within its borders. In exchange for the Federal Government assuming control of these lands, Alaska was given explicit authority to manage its wildlife populations. This new agency rule breaks this promise. It begins a dangerous process of seizing control of fish and game management decisions which have by right, by law, and by custom belonged to the States. The North American model of wildlife conservation has been a huge success and has sustained healthy wildlife populations for many generations. Not only is the Fish and Wildlife Service rule illegal, it threatens to reverse these successful land management relationships; it places severe restrictions on the public’s right to hunt and fish on these public lands; it interferes with the State’s success in managing wildlife populations to assure that they don’t overrun the ability of the land to support them; and it shreds the cooperative relationship that Alaska and the Federal Government have enjoyed over these lands since Alaskan statehood. We have three overarching objectives in the Federal Lands Subcommittee: to restore public access to the public lands, to restore sound management to the public lands, and to restore the Federal Government as a good neighbor to those communities and States impacted by the public lands. In adopting this rule, the agency violated all of these principles. The Federal Lands Subcommittee will spend this Congress working on legislation to restore our public lands from the policy of benign neglect that has plagued our land management to the point where we are losing entire forests in the West and that has strained the relationships between our communities and our Federal agencies. The resolution sponsored by Congressman YOUNG is an excellent start. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), the former ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, let’s talk about what this rule didn’t do. First off, ANILCA did not grant the State of Alaska any additional authority to manage wildlife on Federal lands. This rule is totally compliant with ANILCA. ANILCA actually prioritizes conservation of these species we are talking about here today, apex predators, on more than half the refuges in the State. As required by ANILCA, the rule ensures that national wildlife refuges— that is what we are talking about here, wildlife refuges—conserve species and habitats in their natural diversity. That doesn’t mean you kill the predators so that people who don’t have good hunting skills are going to have an easier time getting a caribou or moose. That is not what this is supposed to be about on the national wildlife refuges. It actually prioritizes conservation of these species. I just heard that something about this will severely restrict hunting and fishing on these lands. Absolutely not true, unless you say shooting wolves and their pups in the den or gassing them in the den is hunting—and we are restricting that. Bears and cubs would be killed during hibernation, hunters crawling around killing bears during hibernation. No, hunters don’t do that. Brown and black bears would be trapped, snared using steeljawed traps, wire snares—again, not hunters, not sportsmen. Luring and baiting grizzly bears? Wow. Now, that is a real sportsmanlike hunter with a lot of skills kind of guy or woman who has to use bait to kill a grizzly bear. b1300 Aerial gunning of bears by State agency personnel, that is hunters? No, not quite. Sportsmen? No, don’t think so. And using aircraft to track bears and kill in the same day, those are the things that would be prohibited. That is what is prohibited. Subsistence hunting? Absolutely no impact. Fishing? Fish? I guess the fishing thing would be the grizzly bears eat the fish, and people who don’t have good fishing skills want to catch the fish. So if we kill the grizzly bears, they won’t eat the fish. So it does impact fishing, I guess, sort of, maybe. No, it doesn’t. This is absolutely inhumane, unsportsmanlike, and unnecessary. The State of Alaska is doing this just to decrease the natural balance of predation, which actually creates healthier herds of caribou and healthier moose populations. There was a study done in 2015 by professors from both Alaska and Washington that showed that actually having these predators present increases the health and the diversity of the herds of caribou, because the sick and the lame and the old get killed, but the rest of them flourish and breed. There would be more than enough still to hunt. Yeah, maybe you won’t be able to drive your pickup truck, stick your rifle out of the away, blast away, and get one. You might actually have to get out of the pickup truck. You might actually have to have some hunting skills and track a little bit to get the caribou or the moose. But if we kill off all of the grizzlies and the wolves, it will be a lot easier. They will overpopulate. Actually, what they will do is they will start going down at the riparian areas, like happened—it is a different ecosystem—in Yellowstone, and then the streams will not be as plentiful with fish. This is about natural balance, it is about Federal lands, it is about sportsmen and women, and it is about prohibiting the State of Alaska from using its extreme predator control methods. That is what this is called: extreme predator control methods. That is all it prevents. This is a very sad day in this House if this resolution passes, and it is long term bad for Alaska. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ), the vice chairman of the Federal Lands Subcommittee. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 69, a bill to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal a rule issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service to restrict hunting within national wildlife refuges in Alaska. I would like to commend Congressman YOUNG for his leadership on crafting this legislation and for defending his constituents’ right to manage the wildlife in their home State. Mr. Speaker, the assertion that the repeal of this rule would allow unethical management and hunting practices is utterly false. Alaskans have hunted and managed their land for generations, and this overreach by the Fish and Wildlife Service simply impedes their ability to do just that. Allow me to read from the 2016–2017 Alaska Trapping Regulations, one of many sound management documents usurped by this bureaucratic overreach: ‘‘Wolves and bears are very effective and efficient predators of caribou, moose, deer, and other wildlife. In most of Alaska, humans also rely on the same species for food. In Alaska’s Interior, predators kill more than 80 percent of the moose and caribou that die during an average year, while humans kill less than 10 percent. In most of the state, predation holds prey populations at levels far below what could be supported by the habitat in the area. Predation is an important part of the ecosystem, and all . . . wolf management programs, including control programs, are designed to sustain wolf populations in the future.’’ Additionally, the regulations go on to say: ‘‘You may not: disturb or destroy beaver houses or any furbearer den.’’ Such as wolves, coyote, or mink. Mr. Speaker, the claim that this bill will allow Alaskans to hunt wolves in their dens is simply false rhetoric, designed to mislead the public, while bureaucrats take away the rights of Alaskans. The people of Alaska rely on these lands to provide for their families, and this Fish and Wildlife rule attempts to insert Washington bureaucrats into that process. 
Mr. Speaker, I cringe to think about U.S. Fish and Wildlife usurping established law. I cringe to think about U.S. Fish and Wildlife legislating themselves more power through the rulemaking process. I cringe to think about U.S. Fish and Wildlife expanding the regulations in Alaska, and I sure as heck don’t want them expanding them in Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, this is a slippery slope, and I urge my colleagues to rescind this overreach and support this resolution. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, a quick response to the notion that the fears of inhumane practices are utterly false. In a Los Angeles Times story in 2012, the headline is: ‘‘Alaska officials expand aerial shooting of bears.’’ It goes on to say: ‘‘The controversial ‘intensive management’ moves are the latest in a series of increasingly aggressive control methods targeting bears and wolves in Alaska. In some areas, wolf pups can be gassed in their dens, bear cubs and sows can be hunted, and wolves shot from helicopters.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS). Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, we really should be calling this bill the ‘‘Puppy Killing Act.’’ This resolution would overturn a rule that prohibits some of the cruelest hunting practices on Federal lands in Alaska. Now, again, this is not on State land. This is on Federal land that Colorado taxpayers and taxpayers across the country pay for the maintenance of and that we, the people of the country, own. The Fish and Wildlife rule prohibits socalled predator control activities that Alaska has made legal in State law. As Mr. HUFFMAN said, the Alaska Board of Game specifically voted to allow aerial gunning and snaring of bears. They have engaged in gassing of wolf pups in their dens. These are not theoretical matters. They are actual matters as to why this rule is so important and why I oppose it being overturned. If this bill passes, the activities that are prevented under this rule for refuges can actually occur. These cruel and inhumane methods that Alaska wishes to implement, including killing wolf pups and their mothers at or near their dens, killing brown bears with the use of steeljawed traps, and scouting and shooting grizzly bears from planes and helicopters, are not only unsportsmanlike, but run counter to the directives of the National Wildlife Refuge System and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Thirtyone scientists submitted their support for the Alaska National Refuge Act, noting that the best available science indicates that widespread elimination of bears, coyotes, and wolves will quite unlikely make ungulate herds magically reappear. So, again, the science is clear on this matter. There was another study by the 1997 National Academy of Sciences that found that Alaska’s predator control system, including the assertion of killing wolves and bears, somehow makes other wildlife populations healthier is simply not supported by sound science. This blunt and unscientific and inhumane approach to managing apex predators and carnivores employed by the State of Alaska is actually counter to the law and the congressional mandate regarding the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which passed overwhelmingly in this body, says it requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to: Conserve Fish and Wildlife populations and their habitats in their natural diversity. 
How does it protect our carnivore species and the species they consume in their natural diversity if there is artificial and inhumane human intervention to kill puppies and target bears from aircraft? It is simply unscientific, inhumane, and wrong. In direct contrast to Federal law, Alaska has adopted regulations that require the killing of wolves and bears under socalled predation control efforts to artificially inflate game populations frequently above and beyond the carrying capacity of the land. The State currently authorizes extreme practices like aerial shooting of wolves or bears by State agency personnel, trapping of wolves by paid contractors, and using airplanes to hunt wolves and bears. Not only is this bill inhumane and counter to our stewardship of the National Wildlife Refuge, but it is also counterproductive for jobs in the economy of Alaska. Wildlife watching provides roughly five times more the revenue to the Alaskan economy than hunting or trapping. It turns out that the American people and tourists around the world would rather see these puppies and photograph them rather than shoot them and gas them. According to the Fish and Wildlife records, wildlife viewing activities in Alaska support over $2 billion in economic activity. Why is Congress spending time trying to allow puppy killing and cruel hunting methods to occur, instead of fair chase methods, especially when this actually undermines Alaska’s economy and their ecology of Federal refuges? Why are we repealing this rule when, in fact, most Alaskans support it? The American people know there are more pressing issues facing the country than this rule. I urge Members to join me and vote ‘‘no’’ on the CRA and protecting puppies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BEYER. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds. Mr. POLIS. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting with the Alaskan people, with the economic interests of Alaska, and with the taxpayers of America, who are stewards of this land, for better wildlife management practices, to stop killing puppies, and engage in inhumane trapping and hunting practices of bears. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ), a member of our committee, who is also going to talk about the reality of what we are facing here. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, on August 5, 2016, the Obama administration published another overreaching regulation that threatens the authority of States nationwide to manage fish and wildlife. Specifically, the new rule undermines Alaska’s authority to manage fish and wildlife on State, private, and Federal lands. The new regulation destroys the cooperative relationship between the State of Alaska and the agency that historically worked well. This power grab threatens management policies and wildlife refuges nationwide and, if allowed to stand, will set a dangerous precedent for future topdown mandates from the Federal Government that seize authority from States. The rule violates the Alaska constitution and two laws that were passed by Congress in the form of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and the Alaska Statehood Act. People throughout the country oppose this misguided rule that harms the State of Alaska’s authority to manage fish and wildlife within its borders. In my home State of Arizona, 21 different sportsmen’s groups have come out publicly against the rule and endorsed Representative YOUNG ’s bill to overturn this Washington power grab. The 21 Arizona sportsmen’s groups include: Anglers United; Arizona Flycasters; Arizona Sportsmen for Wildlife Conservation; Arizona Antelope Foundation, Arizona B.A.S.S. Nation; Arizona Big Game Super Raffle; Arizona Bowhunters Association; Arizona Catfish Conservation Association; Arizona Chapter of National Wild Turkey Federation; Arizona Council of Trout Unlimited; Arizona Deer Association; Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society; Arizona Elk Society; Arizona Houndsmen Association; Arizona Outdoor Sports; Coconino Sportsmen; Outdoor Experience for All; Shake Rattle and Troll Outdoors; the Bass FederationAZ; Xtreme Predator Callers; and 1.2.3.Go. Representative DONYOUNG ’s bill is also supported by 27 different sportsmen and conservation groups throughout the country. The National Rifle Association, who is key voting in support of Representative YOUNG ’s bill, stated: 
The sustainable management of these natural resources needs to be led by the State working in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Fish and Wildlife Service’s final rule would set an illadvised national precedent that could have farreaching negative implications on the lower 48 
States. H.J. Res. 69 will restore the jurisdictional StateFederal relationship as Congress has previously directed. 
Americans for Prosperity, who is also key voting in support of H.J. Res. 69, stated: 
The Interior rule relating to nonsubsistence take of wildlife, and public participation of closure procedures on national wildlife refuges in Alaska undermines the ability of Alaskans to manage fish and wildlife on refuge lands, which make up more than 20 percent of the State. Instead, Congress should work with the Trump administration to ensure cooperative Federalism and greater public participation over fish and wildlife management decisions. 
I share these concerns and urge rejection of this Obama power grab that undermines Alaska authority to manage fish and wildlife on State, private, and Federal lands. I applaud Representative DONYOUNG for his excellent work and leadership on this issue. He has been remarkably successful over the years of protecting the interests of the people of the State of Alaska. This is yet another classic example of the bureaucratic overreach that Representative YOUNG is working hard to overturn. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game knows best how to manage fish and wildlife in the State of Alaska, not Washington bureaucrats. I urge adoption of Representative YOUNG ’s commonsense bill. b1315 Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues and my fellow Americans can see what is even greater about this country in its farreaching wildlife and open areas. I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 69 because I do think it is important that we be good custodians of what has been given to us. Yes, to protect those humans who have come to be in places where wildlife was, but to be good custodians. The rule that was adopted years ago after public engagement from many different people is reasonable and rational: Denning of wolves and their pups, shooting or trapping them while at their dens in the spring; using airplanes to scout land and shoot grizzly bears; trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steeljawed leghold traps and wire snares—this is what that rule prevents—luring grizzly bears with rotting meat, sugar, and pet food to get a pointblank kill; denning of black bear mothers and cubs during hibernation. It reminds me of the time that I came to the floor last year to stand against a horrible killing of Cecil the lion by someone who wanted a trophy. So let me tell you about the lesson from Dr. Ed Schmitt, a retired surgeon, a hunter, who moved to Alaska from Colorado to fish in the river that flowed by his house, to be able to hunt. He enjoyed fishing for salmon, casting for salmon, and seeing the brown bears, also known as grizzly bears. Here is what he said: ‘‘’Most of us that live in Alaska are here because we recognize that it has something that the rest of the world doesn’t,’ says Mr. Schmitt, president of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, which is working with the HSUS to protect animals from trophy hunting abuses. ‘The wildness can be destroyed by people. We’ve stopped seeing the wildlife because we’ve made it go away.’’’ He further said: ‘‘It’s not true that all Alaskans are OK with the state running rampant on public lands.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. JACKSON LEE. ‘‘‘It’s not true that all Alaskans are OK with the state running rampant on public lands,’ he says. ‘Only a minority of Alaskans are hunters, and even fewer kill animals just for a trophy.’’’ This is Dr. Schmitt, a hunter. This is not a tree hugger. He is a hunter who moved to this beautiful land that we can call America. So many Americans on the mainland, in essence, go to this beautiful, connected Alaska, and so Dr. Schmitt goes on to say, like most hunters in Alaska, he is appalled at practices that have been raised up to not save the beauty of these wild animals. ‘‘’The notion that people don’t want any rules is a myth. We want good rules, just like everybody else.’’’ Well, I want to stand alongside of Dr. Ed Schmitt, a healer, a former doctor, a hunter who moved to Alaska, who understands that what we are seeking to disapprove is wrong because it was a reasoned response to all who were engaged in this area. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 69, a congressional resolution rescinding a final rule promulgated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to prevent widely criminalized, cruel, and unsporting hunting methods of killing wolves, grizzly bears, and other native mammals on 76 million acres of federal lands in Alaska. I oppose the disapproval resolution because it subverts the judgment of professional wildlife managers, and allows appalling methods of killing animals on public lands designated for wildlife. The FWS rule does not apply to subsistence hunting or sport hunting in general; it simply restricts methods of killing that are not suited anywhere, least of all on national wildlife refuges. The rule, adopted after years of public engagement and with the support of many Alaskans, bans the following practices: 1. Denning of wolves and their pups—shooting or trapping them while at their dens in the spring; 2. Using airplanes to scout, land and shoot grizzly bears; 3. Trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steeljawed leg hold traps and wire snares; 4. Luring grizzly bears with rotting meat, sugar, and pet food to get a point blank kill; and 5. Denning of black bear mothers and cubs during hibernation. H.J. Res. 69, if adopted, would prevent the Administration from ever issuing a rule on this topic, foreclosing our Federal wildlife managers from regulating these activities in any way under current law. The decision to ban these cruel hunting practices came directly from professional wildlife managers from the FWS based in Alaska and is consistent with sciencebased wildlife management practices. In addition, the FWS statutory mandate requires that the agency conserve wildlife species. The FWS appealed to the Alaska Board of Game dozens of times to amend its rules to ensure that the FWS statutory mandate was being followed. The Board of Game’s continued refusal to do so forced FWS to initiate this rulemaking to ensure that its statutory mandate of conserving wildlife species on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska is followed. Mr. Speaker, a statewide poll conducted in February 2016 showed Alaskans opposed denning of wolves by more than a 2to1 margin. The poll showed that Alaska voters strongly support eliminating these cruel and unsporting methods of killing native carnivores on National Wildlife Refuges in their state. Additionally, at a series of public meetings on the rule, many Alaskans turned out to publicly support the rule because they want these inhumane, unsustainable, unsporting practices to end. Mr. Speaker, another reason to oppose H.J. Res. 69 is that it would damage wildlife tourism and hurt the economy of Alaska. These are federal lands, maintained with federal taxpayer dollars, and millions of Americans travel to Alaska each year for the unique opportunity to see bears, wolves, caribou, lynx, and other species on these lands. Wildlife watchers contribute over $2 billion to the economy of Alaska—five times more than the amount generated in Alaska from hunting activity. The wildlife within our National Wildlife Refuges is a national resource and Americans across the country care about protecting it for future generations of Americans. For these reasons, I strongly opposed H.J. Res. 69, and urge my colleagues to join me. I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this disapproval and to support and stand with these beautiful animals. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the article, ‘‘The Fight to Protect Alaska’s Predators,’’ and an article regarding Safari Club. 
[The Humane Society of the United States, Oct. 19, 2016] THEFIGHT TOPROTECT ALASKA ’SPREDATORS  (By Karen E. Lange) Ed Schmitt, a retired surgeon, moved to Alaska to experience the wild. He left Colorado for the Kenai Peninsula, south of Anchorage, where he could fish in a river that flowed right outside his house and hunt, he says, in a way that respects wildlife and the environment. Schmitt enjoyed casting for salmon and seeing brown bears, also known as grizzly bears, fishing nearby. He never wanted to kill them. But over 25 years, development and new roads ate away bear habitat. And a different mentality from Schmitt’s, one that treats large predators as 
creatures to be eliminated so populations of moose and caribou can flourish, took its toll on the Kenai’s brown bears. Schmitt hasn’t seen one in three years. ‘‘Most of us that live in Alaska are here because we recognized that it has something that the rest of the world doesn’t,’’ says Schmitt, president of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, which is working with The HSUS to protect animals from trophy hunting abuses. ‘‘The wildness can be destroyed by people. We’ve stopped seeing the wildlife because we’ve made it go away.’’ A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule released in August aims to preserve the state’s biodiversity by banning cruel and unsporting hunting methods on the 76 million acres of Alaska’s federal national wildlife refuges. (Last year, the National Park Service issued a similar rule for the more than 20 million acres of federal preserves within the state). Under the rule, supported by The HSUS and a network of scientists and local advocacy groups, hunters will no longer be able to bait brown bears, trap brown or black bears or use a plane to find bears from the air and then immediately land and shoot them. In addition, trophy hunters will not be allowed to kill black bear mothers and cubs or wolf and coyote mothers and pups in their dens (subsistence hunters are exempt). And ‘‘predator control’’ programs, which let hunters kill greater numbers of carnivores in the hope the populations of prey animals such as caribou will increase, won’t be permitted in national wildlife refuges. ‘‘This is the first time the federal government has stood up to the state of Alaska’s brutal practices in 37 years,’’ says Wendy Keefover, HSUS native carnivore protection manager, who led meetings on the rule in Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks to encourage constituents to speak out. An HSUS poll in March showed a majority of Alaskans support these restrictions, and the Fish and Wildlife Service says most people who submitted comments favored the rule. The change came despite wellfinanced campaigns by the NRA and Safari Club International against it, and the opposition of the hunters, trappers and hunting guides on the state’s Board of Game, as well as Alaska’s representatives in Congress. HSUS Alaska state director Michael Haukedalen says the number of residents who rallied to support the rule shows there’s a constituency for reform. ‘‘It’s not true that all Alaskans are OK with the state running rampant on public lands,’’ he says. ‘‘Only a minority of Alaskans are hunters, and even fewer kill animals just for a trophy.’’ In the 1980s and 1990s, citizen ballot initiatives passed bans on cruel and unsporting hunting practices. However, these were later overridden by the state legislature and governor. In 1994, the legislature enacted a law requiring the state’s Department of Fish and Game to practice ‘‘intensive management’’ of predators if caribou, moose and deer populations dropped below certain levels. For 10 years federal officials tried to negotiate with the Alaska Board of Game to protect wolves and bears from egregious hunting practices, says biologist Francis Mauer, retired from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. ‘‘It’s this everincreasing fervor to kill predators in Alaska,’’ he says. ‘‘The federal agencies realized these hunting practices are inconsistent with the purpose for which the parks and reserves were established, and they had a responsibility to act.’’ The fight against hunting abuses has now shifted to Washington, D.C., where Rep. Don Young (R–AK) got riders into House appropriations and energy bills that would undo both the Fish and Wildlife and National Park Service rules. Similar language was slipped into a Senate appropriations bill. The HSUS and other groups are encouraging Congress to reject these riders before sending the bills to the president. Schmitt says he, like most hunters in Alaska, is appalled by the practices the Fish and Wildlife Service has banned. ‘‘The notion that people don’t want any rules is a myth. We want good rules, just like everybody else.’’ 
[From the Clarion, Feb. 9, 2017] SAFARI CLUBSUESOVERNATIONAL PARK, WILDLIFE REFUGE REGULATIONS  (By Elizabeth Earl) The Safari Club International has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service over its hunting rules on federal lands in Alaska. The nonprofit, one of the largest hunting advocacy organizations in the country, is challenging a set of rules the three organizations enacted in 2016 to restrict hunting and trapping practices on national preserves and on national wildlife refuges in the state, specifically on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. The rules conflict with the state’s ability to manage wildlife and interfere with Alaskans’ ability to hunt and trap, among other impacts, according to the lawsuit filed Jan. 19 in U.S. District Court for Alaska. The federal government owns more than half of Alaska, managed by a smattering of different federal agencies. The U.S. Department of the Interior manages national wildlife refuges through the Fish and Wildlife Service and national parks and preserves through the National Park Service. Taken together, NPS manages about 54 million acres of the state, and Fish and Wildlife manages about 76.7 million acres. Specifically, the lawsuit takes issue with a rule that bans predator control activities on national wildlife refuges ‘‘unless based on sound science and in response to a conservation concern or is necessary to meet refuge purposes, federal laws or (Fish and Wildlife Service) policy,’’ according to an Aug. 3, 2016 press release about the rule. The National Park Service’s rule, which was finalized Oct. 23, 2015, prohibits the taking of brown bears over bait and the take of wolves and coyotes between May 1 and Aug. 9, which is designated as denning season, and eliminating the ‘‘temporary’’ closure category for national preserves in Alaska, which previously expired after 12 months. The lawsuit claims these closures allow Alaska personnel ‘‘unlimited discretion’’ to close areas to sport hunting without providing rulemaking notice or public comment opportunities. The lawsuit also claims the consequences of the National Park Service’s actions extend beyond its boundaries because the predators and prey do not remain within the boundaries of the national preserves. ‘‘The NPS exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the NPS Regulations, as the regulations illegally override the State’s authority to regulate the methods and means of taking Alaska’s wildlife,’’ the lawsuit states. The complaint against Fish and Wildlife’s general rule prohibiting predator control activities on Alaska national wildlife refuges is for similar reasons. On the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge specifically, which covers a broad swath of the Kenai Peninsula between the Russian River and the community of Sterling and stretches down toward the Fox River Flats on the southern peninsula, the lawsuit objects to the public use restrictions that prohibit some plane and motorboat use and lynx, coyote and wolf hunting within the Skilak Wildlife Recreation Area and prohibit bear baiting for brown bears, require a permit for baiting black bears and prohibit using a dog to hunt big game except for black bears, with a special use permit, among other rules. The lawsuit claims that neither the National Park Service nor Fish and Wildlife completed the proper National Environmental Protection Act processes for their regulations. The lawsuit asks for the court to declare all the regulations as invalid and enjoin the agencies from enacting the regulations. The suit was filed less than a week after the State of Alaska filed its own lawsuit against the same rules. The state’s suit claims very similar grievances against the rules, saying it breaches the state’s ability to manage its wildlife effectively, according to a news release from Gov. Bill Walker’s website. The Safari Club International supports the state’s lawsuit but chose to file its own anyway, said Safari Club International President Larry Higgins in a statement. The Safari Club’s lawsuit focuses more specifically on the rights of nonsubsistence users than the state’s lawsuit and contains complaints specific to the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge rules, which the state’s lawsuit does not, he said. ‘‘Safari Club concluded it was necessary to file its own lawsuit to represent and protect fully the interests of its members and others who hunt in Alaska for subsistence and/or for nonsubsistence purposes,’’ he said. ‘‘Both lawsuits challenge regulations adopted by the Obama Administration that prohibit certain hunting methods on National Preserves and National Wildlife Refuges.’’ The main issue the group has with the rules is state wildlife management, said Eddie Grasser, the vice president of the Safari Club’s Alaska chapter. All successful wildlife management in the U.S. is based on state management, he said. ‘‘The main emphasis for our part, anyway, is the issue of state management,’’ he said. ‘‘We don’t feel the federal government has the authority to manage wildlife because of the way the system has evolved over time.’’ Higgins said in his statement that the club will support the state’s legal efforts as well. ‘‘To the extent possible, Safari Club will work cooperatively with the State, and others who may decide to challenge the regulations, to present the best arguments to the court,’’ he said. The National Park Service had no comment on the Safari Club’s lawsuit and the Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT). Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the assertion that removing this rule would allow for egregious, cruel, and unsporting hunting methods is just totally false. The people of Alaska, I trust them to manage the game of that State. The idea, the accusation that this rule allows for shooting of wolf pups in their den is totally false. Disturbing wolf dens for any reason— hunting, trapping, or for wildlife management—is illegal in the State of Alaska. The 2016–2017 Alaska Trapping Regulations state: 
The following methods are illegal for taking furbearers: You may not disturb or destroy beaver houses or any furbearer den. 
Again, the people of Alaska can be trusted to manage their game. 
Additionally, the claim that removing this rule would allow for the use of airplanes or helicopters to hunt is totally false. Using aircraft is illegal in the State of Alaska. The 2016–2017 Alaska Hunting Regulations state: 
You may not take game by driving, herding, harassing, or molesting game with any motorized vehicle such as an aircraft, airboat, snow machine, motorboat, et cetera. 
Finally, the claim that removing this rule would allow for trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steeljawed leghold traps, again, simply totally false. Trapping or snaring big game is illegal in the State of Alaska. The 2016–2017 Alaska Hunting Regulations state: 
You may not take game by using a trap or a snare to take big game, fur animals, or small game. 
As you can see, these claims are nothing but false rhetoric from antisportsmen that think they know better how to manage Alaska’s wildlife than the good people of Alaska do. Alaska law already precludes these practices, yet they are being used as an emotional argument to hide what is clearly a bureaucratic overreach which unfairly targets the citizens of Alaska. Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy and I appreciate his leadership on this. I just heard my friend talk about these imaginary practices. If they are, in fact, imaginary, what is the problem in terms of having Fish and Wildlife moving to bring hunting standards in Federal lands in Alaska more in line with standards for other Federal lands across America? The fact is that these practices can, in fact, occur, and it is the judgment of the professionals in this field that developed this proposal for the Fish and Wildlife Service. These are the people who are charged with understanding the dynamics, who understand the interaction, based on sound science going forward. The majority of people in Alaska do not support such practices. These are basically the rules that the rest of America deals with in terms of our wildlife refuges. I spent a lot of time working in the area of animal welfare. It is something that I find is one of those rare areas in Congress where there is far more agreement than disagreement. We find, across the country, 25,000 organizations that are dedicated to animal welfare. This is an area that I am sad to see we are breaking down now with, I think, unnecessary controversy. Being able to deal with wildlife management and protection, being able to deal with humane hunting practices, to be able to allow the professionals in the Fish and Wildlife Service and elsewhere to be able to help in developing uniform standards is something that should not be unnecessarily divisive. I am hopeful that we give the Fish and Wildlife Service the authority and responsibility to manage these refuges and that we respect the fact that they took public input into account; they weighed the comments; they put forward a thoughtful rule. Being able to nullify this rule entirely, return to some of the most inhumane practices, is simply inappropriate. Instead of rolling back these rules, we should respect the agency’s expertise, the wishes of the vast majority of the people we represent, and uniform provisions to apply to all wildlife refuges. I am really disappointed that the rhetoric reaches this level and that we are rushing ahead with making changes like this without providing the foundation that would normally occur in the legislative process. This rule is a culmination of a great deal of time and energy, public input, scientific expertise, and hard work. To overturn it summarily, as this Congress has been doing in other areas, I think is a step backwards. It is something that is not supported by the public, and I think it is something that we ought to strongly reject. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, one quick point is that these national wildlife refuges are U.S. public lands paid for by U.S. taxpayers and should be managed for the benefit of all. So let me quote former Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe, recently departed, who said these ‘‘are not game farms managed for a slice of their diversity for the benefit of a few people who would call themselves hunters.’’ Much has been made in this debate this afternoon, Madam Speaker, about whether ANILCA prohibits this Fish and Wildlife rule. We have gone back and forth with different cases. Let me just quote a few key paragraphs. Section 302 and 303 of ANILCA establishes 16 national wildlife refuges, and for each one, the purpose is stated for which the refuge is to be established and shall be managed, including: ‘‘to conserve fish and wildlife populations in their natural diversity.’’ The law doesn’t say wildlife should be managed in some alternate state of unnatural diversity where no wolves, no bears, and overpopulated moose herds can destroy the landscape. Both the ANILCA, and the Improvement Act, the 1998 law that reorganized the National Wildlife Refuge System, managed Alaska’s Federal refuge managers to conserve natural diversity, a value that the Fish and Wildlife Services correctly noted is incompatible with indiscriminate predator culls. Every Federal court to consider the question, including the Ninth Circuit, which contains Alaska, has held the States lack the authority to overrule Fish and Wildlife Service management decisions concerning Federal refuge management. So this has already been before the courts. The courts, I believe, have already decided. Madam Speaker, in the few minutes I have left, let me just quote a few of the letters we received from Alaska residents in opposition to the resolution before us. Elizabeth Figus, from Juneau, writes: ‘‘I am an Alaskan. I hunt and fish, and I support regulations that prohibit cruel killing. This rule would rightly prohibit controversial and scientifically unjustified killing methods on over 76 million acres of Federal lands in Alaska. ‘‘A hunter who cannot comply with humane methods of the trade/sport is simply lazy and undeserving of the right to harvest the flesh of another living thing. ‘‘This is the 21st century, not the 1800s. We must carry out our hunting in a careful and organized fashion to ensure the safety of Alaskan residents as well as the sustainability of the wild animal resources into the future.’’ This from Elisabeth Moorehead from Eagle River: ‘‘My husband and I owned and operated a successful wildlife tourism business in Alaska for 27 years. The business still continues in the capable hands of one of our guides. . . . I am writing to convey my displeasure over the content of the joint resolution you recently introduced in response to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulations that ban cruel and unsporting methods of killing bears, wolves and coyotes on Federal wildlife refuges in Alaska.’’ And from Fran Mauer in Fairbanks: ‘‘Over the last 15 years I have watched the state hunting regulations for wolves and bears get progressively more extreme. These methods go far beyond any common sense, are not supported by science, and have no place in our Alaskan National Wildlife Refuges. This is the result of the special interest lobby of extreme prohunting groups. . . . I for one, and many other Alaskan hunters, do not want to see the State of Alaska turn our National Wildlife Refuges into game farms.’’ And, finally, from Jeff Fair from Palmer: ‘‘I write you as a 23year Alaskan wildlife biologist . . . Currently 64 years of age, I hunt and fish and enjoy a permanent license to do so in The Great Land. ‘‘As a biologist, I recognize that predator control does not work in the long run to stabilize or maximize cervid populations. I also recognize that an attempt to repeal U.S. Fish and Wildlife regs on these lands would be an attempt to circumvent, contradict, overturn, or simply break the Federal law that establishes the Fish and Wildlife Service’s mission and authority for these lands. And as a hunter I fear for the reputation of the hunting tradition, including conservation and fair chase, when some service antipredator techniques are allowed anywhere, including on federal lands.’’ Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1330 Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ), the one who actually lives there and knows the area and knows the names of the towns. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Speaker, under the decorum of the House, I won’t call it bull. I will just say it is a lot of misinformation and outright story tales, the information conveyed to these gentlemen and the ladies from The Humane Society. That is what it is. There is no sport hunter who is going to be shooting cubs and sows. In fact, there is no one in the State who does not support my resolution of organized hunters, viewers. I have not had any of that. Yes, you got some letters. And I believe the best way to judge is, if they don’t like what I am doing, don’t elect me. I am speaking for the people from my State, not Virginia, not a used car salesman. I am speaking for my people. The second false claim is it allows aerial shooting and gunning of bears. That is not what this is about. It is about the law, and we will win it in court. But I don’t want to win it in court. I want to establish the fact that an agency does not have the right to break the law. As far as Dan Ashe goes, well, did he have any specialists? No. He did this because of interest groups, governing by interest groups, not the hunters, not the Alaskans, not the gunmen of Alaska, but The Humane Society that put out all of this propaganda. Denning of wolves—and, by the way, I have to remind people. We used to den wolves. I have done it myself. I got paid 50 bucks for every wolf I got. You know who paid me? Uncle Sam did when we were a territory. And when we became a State, we did not allow that. So let us do our job as a State, instead of having this Congress try to stop it with an agency. So I am asking my colleagues to vote for the law, as you should uphold as you took your oath for this office, the law. And if you continue this misinformation, I feel sorry for you, and I feel sorry for the interest groups. So, Madam Speaker, I do urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. WAGNER ). The gentleman is reminded to address the Chair. Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, just in mild response, I am, I believe, heartened to know—that may be the wrong verb—but, at least, respect my friend and colleague from Alaska’s notion or assertion that these terrible, inhumane hunting practices, which we have talked about for the last hour—whether it is gassing wolves in the den or shooting bears from the helicopter or using bait for the bears or many of the iron leg traps—that all these things do not occur in Alaska on the wildlife refuges; that they are illegal in Alaska. If that is so, that is an excellent thing. I wonder why the need for the Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the Fish and Wildlife regulations if none of these are, in fact, happening. In any case, there is still a legitimate debate about whether the Fish and Wildlife regulation contravenes ANILCA and the state establishment act. Hopefully, this doesn’t have to go to court in order to do that, but I think there seems to be enough judicial precedent that if it did go to court, the Fish and Wildlife regulations would be upheld. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, we are here to repeal a rule issued by the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service to restrict hunting on the national wildlife refuges in Alaska. This rule is a solution. The only problem is no one knows for what it is a solution because there is no problem. And the sad part is that means that this rule is basically a useless rule. It has no efficacy to it. Despite the assertions that had been made repeatedly and a cacophony of all sorts of practices that are seeming to be wrong and bad, this rule doesn’t do that. This rule does not abandon any of the practices you are talking about on subsistence hunting, only on nonsubsistence hunting, which simply means that, if you are classified as a subsistence hunter, anything that the other side talked about and raled about is actually allowed by the silly rule. That is why the rule makes no sense. The State of Alaska had it under control, and there is no real problem that is solved by this rule that is totally inefficient, but did make something nice about it. Now, it makes things worse because it is talking about predator control only on nonsubsistence hunting. Unfortunately, the predators don’t know, when they go after their prey, whether that prey is designed for a subsistence hunter or a recreation hunter. They haven’t learned to distinguish that yet. Ergo, how you administer this law is totally ineffective. It is impossible to do so, and what you do is simply make a blanket approach so that everyone gets harmed in the same equal fashion. That is what Fish and Wildlife has decided to do. In addition to that, yes, it is illegal. It usurps State authority, and it usurps it very clearly. You know, it is amazing to me. I cannot believe that in the first Congress that we had, the Founding Fathers were there coming up with the Bill of Rights and the 10th Amendment, they thought the 10th Amendment would eventually some day be imagined by a bureaucrat in Washington to overrule Congress on matters that were clearly intended for State discretion, but that is precisely what we have done here. This rule violates three congressionally passed statutes that have precedence on this particular issue. And this rule violates Federal law passed by Congress on three separate occasions. What was supposed to be envisioned with this system was a cooperative relationship between the State and the Federal Government. What this rule simply does is allow for Fish and Wildlife on the Federal level to have supremacy, to destroy that cooperation and coordination and take over control totally. That is wrong. It should never be there. There are 16 different refuges up there. That is 76 million acres of land now going to be controlled by the Fish and Wildlife system here in Washington. That is more acreage than 46 of the 50 States that we have. And, once again, for many of those people, this hunting is a source of subsistence up there. Here is the bottom line: Mr. BLUMENAUER came up here and said, why don’t we let the professionals make their decisions. They do. Those professionals are the Alaska Department of Fish and Game who know exactly what they are doing, they know the area, and they know the animals. The socalled helicopter hunting that was raled against up here is not done by any recreational hunter. Alaska doesn’t allow that. The Alaska Fish and Game will do that for management control based on scientific purposes and reasons and that only. This rule doesn’t change any of that. No. I’m sorry, this rule actually doesn’t change any of the recreational hunting, which is already outlawed by the State of Alaska. It only stops the Fish and Wildlife system of Alaska from simply doing their job as they know how to do it. I include in the RECORD a letter supported by 27 different organizations all dealing with outdoor life in support of this particular resolution. 
FEBRUARY 6, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives Washington, DC. Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY , Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER MCCARTHY: We write representing organizations that collectively include millions of wildlife conservationists, hunter conservationists, wildlife enthusiasts, and wildlife scientists, in strong support of H.J. Res. 49 from Cong. Young (AK), which would nullify the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) final rule ‘‘NonSubsistence Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation and Closure Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska’’ (81 Fed. Reg. 52248 (August 5, 2016)). Our community exhausted all Executive Branch appeals and remedies urging the FWS to slow down the Proposed Rule, and revise it to reflect a proposal mutually agreed to by the State of Alaska and the FWS; all to no end. It is time for Congress to nullify this final rule. This final rule boldly preempts the authority of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to manage wildlife for both recreational and subsistence hunting on NWRs, which authority of the state is affirmed by Congress in the Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska National Interests Land Conservation Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act. The FWS final rule was premised on meeting as a priority the FWS policy on Biological Integrity, Diversity and Environmental Health; which 
would inadvisably set a precedent nationally. Many members of our organizations enjoy Alaska’s bounty of fish and wildlife resources and their habitats for unrivaled hunting, fishing and outdoor experiences. The sustainable management of these natural resources needs to be led by the State working in cooperation with the FWS. We urge that you favorably consider H.J. Res. 49 which will restore the jurisdictional state federal relationship as Congress has previously directed. Thank you very much for your consideration of our concerns about this harmful and illegal rule which if left unremedied, significantly affects the use and appreciation of the magnificent natural resources found in Alaska. Sincerely, Archery Trade Association, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, Council to Advance Hunting and the Shooting Sports, Dallas Safari Club, Delta Waterfowl Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, Houston Safari Club, Masters of Foxhounds Association, Mule Deer Foundation, National Rifle Association, National Shooting Sports Foundation, National Trappers Association, National Wild Turkey Federation, Orion the Hunter’s Institute.

Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, this comes from groups all over the Nation who understand what is going on and also realize the problem of this—I mean, there are some people who might think this only deals with Alaska. Technically, it does. The problem is, if this happens to Alaska, if the ability of the Federal Government to supersede the State happens in Alaska, this could also happen to anyone of the lower 48 States. We are simply one lawsuit away from Fish and Wildlife Service being either allowed or required to order similar regulations for everything across the lower 48 States as well. And that is what is so difficult and impossible to understand. Look, let me try and sum it up this way: None of the practices that have been railed about today actually are existing, and any of those that are are easily controlled by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The underlying premise, both of the rule that the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior did and the underlying premise of most of the debate that has happened here on the floor, is that only somebody who lives here in Washington has the intelligence, the foresight, the vision to make these kind of rules that unfortunately people in Alaska are simply too dumb to do it. You are a bunch of redneck hicks that don’t understand how to rule yourself. You don’t understand science. You barely have television. I don’t know what it is, but why do we have this mindset that only Washington can make these decisions when actually the States have proven, not only that are they capable, they are superior to what happens from this Department here in Washington. That is what this is about, an illegal rule that simply takes away from the States what they are doing and what they are doing well; and that is why this should be opposed. That is why this rule should be pulled away. This midnight rule, once again, should be taken back. Allow them to start over and do something intelligently. At least, recognize the professionals—the real professionals who work in the States to make this system work. They can do it. They have done it. Allow them to do their jobs, and protect the rest of us from any judge saying, oh, if it happened in Alaska, maybe it can happen in your State as well. That is the fear. This is a rule passed by Fish and Wildlife at the last minute of the Obama administration that doesn’t solve anything and will be impossible to administer. It violates everything that has gone on before. Vote for this rule. Bring back sanity and allow the States to do their job as they are supposed to do and as the law prescribes for them to do. I urge support of this. I don’t know if you are undecided on whether I was for this resolution or not. Just, for the record, yes, I support this resolution. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 123, the previous question is ordered on the joint resolution. The question is on engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the joint resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF FINAL RULE BY SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 123, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 43) providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule submitted by Secretary of Health and Human Services relating to compliance with title X requirements by project recipients in selecting subrecipients, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 123, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: H.J. R ES. 43 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services relating to compliance with title X requirements by project recipients in selecting subrecipients (81 Fed. Reg. 91852; December 19, 2016), and such rule shall have no force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACK ) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 43, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. b1345 Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my resolution of disapproval, H.J. Res. 43, which uses the authority of the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Obama administration’s 11thhour rule forcing States like Tennessee to fund abortion providers. I want to begin today by stipulating very clearly what this resolution is about because, while I am unapologetically prolife, you don’t have to be in order to support this resolution. You just have to believe in the Tenth Amendment. Despite the histrionics you may hear on the other side of the aisle today, with today’s resolution, we are not, we are not, one, voting to defund Planned Parenthood in any way, shape, or form; we are not voting to cut title X funding; and we are not voting to restrict abortion rights. Madam Speaker, we are simply voting today to affirm the rights of States to fund the healthcare providers that best suit their needs, without fear of reprisal from their own Federal Government. I didn’t realize this was a partisan issue. It shouldn’t be, because that is how the title X grant program functioned for more than 45 years, until the Obama administration decided to leave this parting gift to abortion industry on its way out the door. For me, this is a personal issue. As a registered nurse, I know that vulnerable women seeking true comprehensive care deserve better than abortion centric facilities like Planned Parenthood. So, as a State legislator, I worked within my authority to make sure that Tennessee honored the will of 
our prolife populace and steered our State’s share of title X dollars away from healthcare providers that performed abortion. As a result, our share of title X grants have been sent exclusively to the Tennessee Department of Health, which then allocates them to the county health departments and other qualified providers that protect the lives of the most vulnerable. That was Tennessee’s right, and it has been able to exercise that right while protecting access to comprehensive care for those who are most in need. As a matter of fact, according to HHS’ own 2015 title X Family Planning Annual Report, our State provided care under title X to more than 75,000 Tennesseeans. That means that we served even more citizens than the more populated States like Michigan and Virginia. But in December of last year, the Obama administration decided to intervene, setting unprecedented new parameters on how States must select title X grantees that were specifically designed to prop up its political allies in the abortion industry. With my resolution, I am proposing that we go back just a few short weeks prior to December 15, 2016, the day before the Obama administration decided to reconfigure this 45yearold program with its illconceived order. That is all my resolution does is to take us back 45 years to the way the program has operated. I urge my colleagues to give States the freedom and the flexibility to take care of their citizens the best way that they know how by voting ‘‘yes’’ on this H.J. Res. 43. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. Madam Speaker, we are not even a full month into the new Presidency. Yet, the President and the Republicans in Congress have already launched numerous attacks on women’s health and access to care. Here’s just a few of the examples aside from today. They are charging ahead to dismantle the Affordable Care Act without making any promises to preserve the vital protections for women that are in that bill. They imposed and dramatically expanded the global gag rule, which harms women’s access to health care around the world. And just after the historic Women’s March, House Republicans passed H.R. 7, an extreme bill that effectively bans private insurance companies from covering comprehensive healthcare services. But here we are again today, with another bill that threatens access to family planning care for millions of our most vulnerable citizens by attacking title X. Title X is the only Federal program dedicated solely to family planning, which includes a range of services that help women and their partners prepare for pregnancy and ensure healthy spacing between births. Title X helps 4 million people who are uninsured. Title X centers also play an important role in reducing unintended pregnancy, and title X centers are also major points of access in our safety net. Six in 10 women who go to a title X center consider it their major source of health care. What this rule that Republicans want to roll back does is it simply reinforces longstanding requirements that say that States cannot discriminate against providers for reasons that are unrelated to their qualifications to perform family planning services when distributing title X funding. In other words, if an organization provides abortions with its own private money but it qualifies for title X, it can still get that funding. Now I keep hearing from my colleagues that this violates states’ rights, but that completely ignores how Federal programs work. Virtually all Federal funding opportunities require a State to adhere to certain standards to ensure policy goals are met, and that is exactly what this rule did. Republicans will also argue that community health centers can fill all the gaps created and accessed by denying these centers title X funding. This claim has been debunked on numerous occasions. For example, in 21 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood center, Planned Parenthood is the only safety net provider in the area. That is why the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated, if Planned Parenthood were defunded, as many as 390,000 women would lose access to care, and 650,000 women would have reduced access. That is why repealing this rule is a serious problem. Just this afternoon I read a quote, and here’s what it said: ‘‘Patients and doctors should be making the big decisions—not government bureaucrats.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds. Let me say that again. ‘‘Patients and doctors should be making the big decisions—not government bureaucrats.’’ Who said this? Margaret Sanger? No. Cecile Richards? No. Hillary Clinton? No. The person who said this this afternoon is the Speaker of the House, PAUL RYAN. I couldn’t agree with him any more when it comes to title X family planning money. This should be made by patients and their doctors, not by bureaucrats in Washington. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), who has been a champion for life and been fighting for life for a long time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentlewoman for her extraordinary leadership on the life issue. Madam Speaker, subsidized by over $500 million taxpayer dollars each year, Planned Parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons a baby to death every 2 minutes, killing over 7 million innocent children since 1973. Undercover videos in 2015 exposed, in numbing candor, several highlevel Planned Parenthood leaders nonchalantly talking about procuring children’s organs for a price. They describe altering gruesome dismemberment procedures to preserve intact livers, hearts, and lungs from freshly killed babies. All of this begs the question, Madam Speaker, why are U.S. taxpayers giving half a billion dollars each year to Planned Parenthood? H.J. Res. 43 simply allows States to redirect funds away from abortion clinics and does not reduce funding for title X by so much as a penny. Those funds are just redirected to other health clinics that provide women’s health care and don’t engage in abortion. In midDecember, on his way out the door, former President Obama finalized a rule that coerces States to fund Planned Parenthood with their title X money. Prior to the Obama rule, States had chosen, five of them, to award title X funds to nonPlanned Parenthood entities. These five States, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Ohio, account for nearly $16 million in annual title X funding and serve over 279,000 individuals a year. These five States redirected those funds to other health clinics. But under the Obama rule, these State recipients are threatened with losing all—I say again—all of their title X support if they do not comply. This is the definition of coercion. The Obama administration essentially told States: You must use your family planning dollars to support abortionists, or we will take away your family planning dollars. I thank the gentlewoman for her courage, for her insight, and for offering this rule for our consideration today. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ), the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 43. This resolution is simply another attack on women’s health and another attempt by Republicans to limit women’s access to highquality, essential care. For decades, title X family planning program has funded grants that provide millions of Americans each year with access to a broad range of preventive health services, including contraception care and cancer screenings. Title X is a critical safety net for low income women and teens; and for many patients, this program is their only source of health care. 
But the Republicans want to limit access to these services and allow States to discriminate against certain providers, all as part of their ongoing ideological crusade against abortion. I stress, this resolution would permit States to prohibit reproductive healthcare providers from participating in the title X program, and would allow States to block access to care if the provider separately performs abortions or is affiliated with health centers that do. Now, we already have seen what happens when States take actions to discriminate against providers in the title X program. Access goes down, the unintended pregnancy rate goes up, and the spread of sexually transmitted infections increases. So I would urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution because Republicans should not be entitled to pick and choose providers in the title X program and play politics with women’s health. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ), a freshman and a physician. Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, this past December, our past President finalized a rule requiring States to fund Planned Parenthood through title X funding. Today I rise as a cosponsor of and in support of this joint resolution, H.J. Res. 43, which repeals this Obama rule and allows States like mine, Kansas, to choose how to best allocate title X funds. The Obama rule is yet another example of government overreach that tries to force my State to fund Planned Parenthood. Redirecting Federal funds away from abortion providers does not reduce funds for other title X programs. Instead, this will allow even more funding available for county health departments and other public health clinics for family planning, sexually transmitted disease testing, and lifestyle choices education. While Planned Parenthood remains a political organization that spent tens of thousands of dollars in the last election to oppose prolife candidates, let me stop and salute the nurses and social workers back home at the Barton County Health Department where I worked for years, and salute my fellow doctors, Dr. Perry Smith and Dr. Bill King, and everyone’s favorite nurse practitioner, Sheila Hein, who dedicated themselves to helping women. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ). Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I hope the women of America are watching. Let there be no doubt about the actions of congressional Republicans and the Trump administration. They will oppose your right to make your own health decision and limit access to your reproductive health care at every available juncture. Rather than work to create jobs, House Republicans are helping State officials block women from getting contraception and other reproductive health services. Today’s bill would particularly harm the neediest Americans, as it could deny them the opportunity to visit the health provider of their choice, which in many instances may be the only provider available within hours of their home. Sadly, this will be just one of the many assaults on women’s rights in the 115th Congress. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ), who is the chairman of our Republican Study Committee. Mr. MESSER. Madam Speaker, the Federal Government should not fund abortions, and it should not force States to fund them either. That is one reason this body recently voted to make the Hyde amendment permanent and governmentwide. The vast majority of Americans support this policy as a matter of conscience and agree that tax dollars should not fund abortion procedures. Today’s bill is consistent with that principle. But despite the rhetoric across the aisle, the bill permits, but does not require, States to direct title X funds to health providers that do not provide abortions. Without this bill, States would be forced to fund the abortion industry by Federal bureaucrats. This is an issue of states’ rights as well as one of conscience. b1400 I am proud to support this measure, stand up for States, and defend life. I want to thank my colleague, DIANE BLACK , for her hard work and leadership on getting this bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ). Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for her leadership. For almost 50 years, a law called title X has ensured that women across America, no matter their station in life, can receive expert advice on how and when to plan their families, on contraceptives, and also receive breast and cervical cancer screenings. It is smart public policy. It often allows women to complete their education and to get a job to become financially independent. It is cost effective for all of us because it saves public money on prenatal, maternity, and newborn care, and it has worked to decrease teenage and unintended pregnancies. In Florida, in 2014 alone, over 160,000 were counseled through nonprofit agencies and community health centers, and over 38,000 unintended pregnancies were prevented, which helped prevent about 18,000 unintended births. That resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings. Plus, it is difficult to put a price tag on the ability of someone to become selfsufficient and get a good start in life. Title X is critical for many of my neighbors in Florida, and it should be protected. So it is sad to see my Republican colleagues target working families and young women to restrict access to contraceptives, family planning, and other health services. If Republicans are successful, it would only harm our communities, and in doing so, you are targeting the folks who need the help the most. These politically motivated attacks on women’s health are a distraction from the real issues. Across the country, women, parents, moms, and dads need greater economic and personal security, not less. That is what Congress should be focused on. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this harmful resolution. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY), who is my classmate. Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 43. Congress must use its authority to strike this rule and stop the Federal Government from forcing States to funnel taxpayer money to abortion providers. This rule is wrong on process and it is wrong on policy. First of all, States have every right to put in place reasonable guidelines for how their Federal dollars are spent. For Washington to attempt to coerce States in this way would be bad enough, but for unelected bureaucrats in the Department of Health and Human Services to go around Congress at the eleventh hour of the Obama administration is just outrageous. Madam Speaker, I think we all agree that lowincome women should have access to essential title X services, but why is it necessary for those services to be funded at the Nation’s largest provider of abortion? It isn’t, of course, but the abortion industry and its supporters want us to believe that it is. When it comes to funding, they like to pretend that abortion doesn’t exist and that Planned Parenthood is the only place where women can get health care, but that is not true. The truth is that there are more than 13,000 federally qualified and rural health centers that offer lowcost health care to women. These centers outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics 20 to 1; they just don’t preform abortions. Understanding this, some States have rightly enacted laws and policies redirecting title X dollars away from abortion providers and toward these noncontroversial clinics. If the true goal here were to ensure women’s health care, no one should have a problem with that. But that wasn’t the goal, and everybody knows it. There is a reason people call this rule President Obama’s parting gift to Planned Parenthood. It was a blatant, transparent attempt to preserve the 
pipeline of funding to the Nation’s largest abortion business. It was wrong, and I urge my colleagues to vote to nullify it today. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ). Ms. SPEIER. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership. Madam Speaker, it is very hard for me to listen to the conversation on the other side of the aisle because it is a conversation they are having with themselves, and it is a conversation we are having with ourselves. Let me be really clear. This is not about Planned Parenthood and abortion because we already know that Planned Parenthood gets no funding for abortions in this country, pure and simple. Planned Parenthood gets funding through title X to provide services for breast cancer screenings, cancer screenings, STDs, and contraception. What my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing to say is: We just want to make sure Planned Parenthood doesn’t get a dime. Just squeeze every dime out of them that may be Federal dollars, even though they provide a really important health service. So I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I guess what you are saying is, to the 80,000 women last year who were diagnosed with cancer because they went to a Planned Parenthood facility and of the 800,000 that were screened for cancer, you would rather see them die. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. NOEM), who is my fellow Ways and Means Committee member. Mrs. NOEM. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 43 which overturns an Obamaera regulation forcing States to administer title X healthcare funding to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Time and again, this Congress has risen with bipartisan support to oppose the taxpayer funding of abortions. Annual provisions, including the Hyde amendment, have been passed repeatedly and have saved an estimated 2 million innocent lives. Today, we rise again to stop the taxpayer funding of abortion providers. I want to be clear. Nothing we do today will take a penny from women’s health. Instead, we are empowering States to redirect these funds to community health centers and hospitals that offer more comprehensive coverage to women. In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood performed more than 300,000 abortions while failing to provide even the most basic services, like prenatal care, at many of their facilities. Hospitals and federally qualified health centers not only offer a broader range of services, but also greater accessibility in many cases. While there is only one Planned Parenthood center in South Dakota, we have six federally qualified health centers that operate in 45 service sites and serve more than 54,000 individuals per year. These care centers offer lowincome families health services, but they don’t perform abortions. We can support women’s health—and, specifically, health care for lowincome women—without supporting abortion providers. Simply put, H.J. Res. 43 does not restrict access or funding to health care for lowincome women. What it does do is help protect taxpayers from funding abortion providers. It empowers the States to direct healthcare funding to organizations that truly do support women’s health, and it makes strides toward protecting the most vulnerable among us, the unborn. I thank Chairman BLACK for her commitment to this issue, and I am proud to stand beside her as a partner in this effort. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from the State of Washington (Ms. DELBENE). Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, another week, another attack on women’s health. Only 6 days ago, the Senate confirmed a Secretary of Health and Human Services who opposes women’s access to nocost birth control—a man who claimed that not one woman has struggled to afford contraception. Now, House leaders are working to eradicate the number of places where women can access birth control. It is unacceptable. For more than 40 years, title X has been a bipartisan program that helps vulnerable Americans get basic health care like cancer screenings, HIV tests, and contraception. In 2014 alone, it prevented over 900,000 unintended pregnancies. But if this resolution passes, millions will find themselves without access to the essential care that they need, especially those in rural and underserved communities. I have said it before and I will say it again: Our constituents deserve better. It is time to focus on the priorities that matter to the American people. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ), who is a fellow Ways and Means Committee member and advocate for children. Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative BLACK . Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 43. This resolution will overturn an Obama administration rule that forces States to direct Federal funds to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. States receive Federal funding to support family planning services, and they have the discretion to distribute these title X funds in the way that best serves their communities. Many States have exercised their discretion to direct title X funding to community health centers and family health clinics that do not provide abortions and withhold funding from abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. It is just common sense that States know the needs of their people and their communities better than Washington bureaucrats do. The States should be able to decide how these Federal funds are distributed. Unfortunately, the Obama administration disagreed, so they issued a last minute regulation in their final days in office that would force States to distribute funding to abortion providers. Their rule would take away States’ abilities to direct title X funds to providers that offer comprehensive care but do not participate in abortion. It would force States to enable the flow of funds to Planned Parenthood and others in the abortion industry. I think it is reprehensible. Now Congress has the opportunity to right this wrong and undo the massive overreach. We are taking action to defend taxpayers and defend life by using the Congressional Review Act to overturn this rule. Overturning this rule won’t reduce funding for women’s health care. In fact, it will let States direct these funds in the way that is best for their citizens. It will ensure States can support women’s heath as well as protect the unborn. Madam Speaker, this resolution is essential to rolling back executive overreach and standing up for the sanctity of life. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.J. Res. 43. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership. This is not about States, and it is not about the Federal Government. It’s about women and the rights of women. H.J. Res. 43 could impact nearly 4 million primarily lowincome patients that receive family planning services at title X sites, annually, across the United States. Of those 4 million patients, approximately 69 percent had incomes at or below the Federal poverty line, while 61 percent of those patients claimed the title X clinic as their only regular source of health care. About 60 percent of women who access care from family planning health centers consider it their main source; 4 in 10, it is their only source of care. Approximately 1.5 million Planned Parenthood patients benefit from the Nation’s family planning program. Approximately 20 percent of these patients identify as Hispanic and approximately 50 percent as African Americans. Every public dollar invested in Planned Parenthood, $7.09 is saved in Medicaidrelated costs. Planned Parenthood centers are roughly onethird of the program’s clients, although Planned Parenthood health centers comprise 10 percent of the publicly supported safety and family net. This resolution for which we should vote ‘‘no’’ is going to take away money from people who are in need, who need 
health care. Where are the Republicans on women’s rights? Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 43, a congressional resolution rescinding a rule promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services providing important protections to ensure that women, men, and young people can see trusted reproductive health care providers, like Planned Parenthood, through the Title X family planning program. I oppose the disapproval resolution because it is nothing more than a blatant attempt to persecute Planned Parenthood and make it easier for the state politicians to take away people’s health care, specifically, the four million people who rely on Title X for birth control and other care. From birth control, to wellwoman exams, to cancer screenings, millions of Americans nationwide turn to Planned Parenthood and other safety net reproductive health providers as their trusted source of health care. Many of these Americans, including lowincome women, women of color, and those living in rural areas, are uninsured and rely on important public health programs for affordable health care, including Medicaid and the Title X family planning program. But their access to health care is under attack across the country because in recent years because politicians in at least 14 states have taken action to block access to care through Title X, willfully ignoring the law, the recommendations of public health experts, and the clear and present need in their communities. In September 2016, HHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) titled ‘‘Compliance With Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients’’ aiming to explicitly bar these types of actions. HHS opened the proposed regulation to public comment, which closed in October 2016 and garnered widespread support, with 91% of the roughly 145,000 responses in favor of the rule. Madam Speaker, Title X provides lifesaving, preventive care to millions of people and is costeffective. Title X helps ensure more than four million persons of lowincome have health care in this country. In fact, Title X is the only way that millions of lowincome women or uninsured women have access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI tests, and other basic care. Eightyfive percent of the people served by Planned Parenthood’s family planning program have incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and 48 percent are uninsured. In 2015 alone, Title X provided nearly 800,000 Pap tests, breast exams to 1 million women, nearly 5 million tests for STIs, and 1 million HIV tests. About 60 percent of women who access care from a family planning health center consider it their main source of health care; for 4 in 10, it is their only source of care. Approximately 1.5 million Planned Parenthood patients benefit from the nation’s family planning program, 78 percent of whom live with incomes of 150 percent of the federal poverty level or less, the equivalent of $35,775 a year for a family of four in 2014. Approximately 20 percent of these patients identify as Hispanic; and approximately 15 percent identify as African American. For every public dollar invested in family planning, $7.09 is saved in Medicaidrelated costs; that is savings to both federal and state governments and taxpayers. Planned Parenthood health centers serve roughly onethird of the program’s clients, although Planned Parenthood health centers comprise 10 percent of publicly supported safety net family planning centers. Planned Parenthood health centers are located in the communities where access to care is most needed. More than half of Planned Parenthood’s health centers across the U.S. are in rural and underserved communities with limited access to health care. Seventyfive percent of Planned Parenthood patients have incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). The idea that other providers could absorb Planned Parenthood’s patients has been resoundingly dismissed by experts. In fact, the American Public Health Association called the idea ‘‘ludicrous.’’ Planned Parenthood health centers are also considerably more likely to offer Title X patients a broader range of contraceptive methods than other providers. In a study of Community Health Centers (CHCs), among CHCs that reported an independent family planning clinic in their largest site’s community, 69 percent reported referring their patients to providers specializing in reproductive health services, like Planned Parenthood health centers, for family planning care. H.J. Res. 43 is a blatant effort to embolden states to try to block women from getting birth control and other preventive care at highly qualified family providers. By issuing this important protection, the Obama Administration made sure that politicians cannot ignore the law and stand in the way of the care that women need. I urge all Members to vote No on H.J. Res. 43. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter and article in opposition to this resolution. 
FEBRUARY 14, 2017. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC. Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER , Senate Minority Leader, Washington, DC. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARLEADER MCCONNELL , SPEAKER RYAN, LEADER SCHUMER AND LEADER PELOSI : As or ganizations committed to improving access to health care for all people, the undersigned groups write to strongly oppose H.J. Res. 43 and S.J. Res. 13, legislation to overturn the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) final rules updating the regulations governing the Title X family planning program. This critical rule clarifies and reinforces the longstanding requirement that health care providers may not be excluded from the program for reasons unrelated to their qualifications to perform Title Xfunded services. The Title X family planning program is a vital source of family planning and related preventive care for lowincome, uninsured, and young people across the country. Every year, more than 4 million individuals, including LGBTQ people and people living in rural and medically underserved areas, access lifesaving care such as birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV at Title Xfunded health centers. Title X cannot succeed unless states and other Title X grantees include providers that are optimally qualified to furnish the range of Title Xfunded services according to national standards of care. This task becomes all but impossible if experienced, reputable reproductive health care providers are arbitrarily barred from fair consideration. An increasing number of states have nevertheless tried to block trusted reproductive health care providers from participating in Title X. To date, at least 14 states have taken official action to target and exclude otherwise eligible providers from the program. Other states have threatened to follow suit. Mounting evidence shows that the exclusion of reproductive health care providers from publicly funded health programs harms health outcomes, widens disparities, and erects new barriers to care. When the very providers that are best suited to deliver Title Xfunded services are targeted for exclusion based on factors wholly unrelated to the program’s objectives, federal health care resources are poorly and inefficiently distributed and care is less likely to reach individuals in need. Ideological exclusions of trusted, highly qualified providers from federally supported health programs undermine health care access and jeopardize the health of the patients these programs serve. Title X patients deserve the opportunity to obtain highquality family planning care from the providers that are best equipped to provide it. As such, we strongly support HHS’s rule reinforcing that grantees must design their provider networks based on the ability to provide care to Title X patients in an effective manner—not based on the political preferences of state lawmakers. We strongly urge you to oppose H.J. Res. 43 and S.J. Res. 13, legislation that will overturn this important rule and embolden states to attempt to block women from getting birth control and other preventive care at highly qualified family providers.

[From Mother Jones, Jan. 31, 2017] SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE THE FIRST STEP TODEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD  (By Hannah Levintova) Leticia Parra, a mother of five scraping by on income from her husband’s sporadic construction jobs, relied on the Planned Parenthood clinic in San Carlos, an impoverished town in South Texas, for breast cancer screenings, free birth control pills and pap smears for cervical cancer. But the clinic closed in October, along with more than a dozen others in the state, after financing for women’s health was slashed by twothirds by the Republicancontrolled Legislature. The cuts, which left many lowincome women with inconvenient or costly options, grew out of the effort to eliminate state support for Planned Parenthood. Although the cuts also forced clinics that were not affiliated with the agency to close—and none of them, even the ones run by Planned Parenthood, performed abortions—supporters of the cutbacks said they were motivated by the fight against abortion. In December, the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that would prohibit states from withholding federal funds—including Title X family planning money—from Planned Parenthood. On Monday afternoon, a Republican senator introduced a bill that would reverse it, along with a second bill that would prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal funding—including Medicaid. The bills, from Sen. Joni Ernst (RIowa), would redirect federal funds away from Planned Parenthood to other health care providers. The Hyde Amendment already prohibits federal funds from being used for most abortions, but this legislation would bar lowincome women who rely on Medicaid and Title X funding for subsidized care from obtaining other women’s health care services at Planned Parenthood. ‘‘With a prolife president in the White House and prolife majorities in the House and Senate, we will continue to work together this year to undo the damage done by the Obama administration,’’ wrote Ernst and Rep. Diane Black (RTenn.) in an oped published in the Washington Examiner on Friday, the day of the annual antiabortion March for Life. The text of one of the bills, S. 241, explains that other entities, including ‘‘state and county health departments, community health centers, [and] hospitals,’’ will be able to fill women’s health care needs, including contraception, STI testing, and cervical and breast cancer screening. Many health experts say other health providers would not be able to absorb Planned Parenthood’s patients. An analysis conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, which publishes research on reproductive health, found that in twothirds of the counties that have a Planned Parenthood center, these centers serve at least half the women seeking publicly funded contraceptive care. In onefifth of those counties, Planned Parenthood is the only provider offering subsidized contraceptive care. ‘‘If passed, these bills will cause a national health care crisis, leaving millions with nowhere to go for basic care,’’ said Dana Singiser, vice president of public policy and government affairs for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement. Texas offers an example of what women’s health care looks like when Planned Parenthood is excluded from public funding. In 2011, the state stopped state funds from going to Planned Parenthood, leading to numerous clinic closures. Other health centers attempted to step in, but Medicaid contraception claims declined by 35 percent, suggesting that fewer lowincome women were obtaining contraceptive care. There was also an increase in childbirths among women receiving Medicaid who’d previously received contraception from Planned Parenthood clinics. A bill to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood passed both chambers of Congress last year, but was vetoed by then President Barack Obama. Trump is likely to sign Ernst’s version of this bill should it cross his desk: Throughout his campaign, Trump promised that defunding the women’s health care provider would be a priority for his administration. 
Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ). Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise with my Republican colleagues in support of H.J. Res. 43. Under the Obama administration’s lastminute rule change to title X funding, States like Texas are prevented from establishing criteria that would eliminate abortion providers from receiving title X grant money. States have the right and responsibility to choose the health providers that best provide and serve the needs of their moms and their babies. During my time in the Texas Legislature, we used the Alternatives to Abortion program. This program provides lowincome pregnant women and their babies care items during pregnancy, and it also provides preventing information. It also funds the counseling referral and pregnancy information hotline and the Texas Pregnancy Care Network. Additionally, this program supports groups in maternity homes, provides referrals to community and social service programs like child care, and offers classes on life skills, budgeting, parenting— yes, parenting—stress management, and GED preparation. b1415 Nationally, 13,000 federally qualified health centers and rural health centers provide comprehensive healthcare services to lowincome moms and their babies. In my district, the 14th Congressional District, over 30 clinics are committed to our community, including moms and their babies. These organizations do a terrific job of supporting women, and yes, their babies, too. We are not cutting funding. We are not cutting care. We are ensuring that Federal health centers have the funds and the support they need to give the women and the babies the care that they deserve. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for her efforts to stand up for women and their babies. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, let me thank Congresswoman DEGETTE for her tireless leadership in fighting for women’s health, for healthy families in general, and for our children. I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 43. It is no surprise that, once again, congressional Republicans are trying to undermine women’s access to health care and basic family planning services. This ideological crusade—and that is what it is—will hurt those who need help the most, including lowincome women, women of color, and young women. It would also deny thousands of families from choosing their provider of choice—and sometimes the only accessible provider—under title X. Not only is this resolution antiwoman, it is also counterproductive. We know that for every dollar spent on title X family planning, we save more than $7 on Medicaidrelated costs. But my Republican colleagues are so determined to take family planning options away from lowincome women that they are prepared to put ideological perspectives above public health. As a member of the Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I, unfortunately, see these attacks on women’s health all too well. Last year, Republicans tried to completely eliminate funding for title X. So don’t be fooled. This piece of legislation is not about Planned Parenthood. It is about Members of Congress trying to control women’s bodies. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative BLACK for her work on this subject. I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 43, a joint resolution to stop an Obama administration rule that will force States to send taxpayer dollars to abortion providers, including abortion giant Planned Parenthood. In addition to last year’s shocking videos where we heard highranking Planned Parenthood officials use jarring language such as doing a less crunchy type of procedure to preserve body parts, we have recently learned in Pennsylvania that Planned Parenthood was using false advertising on its websites. The Pennsylvania Family Institute recently found that each Planned Parenthood affiliate in Pennsylvania does not provide prenatal services, even though all 27 Planned Parenthood locations in Pennsylvania had listed ‘‘prenatal’’ as a service on their website. After these clinics were called and asked, Do you provide prenatal services, not one had any such services to offer, but they did offer terminations. Planned Parenthood has since removed 
the word ‘‘prenatal’’ from their booking appointments website. They should not be receiving one dime of Federal dollars when they are actively attempting to deceive women to get them in the door. Abortion is not health care. Subsidizing the destruction of human life with Federal dollars in the name of family planning is simply unconscionable. I urge my colleagues to join me in defending the lives of the unborn and support this important joint resolution. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHU). Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 43. This bill is another in a long line of attacks on women’s health, women’s choices, and women’s lives. For 50 years, title X has been the only federally funded program dedicated to providing comprehensive family planning services for lowincome patients. Thanks to title X, these women have gained access to services like birth control, STD testing, cancer screenings, counseling, and sex education. For most of its history, title X has received broad, bipartisan support from Congress. That is because it has helped millions of women and families. But now, Republicans are using this longstanding program to continue their attack on women’s health. Last year, Republicans eliminated title X funding from their budget altogether. This bill is just the latest attempt to do the same thing by putting family planning resources out of reach for poor women across the country. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let healthy pregnancies and healthy families become a luxury reserved only for the wealthy. It must remain a right for all. I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ), chair of our Values Action Team. Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my unwavering support for the lives of the unborn, to stand in solidarity with the States, and to urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.J. Res. 43. This resolution does not cut a dime from family planning funding available to States. It simply enables States to direct the funding towards nonabortion ‘‘whole women’’ healthcare providers, such as rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers. It is important to remember that, for every Planned Parenthood clinic, there are 20 federally qualified health centers. Each year, these centers serve over 21 million American women. This is almost eight times the impact of Planned Parenthood clinics. We know that Federal law requires that federally qualified health centers provide mammograms, prenatal services, and emergency medical services, none of which are offered by Planned Parenthood clinics. The States were wise to prioritize such quality health care for women with title X funds. Prior to this new, heavyhanded, agendadriven policy, the States maintained the flexibility to determine grant recipients. This lastminute Obama administration rule effectively nullifies the policy of 13 States that want to prioritize women’s health over abortion. This Obamaera rule could also impair funding for another 10 States that have chosen comprehensive care over abortionfocused clinics like Planned Parenthood. But it gets worse. Of the 13 States impacted by this rule, five States—Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Ohio—could lose almost $16 million in title X funding for failing to abide by the rule. This regulation forces these States to forego their title X funding for all of the women in their State. Today’s resolution resolves this encroachment on the States, rolls back this lastminute rule, and restores flexibility to the States so that women can receive the health care they deserve. I would like to thank Chairman BLACK for her work on this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.J. Res. 43. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY ). Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, the war on women is escalating and more dangerous with H.J. Res. 43. Let’s not beat around the bush. Let’s call this joint resolution what it really is. It is a backdoor attempt to restrict access to a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion. We all know that Federal funding for abortion is already prohibited, but this goes further—much further. It cuts off funding for contraception, screenings, and treatment if a provider also offers abortions paid for with private funds. Providers either stop doing abortions or they lose the Federal funds they need to keep their doors open to serve their communities. In other words, the supporters of this resolution are willing to sacrifice women’s access to basic healthcare services in order to stamp out abortion. It is cruel, it is wrong, and I would say it is discriminatory. When is the last time this body was called upon to cut off access to basic health care for men? Vote ‘‘no.’’ Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. THOMAS J. R OONEY ). Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, as one of his final acts in office, President Obama issued a rule requiring that States give title X family planning fund grants to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. States have always had the autonomy to distribute these grants to providers that they choose. Obama took that freedom away from States by requiring them to directly fund abortions under the false assertion that this provides women with greater access to health care. That is just not true. What people seem to forget is that for every 1 Planned Parenthood facility in the United States, there are 20 federally funded community health centers that stand ready and eager to provide health services to women and don’t perform abortions. States should be able to make their own healthcare decisions. By passing this resolution, we return that power to the States. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL ), the chair of the Democratic Women’s Working Group. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Madam Speaker, for women to thrive in the economic and social opportunities of our Nation, we must have the ability to control our own reproductive lives with full access to healthcare choices. Now, here we go again: another Republican bill aimed at taking us back to the dark, dangerous days when women were prisoners of their own bodies; back to 50 years ago when Katy, a nurse in Florida, had no access to legal contraception or abortion. She was a mother of two, recently divorced. Pregnant and unable to responsibly raise another child, she made an appointment on the phone with a nameless person who met her on a lonely street corner in Miami. She blindfolded her, hid her under a rug in a car, and took her to a garage where she had an abortion. But Katy was one of the lucky ones. She survived. Not so fortunate were the women who threw themselves down stairs or inserted chemicals or coat hangers into their uteruses in order to terminate their pregnancy. Madam Speaker, we will not go back to those dark, dangerous days. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS ), one of our freshman Members. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.J. Res 43, which would overturn the previous administration’s title X family planning funding rule. In December, the Obama administration finalized a misguided rule which dictates that States must send title X family planning grant money to abortion providers. Even more, this rule also threatens to deprive noncompliant States, such as Representative BLACK ’s home State of Tennessee, of all title X family planning funds. This politically motivated requirement was made neither in the interest of protecting life, nor in the interest of the States. Under the rule, States that decline to send title X funds to abortion clinics 
would lose their title X funding completely. If States make the decision they want to use their funding to affirm life, then they should be allowed to do so. This rule blatantly steps all over states’ rights and goes out of its way to favor abortion providers at the same time. Let’s ensure States continue to have the freedom and flexibility to make the right decisions for themselves. That is exactly what I have advocated for my entire career, both in the Statehouse in Indiana and again here on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. I express my strong support for the passage of H.J. Res. 43, introduced by Representative BLACK . b1430 Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Colorado has 15 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 8 minutes remaining. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. JAYAPAL ). Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution. For many people, particularly women, title X funding literally means the difference between receiving reproductive health care or being forced to go without birth control, critical cancer screenings, and other preventive care. For the 4 in 10 women who access health care at title Xfunded providers, cutting this funding would mean cutting their access to health care altogether. For people of color, rural communities, and those who struggle to make ends meet, cutting title X funds will certainly have a disproportionate impact. Let’s be very clear that these funds are not controversial, but the Republican majority in Congress and anti choice groups are doing their best to create a false narrative in order to demonize this funding, which has done nothing but improve the lives of millions of people. Cutting this funding would actually increase the number of unwanted pregnancies by nearly 1 million in just a year alone and would increase abortions by 33 percent. Women need title X so they can continue to make decisions with their doctors. It is 2017, and a woman’s uterus is not a political football. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I must, once again, talk about what this resolution really does. This resolution empowers States. It empowers States that are able to choose to invest in women’s health care over abortion by sending those title X dollars to clinics that do not destroy innocent life. My colleagues on the other side talked about how this is destructive to women’s health. I want to just mention that the true destruction to women’s health is abortion. That is the little girl who is aborted that will never know about being a woman. This bill does nothing to prohibit States from deciding where to best use their dollars, but in States such as mine in Tennessee for the last 6 years, who have made that decision to send their dollars to facilities that they believe give the best women’s health care, comprehensive health care, to over 75,000 women in our State, more than many States that surround us that have larger populations. If this were prohibiting women from getting services, we wouldn’t be so successful with providing services to more than 75,000 women in our State. We haven’t seen a decrease in services. We have seen an increase in services. If you were to ask these women what they thought about services that they are getting in these other facilities such as Department of Health and federally qualified health centers, you would see they are very satisfied because they get comprehensive services that go beyond what places like Planned Parenthood can even provide for them. They do mammograms, they do procedures if there are cancer cells found in a woman’s cervix. So this whole ruse that this is a war on women and that we are taking away women’s right to healthcare services is a ruse. All this does is to say, if a State like Tennessee decides this is the best place to give the best quality of care for a woman, and hopefully their babies and their children—which, if you go to these clinics, you will see them all running around, they have life—it just gives them the choice to do that. Don’t take away that choice from my State. Don’t punish my State because we do what we believe is the best thing for women’s health. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA). Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her leadership on this subject. I am a doctor, and I have worked in lowincome and free clinics, and I know title X funding works. It has impact. Here is how we also know it works: by expanding access to full reproductive services under the Affordable Care Act and contraception, we have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of unintended pregnancies. We are debating the wrong thing here. We should be increasing title X funds right now. We should be debating how we make access to full reproductive services more readily available. That is what the women of America want. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this dangerous bill. I urge my colleagues to understand the women of America are watching. I also urge, if somehow this makes it to the President’s desk: The mothers and daughters, Mr. President, are watching; so be careful here. This is about preserving access to care and full reproductive rights. We are watching. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ). Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, title X family planning services are an essential lifeline for Mainers who need access to highquality preventive and reproductive care, from cancer screenings to STI testings, to birth control. The resolution we are debating today threatens access to these critical services. Every year, Maine’s network of title X providers serves more than 22,000 individuals in nearly every county, including some of the most rural and underserved communities in our State. Sixtyfive percent of last year’s patients had outcomes that qualified them for free or reducedcost services. Family planning health centers often end up being their patients’ primary source of health care. Providers are trusted members of the community. The care they deliver is high quality, and often they are the only affordable local option. Without title X funds, thousands of women and men throughout Maine would struggle to access and afford alternative primary care. At a time when Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan, it is more important than ever to preserve title X as a cornerstone of our safetynet healthcare system. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for her incredible leadership on this issue. Rather than working across the aisle with Democrats to grow our economy, to rebuild older communities, to create new jobs, Republicans are, again, focused on attacking women’s health, undermining healthcare programs that provide preventive care for over 4 million Americans, many lowincome women who would otherwise be uninsured. Eliminating this rule makes it harder for women and families to have access to lifesaving cancer screenings, for example, birth control, and other vital health services. These funds are providing necessary health services, Madam Speaker, and everyone in this debate knows what this is about. These dollars do not support abortion. We know Federal law prohibits these dollars from being used for that purpose, but to hear our friends on the other side, they would imply that is the case. Now, there is and should be a legitimate debate on that subject, but it has been the law and it continues to be the law that these dollars are not used for abortion services. This is about health care. This is about lifesaving health 
care for women, and it ought to be preserved. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE ). Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 43, yet another partisan attack against women’s health care. For more than four decades, title X has helped some of the most underserved women in our country get access to family planning services that otherwise would not have been received. Once again, some of my colleagues believe that they have the right to impose their beliefs on a nonpartisan issue. Instead of allowing women to choose family planning services that are right for them, this Chamber is voting to take that choice away. Instead of attacking legitimate title X qualified providers who serve women across our country, our Chamber should be working to ensure that all Americans have the right to quality health care. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stop this attack on women’s health care. I urge my colleagues to defeat this resolution. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, it is my understanding that the other side is reserving its time to close. Is that correct? Mrs. BLACK. That is correct. Ms. DEGETTE. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK ). Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for all her leadership. We are barely 6 weeks into this new Congress and the Republicans are back at it again, attacking comprehensive health care for American women. The regulation under attack says that in order to be awarded title X funding, you must be able to deliver the services. Those services are family planning and related preventative health services. The majority is correct, we are not talking about abortion because abortion is not funded by title X. Why would Republicans oppose this regulation? Because it allows them a backdoor way to make funding decisions based on ideology, not quality of care. Don’t we want the best health outcomes for the over 4 million patients who benefited last year from HIV tests, breast exams, and contraception coverage under title X? Title Xfunded healthcare providers around this country are highquality professionals who provide needed care for millions of families, many of whom are underserved. I oppose this resolution. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ), a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, this is not a women’s issue or a men’s issue. It is an issue for what is right. People have a right to make health choices. If someone doesn’t believe in abortion, then make that choice for yourself. If someone believes in something else, then they have the right to make that choice. So eligibility for title X funding should be based on a provider’s ability to provide family planning services, period. Whether a provider offers safe and legal abortions with private funds should not be used to prevent women and men from getting preventive care like cancer screenings or HIV tests. That is all the rule requires. It should not be controversial. Yet, here we are. What effect would this Congressional Review Act have? Well, Kansas has given us an ominous preview. When Kansas defunded providers that offered abortion services, the number of Kansans accessing cancer screenings, STI tests, and other care through the title X program plummeted by thousands. A vote for this CRA is a vote to multiply that number. The Americans who will be affected by this CRA will lose the opportunity to see the provider of their choice, sometimes the only viable provider. Why would we want to put women— why would we want to put anybody in that category, where they cannot see the only viable provider because someone else doesn’t like what the doctor can do? I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ My Republican friends always talk about individual freedom and how important it is. This is an individual freedom of a woman’s right to control her own body and to make personal choices on health care. We should not interfere with that. We should allow the most and the best health care to be available to all people. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, Republicans are continuing their crusade to cut off access to comprehensive family planning services. Last year they tried to zero out title X in their budget. This year they intend to repeal ACA’s costfree contraception coverage for women with private insurance. Today Republicans are attempting to stop the flow of title X grants to health centers around the country. Title X grants ensure that lowincome families have access to birth control and can plan their pregnancies so that moms and kids stay healthy. Research has shown that without these vital services, the unintended pregnancy rate would be 33 percent higher and the number of abortions would also be higher. My antichoice Republican colleagues should cheer this program, but instead not only are Republicans trying to defund Planned Parenthood so they won’t be able to provide contraception help, but now we are hypocritically rolling back a rule that allows title X funds to flow to reproductive health centers, which are the most effective providers of title X services and which we were told would provide the contraception and other health services that Planned Parenthood no longer would be able to. b1445 Women are watching us today. They know that this joint resolution is nothing more than another attempt to stop lowincome women from accessing the health care they need and to allow the government to once again step between women and their doctors. It is no secret I support a woman’s constitutional right to access abortion; but even if you don’t and are committed to reducing abortion in this country, you should step up to the plate and support comprehensive and robust family planning for all women. This joint resolution should do the opposite. We should all support contraception for the women of this country. I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution. Ms. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, well, here we are again, considering legislation that would harm women and families. Let’s be clear: House Republicans do not support family planning title X. For years, Republicans have tried to completely eliminate funding for title X through the appropriations process. So think about that. We are debating contraception in 2017—astonishing. Title X provides millions of low and middleincome men and women with access to reproductive healthcare services. The joint resolution we are voting on today would allow States to discriminate against title X providers who perform abortion with nonFederal funds by removing them from the program, leaving patients with few options for the care they need. Again, let’s be clear. If you want to reduce the number of abortions, you need to ensure everyone has access to family planning. Teen pregnancy and the rate of abortion are at historic lows because we have worked to make contraception more affordable and accessible. For over 60 percent of title X patients, the clinics they visit for family planning services are their only regular source of care, and yet we are considering legislation that would result in clinic closures and would prevent men and women from seeing trusted providers in their own communities. Do Republicans oppose cancer screening for cervical breast cancer? Do they oppose STI testing? Do they oppose contraception? The answer seems to be yes because Republicans continue to 
ignore these facts in their effort to harm women’s health. I urge my colleagues to put an end to the war on women and to oppose this very dangerous legislation. Ms. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Madam Speaker, we hear today this really isn’t about denying women and families access to family planning and birth control because States would just simply take that title X money and put it somewhere else. Unfortunately, this seems to be a bit of magical thinking. Even the Congressional Budget Office said that as many as 390,000 women would lose access to care and 650,000 women would have reduced access if legislation like this passed. The fact of the matter is you can’t simply shift all of these people from title X family planning centers like Planned Parenthood to community health centers, as the other side asserts. For one thing, 69 percent of the community health centers actually refer patients to family planning providers like Planned Parenthood, and only 19 percent of community health centers report that their largest sites both prescribe and dispense all types of contraceptive methods. Only half of community health centers that received title X funding provide IUDs and other types of longacting birth control, the most effective type of birth control, so you can’t just shift everybody else someplace else. In fact, the National Association of Community Health Centers itself said that they could not treat all of the patients that Planned Parenthood now has if this legislation went through. Let’s just call this joint resolution what it is. It is an attempt to take away important family planning resources from the women and families of America. Now, I think if we all support title X when the annual appropriations bill comes up this year, I would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to please join me and my colleagues in an effort to increase title X funding. In all the years I have been in Congress, I have seen attempt after attempt not only to reduce abortion availability, but also to stop family planning services. I think that is something we could agree with on, and I think we could do that. So in the meantime, let’s make sure that the women of America can get access to the family planning they need, and let’s continue to give family planning money to all of these interests to do that. Again, I would like to reiterate, we have no family funding for abortions. That is the law. I don’t like the law, but that is the law. We are talking about family planning and title X. That needs to be preserved and enhanced. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this joint resolution. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I include in the RECORD letters from March for Life Action, Christian Medical and Dental Associations, and United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
MARCH FOR LIFEACTION , Washington, DC, February 15, 2017. REPRESENTATIVE , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of March for Life Action and the hundreds of thousands of our supporters and fellow marchers, I urge you to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 43., sponsored by Rep. Diane Black (R–TN). When H.J. Res. 43 comes to the House floor for a vote we will be scoring the vote in our annual scorecard for the First Session of the 115th Congress. In the waning days of his Administration President Barack Obama, using his power at Health and Human Services, issued a rule that locked down federal grants for abortion giant Planned Parenthood but also usurped state’s rights by blocking states seeking to defund the abortion industry and redirect funds to county health departments, community health centers and other clinics that put women’s health above an abortion agenda. H.J. Res. 43 does not reduce funds for family planning, but allows states to assure that taxpayer funds do not support or underwrite abortion providers when so many Americans have ethical reservations about this procedure. The time has come for a clean break between government support of family planning activities and abortion. Again, on behalf of March for Life Action, I strongly encourage your vote for H.J. Res. 43. March for Life Action will score this vote in our annual scorecard. Sincerely, THOMAS MCCLUSKY , Vice President of Government Affairs. 
CHRISTIAN MEDICAL & DENTAL ASSOCIATIONS , Bristol, TN, January 16, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MAJORITY LEADERMCCONNELL : Thank you for your strong, principled and commonsense leadership on the issue of preventing American tax dollars from funding abortion on demand. Thank you also for your commitment to providing healthcare access to the poor and other vulnerable patients in need. On behalf of the over 18,000 members of the Christian Medical Association, we urge you to: 1. ensure the reallocation of funding currently used by abortionperforming, partisan political organizations such as Planned Parenthood, by directing that funding instead to the over 13,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Centers (RHCs); and, 2. overturn, through the Congressional Review Act, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule finalized December 19, 2016, titled ‘‘Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients,’’ in order to ensure that states are allowed to take a similar direction in allocating federal funding. Many of our members serve in federally funded centers that focus on providing care to patients regardless of who the patient is or what the patient’s values, orientation, ethnicity or any other qualities may be. As you know well, needy patients depend on these centers and on physicians like our members to provide healthcare when likely no one else would provide healthcare for them. FQHCs provide comprehensive services and a ‘‘medical home’’ for whole families and work in the areas of most critical need. According to the independent government watchdog GAO in 2012, FQHCs served 21 million individuals and provided services including STD testing, cancer screening and contraceptive management, as well as other services including immunizations and general child wellness exams. FQHCs and RHCs often meet patient needs on modest budgets, and those who serve in these centers often do so at great personal financial sacrifice. Unlike Planned Parenthood, which follows an aggressive business plan designed to maximize profits on services such as abortion, these centers exist for the purpose of serving the nation’s most needy patients. Yet some medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, whose proabortion ideology aligns with Planned Parenthood and whose members profit personally from working with Planned Parenthood, decry ‘‘political interference in the patientphysician relationship.’’ This cry comes, oddly enough, while applying pressure on politicians to fund political groups like Planned Parenthood. It is also worth observing what sources such as the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics and PolitiFact National have confirmed—that Planned Parenthood spends millions of dollars each year for one partisan purpose: to elect Democrats and defeat Republicans. It’s hard to get more political than that, and it’s impossible to get more politically partisan than that. The majority of Americans do not want their tax dollars to subsidize abortion, and they certainly do not want their tax dollars to subsidize an abortionperforming partisan political machine. Because of the strong concern of American taxpayers, existing federal law addresses direct funding of abortion. However, the fungible nature of federal grants to Planned Parenthood means that every American’s tax dollars, regardless of their convictions about abortion, are being used to prop up the abortion industry. Any organization that wishes to avoid political entanglement can do so quite easily— by simply foregoing government funding. Those who seek funding should expect federal and/or state oversight, requirements and standards. Even the most modest of standards should disqualify from federal funding organizations such as Planned Parenthood, given the recent findings of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, the list of 15 criminal and regulatory referrals made by the Panel, and the referral by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to the FBI and the Department of Justice for investigation and potential prosecution. If any organization can and should do without federal funding, the billiondollar, corrupt abortion business Planned Parenthood is a prime example. We respectfully urge you to reallocate American tax dollars away from such profit centered, divisive and partisan organizations and provide funding instead to patientcentered, noncontroversial and nonpartisan Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Centers (RHCs). And we urge you to ensure that states can do the same, applying reasonable state standards and requirements to those who seek to use taxpayer funds. Thank you very much for your consideration of these views, and for your leadership on this issue. Sincerely, DAVID STEVENS , MD, MA (Ethics) CEO. 
OFPROLIFEACTIVITIES , Washington, DC, February 14, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : I write on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Committee on ProLife Activities to urge your support for H.J. Res 43. This resolution of disapproval would nullify former President Obama’s final rule relating to compliance with Title X requirements by project recipients. 81 Fed. Reg. 91852 (Dec. 19, 2016). The stated purpose of this rule change is to prevent states from excluding providers such as Planned Parenthood from subawards based on state criteria, such as a requirement that subrecipients provide comprehensive primary and preventive care in addition to family planning services. The Title X rule change is bad public policy and should be nullified for several reasons. First, it is deeply troubling to many Americans that Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion network (performing over a third of all abortions), receives more than half a billion taxpayer dollars per year. This concern has rightly grown with revelations about Planned Parenthood’s willingness to traffic in fetal tissue from abortions, and to alter abortion methods not for any reason related to women’s health but to obtain more ‘‘intact’’ organs. Additionally, a recent revelation that the vast majority of Planned Parenthood facilities do not provide prenatal services provides additional evidence of its bias toward providing and promoting abortion. Second, the Department of Health and Human Service’s stated objective in preventing states from ensuring the seamless delivery of comprehensive care places the Department in a selfcontradictory position. Last year in the Nation’s highest court, HHS touted the seamless coverage of health services as a virtue. Indeed, the Department argued that seamlessness is a government interest of the highest order, sufficient to outweigh constitutionally and statutorily protected religious objections. In this new rule, however, HHS takes the opposite position, saying that the seamless provision of services is an ill to be avoided. The present rule would ensure that the provision of care is fragmented, rather than seamless, because it would undermine state requirements that subrecipients provide primary and preventive care in addition to family planning. Seamlessness cannot at one and the same time be a government interest of the highest order when it disadvantages religious organizations, but an affirmative ill to be avoided when it disadvantages Planned Parenthood. Third, states may have other reasonable and persuasive grounds for disqualifying entities from subawards that go beyond the ability of such entities to ‘‘provide Title X services’’ as the rule states (81 Fed. Reg. at 91860). For example, a subaward applicant may have been involved in fraudulent practices, or the applicant or its stakeholders may even have committed a crime, bearing on the applicant’s fitness and suitability for a subaward. Indeed, the requirements for federal awards and subawards in general are typically accompanied by all sorts of standards, many of which are imposed by the federal government itself, and those standards often have little or nothing to do with the ability to provide services (governmental guidelines are replete with such requirements). States may also have widely differing standards for subawardees based on the states’ own policy judgment. Therefore, it should be permissible for states to decline to make a subaward when the subawardee does not meet applicable criteria, whether federal or state, even if the entity is, strictly speaking, able to ‘‘provide Title X services.’’ Those criteria, of course, themselves remain subject to applicable federal and state law. For each of these reasons, we urge you to support H.J. Res. 43. Sincerely, TIMOTHY CARDINAL DOLAN , Chairman, Committee on ProLife Activities, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, the 10th Amendment of the Constitution reads pretty clearly to me: ‘‘The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.’’ I understand that there is a diversity of views represented in this Chamber on matters of health care and human life. I am not asking my colleagues to set those views aside with this vote. I am simply asking them not to substitute their judgment for the will of the States. With this resolution, we are letting States care for their citizens the best way they know, just as they have had that ability for the past 45 years, and we are maintaining access to care for women and families. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this resolution. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 43 which is another baseless and dangerous attack on women’s health care providers. The title X Family Planning Rule, passed almost 50 years ago, already requires states to base title X funding on a provider’s ability to provide title X services. This rule protects title X providers from facing unwarranted discrimination and allows them to continue doing the important work 4 million Americans rely on every year. Title X services include family planning services, cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and basic care. To diminish these services will result in women, men and young people with the greatest need being denied the opportunity to have any health care. Whether or not a provider provides safe and legal abortions with private funds is irrelevant to their ability and capacity to provide title X services. In fact, it is preventive services and family planning offered through title X programs that help to lower the number of unintended pregnancies. But attacks on these providers and the services they offer in their communities persist. This resolution rolls back protections that should already be guaranteed, but repeated attacks on family planning providers have resulted in the need for rules like the one this resolution dismantles. That is why I strenuously oppose this resolution. It should be rejected as an unjustified and unnecessary attack on title X programs and the services they provide for millions of low income Americans. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, it’s been less than two months since the start of the 115th Congress and Republicans have already taken every opportunity to roll back progress made for women. They have pledged to tear down the Affordable Care Act and block access to Planned Parenthood. They passed a bill through the House that limits insurance coverage for comprehensive reproductive healthcare. Now they’ve turned their sights to title X, a family planning program that is crucial for women’s health. There are serious consequences for scaling back title X: without the contraceptive services provided at these title X sites, pregnancy rates would be 30 percent higher among teens. We in government should be making it easier for young people to make smart and informed decisions, not depriving them of the ability to be responsible about their health. Please, Madam Speaker, think about those young women. Their lives and their health should be a concern to all of us. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 123, the previous question is ordered on the joint resolution. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. D EGETTE. Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 1 p.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. 
APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS TO THE COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair announces the Speaker’s appointment, pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 3003, and the order of the House of January 3, 2017, of the following Members on the part of the House to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe: Ms. JACKSON LEE, Texas Ms. MOORE , Wisconsin 
b1530 DISMANTLING THE WOTUS RULE (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, waters of the United States, or WOTUS, has been a thorn in the side of Americans, especially our farmers, since its introduction. WOTUS is a rule issued under the Clean Water Act by the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers designed to redefine the scope of waters protected and regulated by the Federal Government. WOTUS would grant the Federal Government regulatory power over virtually any place where water flows in the United States; that includes ditches, puddles, streams, or any manmade constructions, you name it. If enacted, it would undermine the rights of States, local governments and landowners, and create more red tape, preventing economic growth and jobs, particularly in the agriculture industry. If it sounds ridiculous, that is because it is. WOTUS was flawed from the beginning. It has been held up in the courts since 2015. To ensure WOTUS never sees the light of day and completely eliminate the potential of it becoming a reality, I introduced legislation to repeal this harmful rule. I look forward to working with President Trump and my colleagues on this very important issue. 
CERBERUS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, before President Trump and Steve Bannon bring in a Wall Street billionaire to delve into our Nation’s most classified intelligence, the American people have a right to know the facts about who he and his firm are. If you believe in the United States military, as I do, and not simply cashing it out to private guns for hire, then we would best pay attention to Stephen Feinberg, CEO of Cerberus, who is to be tasked with leading a review of our U.S. intelligence agencies. Cerberus also owns DynCorp, which is in a legal dispute over a $10 billion State Department contract for operations in foreign countries. The Director of Homeland Security, retired General Kelly, received $166,000 as an adviser to DynCorp prior to his Cabinet appointment. Simply put, Cerberus profits off the privatization of war. Handing the keys to our intelligence agencies over to Wall Street is dangerous. Privatization of our homeland security and Armed Forces jeopardizes our national security. It is critical we stand together, take action to demand transparency, prevail for the sake of future generations, and prevent the siphoning of funds intended for our military. Before any Wall Street speculator sets foot on our Nation’s most precious security turf, the American people and our military need complete disclosure and divestiture of all Cerberus’ and Mr. Feinberg’s holdings. f 
PARKING DRIVEBY LAWSUITS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Weingarten Realty owns several shopping centers in Texas. Recently they were sued by plaintiffs who had never visited the shopping center. The complaint? Allegedly, nine designated ADA van accessible parking spaces were not dispersed far enough apart. The plaintiff did not notify Weingarten of the alleged violations before filing the lawsuit, so Weingarten couldn’t comply. The real estate company believes they were in compliance with the ADA. But often companies like Weingarten decide the best economic decision is to settle the lawsuit rather than an expensive court trial. Businesses are told to either pay a settlement or face an expensive trial. The bipartisan bill, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017, requires plaintiffs to give businesses notice and time to fix the alleged ADA infraction before a lawsuit is filed. Mr. Speaker, the ADA was designed to improve access for the disabled, not allow a handful of greedy plaintiffs who have never been on the premises to use a loophole to extort unsuspecting businessowners of money. And that is just the way it is. 
THE WIDENING FLYNN SCANDAL (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, are we witnessing the first Manchurian presidency in the history of the United States? This resignation of President Trump’s National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, has done nothing to end the controversy surrounding the administration’s relationship with Russia. I am calling for an independent investigation into Flynn’s actions. The White House knew for weeks that Flynn misled about his secret communications with the Russian Ambassador, but apparently that was not a problem for the Trump administration as long as it was hidden from the public. Did the White House authorize Flynn’s secret communications? Did the President? Why wasn’t Flynn gone sooner? We don’t know yet the answers to these and other questions. What we do know is that the Trump administration is not prepared to protect this Nation. For all their talk of national security, Republicans are giving President Trump a pass. An independent investigation into Flynn’s actions is needed. The investigation must determine if improper relationships between the Trump administration and the Russian Government exist. Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding to know, and they deserve to know just how tight Russia’s grip is on the Trump administration. 
CUT BUREAUCRACY OUT OF THE CASEWORK PROCESS (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 512, the WINGMAN Act. The WINGMAN Act will help Members of Congress and our staff members better assist the constituents that we serve. It cuts bureaucracy out of the casework process, and it makes it easier to connect Pennsylvania families with the services and benefits that they need. Our staff members in our district do tremendous work every day. They help constituents and their families navigate the Federal bureaucracy, whether it is helping veterans obtain care through the VA, seniors access their Medicare or Social Security benefits, or even helping a traveler obtain a passport for an emergency trip overseas. Too often that work goes unsung and the hard work they do goes unrecognized. I am blessed to have a terrific staff in my district office, led by my district chief of staff, Caitlin Ganley. Our team, Bill Dondero, Maureen Quinn, Alaina Sforza, and Brian Gallie have helped literally thousands of individuals as we have worked to cut through the red tape and get the answers they need from the agencies across the Federal Government. The WINGMAN Act will make this difficult job just a little bit easier, and I am proud to support it. f 
WHAT IS THE RUSSIAN CONNECTION (Mr. WELCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, after only 24 days in office, President Trump’s National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned in disgrace. Why? He had direct contact with the Russian Ambassador, assuring him, in likely violation of U.S. law, that the Obama sanctions against Russia would be reversed. And then he lied about it. There is evidence of Trump campaign officials having regular contact with Russians officials, and we know Russia hacked into DNC files and doled out stolen information with the goal of aiding the Trump campaign. So the question is: What is the Russian connection? Congress must do its job. We should conduct a fullscale, noholdsbarred investigation of the links between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. There is a mountain of evidence we cannot ignore. The American people have a right to know, of course. But even more importantly, the enduring strength of our democracy is being tested. Congress must maintain our constitutional protection of checks and balances. Investigate now. Investigate fully. 
THE STATUS QUO IS UNSUSTAINABLE (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, we have seen more troubling signs this week that things continue to get worse under the healthcare law. Humana announced they are dropping out of the ObamaCare marketplace next year. The CEO of Aetna said that ObamaCare is in a ‘‘death spiral.’’ Families in Michigan and across the country are left with fewer choices and soaring costs. Mari, from Jackson, in my district, is one of them. Her premiums nearly quadrupled last year under ObamaCare; and this year, her premiums went up so high, she could not afford to pay them. So she and her husband, who is selfemployed, dropped the plan and now are going without any health insurance at all. The status quo is simply unsustainable, and we are working to provide relief to families who are struggling. This will be an orderly, stepbystep process as we transition to patientcentered solutions that lower costs, increase choices, maintain preexisting conditions coverage, and meet the needs of all Americans. That is what Mari and every single American deserves. f 
TITLE X FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today deeply disappointed that the House has again put attacking women’s health over the important priorities the American people sent us here to address. More than 4 million individuals across the country, many of them low income, uninsured, or young, depend on title X for family planning and related preventative care. This is lifesaving care: birth control, HIV and other STI testing, and cancer screenings, to name a few. The resolution that passed today allows States to deny trusted reproductive healthcare providers from receiving title X funds for purely ideological reasons. Already, 14 States have taken official action to exclude Planned Parenthood and other critical reproductive healthcare providers from serving patients through the title X program. This shameful legislation puts politics ahead of women’s health and does a disservice to women and families across our Nation. 
WHY THE MEDIA ATTACKS PRESIDENT TRUMP (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise that the media’s credibility has hit a record low with the American people, according to a recent Gallup Poll. The media attacked President Trump because he proved their predictions wrong and their candidate lost. They attack him because they are mostly liberal Democrats and he is a conservative Republican. They attack him because he is reversing many of the policies of President Obama, whom they openly supported. They attack him because he is going around them, directly to the American people with his Twitter messages. They attack him because they can’t intimidate or control him. The media’s hate is poisoning the country. Wouldn’t it be better for our country if the media gave the American people the facts rather than told them what to think? Wouldn’t it be better for our country if the media treated the President fairly and without malice? 
WHEN WILL CONGRESS FINALLY ACT (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, CNN reported that the Pentagon is considering a proposal to send U.S. ground troops to northern Syria. This is for a report to President Trump on the war against ISIS due this month. But the very idea that the Pentagon is seriously considering sending more troops into Syria should be a wakeup call to Congress and to all Americans. Three years after the U.S. first sent troops to Syria and Iraq, Congress still hasn’t voted to authorize the fight against ISIS. Do we really want to send more Americans into war? What is the mission? How does it end? For 3 years, Congress has failed to do its constitutional duty. Three years of cowardice. Three years of a blank check. Speaker RYAN promised action in 2016, but did nothing. When, Mr. Speaker, will this House finally do its job? After 100 more American troops are sent to Syria and Iraq? Five hundred more? A thousand? When will Congress finally act? Mr. Speaker, I say the time is now. 
b1545 COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF TIM PRENDIVILLE (Ms. MCSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life of Tim Prendiville, an active member of Tucson’s Irish community and dear friend of my family and mine who sadly passed away on February 14. Tim dedicated his life to giving back to others. For example, he organized meals and bought sleeping bags for the homeless at Armory Park, and he donated his time to help those who could not read or write send letters to their loved ones. He was a founding member of Tucson’s St. Patrick’s Day committee and was honored last year as grand marshal of the annual parade. He was a gifted storyteller, a reflection of his Irish roots. One of his favorites was the time he sang ‘‘Oh Danny Boy’’ at a dinner with thenPresidential candidate John F. Kennedy. I’ve known Tim ever since I was a young child. When I was 12, he delivered the eulogy at my father’s funeral. Throughout my life, he has been a constant source of encouragement, and, although we belonged to different political parties, he was somebody who shared widely his faith and belief in me. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply grateful for Tim Prendiville’s love and support. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and loved ones in our time of grief. I know he is now singing ‘‘Oh Danny Boy’’ with the angels. f 
APPLAUDING THE OSCAR DE LE RENTA POSTAGE STAMP (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the United States Postal Service for its dedication of the Oscar de la Renta postage stamp. This stamp was unveiled today at Grand Central Station in New York City in a wonderful ceremony, and it is part of the U.S. Postal Service’s Forever collection. As a lifelong friend, I dearly miss Oscar de la Renta and care about honoring his work and his memory. To me and so many Americans, particularly immigrants, he was more than just a designer, he was a good friend and a pioneer. As a member of the DominicanAmerican community and as a member of the U.S. Congress, it is my goal to highlight the achievement of immigrants who have contributed to American society and culture. Though Oscar was highly regarded by some of the most prominent figures of our time, including first ladies, he maintained his humility and never cast aside those who were less fortunate. His creativity, resourcefulness, and love for life are admirable characteristics that made him a true national treasure. Oscar was widely known for his love of country and deep affection for the DominicanAmerican community. I am proud to see Oscar’s legacy honored and hope to keep his memory alive. Oscar is still with us. Once someone asked him how he wanted to be remembered, and he simply said: As a pretty dress. 
LAUDING MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIPS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the important role the Manufacturing Extension Partnership plays in strengthening U.S. manufacturing. This publicprivate partnership consists of a nationwide system of centers located throughout the United States. Manufacturers can receive several services by visiting a designated MEP center, including workforce development, supply chain development, commercialization, exporting, and many other helpful strategies. I recently had the opportunity to meet with the Innovative Manufacturers’ Center in my home district. The IMC works to increase the innovation, productivity, and growth for manufacturers in central Pennsylvania. Over the past 25 years, IMC has helped more than 600 manufacturing companies in its 12county region of the Keystone State. Mr. Speaker, American manufacturing is a critical part of our economy. I am pleased to see that public private partnership is working to help support small and midsized manufacturers. These are the businesses that employ our neighbors and produce quality made in America products. I look forward to seeing their continued growth, and I salute the centers nationwide that help them do just that. f 
THANKING ATTORNEY GENERAL XAVIER BECERRA (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate California’s new attorney general, my friend, Xavier Becerra. As many of you know, former Congressman Becerra was the Congressional Hispanic Caucus chair from 1997 to 1999. He was our Democratic Caucus vice chair from 2009 to 2013, and also our Democratic Caucus chair for the 114th Congress. We all know that Attorney General Becerra was a staunch defender of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and other support for people in need. He was also a supporter for our DREAMers, for DACA, and for women’s rights. He was also a mentor to me. Aspiring new Members who came here looked to him for advice, especially in their first couple weeks here. I want to thank Attorney General Becerra for coming to a roundtable in my district over in Polk County to visit with so many of our agricultural workers in our community and so many DREAMers. It is so critical for agriculture, for our farmers, and for rural America that we continue to make sure that agriculture continues to be strong in our Nation. As a Californian, he also even starred in Stephen Colbert’s ‘‘Better Know a District.’’ So I just want to thank, once again, Congressman Xavier Becerra for being an American Member of Congress, someone who looked out for all of us and defended our values. 
COAL REFUSETOENERGY LEGISLATION (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the progress hardworking western Pennsylvanians have made in restoring our hillsides and streams in historic mining communities polluted by waste coal. Through the use of innovative technology, workers in the coal refuseto 
energy industry have brought about an incredible transformation of formerly polluted areas, restoring landscapes to their original natural beauty. It is a success story all around, both environmentally and economically. Unfortunately, onesizefitsall Washington regulations threaten to stop this success story in its tracks and to destroy the familysustaining jobs the coal refusetoenergy industry supports. That is why, for the third time, I am reintroducing the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, or SENSE Act, in the 115th Congress as H.R. 1119. My legislation ensures that regulations are tailored to allow a very specific and small subset of power plants to continue their remediation efforts and restore western Pennsylvania’s natural beauty, as well as landscapes in historic mining communities across the country. This legislation passed the House with bipartisan support last year, and I urge my colleagues to support it once again so that the vital and successful work of providing electricity while cleaning up the environment can continue. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAVES LIVES (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, from the mother of four with a preexisting condition to the family of a young boy who can now afford health insurance for the first time—we have heard constantly and over and over how the Affordable Care Act has saved lives. The Affordable Care Act provides quality, affordable insurance to millions of Americans. For example, just in my district alone, nearly 100,000 people who are now covered through the Covered California exchange or through the Medicaid—which is in California Medi Cal—expansion, they stand to lose coverage if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. It is completely irresponsible to speak about repealing the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. I urge my colleagues to think about their own constituents before doing so. 
THE THIRTY MILLION WORDS INITIATIVE (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a truly innovative pilot program in my district in Pensacola, Florida. This oneofa kind program, known as the Thirty Million Words Initiative, is a collaborative effort brought by researchers from the University of Chicago in partnership with the Studer Community Institute. The Thirty Million Words Initiative will educate parents of newborns at Sacred Heart Hospital, Baptist Hospital, and West Florida Hospital on best practices for speech and engagement during the critical learning stage up to 3 years old. As we all know, interaction by speech or music with young children has not only had an impact on learning abilities but also emotional needs. This program builds on this principle and strives to include all newborns, regardless of income level, race, or ethnicity. Through this simple commitment, we can challenge the socioeconomic stereotypes we have become too used to and build a future for leaders and innovators stemming from all walks of life and bringing new ideas for a vision for the future. This truly unique partnership between our community leaders and the parents of our future generation will garner a secure foundation for our children to bring stronger education, allow limitless possibilities, and meeting the challenges to build a better tomorrow. f 
U.S.ISRAELI RELATIONS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the relationship between the United States and Israel is a very important one, a moral one, and one beneficial to both sides. I was very glad to see this week the President, so early on in his term, inviting and making welcome Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to this country and showing that the U.S. relation with Israel is as important to us as it is to them. Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state, through much of its history of this Earth has been a very strong one for their assertion for their rights to be part of the fiber of the Middle East. The United States needs to be on their side and a firm partner in what they need to do. So, again, kudos to President Trump for making this establishment of this relationship early on in his term and sending that assurance to Prime Minister Netanyahu, the people of Israel, and the importance to the people of this country of that relationship. 
LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to be recognized to address you here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives, this great deliberative body. To start this off, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTEN BERRY ). Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa. Perhaps this will embarrass you, my colleague, STEVE KING, but as I was flying into Nebraska last week—and I do this on occasion—I am looking out of the window and looking at the rolling hills of the western edge of Iowa as it borders the Missouri River and all of that beautiful terracing that has been done, all of that extraordinarily productive farmland, in order to save the soil and increase yields, and I wonder how much of that STEVE KINGdid himself in a former life. So I am grateful not only for the opportunity but mostly for your friendship. Mr. KING of Iowa. The answer would be a fair amount, and I yield to the gentleman. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, as I was going through my mail last week, I read a publication that I receive frequently at my house from what is known as the Great Plains Trail Network. This is a dedicated group of people who enjoy, promote, and foster the growing network of hiking and biking trails in my hometown of Lincoln and the vicinity. They provide an extraordinary service to our community. Most notably, the trail systems provide an alternative means of transportation, physically linking our community in creative ways along creek beds and underpasses, through open plains and wooded areas, and beside the wooden fences between residential neighborhoods. These trails also link us in a more profound way. They link us to the values of healthy exercise, neighborliness, and the beauty of nature— even in the setting of the urban city environment. Now, Mr. Speaker, I received an unusual media request recently. New York Magazine wished to speak to me. I took the meeting because I wanted to give a broader perspective on the issue of environmental stewardship, particularly in light of policy debates about energy and the environment. Since this topic can be so toxic, I thought it was important to reframe the issues with some prairie perspective, if you will. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, it is time to spike the football and focus on solutions and activities that all of us can agree on and that all of us see are beneficial. Mr. Speaker, for the 21st century, we must harmonize environmental and economic security. As a different public policy approach, I am considering a new idea called the zeroemissions energy credit, or ZEEC. b1600 The more that we can do, I believe, to stop waste and pollution through conservation and innovation gives us peace of mind in regards to the proper use of our resources. This ZEEC concept would reward reduced emissions through a tax credit 
system. In this way, the government is not picking one technology over another or fighting over one regulation versus another, but positively valuing the diminishing externality cost of polluting emissions. Mr. Speaker, environmental initiatives can also take many other forms. I am very proud to be recently named the cochair of the International Conservation Caucus, called the ICC. It is one of the largest bipartisan caucuses in the Congress. The ICC works to ensure the sustainability of both persons and wildlife, works to promote market innovation, as well as proper stewardship of our precious natural resources. As an example, not long ago, in the African country of Mozambique, in the midst of a civil war, the Gorongosa National Park was completely stripped of wildlife and devoid of people. A once lush microecosystem is dead, primarily due to political disagreement. Interestingly, fascinatingly, extraordinarily, a mere 10 years later, thanks to the work of a major philanthropist and a receptive government, a park system now teams with wildlife, with indigenous people reintegrated back into their homeland, who are engaged in now good and sustainable farming methodologies, engaged in park management, as well as conservation, all creating an atmosphere in which the entire ecosystem once again thrives. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know anyone in this body or anywhere else who wants dirty air or dirty water. However, as another example, if you live in Beijing, polluted air alone costs you 5
1⁄2years off your life. Parts of India are perhaps worse. By the way, the Chinese Government was infuriated with the United States because we created at our embassy a pollution monitoring device, and then publicly released that data to Chinese society. It had a major effect. As one Chinese person once whispered to me: What is the point of all this economic development if it kills you? Economic development without a soul strips us of the capacity to fully prosper. On the other hand, one of the prime contributors to environmental desecration is economic underdevelopment. Persons who have diminished economic options will use the resources at hand, sometimes merely to survive. The tragedy of the commons occurs when there are fractured social linkages, a lack of access to technology and information to feed, clothe, and house in a more sustainable way. Mr. Speaker, I believe this: as new technologies emerge, we may see exciting opportunities to build our own sustainably sourced microenergy economy, one that harmonizes with the environment and creates new economic opportunities and linkages. This doesn’t mean we all live on game preserves, but through proper public policy and innovation, we may be on the trail to environmental, economic, and community security, and perhaps create a new type of Great Plains Energy Network. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congressman KING, for the various aspects of leadership he has provided, particularly today, on an essential issue: a prolife issue. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY ) for his presentation here today, his friendship, and the job he has been doing for a long time representing the eastern third of Nebraska, generally speaking. I would point out also, Mr. Speaker, that we actually first met on the pro life issue. As I was looking at the primary candidates that were vying for that position in eastern Nebraska, I wanted to measure their character, the content of their character, the value of their faith and their commitment to principle and planning and Constitution, but especially life. In looking at the candidates, it didn’t take very long to figure that out. I think Nebraskans have done very well with the representation that they have sent to this Congress, especially in the case of Mr. FORTENBERRY , who has exceeded my expectations. And I am pleased to say that here. As the gentleman indicated, I came to the floor here this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, to speak about life, about innocent, unborn human life. To start with, I will put it this way, Mr. Speaker. There are a series of values that we hold dear. Many of the debates here on this floor and in the committees and the various committee rooms around the Hill that we have are more or less working around the edges of the central issue. Sometimes, though, we do get to the central issue. The central issue was debated here on the floor earlier with a different piece of legislation. When young people are growing up in America and they are listening to their parents, their teachers, other friends and relatives and schoolmates, the question will emerge—and you can’t grow up in America without the question of abortion emerging; and sometimes they are counseled on one side of that question and sometimes on the other—but when I am talking to young people, I want them to shape their values around the most solid principles, as our Founding Fathers shaped the values of America around the solid moral principles. It doesn’t do to simply pass off the idea of abortion and say: I am not going to think about it; or I am going to leave it up to God to decide. He calls on us also to contemplate these things. Our Founding Fathers wrote into the Declaration of Independence that we have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. When I contemplate those words and the order of those words, often it is conflated together as equal or equivalent values as if life and the pursuit of happiness are equivalent values, with liberty in the middle of all that, and you can stir it up and no one’s pursuit of happiness should be diminished by someone else’s search for liberty or the exercise of their liberty or that no one’s life should trump that of someone else’s pursuit of happiness or liberty. Mr. Speaker, in understanding the Declaration of Independence, the foundational document that undergirds our Constitution and the most beautiful document written in the history of the nationstate—and I believe that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were inspired with divine guidance, just a little bit lower standard of true than divine inspiration; a divine guidance—I believe our Founding Fathers thought deeply about that message that was coming to them from above and the words that were put down on that parchment by Thomas Jefferson. The right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were rights that were considered carefully to be prioritized in their order of what was the most important down to the least important of the three. Life came first. They didn’t say right to pursuit of happiness, to liberty, to life. They didn’t say right to liberty, pursuit of happiness, and then to life. They wrote life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To understand what that means, think of this. First, the definition of pursuit of happiness is understood by our Founding Fathers. Our Founding Fathers didn’t see this pursuit of happiness as let’s just say a tailgate party on a Saturday noon or early Saturday afternoon. It wasn’t about going off to a party or sitting in your backyard with your family or doing the things we enjoy to do, enjoying sports, watching or participating; or being out on the water or down the ski slopes. That was not imagined at all as the pursuit of happiness because they understood pursuit of happiness to be the definition of the Greek term that I pronounce eudemonia, pronounced with a Greek accent. But what it means is: in pursuit of happiness. Happiness under the Greek understanding of the term was the whole person; to develop one’s self as the whole person. That would be to develop yourself physically. As you grow into adulthood, keep yourself in shape, build your muscles up, eat healthy, sleep healthy, do the healthy things, make sure that this temple of our body is taken care of and respected and appreciated. That is the vessel through which we carry our values and are able to carry out many of the things we do in our lives. So physical health was part of the pursuit of happiness, but also the mental development. And it is not just pursuing knowledge, not rote memorization alone, which has its value—always has, always will have—but also the understanding of a philosophical person and an intellectually complete individual to complement the physically healthy and inshape individual, philosophically sound, intellectually sound, but also theological sound. 
That is eudemonia. That is the complete human being. That is making the most out of God’s gift to us and developing ourselves physically, mentally, emotionally, theologically, and psychologically. The whole human being. The understanding that our Founding Fathers had was that you have a right to pursue this. You have a right to develop yourself. In fact, the implication is that we have an obligation to do so. That means we have got an obligation to evaluate the moral questions in front of us with the brain that we are given and the values that we have developed and the education that we worked to earn. That is pursuit of happiness. But that is the lowest of the three on the priority, Mr. Speaker. The next value is liberty. With that value of liberty, there are certain things that are liberty. We take liberty with our speech. We take liberty with our religion. We take liberty with the press. We have our right to assemble and all of those things. If someone is in pursuit of happiness, they are not going to take away our rights to our liberty. Most of our rights to liberty are wrapped up in the Bill of Rights. The First Amendment catches the most important ones early. Also, the liberty to keep and bear arms, the property rights that come along in the Fifth Amendment, the components of liberty that we have and the provisions that allow us to face a jury of our peers and no double jeopardy. Those are liberties. The liberties that are defined trump the pursuit of happiness. In other words, someone else can’t take away our freedom of speech because they are in search of a good tailgate party. We go from the lowest priority, the pursuit of happiness, to the next level up, liberty, and to the highest level up, which is the right to life. Life itself is sacred. When I talk to young people, I ask them the question: Do you believe that human life is sacred in all of its forms? They look around each other in the bleacher seats in the gymnasium, if it happens to be a school in that fashion, and they come to a consensus: Yes. And I will ask them: Is your life sacred? How about the person sitting next to you, is their life sacred? After a little while, they start to nod their heads and agree. It is no trick question. Human life is sacred in all of its forms. Once we understand that and we accept that universal consensus that is here in this society of America, then the only other thing we have to say is: Well, if human life is sacred and we protect it with all that we have, then we need to know when life begins and we need to know when life ends. We know that in 1973, 44 years ago, the Supreme Court came to a conclusion. Well, actually, they didn’t know, but they spoke of viability and they used a vague, mushy definition of viability and trimesters, but that is not a way to define life. When you deal with something that is sacred in all of its forms, you don’t use a definition that says maybe it is or maybe it isn’t a life; maybe it is viable, maybe it isn’t; maybe it has actually crossed this threshold of this trimester or this one or this one. So what they ended up in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, the combination of the two was abortion on demand and the person’s right to life. That personhood that begins at the moment of conception is subject to the judgment of the mother, who may think that this life is inconvenient to her liberty or her pursuit of happiness. b1615 That was when they crossed a moral line that needs to be examined by everyone in this country who goes to the polls and votes or conducts themselves in a fashion that is affected by the abortion industry itself. So I say to them, students especially: Is human life sacred in all of its forms? The answer comes back: Yes, it is. And then I say: Then you have to choose a moment that life begins, and that moment, there is only one moment that we know, and that is the moment of conception. That moment of conception that life begins is a moment that I believe that God places the soul in that little being that is a full complement of a combination of the DNA of the father and the mother, the full complement of the human being, a unique human being, a unique human being that there will never be another one exactly like that little baby that is conceived. There will never be another one. Even identical twins have their distinctions, Mr. Speaker. Mothers can tell them apart. Not always easily, but they can tell. Fathers can tell little babies apart. Even though they have got matching DNA that is exactly the same DNA, they are still unique. They are still a little bit different in certain ways. Their personalities develop in different ways, and they have physical characteristics that become more and more apparent as the years go on. There are no two human beings exactly the same. That is because God made it that way. Think of how unique this is. There are over 7 billion people now on this planet. Our population has gone over 7 billion people. Of all the people who have gone to their graves throughout history from the beginning of time, from the Garden of Eden until today, and all the people who live on the planet, 7 billion today, and of all the people who will come, likely by the billions, into the future, there are no two faces that are the same. They sometimes look a little the same—more than a little—but there are no two faces that are the same. There are no two faces that anybody who knows them can’t tell the difference. Think how genius it is to create a species, Homo sapiens. We each have a unique visage that will never be matched again throughout the duration of time. It has never been matched before from the beginning of time, and no matter what any scientist might do in a laboratory, there is never going to be anybody exactly the same, even if the DNA matches exactly. That is a unique approach to this. Think about this: The thing that we measure ourselves by and recognize ourselves by, our face, our visage, carries with it the package of all of the emotions and the thoughts and the expressions that bypass so much need to use the words in this very excellent language that we have. Think of how you interact with your friends, your family, your neighbors, when you are sitting at a meeting, when you are giving facial expressions that don’t require a sound. People read those facial expressions, and they react off of them. I think of the days that I am out, as Mr. FORTENBERRY said, working on a crew, maybe laying pipe with my three sons, and we may not even have to speak all day long because facial expressions, a nod here and there, we know each other, we can communicate with our facial expressions, and that is enough. That is a unique thing that we have been blessed with. Every one of us is unique. Our lives begin at the moment of conception. We can’t measure and we can’t prove scientifically when that moment of conception is. We just know. We know that that is when that baby, when the components of the DNA of the father and the mother come together in that fertilized egg. That is the moment of conception; that is the moment that life begins. I would like it if we could identify scientifically, if a little bell went off and we knew, here is conception. There is a unique little life here in the womb of the mother—and, by the way, she is a mother at that moment. But we can’t do that yet. We have come a long way. When our family was born, at that time, we couldn’t tell whether it was a boy or a girl, and so it was nice, in my opinion, to have a surprise on whether it is a boy or a girl. Of course, I always prayed that they would be mentally healthy and, after that, physically healthy, but never began to ask whether it should be a boy or a girl. But today we know. We can measure if it is a boy or a girl. We can tell facial characteristics. We can see the personality of these little unborn babies in the womb. When they make faces, you can see them grimace. You can see them smile. You can see them suck their thumb. There are many, many people in this country today who have a 4–D ultrasound of one or more of their children that is taken well before they are born. I can think of one of my district personnel who has, in his office in Sioux City, a framed picture of the ultrasound of Joseph Dean Anderson, my godson. It is there, framed, the 
ultrasound of that little baby boy months before he was born. Now he is about 7 years old or so, perfect little towheaded, blondhaired kid running around, full of happiness, love, and energy. But he was first known in his mother’s womb and first recognized as a family member there and his picture framed. It still is there in the office in Sioux City. He is about tall enough to see it straight on these days. That happens all over America because we know that life begins at the moment of conception. We hold it; we cherish life as sacred to us. These little babies are the future of America. They are God’s will, and they are the future of America. Yet, nearly 60 million of them have been aborted over the years since 1973 and Roe v. Wade, nearly 60 million. Think of that, 60 million babies in 44 years. And we are watching a nation that has a birthrate now that is lower than the replacement rate. You hear debate on this floor, Mr. Speaker, that says that we have to go to foreign countries to bring people in here to do the work that we don’t have enough people to do. I don’t accept that as a rational thing for a country to do in that way. What we need in this country is we need good people to have more babies and raise them right, and yet we are missing 60 million. That doesn’t include the second generation of those who were aborted in the first half of the 44 years of Roe v. Wade. Thomas Jefferson concluded that a generation was 19 years. It is probably a little longer than that today. Generations turned over, by his estimation, in 19 years. It is just convenient for me, 44 years since Roe v. Wade, I am going to call that, divided by two, two generations, 22 years a generation. Two generations, a third of Americans, gone because of a court decision that unjustly found, unconstitutionally found, immorally found, irrationally found, and the guilt that this Nation carries for tolerating a Supreme Court decision and accepting that Supreme Court decision. But it is not everybody in this country who carries that guilt because we have armies of prolife workers who are out there on a daily basis doing all they can to bridge the gap for, let’s say, a mother who is in a crisis and can’t care for the baby that is on the way; the crisis pregnancy centers that are there; the lives that have been saved by the thousands and thousands by the prolife workers, the lives that have been saved by the inspiration that comes from seeing hundreds of thousands of prolife marchers come to this city and make that march from around the Washington Monument on up to the Supreme Court and to the west side of the Supreme Court to plead for justice for those who are voiceless in the unborn. Well, Mr. Speaker, it is time for this Congress to address this. It is time for Congress to move along the issue. And so because we cannot medically prove when a conception begins, we believe profoundly that personhood begins at the moment of conception, and personhood needs to be protected in all of its forms. The closest we can get to verifying that personhood, that conception, is the measure of the heartbeat. We all know that a beating heart is life. When the heart stops beating, life ends. Now, we can detect a heartbeat as early as 16 days from conception, and often the number is published to be 18 days from conception, Mr. Speaker. It may not always be detectible in every pregnancy that early, but it is entirely detectible early on in the pregnancy. So I have introduced legislation, Mr. Speaker, to protect these innocent babes, these babes that can’t speak for themselves, that can’t cry out for their own mercy, but they are already formed in their mother’s womb, and the unique individual that grows from the matching of those two DNAs. And when that heart starts to beat, a physician can detect that heartbeat, when they can detect the heartbeat, we need to protect the baby. With the understanding that when a heartbeat can be detected the baby must be protected, I have drafted and introduced legislation that is H.R. 490, Mr. Speaker. Now, this bill is titled the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017. It makes a lifesaving stride in enshrining the rights, the rights of the unborn, into U.S. law. It ensures that no child for whom a heartbeat is detectible is aborted unless the life of the child’s mother is endangered in fact by a physical disorder, by a physical illness, or by a physical injury. Any abortionist who performs an abortion under this legislation, H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017, any abortionist who performs an abortion in spite of a detectible heartbeat and outside of the exceptions that I have defined, which is for a physical disorder, a physical illness, or a physical injury, any physician who performs an abortion outside of those exceptions would be subject to a fine or imprisonment—and that is for a period up to 5 years—or both. This is a serious piece of legislation, and it needs to be, because life itself is the number one thing that is sacred here on this planet, especially in this country. This legislation, the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017, will require all physicians before conducting an abortion to detect the heartbeat of the unborn child; and that means they have to maintain the records of their endeavor to detect a heartbeat, and if a heartbeat is detected, the baby is protected. That is the center of this law. Ever since Roe v. Wade, which was unconstitutionally decided in 1973, 44 years ago, these 60 million babies—almost 60 million babies that have been ended by the abortion industry—have received a rubber stamp from the courts, from the Federal Government, not from this Congress and not from the States. The Supreme Court overrules the efforts in the States to protect innocent, unborn human life. The Supreme Court overrules this Congress to protect unborn human life, and we have been trying to find ways around that decision ever since 1973. But I have introduced the bill, and it will protect the lives of the voiceless innocents. Then to make a point now, Mr. Speaker, there are probably some people who are thinking this is a little bit too big of a leap for where we are on the topic today. I would submit that it is not, that we have been working too patiently with what I will call incrementalism. When I came to this Congress more than a decade ago, I had been, at that time, already working to try to help pass legislation that banned partialbirth abortions, and the Supreme Court had found the partial birth abortion ban to be unconstitutional based on a couple of things. One of them was the Supreme Court ruled that it was necessary to save the life of the mother or the health of the mother, and the other one was that Congress hadn’t defined the act precisely enough. So we went to work in the Committee on the Judiciary. I want to thank Congressman STEVE CHABOT of Ohio for taking the lead on this issue. We held hearing after hearing, and Congress had findings that a partial birth abortion was never medically necessary to save the life of the mother; and that is with much, much testimony of experts before the committee for a long period of time definitively concluding such, and then the act itself was more precisely defined. Then it went back before the courts, and each of the Federal districts that heard the case, three of them, simultaneously, all of them turned it down as unconstitutional. But it went to the Supreme Court, where the ban on partialbirth abortion was upheld. It has saved some lives but has put a small dent in this huge 60 million aborted babies industry. We began to go to work on this in other ways. We have legislation that is introduced before this Congress that bans sexselected abortions. We know that there are mothers and fathers that will use the ultrasound to determine the sex of the baby. If they want a little baby boy and it is a girl, sometimes they will abort that little girl and try again for a boy. We know this is happening in places like China, where they have had, up until recently, the onechild policy, and the proportion of boys to girls is way out of whack in China because they are aborting little baby girls because they would prefer having a boy. b1630 That happens in America, too, but not as statistically evident. It is immoral to do that. That piece of legislation has 77 percent support. That is the strongest support we have, statistically, for abortion legislation that 
exists, as far as I know, in this Congress. Then we have paincapable legislation, little babies that can feel the pain of abortion when that needle with a saline solution is stuck into—Mr. Speaker, I am just going to bypass the details of how this functions. Babies can feel pain. They can experience joy; they can experience pleasure; and they can experience pain. We have legislation to prohibit abortion from the time that we can determine that that baby feels the pain of being aborted. But that is a definition of pain, not a definition of life. If this is a unique life, as I have described at length here, then this unique life must be protected. We don’t say this unique life which has this soul— and God put in this soul from the moment of conception—doesn’t deserve to be protected unless they feel pain. What we are saying is it bothers our conscience too much to have a baby killed that can feel the pain and suffering. I support these other two pieces of legislation that I have described: the ban on sexselective abortion and the ban on paincapable abortion. But, Mr. Speaker, that doesn’t get at the heart of this. The heart of this is this: sacred human life. Human life, sacred in all of its forms, begins at the moment of conception. We need legislation to protect that personhood. And when we can define and clearly detect a heartbeat, a heartbeat in a baby from as early as 16 days, we must protect the life of that innocent baby. So that, Mr. Speaker, is my conviction, my deep conviction, my very profoundly held conviction. But I wonder: What does the rest of the country think? Sometimes I find myself out there right without a majority. Sometimes they will say: Well, you didn’t have a majority because you weren’t right. And this one, I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, human life is sacred in all of its forms. So we ask the question in polling across America: What do the American people think of the proposal to ban abortion once a heartbeat can be detected? Mr. Speaker, the polling that we have out there is very carefully done, and I am going to give you the numbers first. This is the general number that asks the question, if the heartbeat is detected, the baby is protected, and here is how the polling came together. Sixtynine percent agree with the position that I have just taken here in the bill that I have introduced, which is H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017. The data contained in this polling report are responses to a question that was commissioned by Faith2Action. That is in a Barna Group OmniPoll. 1,002 interviews were conducted of U.S. adults nationwide. The sampling error for this 1,002 interviews is plus or minus 3.1 percent. That is about as accurate as you get with polling. That means that there is a 95 percent confidence level that these numbers are right. The data is weighted in the national distribution of U.S. adults. They took minimal statistical weighting and they used it to calibrate the samples—so, of known population percentages—and it is in relation to the demographic variables of age, gender. I bet it is age, sex, education, and region, so that it is scientifically applied. It is a poll that was run from January 19 until January 27. This is pretty fresh information, about as fresh as it gets. These interviews were conducted over a majority landline—60 percent or so off landlines and 40 percent off cell phones or other mobile devices, so that we got a good cross section of people throughout that. They were conducted by experienced, trained interviewers. They were supervised at all times. They were monitored. They were computerassisted telephone interviewing to make sure that the balance of this thing was as good and as objective as it could get, Mr. Speaker. So this polling result says, among U.S. adults nationwide, a slight majority, 55 percent, agree strongly that, if a doctor is able to detect the heartbeat of an unborn baby, that baby should be legally protected—that is the core of the question that was asked—and 18 percent disagree either strongly or somewhat with this. So when I look at the numbers here, 69 percent overall are packaged up within the agree strongly component— fiftyfive percent. Now, that is landslide in a political election, 55 percent. And this will be a landslide in the polling that says 55 percent strongly agree that, if a doctor can detect a heartbeat, the unborn baby should be protected by law, a 55 percent landslide majority, Mr. Speaker. And then you add to that the 14 percent who agree somewhat with this. So, from a general agreement standpoint, 69 percent, or as close as you can get and not exactly hit the number, 7 in 10 Americans say let’s protect those lives of those innocent, unborn babies when you can hear their heartbeat. The people who disagree strongly are only 10 percent. And then those who disagree somewhat are another 8 percent; 18 percent disagreeing on the other side, but only 10 percent disagree strongly. So 55 percent say they strongly support a ban on abortion, once a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected, and only 10 percent disagree with that strongly. I am going to say that they are probably some of the hardcore leftists that I am engaged in debate with on almost a daily basis with here, Mr. Speaker. But you can divide 10 percent into 55 percent and say, for everyone out here who says we should not protect that innocent, unborn baby whose heart is beating, for everyone who says that, there are five and a half Americans who say we have to protect, we have got an obligation to, and they believe strongly that we protect the lives of those innocent, unborn babies with a heartbeat. That is a huge majority on the side of life. I am very gratified to know that that is the position of the American people, with only a 3.1 percent margin of error in a scientific poll that I am happy now is part of the RECORD in the United States Congress. I would say there is another way to analyze this poll. I am looking at this one that says there are 13 percent undecided, Mr. Speaker. So you have 69 percent who agree altogether, and you have got 18 percent that disagree altogether, and 13 percent that neither agree nor disagree. Now, I always wonder, when we are doing polling, why do we measure those without an opinion? If they don’t agree or disagree, that is about the definition of ambivalent. They call that mox nix where I come from. So if I take that out of there and calculate it the other way and put it together, you add together 69 percent and 18 percent, and then you say what percentage are those that agree, well, it is actually 79.3 percent say we should not abort a baby whose heart is beating, and 20.7 percent say, well, it would be okay with them if we did. That is another way of measuring this. And that is a 4to1 measure—5.5to1, 4to1 Americans are ready to protect innocent, unborn human life. Mr. Speaker, think what this means. Think what it means that we are a society that seems to have plugged our ears to the understanding that life begins at conception. I have known this for a long time. It wasn’t a mystery to me. I see the beautiful little baby going out now. Mr. Speaker, that is a very gratifying thing to see from down here, parents raising their children right. But from my standpoint, I have this memory. Marilyn and I were married in 1972. I remember sitting there in card club, and the discussion at that time was we have all these babies being born in Central America and why do they have these babies if they can’t feed them? Why don’t they just abort them? I remember that discussion around card club on a Friday night. It didn’t really trigger me at the time because we hadn’t been very far into the abortion debate. I hadn’t thought about it very much. We weren’t parents, and Marilyn wasn’t pregnant at the time. We were just married. So I remember that discussion though, and it just didn’t hit me. It just kind of went through. I don’t even know if I engaged in it. I just remember that somebody at the table said, well, if they can’t feed them, why don’t they just have an abortion? Well, not very long after that our first child was born. And I picked up that little baby—actually, he wasn’t little. He was just a little bit short of 9 pounds. But I looked at him, and I 
was in such awe of the miracle of that little boy, that little baby boy named David. There was an aura about him. He was a product of Marilyn and me from our love. And there he is, a miraculous little child in my hands, warm and squirmy and soft and beautiful and a miracle. It is different if it is somebody else’s child, I suppose, because it hadn’t hit me like that. But there was an aura about this little baby, and you could have convinced me he was the second coming of Jesus Christ, himself. And I looked at him and I thought, how could anyone take this little miracle’s life? How could they kill this baby now? He is minutes old. How could they take his life the minute before he is born? No one could do that— well, almost no one. Could they take his life the minute after he was born? Or could they take it the minute before he was born? Or could someone take his life an hour before he was born or a day? Or could they take it a week before he was born or a month or one trimester or two trimesters or 8 months or 36 weeks or 37 weeks before he was born? What changed? What changed throughout that time? In a matter of minutes, it all fell into place for me. From the moment of conception he was formed in his mother’s womb, and from that point on he is growing on the genetic configuration that he is, blessed with a soul placed in him at that moment. That little boy grew from that point on, and now he is the father of three of my grandchildren. They are all miracles to me. And our other sons are all miracles to me, and our other grandchildren are all miracles to me. But I can’t conceive of doing anything except sacrificing, if I needed to, my life to protect them because they are unique human beings, worthy of all of the protection that society can give them, just like every American is; and, in fact, everybody on this planet is seen in God’s eyes. There has to be a moment that our lives begin. We have to choose that because we can’t have an immoral position coming out of law that says, well, it is up to the mother to decide whether this baby is going to have an opportunity to fill its lungs full of free air and scream for its own mercy. They can’t do that from the moment of conception, but they can do that from the moment of birth. And if we could hear that inner womb scream at that moment of abortion, we would plug our ears in terror and fright at the crime that abortion is. So it is our moral obligation to protect all human life from the moment of conception until natural death. That is what this bill does, H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017. The polling that we have here says clearly that the American people agree. And it is not only, Mr. Speaker, the American people—well, it is actually in the polling. But I separated them out into categories so we could understand how people think about this and how they think about it from the categories of being Republicans and Democrats and no party or Independents. As you can see, among the Republicans, 86 percent agree that, if a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected. That is 86 to 6 percent disagree. Eightysix percent of Republicans, that is about as high a number as you see on anything. I should run a little measure sometime when you ask, does the Sun come up in the east. That is probably about only a 97 percent issue. But it is 86 percent want to protect a baby with a heartbeat—Republicans. Democrats, still that landslide majority of 55 percent of Democrats want to protect a baby from the moment a heartbeat can be detected—25 percent say no, 55 percent say yes. It is more than a 2to1 support among Democrats to support the language that is in this bill for H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act. And then when you go among Independents, they are a little more pro life than Democrats are. I shouldn’t be surprised at that. Sixtyone percent of Independents want to protect a baby from the moment that their heartbeat can be detected. b1645 This is a huge issue for America. America is not yet informed enough about this legislation that is available. And sometimes we get stuck in a rut and we decide, well, we have been working on the sexselective legislation or the paincapable legislation, or we have been trying to get Planned Parenthood defunded—which this Congress must do—and we need to do it perpetually, not just annually. Those are all things that we need to be working on, but it is time now for this Congress to swing for the fences, to move legislation that is based upon a clear and distinct principle of life. If that heartbeat of that little baby’s heart, that innocent little baby can be detected, we have a moral obligation to protect that baby. Then how do we measure the end of life? And how has it been from time immemorial? When the heart stops? When the heart can no longer beat? Yes, we measure brain waves and we do other things. But when that heart stops and it can’t be started and we can’t sustain life, we call that death. And when an abortion is committed, that little baby’s heart is beating. And you know that the abortion stops a beating heart. That is on posters by the Knights of Columbus and others all over this country. Abortion stops a beating heart. We need to protect the lives of all of those little babies with beating hearts. We can detect them now with the ultrasound and the science that we have. It is time for this Congress to move. In our March for Life here that I mentioned a little earlier, Mr. Speaker, when we have hundreds of thousands of people that come out here and gather on The Mall and then march to the Supreme Court building to plead for the court to protect innocent, unborn human life, what is happening is America is waking up. America is feeling the guilt, and we pray for the mothers who have had abortions. But America is also understanding that there is a life that begins at the moment of conception. So of all of the families that have first bonded with this little unborn baby by seeing the ultrasound—sometimes by framing it, as exists in my Sioux City office for Joseph Dean Anderson’s ultrasound—but millions of those cases across the country are raising the awareness of the American people, and it is not just the mother and the father that see that ultrasound. They see it in realtime, and they hear the sound for real. It is not just a picture that goes up on the wall that is framed, but it is a living, breathing, moving organism where you can see that innocent little baby squirming and moving around inside in the amniotic fluid, and you can see the expressions on their face and the movement that is there. That this is a real human being and you want to get your hands on that little baby and hold them and love them, but you have to wait until they grow enough that you can do that. But family after family has this, and little brothers and sisters are shown that ultrasound and they say: This is your little brother or little sister that we expect on such and such date—we have become pretty close with that date. And so kids, brothers and sisters, the siblings are recognizing their brother or their sister, acknowledging that they are an innocent unborn human being well before they are born. And they grow up knowing this. Now, for the 44 years since Roe v. Wade, we have millions of millions of prolife people and millions and millions of antiabortion people who understand this. They grew up understanding this. And no one can any longer tell them that it is just a blob of a tissue and that it is not alive. I recall a World War II veteran, one who I admired and respected. He has passed away now, as many of them have. His name was Vic Lunsman. We were having this discussion while we were talking about building terraces and tiling, and he said: When the pro abortion people say that this baby is not alive—if this baby is not alive, why then do you have to kill it? Why do you have to kill it? I thought he put that into a package about as compressed as it could be. We know that abortion ends an innocent life of an innocent human being that is created in the same image that we are recreated in, in God’s image. And now we know from 16 days on that—it is not just that we know that there is a heartbeat, but we can hear it. We can hear the beat, beat, beat, beat, beat of 
that little heart. And to think of that little heart struggling for life; to think of that baby squirming to try to avoid the abortionist; to think of that baby feeling the pain; to think of that baby being aborted because the mother or the father wanted a boy or a girl; or because somebody told them that that baby wasn’t going to be exactly perfect, none of that measures up against innocent, unborn human life, sacred life, that life that we have to protect from the moment of conception to natural death. That is what is wrapped up in this heartbeat bill. And if we had the science to prove the moment of conception, I would be standing here with a moment of conception bill. We don’t have that science today, but we do have the science of detecting a heartbeat. And we know the sound of a beating heart is the sound of life. And if you can detect a heartbeat, if you can hear that heart beating in any of us, you know that person is alive; you know there is a spirit within us; you know that our soul is still within our body; and you know that there is a hope for us—at least whoever that might be whose heart we are listening to—to get up and to move about, to live, love, laugh, learn, reproduce, and contribute, to glorify this Earth in a way that we are challenged to do. Yet, 60 million babies have been denied that opportunity and have been denied that gift of life. What might they have done? What might they have done for America? What might they have done for the world? How many Presidents, how many Mother Teresas, how many Billy Grahams? How many people have lost their life before they ever had a chance to breathe and fight for it that might have solved the problems that we are facing today here in this United States Congress? We can’t deny that potential. We carry that guilt today, but the best we can do is end it as soon as we can end it. And we would end 90 to 95 percent of the abortions in America with H.R. 490 the Heartbeat Protection Act. Mr. Speaker, I want to remind you here in this Congress that this is a bill that has strong support in the polling that we have rolled out here. Eighty six percent of Republicans say that if a heartbeat can be detected, the baby should be protected. Fiftyfive percent of Democrats agree that if a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected. Sixtyone percent of Independents say that if a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected. And of those who oppose it—at least those who oppose it vigorously—only 6 percent of Republicans, 25 percent of Democrats—and I am going to suspect that a fair amount of these 25 percent of Democrats, Mr. Speaker, are more for political reasons and that they wouldn’t be able to sustain themselves in a moral debate on the topic. I think that may or may not be the case for the 27 percent of no parties. But to put this back into summary, Mr. Speaker, here are easier numbers to remember: 69 percent of the American people, with only a 3.1 percent margin of error, believe that if a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected. That is 7 in 10 Americans that take that stand. And that is one of the strongest pieces of support you can get for any bill that would ever come to this floor or any discussion that we ever have if you get up to that level of 7 out of 10, and only 18 percent disagree vigorously. So, Mr. Speaker, I hope that the people that listen in on this conversation between us have contemplated the central points that I have put into this debate and this discussion here this evening, and I hope they have thought about the principles that are involved. I hope they are able to carry this message along to their children and grandchildren, and into our schools and our classrooms, our churches and our synagogues all across this land, this profound belief that if Americans share; that we believe that human life is sacred and it needs to be then sacred in all of its forms. The second question is: At what moment does life begin? There is only one moment in the full development of a full human being, and that is the moment of conception. The closest we can scientifically get to proof of that conception is the sound and the detection of that heartbeat, which we all recognize to be the sound of life. That sound of life, that beat of that heart cannot be extinguished by a moral human being who believes that a human life is sacred in all of its forms, and knows that it begins at the moment of conception. And then we can measure the heartbeat and protect that baby from the moment that that heart has begun to beat. Any doctor that fails to follow the directive in this legislation, in H.R. 490, any doctor that fails to search for a heartbeat and conducts an abortion without—or conducts an abortion in spite of that beating heart is facing a fine and a prison term up to 5 years, or both. That is a respect for human life. By the way, we hold the mother harmless. She is also protected from any touch of this law. It is only the abortionist that is the subject of this piece of legislation that I have introduced. But it aims to protect human life from at least the moment that the heartbeat can be detected; the baby is protected. And this will gain momentum as we go forward. The American people will understand what this means. I am hopeful that across our churches, across our schools, across our families, they begin to talk about the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017. And our little kids that grow up, as mine did—having once seen the film, that families grow up respecting the heartbeat of innocent, unborn human life. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your attention this evening. I yield back the balance of my time. 
DISMANTLING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be with you this afternoon. I have a series of other speakers who will be joining me later in the hour from the Progressive Caucus, as we discuss some of the key events of the week from our perspective. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all the Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland? There was no objection. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I love magic, and I bet a lot of people out there watching today love magic, too. Ever since I was a kid, I loved the cup tricks, the card tricks, and the rabbit coming out of the hat. When I was in college, I even used to entertain at elementary school birthday parties, helping to pay my way through college. The key move in magic, as you know, Mr. Speaker, is the sleight of hand. I looked up the definition of ‘‘sleight of hand’’ in the MerriamWebster Dictionary, which defines it as a cleverly executed deception. A sleight of hand is also sometimes called a prestidigitation, quick fingers, or legerete de la main, which is the French phrase for ‘‘lightness of hand.’’ It is defined as the set of closely related techniques used by a stage magician to manipulate the perceptions of the audience. Sleight of hand depends on the use of psychology, careful stage misdirection, constant blabbering, and strategic confusion to distract the audience. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States has been masterfully deploying sleight of hand ever since his inauguration. With his nonstop tweeting and his incessant mad antics, the President distracts us from the real action, which is what is happening here in Congress. We are witnessing a magic trick on the world’s largest stage, the auditorium of American democracy. And we, the people, are the captive, bedazzled, and totally distracted audience of the President. The tweets are a massive sleight of hand distracting us from the serious destruction of public policy and law that is taking place right here in Congress. 
b1700 I want to say, at the outset, I prefer to think of this as a magic trick because the alternative that the President simply can’t control himself is almost too horrific to contemplate. The Constitution does have a way of dealing with that problem, too, and you can find it in the 25th Amendment. Today, we are going to assume that all of this is a magic show. I used to coach kids’ soccer. And when I coached soccer, I would always tell the kids: Don’t bunch. Keep your eye on the ball. Stay in your lane and pass the ball. Without fail, the youngest kids who are just starting out, they all chase the ball. They move around the field in a big clump, a big mob. And I would say: Don’t follow the mob that is following the ball. Go to where the ball is going to be going. When they are young, they don’t know how to do it. I think that advice applies here as well to America, to the body politic. Don’t follow the mob that is following the ball. Let’s not be distracted full time by all the tomfoolery and tweetfoolery. There are important and dangerous things happening right here in Congress right now. While the President is tweeting insults and fake news and inflating his slender college victory and the size of his inaugural crowd and making fun of Meryl Streep and chatting about Nordstrom’s department store and talking about how he is going to make Mexico pay for his wall and so on, what is taking place in Congress is the systematic dismantling of the regulatory apparatus that the American public depends on for clean air, clean water, safe food, a decent environment, and control of criminality in the country. The fundamental political action that we must be paying attention to now is the dismantling of the regulatory apparatus of the Federal Government, which is happening every day right here in the Halls of Congress. This is the apparatus that protects our food, our air, our water, our health care, our financial system, the ability of people to invest safely on Wall Street, occupational safety and health for our workers. All of this is being attacked in terrifying and often invisible ways. Behind the scenes, while the wizard of odd convenes a dinner in MaraLago where he entertains a national security crisis discussion in full view of other diners who begin to tweet out and Facebook out what they are seeing happen, while all of that is happening, Congress is rolling back environmental protections to protect streams, rivers, and drinking water from pollution. They are savaging the rules that restrict the volume of greenhouse gas emissions that are leaked into the atmosphere, destabilizing our climate system. Check out H.J. Res. 38 and 36. While the distractor in chief whines about leaks, while his whole campaign was based on leaks of emails that were captured by Russian agents working to get him elected, in Congress, they are rolling back financial regulations which ensure that workers have retirement savings options, H.J. Res. 66, and which protect consumers from excessive financial risks, H.R. 78. They have also targeted and rolled back labor regulations that promote safe and healthy workplaces and fair employment practices, H.J. Res. 37. Amazingly, while President Trump’s National Security Adviser, General Flynn, was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had been colluding with Russians to lift the sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia, here in Congress, we are passing joint resolutions to rescind anticorruption regulations that required oil and gas companies to report monetary payments that they made to foreign governments, H.J. Res. 41. So Trump tweets about leaks, while his administration is one vast leak to the Russians. And here, Members of the GOP are working to throw an invisibility and secrecy cloak over corporate payments being made to foreign governments and corporations. While the world is distracted by all of the sleight of hand, this Congress is passing bills to give government back to giant corporations and special interests that care not for the common good but simply for their own bottom line. Mr. Speaker, as a freshman, I have been here for only 8 weeks. I have to tell you that I am disappointed that I have not voted on a single bill in the House Judiciary Committee that has had so much as a hearing. Yes, I want to repeat that. We have voted on five bills since I got here and not one of them has had a hearing. Now, I come from the Maryland State Senate where I proudly served for 10 years as a State senator. When we had a bill coming up, no bill could be brought to the floor without a hearing first, and anybody who wanted to come testify on the bill could come testify on it. Now, that is not practicable here in the U.S. Congress. However, we could at least have experts relating to the bill and people who are affected by the bill come in and testify, but we haven’t done that in the House Judiciary Committee. Instead, we voted on a series of bills which, to my mind, dramatically curtail the public interest. Yesterday, we voted on a bill to dismantle, essentially to put into a stifling straightjacket, the classaction mechanism that has been used over the decades to vindicate the interest of people who are victims of sex discrimination, victims of race discrimination, victims of toxic torts, victims of asbestos poisoning. We voted basically to trash class action yesterday without even so much as a bill. Now, on some of the other bills, it was said to me: Well, there were hearings in prior Congresses. One Member said: We had a hearing on that back in 2012. This is 2017, 5 years later. But on this particular bill that I am talking about, nobody even heard the bill. There was no hearing on it. It was simply brought up for a vote. That is irresponsible legislation. That is not real democracy when you don’t even have a hearing and people who are affected by the legislation don’t have the opportunity to come and talk about it. Now, they are not having hearings because they think—and they are probably right—we’re not paying attention. What are we paying attention to? We are paying attention to the magician. We are paying attention to the wizard of odd. We are paying attention to the tweets instead. The good news is that the audience is starting to wise up. The whole country is waking up to the profound dangers of the administration’s financial and political entanglements with Russia, with the Russian corporate and governmental elite. Just this week, the National Security Adviser, Mr. Flynn, resigned after reports came out about his communications with the Russian Ambassador while President Obama was still in office, communications dealing with the lifting of sanctions on Russia, communications that General Flynn lied about and was forced from office because of it. He misled Vice President MIKEPENCE and other officials about his conversations with the diplomat, which was being monitored and recorded by the intelligence community. Now, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, let’s think about this for a moment. As a former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Mr. Flynn was no innocent about the world of spy versus spy. He must have known that his telephone call with the Russian Ambassador was being monitored and recorded. If he really wanted to go rogue and operate on his own without the permission and the license of President Trump, he never would have allowed that telephone conversation to be recorded. But he did allow it to be recorded. He made the call with presumable full knowledge that other people in the intelligence community would be listening in on it, which leads me to the inescapable, logical conclusion that Flynn knew that, in making that call, he enjoyed the full support of the one person above him who could remove him from his job, the President of the United States. Now, do I know that? No, I don’t know it. I surmise it. How are we going to know whether or not this is true? How do we get to the bottom of the Russian connection in the campaign? How do we get to the bottom of the Russian connection in the Trump administration? We need to have a full, complete, independent investigation by experts, like the 9/11 Commission, which gets to the bottom of this profound danger, this dagger pointed at the throat of American democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, everybody loves magic, I think. Everybody loves the enchantment of being fooled, of being distracted, of being diverted. That is why people go to magic shows. It is diverting. It is amusing. It is fun. Everybody loves a great magician, too. None was greater in our history than the great Houdini, who dazzled the world with his extraordinary optical illusions and effects, his amazing ability to simulate telepathy and telekinesis. Houdini also had a very strong ethical and professional code about being a magician. He never revealed a trick. More importantly, he never tried to fool people in order to defraud them. He never tried to fool people in order to humiliate them. He never tried to fool people in order to take away their rights. He never tried to fool people in order to demoralize and crush them or to strip them of their freedom. He never tried to fool people in order to victimize them. Indeed, in the 1920s, Mr. Houdini channeled all of his magnificent energy away from doing his magic shows and instead put it into the separate but related task of exposing psychics, mediums, con men, charlatans, and practitioners of the occult and the dark arts who did take advantage of people’s good will, who did take advantage of people’s impressionability to defraud them, to take their money, their belongings, and to distract them from the real world, and to undermine the moral and ethical principles that should govern human behavior and must govern social life. Although Houdini is no longer with us, he has great heirs today in socially responsible magicians like the Amazing Randi and Penn & Teller. Already millions of Americans themselves—millions of us in the audience— have woken up to the fact that we have been pulled into an irrational and dangerous fantasy world, an echo chamber of malignant narcissism, cruelty, and paranoia. It is time for all of us to stop being distracted, to stop being bedazzled, and pay attention to the real game, which is, one, trying to get America to join with Vladimir Putin, a dictator and an autocrat who said that the single greatest catastrophe of the 20th century was the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in order to create an international league of dictators, demagogues, and despots to violate human rights and crush liberal democracy; and, two, to dismantle at home the public regulatory infrastructure which protects our land, our air, our water, our climate, our liberties, our freedoms, our equal rights, and our capacity to function as the greatest democracy on Earth and to function as an efficient and effective government meeting the needs of the people. The magicians out there—there aren’t many—but you have a special obligation to help us blow the whistle, and you are doing it. But it is really the American people—it is all of us who must stand up. The Constitution talks about three branches of government. Article I is Congress. Article II is the executive. Article III is the judiciary. Let’s call Congress the first branch. But when you think about it, what is even more important than the Congress is the trunk, the roots of democracy. Everything grows up from the people. The branches are out there, but Congress works for the people. The President works for Congress and the people. The Supreme Court and the judiciary work for the people. It is time for the people to dissolve the spells that have been cast over the country, to say this is a democracy. We operate by the Constitution and the rule of law. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate participating in this Special Order hour about things that, I think, the American people really ought to be caring about. The minute that Donald Trump took the oath of office and put his hand in the air, he was in violation of the law. It is just a fact that the Trump Hotel, which is in the old post office building—there is a very explicit contract that says no elected official may enter into a contract for that hotel and profit from the business in that hotel. There was a lawsuit that was filed. It is still pending. You may not think that is a really big deal, but how about this: What if there were delegations from somewhere else in the world, some country that really wanted to curry favor with the United States of America, and decided a really good way to do it would be to move our delegation to stay at the Trump Hotel? b1715 Maybe we could have a big gala, we could have a party, and we could make a lot of money from that. And guess what. Maybe the President of the United States would notice that we are spending money in a hotel from which he gains a profit, and that would be a really swell idea. Well, actually, the Framers of the Constitution thought that was not such a grand idea and very explicitly put into the Constitution something that would prohibit any foreign government from influencing U.S. policy. They were worried about the King of England. They were worried about France. They were worried about other countries having too much influence on the United States by currying favor with the President and the decisionmakers, and so they introduced and put into the Constitution very explicitly what they called the Emoluments Clause in Article I, section 9 of the Constitution. While ‘‘emoluments’’ is certainly not a word we use in regular conversations—emoluments, I never used it before this and never heard of it before this, actually—it is a concept that is part of our Constitution, and it is very simple: that no government official should receive benefits of any kind—of any kind—from a foreign government. President Trump is clearly violating that constitutional principle. So, unlike any Presidents before him, President Trump has actually refused to fully separate himself and his family from his business dealings. It is also very unusual, of course, that we haven’t seen his tax returns, which has been pretty standard for any President to release his tax returns, and it has been a requirement for the Cabinet that Mr. Trump has exacted from those nominees. Because of his business holdings, Trump and his family are constantly— constantly—receiving benefits from other countries, whether it is foreign governments renting that space at the Trump Hotel in D.C. or the loans and business agreements that the Trump organization has with China, Russia, and many other countries. We don’t know them all. We haven’t seen them all. That would be in his tax returns and all the different sections of the tax return, his holdings in Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, which he has refused to put into a blind trust. So it is troubling enough that President Trump and his family are profiting off the Presidency, but now it is becoming clearer that this lack of ethics could threaten our national security and national interests. So if you haven’t cared until now, you ought to start caring. Look at Russia. Trump has done business in Russia and has remained uncomfortably close to Vladimir Putin. He refuses to release his tax returns, which could clarify the specific financial interests that he has in Russia. President Trump knew his National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, was compromised by Russian intelligence and had misled Vice President PENCE ; yet Flynn was allowed to remain in one of our most sensitive national security positions until criticism from Congress, the media, and the public became too much to ignore. President Trump continues to gloss over the serious problems that led to Flynn’s resignation. Instead, he attacks the messenger and the leaks that brought Flynn’s conduct to light. These are bright red flags. These are signs that the President has something to hide. Americans deserve a President who they can trust is putting the country’s interests ahead of his own, that he is putting the country’s interests instead of another country’s interests because that deal might be in his interest. There should be no question over the purity of the President’s motives, especially when he is making critical security decisions on behalf of the Nation. If President Trump wants to assure the American people that he deserves our 
trust, he must be transparent. We need a bipartisan, independent investigation of his conflicts of interest, particularly with Russia, but not exclusively. He must release his tax returns, and he must fully separate himself from his business dealings. The corrupt practices of this administration must stop. Our country and our Constitution demand nothing less. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ), my good friend, the Assistant Democratic Leader. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to continue honoring HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, for their significant contributions to our Nation’s history. While only 3 percent of our Nation’s higher education institutions are Historically Black, HBCUs produce 20 percent of the AfricanAmerican college graduates. Today, I recognize and celebrate two of the seven HBCUs in my congressional district, Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College, both in Denmark, South Carolina. Voorhees College was founded as Denmark Industrial School in 1897 by Elizabeth Evelyn Wright when she was just 23 years old. Wright studied at Tuskegee Institute and was a devotee of Booker T. Washington. She had previously led efforts to start schools for African Americans in South Carolina, which were always met with arson and threats of violence. She persisted in her efforts to offer African Americans an opportunity for a better life and, with Voorhees, created an institution that would stand the test of time. Wright originally taught classes in an old store in Denmark, but, in 1902, New Jersey philanthropist Ralph Voorhees donated money to purchase land and construct a building for the school. A high school at first, Voorhees offered classes at this level for African Americans in the area. In 1924, the Episcopal Church partnered with Voorhees, and an affiliation with that church continues to this day. The college began to offer junior college degrees in 1947 and 4 year degrees in 1962. While originally founded on the principles of Booker T. Washington to teach job and trade skills to African Americans, Voorhees now proudly claims to offer a blend of Washington’s philosophy and that of W. E. B. Du Bois, who believed a classical liberal arts education was vital to the development of African Americans. The college’s recently retired president, Dr. Cleveland Sellers, is a Denmark native who graduated from Voorhees High School. Sellers went on to Howard University, where he became active with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, participating in its 1966 March against Fear. In 1968, after returning to South Carolina, Sellers was arrested and imprisoned for supposedly inciting the confrontation between students and police that became known as the Orangeburg massacre, when police opened fire on students, killing 3 and injuring 27. Voorhees’ College’s new president, Dr. W. Franklin Evans, previously served as interim president of my alma mater, South Carolina State. In that role, he successfully led South Carolina State out of a financial crisis. I sincerely believe that Voorhees College is wellpositioned for the future with Dr. Evans at its helm. Denmark Technical College, whose campus is adjacent to Voorhees, was originally a branch of the South Carolina Trade School System. It was created in 1948 by the South Carolina General Assembly and mandated to provide trade skills to African Americans. During the ‘‘separate but equal’’ era, Denmark Tech was one of the few opportunities for trade school education offered to African Americans by the State. In the early 1960s, Governor Fritz Hollings and thenSenator John West led the effort to create the South Carolina Technical College System. In 1969, the existing trade school in Denmark was transferred into the system and the modern Denmark Technical College was created. Its total enrollment is approximately 2,000, 96 percent of whom are minority students. Denmark Tech continues to provide technical education and trade skills in its assigned region of Bamberg, Barnwell, and Allendale Counties. Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College, like their fellow HBCUs, have made an indelible impact on their communities, South Carolina, and the Nation. They have provided generations of African Americans educational opportunities, and I look forward to their continued success. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, we should be joined momentarily by Representative SHEILA JACKSON LEE. I want to close out, though, my own thoughts by responding to something I have been hearing over the last week here in the Halls of Congress. Now that it is clear from our intelligence agencies, 16 of them, including the CIA, the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and so on, that Vladimir Putin had a deliberate campaign of espionage, cyber sabotage, propaganda, and fake news to undermine American democracy in the 2016 election, and now that it is clear that there were high level contacts between Trump associates and officials of the Russian Government, it is no longer being denied by anybody on either side of the aisle. What I have started to hear is, well, sure, they tried to hack our election, and, sure, they leaked thousands of emails, and, sure, they changed the dynamics of the campaign and what people were talking about in the campaign, but there is no proof that they stuffed any ballot boxes or they hacked into the computers. And that is true; we don’t know that they stuffed any ballot boxes or hacked into computers, and we will have to see if anything comes out about that when we finally get to do a real comprehensive investigation. But, Mr. Speaker, the reality is that we should be terrified and appalled and outraged that they were allowed to go as far as they did. How many people in this body would accept a foreign entity coming into our congressional districts and spending millions or hundreds of thousands of dollars against us, hacking into our computers, releasing our emails, and completely changing the dynamics of the campaign? So when I hear from colleagues that, well, yes, they distorted the campaign, they hacked into the campaign, but they didn’t steal the election, I think that they are making a distinction with no difference at all. If you derail the campaign, you kidnap the campaign, you hijack the campaign, you have altered the outcome of the election, especially one in which your opponent gets 2.9 million votes more than you did, especially in an election where you were able to torture out only the slenderest of electoral college victories in three States by 70,000 votes. b1730 So I simply reject the constant claim that I am hearing from colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that we don’t need to worry about Russian subversion of the 2016 election because it only affected the campaign; it didn’t necessarily affect the election outcome. To influence the campaign is to influence the election outcome. Mr. Speaker, I am seeing Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEEis not here, so I yield back the balance of my time. 
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ) for 30 minutes. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, we see so much on TV. I was watching the President’s press conference a little while ago. We see so much discord out there, and this opportunity that we have in the afternoon to really delve deep into the issues is so valuable to me. It is one of the only opportunities that the American people get to see us delving deeply into the issues. You and I know that we are in the committee room, we are behind closed doors in a bipartisan way grappling with all of the hardest issues that face American families, but folks don’t see it and they don’t feel it. Why it is we celebrate the discord instead of celebrating the discourse is a mystery to me. I bring, Mr. Speaker, today some stories about the Affordable Care Act from my district at home. It is not going to be a surprise to you that these are stories of challenges. In Cumming, Georgia—it is up in Forsyth County, Georgia, just north of 
Atlanta—I heard from a single mom. She has two kids, ages 11 and 13. They have a family physician that they want to hang on to. She says: I work parttime as a paralegal. I earn $25,000 a year, and I also receive child support payments. She said that she was encouraged by a health insurance company to go out and enroll in Medicaid instead, but neither of her children’s doctors accept Medicaid. How often do we hear that? The solution for everything is to dump everyone into Medicaid. Medicaid is not a healthcare system. It is a healthcare payment system. You have to find a doctor who will accept a payment. This young woman’s doctors do not. She said she went on healthcare.gov, filled out an application, and was offered a plan for $464 a month with a $12,600 deductible. She makes $25,000 a year, and what we have offered her is a $500amonth policy, $464 a month, with a $12,000 deductible. That is not affordable, she said. She called an insurance broker and looked for a similar policy. They were priced the same way. She said: I have decided to pay the ObamaCare fines instead. Mr. Speaker, I tell this story because I know that every single Member of this body wants to serve the constituency that sent them here. Every single Member of this body wants to find solutions for folks back home. As we look at the numbers across the country, we find that more Americans that we purported to help with the Affordable Care Act have decided to pay a fine instead of join the exchange system. Mr. Speaker, we have more Americans opting out of the system than opting into the system because we have failed those very people we purported to help. From Buford, Georgia, Mr. Speaker: I’m a fulltime student with a part time job that doesn’t offer health or dental insurance. I can’t get health insurance through my parents because they are on Medicare. I shopped for health plans, but all of the ones on the exchange are out of my budget. I shouldn’t have to pay a fine because I can’t afford health care. Now, think about that, Mr. Speaker. This young student says: I shouldn’t have to pay a fine because I can’t afford the health care. If I can’t afford the health care, I certainly can’t afford the fine. These are the people that we purported to help with the Affordable Care Act, and they are not being served. Back in Cumming, Georgia, Mr. Speaker: Today I have been in my office for hours trying to find affordable health care that accommodates my primary care physician. Prices start for me at $750plus. Before ObamaCare, I was paying $365 with more access to doctors. It is not just about the money, Mr. Speaker. These networks, as you know, are closing. More than onethird of the counties in America have no choice of insurance whatsoever. The networks are narrowing. Folks are not just finding it hard to pay for care, but they are finding it hard to choose their physician. A retired couple in Peachtree Corners, Mr. Speaker: I retired last year, and my husband retired this year. Both of us are in our sixties. We knew we would have to pay a lot for health insurance, but I was stunned when we signed up for the Affordable Care Act to the tune of more than $1,200 per month. I recently received a notice from our insurer that premiums for 2017 will go to over $2,000 per month. This family played by the rules their entire life, Mr. Speaker. They retired, needed access to health care, and went to the exchanges that were purported to help people find affordable health care. They found a $1,200amonth policy that this year rises to $2,000 a month. I say this to the young people planning for their retirement and thinking about putting something away for a rainy day: This couple pays $2,000 a month simply for their premium. Another family in Cumming, Georgia, Mr. Speaker: Six years ago, we had a perfectly acceptable highdeductible plan with an HSA for $300 a month. As ObamaCare has been implemented, it has gone from $300 to $450 to $950 per month, and our only remaining option is a $1,450permonth plan that provides effectively the same coverage. Mr. Speaker, I added that one because these folks weren’t looking for help. These folks weren’t uninsured. These folks didn’t have a problem finding insurance. They had it under control themselves. In the name of helping the uninsured, the Affordable Care Act came in, reregulated the entire insurance industry, even for people who already had health care, and drove this family’s premiums from $300 a month to $1,400 a month. Mr. Speaker, who defends these things? Who defends these things? I tell you, I will not have a colleague from the Democratic side or the Republican side who would say that any of these consequences were intended when the Affordable Care Act was passed. They might have been inevitable, but they were not intended. So we can agree there is a problem. We can agree there is a problem. And if you don’t think that we can agree, let me refer first to former President Barack Obama. Just last fall, he said this: Despite this progress, too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles or pay their monthly insurance bills. They struggle to navigate a complex, sometimes bewildering system, and they remain uninsured. That’s right. They remain uninsured. The trillionplus dollars that we spent to solve the issue of the uninsured solved nothing. We continue to have a problem with the uninsured, yet we have added problems to those who are insured. Democratic Governor Mark Dayton from Minnesota in October of last year, Mr. Speaker: The reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. The reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable—these are words of folks who supported the Affordable Care Act. Former President Bill Clinton: ‘‘So you’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled with their coverage cut in half. It’s the craziest thing in the world.’’ There is a group of people, mostly smallbusiness owners and employees, who make just a little too much to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can’t get Affordable Care Act premiums in a lot of places. Former President Bill Clinton says that there are guys out there busting 60 hours a week trying to make it work for their families, and we have failed them. It is not that they had a problem to begin with. Many of these folks had insurance that they liked to begin with. We failed them when we reregulated them into problems instead of solving problems. Mr. Speaker, the broken promises began right away. You will remember the fact check organization that named ‘‘If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan’’ as the Lie of the Year. Overpromising and underdelivering has been the nature of ObamaCare. We were promised premiums would decline by $2,500. The average family premium has increased by $4,300. We were promised the cost of health care would go down, but deductibles have risen more than 60 percent. We were promised you can keep your doctor, but 70 percent of us find ourselves in narrower networks today than we did before. Middle class Americans were promised we wouldn’t see a tax increase, but as we just heard from this young student, when you can’t find a plan that meets your needs, then you are fined by the IRS. You are paying taxes right then. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not blaming these systemic problems on President Obama. I am not blaming these systemic problems on the Affordable Care Act. What I am doing is pointing out that we passed the Affordable Care Act with $1 trillion in new tax increases and with a reregulation of all of the insurance plans that people liked before in the name of solving these problems, which we did not solve. I will take you to my home State of Georgia, Mr. Speaker. On average, 32 percent is the increase that we are seeing in premiums on our exchange—32 percent this year alone. Of the folks 
who are participating in the exchange, Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of them receive a government subsidy. Let me say that again: Of the folks who participate in the $1 trillion Affordable Care Act exchange program in the State of Georgia, 80 percent of them do so because the government is paying for their health care. That is a pretty good incentive to get in the system. If you’re going to get a subsidy payment, folks are in the system. Eighty percent require that subsidy in order to be enticed into the system. As you know, Mr. Speaker, more people rejected going into the system opting instead for no health care than went into the system with the Affordable Care Act. The average wage earner in Georgia, Mr. Speaker, gets no subsidy from the government. Four hundred percent of the poverty line, as you know, is where that subsidy kicks in. That is about $48,000 a year in the State of Georgia. I am telling you, if you earn $48,000 a year, you have bills, obligations, and responsibilities, and you find yourself in one of these $2,000amonth premium situations that this retired couple in Georgia did, you cannot afford health insurance—or at least you cannot afford the health insurance that the government today is requiring that you have. Let’s think about those requirements, Mr. Speaker. The government, in its wisdom, decided it was going to force folks into plans that it deemed appropriate. Many of those came in the form of healthcare COOPs. It was certainly a reasonable idea: let’s allow folks in States back home to join together and provide health insurance. We sucked folks into those COOPs, Mr. Speaker. Again, an unsustainable system, this death spiral of ObamaCare. One million folks were sucked into COOPs that went belly up, Mr. Speaker. They lost their insurance once when ObamaCare came into business, and they lost their insurance again when these COOPs failed. As you can see on this map, the orange COOPs have failed. Only a few remain in business today. It remains to be seen if they will make it through the year. When we talk about choice, Mr. Speaker, five States have only one insurer in the exchange. That was the whole point of the exchange. That is why we spent literally billions upon billions to set up these exchanges so that consumers could compare and choose. Now, two things went wrong. Number one, we set up this list of mandates that every insurance plan had to comply with, which disincentivized folks to join those plans to begin with. Then, number two, by setting up what you had to have in a plan, you, by definition, restricted the choice of individuals to choose what they want. So you end up with five States with only one insurer under ObamaCare. Now, that is before the announcement this week from Humana that it is withdrawing from all of the ObamaCare plans at the end of 2017. That was before the announcement this week from the Aetna CEO that he sees the death spiral that ObamaCare is involved in— his words—and it remains to be seen whether they will participate next year or not. I don’t need to find consensus among 218 Members or even 435 Members about whether or not ObamaCare is succeeding or failing. b1745 What I need is for folks to look at the 19 million uninsured Americans who had an opportunity to go into this trilliondollar system; an opportunity to reach for the golden ring, as it was described by its authors and its proponents, and they said: No. They said: It doesn’t work for me. They said: It is not the right thing for me. They said: It doesn’t fit into my families’ needs and desires and expectations. Of these 19 million, Mr. Speaker, 6.5 million paid a tax penalty. That is 6.5 million Americans failed by their government in a trilliondollar healthcare regulation, failed by their government in an expansion through ObamaCare and Medicaid, and failed by their government yet again when they received a bill because the trilliondollar program we put together didn’t work for them and their families. Can’t we agree that if our goal was to solve the problem of the uninsured American, having 19 million Americans who would rather stay uninsured than participate in the Affordable Care Act is the definition of failure? We can do better. There is a better way, Mr. Speaker, let there be no mistake about that. I know there is a lot of anxiety out there. I don’t want to minimize that. Fear is a corrosive emotion to have. I want to do my very best to allay the fear of anyone in America, Mr. Speaker, who is benefiting from the Affordable Care Act. As these numbers have demonstrated, there are not many. But if you spend a trillion dollars and re regulate an entire industry, I certainly hope there is at least one family out there who got something out of it. I know that there are. I quote GREGWALDEN , the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Speaker, who, as you know, has wide jurisdiction for reregulating health care. He says this in January of this year: ‘‘We want to make sure that people with preexisting conditions continue to get covered.’’ Mr. Speaker, it is a myth that Congress didn’t care about preexisting conditions. It was Republicans in Congress, led by Republican Newt Gingrich of the great State of Georgia, who abolished preexisting conditions in every federally regulated plan back in 1996. He did that in partnership with Bill Clinton. What you have heard from our chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee is that we are committed to dealing with preexisting conditions. Take that anxiety off your list. From Tom Price, now the Secretary of Health and Human Services: ‘‘Nobody is interested in pulling the rug out from anybody.’’ We believe that it is absolutely imperative that individuals who have health care be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunity for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and their families. There has been a lot of talk about individuals losing health care. That is not our goal, nor is it our desire, nor is it our plan. The new Secretary of Health and Human Services said that this year. Now, Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to overpromise and underdeliver. ObamaCare is failing. The exchanges are failing. Insurance companies are leaving. Plans are being canceled. I am not saying that if you like your plan, you can keep it. Your plan may be one of the overly regulated, overly priced plans that is collapsing across this country. What I am saying to you is, our commitment is to help and not hurt in that area. I cannot prevent ObamaCare from failing. I cannot prevent your plan from going away, but I can provide an off ramp for you and your family so that you can find, as Secretary Price says, better choices and better opportunities. From the United States Senate, Mr. Speaker, Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL : ‘‘There will be a stable transition period, and once repeal is passed we will turn to replacement policies that cost less and work better than what we have now.’’ Some contend that, by fulfilling our promise to the American people, we are somehow going to go back to the way things were before ObamaCare, which we all know is untrue. If your family grappled with preexisting conditions because your State didn’t address it the same way the Federal Government did back in 1996— folks are committed, if you are playing by the rules, to stick with you and your family through this transition. If your family benefits from the raising of the lifetime caps that was a part of the Affordable Care Act, you have won that debate. You needn’t worry as we go through this transition. If you like the fact that your kids are unemployed and staying on your policy until they are 26 years old, I think you have won that debate. I think that is absolutely going to be a part of that conversation in this transition. If you have a fear, if you have a worry, if you have a concern, I don’t want to minimize it. I want to allay it. But come and share it with your Member of Congress, share it with your United States Senator. We have a group of leaders committed to addressing those concerns. Finally, PAUL RYAN, our Speaker of the House: ‘‘We can and should have a 
system in this country where everybody can have access to affordable health care, including people with pre existing conditions.’’ There are things that unite us in this body, and one of those things is caring for people, caring about people, wanting folks to get a fair shake. If you have played by the rules, you deserve a fair shake. That brings us all together in this institution. I don’t want any family to find themselves in fear that they are being forgotten in this transition, but there is a very real fear that, if you are in an Affordable Care Act plan today, that plan will fail. Mr. Speaker, there are two things we can do. We can pretend that failure is not imminent. You can look at all the insurers withdrawing from ObamaCare, you can look at all of the rate increases going up in double digits, you can look at all of the folks who are opting out because it has gotten too expensive and doesn’t serve their families’ needs. You can see the failure of ObamaCare. But the number of options that we have, the number of plans under discussion to replace it is numerous, Mr. Speaker. We have got the Better Way healthcare plan, we have got the American Health Care Reform Act, we have got the Empowering Patients First, we have got our Rules Committee chairman’s The World’s Great Healthcare Plan Act, the Patient Freedom Act, the ObamaCare Replacement Act. Mr. Speaker, we have options. To begin to get to those options, we need to be honest with ourselves, whether we opposed ObamaCare from the beginning or whether we hoped it was going to be the best thing since sliced bread, that ObamaCare has failed. With that recognition, we can repeal those costly mandates, we can repeal those constrictive agreements, we can repeal those things that have isolated us from choice, that have separated us from our doctors, and we can begin to restore a patientcentered, family first system. Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt that you are a smart man. I have no doubt that you work hard from dawn to dusk every day. But no matter how hard you work, I promise you that you will not know better than the families in my district which healthcare plan is best for them, and I appreciate you not trying to second guess them. I cannot make everybody in America happy, Mr. Speaker, but I can give everybody in America the choice to make themselves happy. I can’t empower families in America to make their own choices, their own decisions about what works best for them. Put your mind at ease. For folks who have concerns, we hear you. For folks who have been hurt, we are coming for you. And for folks who know there is a better way, we stand with you. It is going to be a long spring and summer, Mr. Speaker, because this is only heavy lifting, but it is the right thing to do, and we have got the right group of men and women here to do it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
FRIDAY NIGHT IN CAIRO The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 30 minutes. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, as we gather tonight in the historic House Chamber, where so much of our Nation’s history has been debated and dispatched, it is good to hear my friend from Georgia talk about the challenges that face our country with the failure of the Affordable Care Act and his thoughtful presentation on just precisely what we need to do to save Americans from the failures of this bad law. It is an honor to be in the historic House Chamber where every day the distinguished lawgivers in our history look down on this Chamber. George Mason, who wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights, looks down on the Speaker’s dais, as does Thomas Jefferson, the author of our Declaration of Independence. No speaker stands at the dais and addresses the people’s House without the steely gaze of Moses, the ultimate, most revered lawmaker, Mr. Speaker. He looks down on you and on this Chamber for truth and justice. Mr. Speaker, we Americans work hard. We work hard every day of the week, and we love Friday. We love Fridays so much that we say: Thank God it’s Friday. Over the years, TGIF has become not only something that everyone in our country who works hard recognizes, but it became the name of a popular restaurant. In the autumn, we love our Friday nights watching high school football. In the winter, maybe it is catching a movie and eating a pizza with our friends or family. In the spring, Friday can find us catching a baseball game, the American pastime. Mr. Speaker, last Friday night, I was in Cairo, Egypt, and what I saw was that same joyous, happy experience of families sharing their successes of the week; celebrating a great soccer victory; clapping to wonderful, warm local music; and witnessing the squealing of their kids running around their parents, celebrating a birthday or just a good week at work or school. The streets of the Khan elKhalili Bazaar in Cairo were chockfull last Friday, Mr. Speaker, with the living and the loving, just going about that weekly experience pursuing their own version of happiness and TGIF. Friday night in Cairo, the land of the Pharaoh, the land of the beginning of much of human education and civilization, there was dining and bargaining in the bizarre that has been the centerpiece of trading and manufacturing and merchandising for half a millennia. Mr. Speaker, my trip to Egypt was marked not just with witnessing the joy of Egyptian family life and seeing and sharing what we have in common. It was a reminder that the 91 million Egyptians are on the front line of the global war on terror, a war that unites the leadership of Egypt and the United States arminarm to design and implement the most effective strategies we can to defeat the malevolent evil enemy of ISIS, alQaida, Boko Haram, and their bloody cohorts across the globe. In my view, after the approach of the past 8 years, our enemies are stronger and engaged more broadly than ever before. Nothing has driven this point home more than a visit in Cairo to the St. Peter and St. Paul’s Coptic Church. Located on the plaza adjacent to the offices of His Holiness Coptic Pope Tawadros II, there was joy there last Saturday morning, Mr. Speaker, listening to the chants of the priests, the reverence of the families in the pews, the kids again squealing and smiling in their parents’ arms. But, Mr. Speaker, on the periphery of that joy was a stark reminder of the destruction there on December 11, when a male ISIS jihadist suicide bomber entered that church disguised as a woman and detonated his vest, murdering 25, mostly women, splattering the walls and the floors of God’s House with their blood. As I walked through that same entrance last Saturday, Mr. Speaker, the church has developed a reverent shrine to those who were lost. The pockmarks in the marble are there from the shrapnel from the vest. b1800 But that church is a symbol of unity in Egypt, not division, as it was visited by President elSisi, a devout Muslim leader of all Egyptians, who came to share his concern, his affection for Egyptians no matter what their religious background. Best summarized by the wise Pope of the Coptic church— Mr. Speaker, we have to remind ourselves that the word ‘‘Coptic,’’ of course, comes from the Greek word ‘‘aigyptios,’’ which means Egypt. The Coptic church is as old as St. Mark’s arrival in Alexandria in the first century. That wise old Pope told us, and I think really, Mr. Speaker, captured the whole spirit of the Egyptian people and the resolve that is taking place in that country under President elSisi when he said, Egyptians take two things from the Nile River on which they have lived some 5,000 years. They take water, and they take moderation in their beliefs. Mr. Speaker, tonight I wanted to come to the House Chamber and pay tribute to the Egyptian people for being on those front lines in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism, pay tribute to the Christian and Muslim people of Egypt working together to defeat this ideology. I want to commend President elSisi for his courageous leadership in the Muslim world. 
Coinciding with the birthday celebration of the Prophet Muhammad on New Year’s Day 2015, President elSisi went to the Islamic world’s most respected institution, AlAzhar University, and called upon the world’s 1.6 billion faithful Muslims and the faith’s imams to support a religious revolution. He called on the leaders to reject the mindset of death and jihad. Mr. Speaker, in both Egypt and America, we come from dust and to dust we shall return. We are made in God’s image, and God has granted us such unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. While we are breathing, each of us has an obligation to serve our fellow man, work to value our societies and make them the best that they can be. In January, we witnessed a change in leadership here in the United States. We had a former President who grew up in Hawaii and grew up riding the waves in Hawaii. He rode a wave into the White House and then drifted along, bobbing on top of those waves for 8 years. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have a President in the White House who is not riding the waves; he is making waves. It is my hope that he will execute a new direction and take new actions to win the global war on terrorism. I have to say, Mr. Speaker, whether it takes 3 months or 30 years, I won’t rest until we unify the civilized world to reject jihad, reject the terror we saw at St. Peter and St. Paul’s Church in Cairo. Mr. Speaker, we need to condemn those who condone it. We need to condemn those who finance it. We need to reject it when we see it taught in the mosque. We need to reject it on Facebook. We need to reject it in the media. We must condemn those who say it is wrong but stand silent. Mr. Speaker, there are no bystanders in this fight, and there is no substitute for victory. Mr. Speaker, all across the world tonight, we Egyptians, we Americans, we want our Fridays back. TGIF, Mr. Speaker, TGIF. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. CURBELO of Florida (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for today on account of family obligations. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today.
