Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support much needed investments in our Nation’s water systems. Earlier this year, EPA estimated some $472 billion is needed to maintain the Nation’s drinking water infrastructure over the next 20 years. We have woefully underinvested in drinking water for far too long, and now crumbling pipes and failing systems pose a serious threat to public health and public safety. Later today, the House is expected to vote on S. 3021, America’s Water Infrastructure Act, the latest iteration of WRDA. It is a good bill, the result of bipartisan and bicameral negotiations. I am incredibly proud of the work done by both majority and minority members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on H.R. 3387, the Drinking Water System Improvement Act, which was reported out of committee unanimously in July of 2017. Nearly all of that bill has been incorporated into S. 3021. I would like to highlight a number of the provisions that I am pleased were included in the final package. Since 2014, I have introduced legislation to reauthorize the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, the primary source of Federal funding for our water systems. Since its creation, the program has never been reauthorized, and funding has been flat, despite the growing needs in our communities. S. 3021 would increase the authorization from $1 billion annually until it reaches a $1.95 billion level in fiscal year 2021. In addition to providing significantly increased funding through the SRF, I want to mention a number of other provisions. 
First, WRDA makes numerous important changes to the SRF program, including extending the length of loans from 20 to 30 years, and up to 40 years for disadvantaged communities, while increasing the setaside for these communities by raising the maximum and, importantly, instituting a minimum amount of assistance. It provides $125 million annually to support State water offices through the Public Water Systems Supervision grant program. It seeks to improve the availability of compliance data submitted by water systems and States. It promotes better asset management practices, improves consumer confidence reports, and reauthorizes the Source Water Petition Program. It includes funding for EPA to review methods and technologies to prevent and detect leakage, contamination, and other problems. It requires Buy America standards for SRF projects through fiscal year 2023 and prevailing wage standards to ensure that American workers are benefiting from these investments. It provides funding for systems to conduct risk assessments of their resilience to extreme weather. It establishes a grant program to help schools and daycare centers replace water fountains containing lead components. Also related to lead, it requires future EPA needs assessments to include the cost of replacing lead service lines. I know a number of communities are dealing with emerging contaminants, such as PFOA and PFOS. Currently, only systems serving more than 10,000 people are required to test for unregulated contaminants. This bill requires water systems serving over 3,300 people to monitor for these contaminants, empowering local residents to take action to mitigate serious health threats that they may not have known existed otherwise. This would mean that thousands of communities, communities like Hoosick Falls, New York, and similarly sized systems would no longer have emerging contaminants go undetected, potentially threatening their residents for years. Finally, while not included in the committeepassed bill, WRDA authorizes $100 million for areas hit by natural disasters to repair their water systems, enabling postMaria Puerto Rico to access funds without the financial burden of State matching requirements. This is not an exhaustive list of provisions in this title, but it gives a sense of the breadth of policies that were included to improve the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill is not a clean water silver bullet, but it will put us on the path to end the decades of neglect of our water infrastructure and make the investments needed to maintain and upgrade our systems in order to protect public health. I want to thank my colleagues, Representative HARPER , Chair S HIMKUS , Chair WALDEN , and their staffs for working with our side of the aisle on this legislation. I want to acknowledge the contributions of our ranking member Representative FRANK PALLONE , Jackie Cohen, Jean Fruci, and Rick Kessler, and other members of the Energy and Commerce minority staff for their hard work. I always say that every life and every job in this country depends on access to safe drinking water. The needs are great and the cost of inaction is high. Today, Congress has the opportunity to act. I urge my colleagues to support America’s Water Infrastructure Act and for the Senate to take it up immediately. 
HONORING LOGAN S. PALMER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 minutes. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember Petty Officer Logan Palmer of Harristown, Illinois, who was tragically lost in the accident last August aboard USS John S. McCain. Logan knew early that he wanted to serve his country. After he graduated from Sangamon Valley High School and Richland Community College, he enlisted in the Navy as an interior communications electrician. Petty Officer Logan Palmer died serving and protecting our country, and for that, we remain eternally grateful. Today, the House will vote on a bill to designate Harristown’s post office in Logan’s hometown of Harristown, Illinois, a small rural community in Macon County, Illinois, as the Logan S. Palmer Post Office. Although I never had the honor of meeting Logan, I have since come to know his parents, Theresa and Sid, and I was honored they were able to join me when I introduced this bill earlier this year. While they sat in the gallery, I was able to drop that piece of paper in the box to introduce this bill to the floor of the House, and I am honored today to ask my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation to honor one of America’s heroes. Designating this post office will not only honor Logan’s service, but serve as a grave reminder of the risks that our servicemembers take on each day and the responsibilities we have to them as a country. It is my privilege to be able to honor Logan today, but, again, it is not why we are here. Many times this chamber will be criticized for naming post offices, naming public buildings, but, again, let us remember the sacrifices that many of those who those buildings are named after made for the freedoms and the liberties that many of us in this country take for granted every day. When Logan joined the Navy, no one in his hometown, let alone his family, thought that he would sacrifice so much for the freedom and liberty of our great country. It is my honor to honor Logan S. Palmer with this bill today, and his name will live forever on his local post office. f 
b1030 DEMOCRATIC VISION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, once again, the donothing Republican Congress has outdone itself. Here in America, we have a wage stagnation problem, an underemployment problem, an infrastructure problem, a retirement insecurity problem, and a corruption problem right here in Washington, D.C. What is the House Republicans’ response to these challenges facing the American people? They want to get out of town before sundown. Why don’t we remain here in Washington, doing the people’s business week after week, month after month until we get something done on these issues, improve the lives of working families, middleclass folks, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, and the afflicted? They want to get out of town before sundown. There are two very different visions for the American people. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. What has that brought to the American people? Chaos, crisis, confusion, the culture of corruption. Part two, the sequel, and the signature piece of legislation is the Republican tax scam, where 83 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent in this country simply to subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. That is their signature accomplishment? The Democratic vision is very different. Democrats here in the House are fighting for the people. We are fighting to lower healthcare costs, fighting to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, fighting to protect people with preexisting conditions, fighting to dramatically lower the high cost of prescription drugs, fighting to increase pay for everyday Americans so that folks can provide a comfortable living for themselves and for their families, fighting for a real infrastructure plan that invests $1 trillion in fixing our Nation’s crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels and will create 16 million good paying jobs. Democrats here in the House of Representatives are fighting to clean up corruption in Washington to make government work for everyday Americans. We are fighting to end, once and for all, the era of Citizens United. That is the House Democratic vision: lower healthcare costs, increased pay, 
and cleaning up corruption here in Washington. Democrats are fighting for the people. 
A TEXAS RELIGION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, it is that time of the year, a time folks in Texas and in the South have been waiting for. It is called football season. It has been said there are only two seasons in Texas: football season and spring football season. Football in Texas is its own religion. Whether you are watching the game under the Friday night lights, joining 25,000 of your closest friends on Saturday, or checking your watch in church to make sure your preacher gets you out on time on Sunday, there are more than a few prayers being said in the name of football on any given day in Texas. Just last week, I headed to Waco, Texas, with my entire family to watch my alma mater, the Abilene Christian Wildcats, take on the Baylor Bears. The outcome wasn’t what we were hoping for, but there is nothing better than college football under a Texas sunset. Texans naturally believe everything is bigger and better in Texas—because it is. My son, Kurt, started playing football when he was 8 years old, and I have watched him play every game from Humble, Texas, peewee football until he took the field wearing the purple and white of our alma mater, Abilene Christian University. From the beginning, Kurt played quarterback. Being the quarterback is one of those positions that is tough on parents. It is all the fame or all the blame. Every time I saw him take the field, I saw that same little 8yearold boy full of determination. It was that very determination that led to him being a walkon at Abilene Christian University and earning a spot as a safety and becoming an Academic AllConference player. I was a judge during that time in Texas in Houston, and I would head out on Friday night after court and drive all night to towns such as Abilene; Kingsville; Canyon; Wichita Falls; Commerce; Las Cruces, New Mexico; and Ada, Oklahoma, to get there in time for Saturday’s game. There is nothing more fun than being in a stadium on that first weekend and seeing your team and your son take the field to thousands chanting, ‘‘Wildcats, purple, white, purple, white, fight, fight, fight.’’ Last week I saw Kurt’s son, my grandson, Jackson, take the field, also as safety, for the Georgetown, Texas, middle school team. Texas football is a legend and legacy. It has spawned books, movies, TV series, and it has been known to ruin a family dinner or two in a house divided over the loyalty of their team. Blood may be thicker than water, but it is not thicker than football. Yes, Texans love football, right down to the names they choose for their children and to the cars they drive. I am sure there is some big executive in Detroit wondering why they have to send so many maroon pickups to Texas. Well, of course, they are for the Texas Aggie fans. We may not have too many fall weddings in Texas, but I am willing to bet you that you have been to a wedding where the new Mr. and Mrs. took off down the aisle to the University of Texas’ ‘‘The Eyes of Texas’’ or got a big Texas A&M ‘‘Whoop’’ after the preacher declared them husband and wife. But it is not just the action on the gridiron. It is the atmosphere; it is the band; it is the drill team; it is the cheerleaders; it is the moms selling T shirts, the school clubs hanging banners, the same old guys in the same old seats season after season in the stands, and the whole atmosphere of what makes the game great. So, Madam Speaker, it is that time of the year. Put on your school colors; head for the game; grab some hotdogs and Dr Pepper or Coke; and take part in one of Texas’ finest religious traditions: Texas football. And that is just the way it is. 
PUERTO RICO IS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, September 20 this next week is the 1 year anniversary of Hurricane Maria. One year later in Puerto Rico, in the neighboring island of Puerto Rico where there are U.S. citizens living because Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States, the schools are still closed. One year later and people are still waiting for home repairs. One year later and the death toll continues to rise. One year later and we are just now finding out that the death toll resulting from Hurricane Maria and its aftermath resulted in 2,975 deaths, a drastic, dramatic increase from the original reported numbers by the government of merely 64 people. Madam Speaker, the numbers have ballooned from 64 people who died during that terrible storm and the aftermath, to 2,975. We are just now finding out that close to 3,000 U.S. lives were lost while this administration did very little. Just this week, the President said that he has done an Aplus job. He seems to feel that there are only 64 deaths there, but that is not the case. In fact, there were 3,000 lives that perished there with slow response, and that is failure. That is an Fminus, to me, for government. But that is not all. Such is the indifference of this administration to the lives of Puerto Rico. And, Madam Speaker, we have a moral obligation to help the Puerto Rican people. They are American citizens. When we are in a time of war, when our Nation is in danger, we call upon them to defend us. Thousands and thousands of Puerto Ricans have given up their lives for democracy in the United States. We all remember the photograph of President George W. Bush on Air Force One hovering over New Orleans right after Katrina, and it was a watershed moment for our Nation that the photo became the poster child for neglect and the failed response of the government during a tragedy. Well, guess what. Puerto Rico has become our modernday Katrina. Undoubtedly, this administration’s mismanagement of Puerto Rico has become its most significant failure to date. FEMA provided roughly a third of the meals, half as much water, and just a small fraction of tarps to Puerto Rico than it provided to Texas after Hurricane Harvey in the first 9 days after the storm. Several weeks elapsed before FEMA and the Defense Department increased their presence on the island. And even though airports and ports had reopened after a few days, they still failed to bring the necessary help to that island. The agencies failed to direct the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other ships to Puerto Rico and provide first aid to the people who were hurting. We have now entered the 2018 hurricane season. As you know, we are bracing for Florence, Isaac, Helene, and Olivia to make landfall. This administration needs to do better in responding to these emergencies. It is heartbreaking and a serious tragedy for the American citizens of Puerto Rico, their families, and our Nation as a whole to have been treated this way. We cannot turn our backs on Puerto Rico, and we must continue to support our brothers and sisters along this journey to rebuild their lives during this humanitarian crisis. Mr. Speaker, the Puerto Rico crisis has become a humanitarian crisis that has proven far greater than we ever imagined. 
CELEBRATING CONSTITUTION DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in celebration of Constitution Day this upcoming week. On September 17, 231 years ago, 39 patriots signed their names to a document that changed the course of history. This document chartered a lasting experiment in democracy and put our Nation on the path to becoming 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Pastor Rosalinda Rivera, New Life Outreach Church, Richmond, Virginia, offered the following prayer: Dear God, we come before You this day with grateful hearts for this wonderful Nation we live in. For our Senators, our Congressmen and women, our President, for their families, bless them as they sacrificially lead us as a Nation. We lift up those today that are imprisoned by a lifestyle of addiction, trapped in the trenches of hopelessness. Your Word says that if we are in a pit, You will lift us up and put our feet on a rock. So we cry out on behalf of our husbands, our wives, our sisters, our brothers, for the young people of America that are trapped by the pit of opioid addiction and sex trafficking. You are the God of hope and healing. So, in Your name, I declare the chains of addiction are broken. I declare freedom in the hearts of every person fighting addiction. Through You, our God, we have the victory. Thank You for always being faithful. In the name of Jesus, Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. KENNEDY led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING PASTOR ROSALINDA RIVERA The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BRAT) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome Pastor Rosalinda Rivera, and her friends, of Chesterfield County, Virginia, to the House Chamber today. As an associate pastor at the New Life Outreach Church, the church her parents, Carmen and Victor Torres founded in 1972, she has helped reach those who are in search of a better way of life. In addition to her role in the church, she is involved in many other organizations to serve those in need. Whether it is helping young people overcome the challenges of addiction at New Life for Youth, helping young mothers restore relationships with their children at Mercy Mom’s House, or inspiring groups all over the U.S. with her writing and ministry, her service has been one spent devoted to the service of others. She has turned the lives of countless people around, giving them faith, hope, and purpose. Her work is a testament to the JudeoChristian tradition, which calls all people to love and care for others in the same way that God loves and cares for each of us. Thank you, Rosalinda, and God bless you. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize TriYoung, a woman owned business in Peoria, Arizona, on American Business Women’s Day on September 22. In August, I visited businesses across Arizona’s Eighth District to discuss how reduced Federal regulations, pro growth policies, and Republicanled tax reform have impacted business owners and employees. For Julie Young, president of TriYoung, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has produced a sizeable savings that she plans to reinvest back into her employees. 
TriYoung is a perfect example of how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is making a difference in the lives of business owners and hardworking Americans. I am honored to represent this woman owned business in Congress, and I will continue to support legislation that allows small businesses like TriYoung to thrive. Thank you, Julie, for sharing your story. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BELONG ON THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on our highest court in the land. Mr. MCCONNELL can withhold all the documents he wants. Mr. Kavanaugh’s words betray that silence. His emails show that he will dismantle Roe v. Wade. His rulings show that protections for preexisting conditions are no longer safe. His words show that marriage equality and LGBTQ rights would no longer be etched in stone. His silence shows that a President will be handed a shield against accountability. To those harmed by his rulings, he offers not even a handshake. When pressed, he offers just a lawyerly dodge and a shield of confidentiality. But the American people marched for a woman’s right to choose. They took to our streets to end gun violence. They fought for marriage equality. If you believe that healthcare is a right for all and not a privilege just for a few, then we need you to raise your voices today. Mr. Kavanaugh should not be on our court. 
TARLETON STATE RODEO TEAM (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I want to take a moment to recognize the Tarleton State University Rodeo Team located in Stephenville, Texas. Now, if you have never been to a Texas rodeo, I can promise you, it isn’t like anything you have ever seen before. There is nothing quite like it and, frankly, there is nothing more Texan. Day in and day out, the young men and women on the Tarleton State Rodeo Team are dedicated and give 100 percent, no matter what. In fact, this summer, because of their hard work, the men’s team finished second at the College National Finals Rodeo. However, this was not an isolated accomplishment. The Tarleton Rodeo Association has been part of a winning tradition since 1947. They have won seven national championship titles and 27 individual national championships. Mr. Speaker, because of all of this, the Tarleton State Rodeo Team is the best in Texas and one of the best in the Nation. I am proud to represent these champions in the 25th Congressional District, and I look forward to watching them continue to dominate the competition. In God we trust. f 
RECOGNIZING ARTS IN EDUCATION WEEK (Ms. PINGREE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Arts in Education Week. I believe strongly that arts in our schools, whether it is visual art, music, drama, creative writing, or dance, are as much of a component of a wellrounded education as STEM or humanity subjects. The measurable benefits of a robust arts education are clear. The U.S. Department of Education has found that students in arts programming had better attendance and fewer disciplinary issues. But anyone who has experienced arts education knows that its value goes well beyond what’s measurable. It builds confidence, teaching students how to express themselves in front of their peers and the larger community. It promotes diversity and inclusion, encouraging kids to engage with and learn from creative traditions that they may not be familiar with. And it can start important conversations, using fun and accessible mediums to get us thinking about hard topics. I thank the educators and students in Maine and across the country who commit to bringing the power of the arts into our schools and homes every day. 
RECOGNIZING THE TIRELESS WORK AND DEDICATION OF HARRIET V. CARTER (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the decades of service of my congressional community liaison and my friend, Harriet V. Carter. Harriet, a graduate of Tulane University, who participated in study abroad programs, served as a congressional aide for many years in my district office and, during her semiretirement, has been a goodwill ambassador to our community on my behalf. Harriet Carter is a graduate of Leadership Miami, the Cuban American National Council’s Hispanic Leadership Training Program, and has been active in the Greater Miami Jewish Federation, the Jewish Community Relations Council, and a bevy of groups that help Floridians. Harriet’s tireless work in my office and throughout our community demonstrates the positive impact that one person can have. Harriet Carter’s dedication to the service of others is an inspiration, and I am sure that she will continue to work diligently on behalf of our South Florida community for many years to come. f 
WASHINGTON’S RAMPANT CULTURE OF CORRUPTION (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, the recent indictments of two GOP House Members showcases this rampant culture of corruption symbolic of a government of, by, and for special interests and wealthy donors. Now, this week, Republicans are trying to rush through their tax scam 2.0, which explodes the deficit to give more money to wealthy donors and the richest Americans. Because of the first tax scam, some of the biggest corporations are now on track to spend $1 trillion on dividends and stock buybacks. Meanwhile, working class constituents struggle to keep a roof over their head, pay for healthcare, and put food on the table for their family. Democrats want real bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs, reduces the deficit, and is for the people, not just the ultrarich. We want to clean up the corruption and make Washington work for the people again. This means strengthening our ethics laws to fight special interests. This means fixing our broken campaign finance system to end the influence of bigmoney donors, and this means empowering voters to demand a responsive, accountable government, one that protects the right to vote, secures our election infrastructure, and ends partisan redistricting. 
HURRICANE FLORENCE PREPAREDNESS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as Hurricane Florence threatens to strike South Carolina, I am grateful to Governor Henry McMaster, Adjutant General Bob Livingston, Attorney General Alan Wilson, as well as Kim Stenson, Director of the Emergency Management Division, who have all done a fantastic job of preparing for the high winds and extraordinary flooding, while keeping the people of the State up to date with the encouragement of President Donald Trump. I appreciate that the Governor has been in close coordination with President Donald Trump and together they are working to ensure South Carolinians have all the resources for the courageous first responders to respond to Hurricane Florence, which endangers families. The projected phenomenal rainfall will cause unexpected flooding, so we 
should be ready for higher elevation with only emergency travel through next week, as roads will be deadly, as citizens should stay in place. FOX News is providing accurate coverage. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
17TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 2001 AUMF (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 17th year since Congress passed the 2001 AUMF, which has become a blank check for endless war. I would like to read part of the speech I delivered on September 14, 2001, because these words remain true and relevant today. I said: ‘‘Mr. Speaker, I rise really with a very heavy heart, one that is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones who were killed and injured this week. ‘‘September 11 changed the world. Our deepest fears now haunt us. Yet I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States. ‘‘This resolution will pass, although we all know that the President can wage a war, even without it. However difficult this vote may be, some of us must urge the use of restraint. Some of us must say, let us step back for a moment. Let us just pause for a minute and think through the implications of our actions today, so that this does not spiral out of control. ‘‘I have agonized over this vote, but I came to grips with it today. I came to grips with opposing this resolution during the very painful, yet very beautiful memorial service. As a member of the clergy so eloquently said, as we act, let us not become the evil that we deplore.’’ Now, 17 years later, I am asking my colleagues to join me in repealing this overlybroad resolution by cosponsoring H.R. 1229. 
b1215 HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN JACK EDWARDS (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of former Congressman Jack Edwards, who will celebrate his 90th birthday next Thursday. Congressman Edwards’ service to his beloved country started long before his 20 honorable years as a Representative for Alabama’s First District. As just a teenager, Jack left home and pursued something larger than himself and enlisted in the Marine Corps, where he later earned the rank of sergeant. Years later, Jack brought his military background to the Halls of Congress with the first wave of Alabama Republicans. Jack worked alongside five U.S. Presidents during his time in office to ensure that our national defense was funded at the necessary levels, which ultimately brought an end to the Cold War and led to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in 1989. But as a fiscal conservative, he never shied away from speaking his mind about ineffective programs that simply needed to go. Jack, you were a people’s champion in these Halls, a wonderful mentor for me, and I can only hope to be remembered as you are. But more importantly, I am honored by your friendship and your continued support. I look forward to celebrating your 90th birthday with you next week. f 
COLORADO FLOODS (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago this week, Colorado was struck by devastating floods. From Fort Collins, to Estes Park, to Lyons, to Boulder, dozens of communities were hit with unprecedented amounts of rain that gave way to rivers and tributaries overflowing, with huge amounts of damage, including the loss of eight lives. When the floods came 5 years ago, we committed to one another to be Colorado strong and to rebuild. I am proud to say that, in the years since the flood, I have been amazed by the resiliency of so many families. For my family, it meant a flooded basement and the loss of some of our treasured family photographs we stored there. For others, it upended their lives. Stu and Sarah Jane were new parents to their 9monthold daughter when the flood waters demolished their house in Fourmile Canyon. Shortly after receiving a reverse 911 call, the canyon gave way. The family escaped to a firehouse, and, after 2 days, a National Guard helicopter flew in, transporting them to safety. There are so many stories of so many Colorado families, and the smallest difference in circumstances would have meant that many families wouldn’t be alive today. In the last 5 years, communities have come together to repair roads, trails, homes, and businesses. This resiliency and grit that Coloradoans showed the week of September 9 through September 16, 2013, as rains fell, was matched only by the sense of community and tenacity that took hold as the waters subsided. HONORING MINNESOTA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor five incredible members of Minnesota’s law enforcement, each of whom is deservedly receiving the FBI Director’s Award for Excellence: Stearns County Deputy/Investigator Dennis Kern, former Captain Pam Jensen, retired Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Agent Ken McDonald, and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agents Shane Ball and Chris Boeckers. Twentynine years ago, on October 22, 11yearold Jacob Wetterling disappeared. Minnesota was left in shock and horror. Our State hoped and prayed for decades that Jacob would return home. Though unable to change the tragic outcome of Jacob’s life, Deputy Kern, Captain Jensen, Agent McDonald, Agent Ball, and Agent Boeckers were able to offer some peace and comfort by apprehending Jacob’s murderer. Mr. Speaker, words can’t adequately express the gratitude that the Wetterling family and all Minnesotans have for the law enforcement who never stopped searching for Jacob, who never gave up. To Deputy Kern, Captain Jensen, Agent McDonald, Agent Ball, and Agent Boeckers, on behalf of all Minnesotans, thank you and God bless you. 
NEED TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak about the need to protect Social Security. Last year, the Republicans passed an expensive tax scam that gave 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. This and the new tax scam 2.0 will add trillions to our deficit. Now they are trying to use this massive deficit that they created to justify cutting and dismantling Social Security, all while a retirement security crisis is looming to wreak havoc on those who are going to retire over the next decade. One in three Americans have less than $5,000—one in three have less than $5,000—saved. Fewer have pensions. For so many families who have worked hard, played by the rules, Social Security is all they will have. And Republicans, they want to take it away. Mr. Speaker, let’s build up Social Security, not dismantle it. 
RECOGNIZING DOUGLAS LAUX (Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Douglas Laux of Coldwater, Ohio. 
After attending Indiana University, Doug served for 7 years with the Central Intelligence Agency as an operations officer. Unknown to his family and friends, Doug operated undercover in Afghanistan and Syria, fighting America’s global war on terror. Working in Afghanistan, Doug quietly penetrated the ranks of alQaida and the Taliban, where he was able to infiltrate and eliminate one of the largest IED manufacturers in the world. Doug left the CIA in 2013 and now lives quietly in Coldwater, Ohio, his hometown. While Doug does not seek recognition for his past service, his actions struck a major blow to the enemies of our country, and they deserve commendation. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing the bravery of Mr. Laux and to wish him continued success as a private citizen. 
CONGRATULATING DR. LEANA WEN (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen is the new president of Planned Parenthood. Dr. Wen is an immigrant. Her family came here from China, and they were granted political asylum when she was a child. She is a Rhodes Scholar, and she grew up poor in my congressional district in Compton, California. She has worked to close the racial health disparities that are happening in healthcare and to reduce infant mortality. She has been a voice against cuts to healthcare. And she is a champion for health clinic funding across the country, to make sure they can continue to serve lowincome families. I am proud to say that she is a fighter, and I am proud to say that she grew up in Compton, California. With that, Dr. Wen, congratulations. I am looking forward to working with you and Planned Parenthood. 
HONORING RICHARD D EVOS (Mr. AMASH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, the west Michigan community is mourning the loss of Richard DeVos, a man whose spirit touched millions of lives and helped shape Grand Rapids into the thriving city it is today. Rich passed away on September 6 at the age of 92, survived by 4 children, 16 grandchildren, and 6 greatgrandchildren. Rich follows his late wife, Helen DeVos, who passed away at the age of 90 in October of last year. A World War II veteran, an entrepreneur who never feared failure, Rich was a largerthanlife presence whose Christian faith and love for America were evident in all that he did. I greatly admired Rich, as did countless others, not just from west Michigan, but from around the world, for his optimistic and caring approach to family, friends, business, and philanthropy alike. Anyone who knew Rich will tell you that he was an incredibly charismatic, encouraging, and kind person. I was fortunate enough to have a personal glimpse into this legend of a man who did so much for the west Michigan community while his work at home and abroad was changing the world. While no one can fill the void that Rich’s passing leaves, our community takes comfort in knowing that his legacy of generosity, entrepreneurship, and kindness will have a lasting impact. May the memory of him be eternal. f 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3798, SAVE AMERICAN WORKERS ACT OF 2017; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 5895, ENERGY AND WATER, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH, AND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019; AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM SEPTEMBER 17, 2018, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 24, 2018 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 1059 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), my dear friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3798, the Save American Workers Act of 2018, and H.R. 5895, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2019. Mr. Speaker, today is quite an unusual day, not only for our Nation, but also for Members of Congress. As a result of that, I have had a discussion with my dear friend, Judge HASTINGS , and we have decided we are going to try to expedite that which we do today, so all Members need to be advised we might finish the process of the rule on the floor some 55 minutes early. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3798, the Save American Workers Act of 2018 and H.R. 5895, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veteran Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. Since 2010, the American people have been dealing with the impacts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare. As we now know, Obamacare contains a number of provisions that have greatly impacted the labor market, the workforce, and employers of all sizes. At the broadest level, the bill created massive mandatory spending spending programs that have contributed greatly to the 
country’s debt and financial burdens on the American tax payer. At the center of this is the employer mandate. The employer mandate impacts hiring and employees’ hours because it requires employers with 50 or more fulltime employees to provide health insurance and carries a specific fine for noncompliance. Under this, employees who work 30 or more hours per week are considered fulltime. In addition, complex reporting requirements make the burden of this provision even greater for employers. The employer mandate requirement has resulted in employers reducing workers’ hours to 29 hours per week or less in an attempt to minimize the mandate’s devastating impacts. These reduced hours have caused millions of workers to receive less take home pay. The 30hour rule does little more than discourage employment and financial stability for American workers—especially low wage workers. According to a Hoover institution study, 2.6 million Americans making less than $30,000 were at risk of having their hours and wages cut as a result of Obamacare’s 30hour rule. H.R. 3798 would give employers and workers more flexibility by changing Obamacare’s definition of fulltime worker from 30 hours per week to 40 hours per week and from 120 hours per month to 174 hours per month for fulltime equivalents. In addition, the bill gives employers retroactive relief from the employer mandate penalty. Thus, any employer that owed a penalty for failing to provide coverage during that period would no longer owe it, a big help to some our small businesses. The bill also includes a provision that will delay the implementation of the Obamacare tax on highcost health plans, known as the ‘‘Cadillac tax,’’ until 2023, granting employers one additional year of relief from the tax. Finally, in light of the repeal of the individual mandate penalty, H.R. 3798 removes burdensome regulatory requirements on some providers of minimum essential coverage. Mr. Speaker, this rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 5895, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. This threebill Appropriations package provides funding for fiscal year 2019 in three very important categories. This bill is a product of members working across the aisle in a wonderful display of bipartisanship and I am pleased to see this body take up such an important measure. The agreement addresses one of our fundamental responsibilities here in Congress, taking care of our veterans. The bill provides $5.3 Billion above FY18 levels and ensures funding for VA medical care. It funds VA medical care at $72.3 Billion, providing for 7 million veteran patients to be treated in FY19. The bill strengthens veteran programs like mental health care services, opioid abuse prevention, suicide prevention, and rural veterans health initiatives. Additionally, the legislation continues to rebuild infrastructure for our service members and their families with $10.3 Billion for military construction projects, an increase of $241 Million. The second part of this appropriations package, energy and water, prioritizes our national security and invests in American infrastructure. The bill supports a strong nuclear national security strategy with a total $560 Million above FY 18 levels for the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons security programs. It also provides a muchneeded influx of funds into our nation’s water resources infrastructure by directing $7 Billion to the Army Corps of Engineers. Finally, the legislation directs a muchneeded increase of $29.8 Million for our extremely dedicated and brave Capitol Police Officers. This money will ensure their safety, the safety of our Capitol complex, and the thousands of guests who visit every day. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1230 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the distinguished chairman, my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am going to truncate my original remarks. Mr. Speaker, today’s legislation is yet another callous attempt by my friends on the other side to undermine healthcare for millions of Americans, all while recklessly adding billions of dollars to the deficit. This legislation not only guts vital provisions of the Affordable Care Act, but also weakens the requirements on employerprovided healthcare. I might add, even though we may not be bringing it up, we do support the conference report and will be willing to go forward in that regard. The time has come for our friends across the aisle to abandon their tired playbook, a playbook full of tactics and strategies bent on sabotaging and undermining healthcare, rather than plans to make our healthcare system stronger and more inclusive. Mr. Speaker, we are also here today, as I just said, on the conference report, for a threebill spending package, funding a portion of our government, which runs out of funds at the end of this month. This funding package isn’t perfect, and while I would have preferred we consider appropriations bills one at a time through regular order, as the Speaker promised, this effort represents how this House should operate when we consider legislation. We hold hearings, markups, go to conference, negotiate in good faith, and finally, emerge with a bipartisan compromise. Good process makes for good policy. While this bill may not be one Democrats would have written, I am glad this conference report rejects House Republicans’ and President Trump’s extreme budget cuts and harmful antienvironmental riders. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to say this: We have learned that, as Hurricane Florence closes in on millions of Americans, the administration has raided the coffers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to move money to ICE. I am not going to spend a lot of time on that. I think it is just wrong. Mr. Speaker, this Republicanled Congress sets yet another record with today’s 97th closed rule. Week after week, my friends across the aisle continue to make history for all the wrong reasons, but we should not let this latest milestone go unrecognized because it is yet another sad point in this Chamber’s history. In this historically closedoff Congress, Republican leaders have used restrictive rules to block measures to create jobs, bring down the cost of prescription drugs, and make education more affordable for our children. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary thirty minutes for debate, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the Rule for H.R. 3798, the Save American Workers Act and the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 5895. Mr. Speaker, last year Republicans took one on the chin when their Affordable Care Act repeal bill—a bill they spent all of 17 days working on—went down in flames in a most public and spectacular fashion. They learned that conspicuously snatching health insurance from millions of people would probably cost them some votes. So, instead of continuing with their more open, though admittedly failed tactics, my friends across the aisle are pursuing an altogether shiftier strategy today. That strategy, with its aim of ridding the American people of their healthcare coverage, can be summed up in one word: sabotage. Today’s legislation is yet another callous attempt by Republicans to undermine healthcare for millions of Americans, all while recklessly adding billions of dollars to the deficit. This legislation not only guts vital provisions of the Affordable Care Act, but also weakens requirements on employer provided healthcare. Now is the time for us to face facts and accept truths. Fact, the latest Kaiser Health Tracking poll found that 50 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act. Fact, 75 percent of Americans want to keep the Affordable Care Act’s provisions that prevent health plans from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. Fact, 72 percent of Americans want to retain the provision of the ACA that prevents insurers from charging sick people more. The time has come for my friends across the aisle to abandon their tired playbook—a playbook full of tactics and strategies bent on sabotaging and undermining healthcare rather than plans to make our healthcare system stronger and more inclusive. Mr. Speaker, we are also here today to consider H.R. 5895, a conference report for a threebill spending package—funding a portion of our government—which runs out of funding at the end of this month. This funding package isn’t perfect, and while I would have preferred we consider appropriations bills one at a time through regular order as the Speaker promised, this effort represents how this House should operate when we consider legislation: we hold hearings, markups, go to conference, negotiate in good faith, and finally emerge with a bipartisan compromise. Good process makes for good policy, and while this bill may not be one Democrats 
would have written, I’m glad this conference report rejects House Republicans’ and President Trump’s extreme budget cuts and harmful antienvironmental riders. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to say this, we have learned that as Hurricane Florence closes in on millions of Americans, the Trump Administration has raided the coffers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to move money to ICE for the continued immoral detention of children. The ability of this Administration to reach new lows is astounding. To my fellow Americans who are in Hurricane Florence’s path, our thoughts and prayers are with you. As a Floridian, I know all too well the effects these devastating storms can have and I urge everyone to take all necessary steps to be prepared, be safe, and listen to the direction of local authorities as this storm impacts the Southeast. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this Republican led Congress sets yet another record with today’s 97th Closed Rule. Week after week, my friends across the aisle continue to make history for all the wrong reasons. But we should not let this latest milestone go unrecognized, because it is yet another sad point in this Chamber’s history. In this historically closedoff Congress, Republican leaders have used restrictive rules to block measures to create jobs, bring down the cost of prescription drugs, and make education more affordable. These policies deserve consideration on the House Floor, yet they are continuously blocked by the Republican Majority. This discouraging record not only suppresses the voices of Democratic and Republican Members, it also suppresses the voices of millions of Americans. Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends may claim today’s threebill spending package gets the ball rolling to fully fund the government. But we need to put into context what it means to fully fund the government, it means that we must pass 12 appropriations bills in order to fully fund our government. So, before they take a victory lap over today’s spending package, I will simply remind the Majority that with precious few legislative days remaining, we still must pass the remaining seventyfive percent of bills that will fund our government. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the distinguished gentleman, his work with me is appreciated. On behalf of not only Judge HASTINGS and myself, really, the Rules Committee, which both of us represent, with great anxiety, we recognize, as our Members do, about the storm that is headed to the United States of America. We want to wish all the people who are in the storm’s way the very best, but we are attempting to do what we can to make sure we complete our work properly. Thus, I ask for my colleagues to vote for this conference report, which will do so much to move us not only to the point where we can continue to work together, but to fund the important activities that need to take place. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues support this bill and the underlying bills. Mr. Speaker, this is a good rule and so are the two underlying bills. it has become abundantly clear that Obamacare has failed the American people. Our nation’s healthcare system is broken and only getting worse. The American people are counting on us to empower individuals, families, and employers to spend their health care dollars the way they want. They are counting on us to remove the federal government from their health care and the first bill is another step in the right direction. The second bill is a wonderful example to bipartisanship—the package isn’t perfect, but it is a good bill. It takes care of our veterans and our military, it provides muchneeded funding for our infrastructure and our waterways, and it ensures we are providing the Capitol Police officers the funding they need. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bills. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on adoption of the resolution will be followed by a 5minute vote on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 1911.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER ) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3021, the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. This bill is good for our infrastructure, good for jobs, and good for America. It is a bipartisan, bicameral comprehensive bill that delivers on a promise to regularly address water resources and infrastructure issues across the Nation. Title I of this act is the Water Resources Development Act of 2018, or WRDA. I want to remind my colleagues that we overwhelmingly passed WRDA in June by a vote of 408–2. WRDA invests in the ports, locks, and dams, inland waterways, flood protection, and other infrastructure that makes America more competitive and protects our communities. It also builds upon reforms to the Army Corps of Engineers to help improve project delivery. This bill is fiscally responsible and fully offset. It cuts red tape, and it maintains congressional authority and oversight of Federal investment. I want to thank Ranking Member DEFAZIO for working together on the WRDA title. However, today’s bill includes more than just WRDA, and I also want to thank the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Natural Resources Committee, and our Senate counterparts for helping put this package together. I am proud to say today’s legislation continues a 2year cycle of regular order for Congress considering these essential WRDA bills. This has been one of my top priorities since I became chairman over 6 years ago. b1315 We need to pass this bill, continue providing direction to the Corps, and ensure all of these infrastructure improvements move forward. This is simply good public policy, and it is good for our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this jobs and infrastructure bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Section 4302 directs the BOR, working with the Corps to create a flood action plan. The Managers recognize that 2017 was a record year for runoff in the Upper Snake River Basin, causing communities in the region to experience significant flooding. The Managers further recognize that landowners and stakeholders have serious concerns for how the BOR and the Corps have managed the spring runoff out of Jackson Lake and down the Snake River. The Managers seek assurances that the BOR will work with the Corps to protect communities to minimize flooding in the region. Section 4304 establishes a new workforce training program for workforce development in the water utility sector. The managers find that water and wastewater utilities provide a unique opportunity for access to stable, highquality careers. This section also establishes a competitive grant program to promote the development of innovative activities relating to workforce development in the water utility sector. Section 4306 authorizes EPA’s WaterSense program, a voluntary program which identifies and promotes water efficient products through voluntary labeling, is authorized by this legislation. The bill requires EPA to review and revise the program’s performance criteria to achieve additional water savings not more frequently than every 6 years. The Managers expect EPA to conduct these reviews as required by the section and to review the requirements of the program and update them as needed and appropriate. Section 4312 recognizes the rehabilitation and restoration of Indian irrigation systems owned and operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is essential to the success and livelihood of individuals and businesses across 17 reservations. Congress outlined these objectives in Public Law 114–322 and established the Indian Irrigation Fund for the BIA to carry out its trust responsibility for certain individual Indians and Tribes. This provision authorizes seven years of additional funding to complete this necessary rehabilitation, which will ensure the delivery of clean water, reduce the loss of water through seepage, and improve the safety of the systems. The Managers believe the Administration should prioritize the Indian Irrigation Fund in addressing restoration of these Indian irrigation systems. The Managers strongly encourage the Administration to fulfill the objectives outlined in Public Law 114–322. 
Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to thank the chairman for getting the Water Resources Development bills back on track. We had gone many years without an authorization, and the chairman made it a priority to do this every 2 years. We also have created a new process through which we provide some direction to the Corps of Engineers on where to invest their scarce resources. If I had my way, or maybe if we have different leadership in the next Congress, we would go back to a much simpler, explicit process where we would designate highpriority local infrastructure investment as needed in the certain areas around the United States of America to better facilitate commerce. But that is for another day. This is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill. There is, however, one problem. That problem is that Ronald Reagan worked with a Democratic Congress to create a harbor maintenance trust fund funded by a miniscule ad valorem tax on the value of goods that come in from overseas and pass through our ports. Consistently, Congress has underspent those funds under both Democratic and Republican leadership. Many years ago, I started to work with the chairman’s father on this very issue. That is more than two decades ago now. We did make substantial progress in the last Congress and in this Congress. An amendment that I offered to the water resources bill put us on a track toward spending all of the tax that is collected for harbor maintenance on harbor maintenance. Now, I know that is kind of shocking in this town, that you would collect a tax from people and then spend it on the thing for which it is dedicated, but I think that would be right. My proposal was adopted unanimously in the committee twice. Then Speaker RYAN, through his control of the Rules Committee, reached into the bill and extracted that amendment. Why would they do that when we, on an average daily basis, have less than 40 percent of the authorized capacity at our 59 largest harbors? Why would we cripple United States commerce and shipping interests? Why would we do that? Well, so they can pretend that the deficit is a little tiny bit less. When it comes to taxes, a trillion dollars here, a trillion dollars there, we don’t care about deficits. But when it comes to spending the harbor maintenance tax on harbor maintenance, we can skim off a few hundred million dollars every year and put it over here in an imaginary trust fund that we never spend. So it is a bunch of BS that we are doing that. You should not be collecting taxes from the American people and then not spending money on the intended and needed purpose. The Corps’ estimate is that they need about $20 million to bring all harbors up to authorized depths in the next 10 years. If we were spending the full harbor maintenance trust fund income on an annual basis and spending down the balance that has already accumulated, we could exceed that goal and deal with other issues, such as jetty problems and the like. The White House has come up with a brilliant and different solution. They want to reduce the harbor maintenance tax so we will never, ever bring up our ports to authorized depths. In any case, that is the major problem with this bill. The chairman has already mentioned a number of the attributes of this bill. There is a provision that potentially will make the Corps more efficient on dredging projects and look at multiyear as opposed to annual contracts. The Corps is getting some tools to respond to climate change—I can’t believe we got that in there—sea level rise, and natural disasters. It requires the Corps to be more transparent in how it chooses projects. As I mentioned earlier, I think Congress should be a little more direct there. Again, that is for another day. It has provisions that are important to my district and my State, which are fully justified. Mr. Speaker, again, it is a good, bipartisan project, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say the ranking member is 100 percent correct on his assessment of the harbor maintenance trust fund. I support it. He is absolutely right. I just want to make sure, when he is referring to BS, he is not referring to BILL SHUSTER . Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his help on this legislation. I, too, agree in terms of the harbor maintenance trust fund. I rise in support of America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. This legislation includes really important language to assist irrigators in the Klamath Basin who are enduring another challenging drought year, and it helps ensure we are prepared if our farmers are hit again with severe drought conditions in the years ahead. This bill provides the Bureau of Reclamation with the authority to use the funds we secured earlier this year, about $10 million, to implement measures such as groundwater pumping and other priorities for our irrigators, and ensures that they have the authority to survive difficult water years we may face over the next 4 years. I also want to express, as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, our support for a couple other titles in this bill. Title II of the legislation modernizes the Safe Drinking Water Act to address regulatory compliance and infrastructure challenges facing communities across our country. It brings greater investment to improve our aging drinking water systems and supports Stateled efforts in large cities and rural communities alike. For the first time in 22 years, Mr. Speaker, it authorizes capitalization grants for State drinking water revolving loan funds—$4.4 billion over 3 years, to be exact. This is a big infrastructure bill. These loans are a crucial tool to help communities address compliance issues and address drinking water threats. I urge EPA to help each State realize the promise of this new authorization. As we brace for the horrible impacts of Hurricane Florence, I want to point out that title II also authorizes $100 million for areas affected by natural disasters that need help repairing their drinking water systems to deliver clean, safe drinking water. Our prayers are with those in the storm’s path, Mr. Speaker. While this legislation won’t make them whole, it will help them recover. 
Title III of the legislation will make substantial regulatory improvements to the hydropower licensing process, with the goal to deliver more clean, renewable, carbonfree, and affordable energy to consumers. This title incorporates several important bills that passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I am proud to support their inclusion in this legislation before us today. With that, I urge strong bipartisan support of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act. I thank the gentlemen on both sides of the aisle and everyone involved for their work in getting this to the House floor, and I urge its passage. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3021, America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. I thank Chairman SHUSTER , Ranking Member DEFAZIO, Chairman G RAVES , and our own respective staffs for their work on this legislation. It is encouraging to see the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee continue in a bipartisan fashion on this legislation every 2 years. The bill authorizes Army Corps of Engineers’ feasibility studies; chief’s reports; and section 7001 water resource projects across the country for a diverse array of purposes, including flood damage reduction, ecosystem restoration, water supply, navigation, and other things. The bill also includes important provisions that both the House and the Senate have worked on to improve EPA water programs. I am pleased to have coauthored several provisions that will assist communities experiencing stormwater challenges and drought with additional water supply and water treatment options. Section 4106 authorizes $450 million in grants to cities over the next 2 years to plan, design, and construct stormwater, water recycling, and sewer overflow projects. This is incredibly important in my area in Los Angeles, which is addressing a new MS4 stormwater permit and is implementing water recycling projects as a way to address longterm drought and climate change. Section 1164 requires the Corps to work with local governments on integrated water resources planning to incorporate locally developed plans for stormwater management, water quality improvement, and water recycling in Corps projects. Section 1146 makes permanent my provision from WRDA 16 that allows public agencies or private companies to remove sediment from Army Corps dams in order for the dams to be more efficient for water supply and flood control operations. There was a particular problem of sediment buildup in several of our dams, including the Santa Fe and San Gabriel Dams in my region. Section 4304 creates an EPA water infrastructure and workforce investment program, which will provide grants to educational institutions, workforce development organizations, and water agencies to provide training in the water sector. The water agencies in my district have been strongly supportive of creating this program, because many employees in the water sector are retiring and workforce training is needed for new water technologies. Section 4306 formally authorizes and improves the EPA WaterSense program, which creates a national standard for the labeling of waterefficient products. Local, State, and Federal agencies can then give rebates to individuals and businesses that purchase these WaterSenseapproved products, in order to decrease overall water consumption demands. Section 1222 requires the Corps to assess forecastinformed operations in water control manuals to ensure that dams are being used effectively to maximize local water supply. Some of them are more than 40 years old. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30 seconds. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I am confident that this bill, if enacted, will provide droughtprone regions like mine with the tools necessary to increase water supply through water recycling and capturing and treating stormwater. I want to thank my constituent water agencies for their input throughout this process, including the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District; the Three Valleys Municipal Water District; the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District; the San Gabriel Valley WaterMaster; the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works; and my local Corps leadership in General Helmlinger, Colonel Gibbs, and David Van Dorpe. Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we have Hurricane Florence bearing down on our Nation now. The Carolinas and Georgia are inevitably going to have disaster, destruction, and damages. What happens in the aftermath, as folks begin looking at it, they ask the question: What could we have done differently? This bill, together with other legislation, is exactly what needs to be done. This begins the process of addressing this ridiculous backlog of $100 billion in projects that we need to move forward on, that we need to construct, and bringing efficiencies to the table, like allowing for States and local governments to advance these projects on their own, taking advantage of their capabilities of greater cost efficiencies, of streamlined permitting processes, and other efficiencies that they are capable of doing. This bill brings all sorts of solutions to the table, including, Mr. Speaker, looking at whether the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should even be within the Department of Defense. When I call Secretary Mattis and talk to him about Russia, China, North Korea, Syria, and Iran, should I introduce a wetlands permit in that conversation? I don’t think I should. It is not compatible with the agency. So we are looking at where this mission can be a top priority, can be properly housed, and where we can accomplish these projects much faster than we are doing today. Mr. Speaker, this bill also has some important things for us back home, including recognizing the hundreds of millions of dollars in work that our State has done to restore our eroding coastline and the ecological productivity that goes along with it; looking at carrying out a pilot dredge program, whereby we can issue dredging contracts over years over multiple channels, rather than doing one channel at a time, where we can benefit from economies of scale and, again, greater efficiency with taxpayer dollars; and, importantly, Mr. Speaker, ensuring that the old river control structure is not managed by a static 70–30 split that was determined decades ago, using updated science so we benefit navigation, the environment, and other important priorities. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER , Congressman DEFAZIO, Congresswoman NAPOLITANO , Congressman S ANFORD , Congressman ROUZER , and all those involved for their hard work on this. I urge its adoption. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ). Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. DEFAZIO, Mrs. N APOLI TANO , and all the leadership on both the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for putting this bill together. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk about the Energy and Commerce jurisdiction, which is initially the Safe Drinking Water Act. Our Nation’s public drinking water system serves more than 300 million people, but aging and failing infrastructure threatens access to safe drinking water in communities large and small. b1330 The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that our water systems will require $472 billion in infrastructure repairs over the next 20 years, but 
investment simply has not kept pace with the need. This bill reauthorizes the Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Fund for the first time in 20 years and provides significant new funding to State and local governments in dire need. The bill nearly doubles the authorized funding from $1 billion to almost $2 billion in 2021 and increases funding for public water system supervision grants to States. Important provisions in the bill ensure that this money gets to the communities that need it most by raising the cap on special assistance to disadvantaged communities under the State Revolving Fund and setting a floor for such assistance to guarantee help for those communities. I want to thank Representative TONKO , the ranking member of our House Energy Subcommittee on Environment, who led the effort to reauthorize and improve the State Revolving Fund for many years. Many of the provisions in this bill were incorporated from AQUA Act, which he authored. The bill also contains a provision first introduced by myself and Representative RUSH establishing a grant program for replacing leaded drinking water fountains in schools and requiring, for the first time, a national inventory of lead service lines and the cost to replace them. The bill contains Representative DINGELL ’s provision to make drinking water quality reports to consumers more frequent, comprehensive, and understandable. Significantly, the bill incorporates Representative PETERS ’ provision to assist systems with resiliency to extreme weather, and it establishes new requirements to assess and address vulnerabilities to those threats. It also provides $100 million for grants to extend access to safe drinking water into areas impacted by natural disasters, responding to concerns raised by Representative GREEN . Additionally, the bill contains language championed by Representative MCNERNEY authorizing a water sense program to encourage consumer product water efficiency, and it authorizes Buy America requirements for iron and steel products for 5 years. Mr. Speaker, this bill won’t solve all our drinking water challenges, but it makes important improvements and delivers real benefits. I am also pleased that this final bipartisan bill includes important energy provisions that I pushed, to include among them provisions authored by Representatives KENNEDY , D EGETTE , and PETERS . All in all, the drinking water and energy titles of this bill are critical, significant steps forward that will benefit America’s families, industry, and the environment. Mr. Speaker, America’s Water Infrastructure Act is a victory for all of us, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES ). Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of America’s Water Infrastructure Act, which includes the Housepassed WRDA. The chairman’s commitment to passing bipartisan WRDA bills every 2 years has been an impactful item at better managing the bureaucracy at the Army Corps and more regularly approving vital water projects. This is good government and a policy that I would like to see the committee remain committed to in the future. In my district, Mr. Speaker, this bill is extremely important to the agriculture economy and to everyone who relies on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. I am glad the final bill included my amendment to stop the Army Corps from building any new, unproven structures for endangered species along the Missouri, and, instead, they now are required to prove that it will actually work before spending millions of taxpayer dollars. The Corps has to prove that these structures do not negatively impact the other management priorities on the Missouri River. In closing, this is a good bill, and it is necessary to advance the important flood control projects and ensure our inland waterways remain reliable and efficient options for transporting goods. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for S. 3021. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ). Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3021, America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. Every Member in this House should be able to support it. It is how Congress should work, and it is what the American people expect. Overall, the bill would authorize $6.1 billion in Federal funds for the Army Corps of Engineers to carry out new and existing projects critical to our Nation’s economy, environment, public health, and safety, including the Great Lakes region. This legislation also includes the Drinking Water Systems Improvement Act, which the Energy and Commerce Committee approved last year, in bipartisan fashion. These provisions will improve drinking water systems and authorize $4.4 billion for the State Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund Program, which will provide much needed Federal financing for States and utilities to strengthen drinking water infrastructure. Everybody remembers Flint. Now we have PFAS. It is important that every American be able to trust the water they are drinking. This is why I am proud that this bill includes important provisions from legislation I introduced that would increase drinking water notifications and make consumer confidence reports on drinking water easier for every American to understand. It is an essential part of our response to drinking water crises in this country. We have a crisis of confidence in our systems, and consumers deserve clear and immediate notifications and transparency when it comes to the quality of the water they are drinking. By requiring large water systems to provide consumer confidence reports biannually, the American people will have more frequent reports on water quality, which will help identify and mitigate risks sooner. With 90 percent of Americans receiving their drinking water from a public drinking water system, it is our collective responsibility to provide strong funding authorizations for modernizing drinking water systems, and we must continue to find effective ways to keep the public informed. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ). Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of America’s Water Infrastructure Act. This bill revitalizes our waterways, bolsters flood protection, and ensures our channels and harbors can supply America and the world with U.S. goods. Most importantly, this bill includes my New WATER Act, a provision that will help us to build new water storage in California. The last time we built anything of substance in California for water storage was 1979. We have waited 50 years— 50 years—because we don’t have Federal financing and Federal authorization. Finally, under this bill, the New WATER Act will set up a bank for financing for these water storage projects, and we can finally get some of these big reservoirs under way: Shasta, raising Shasta; building Sites Reservoir, which has been studied for decades; building Los Vaqueros; building Temperance Flat. It is time to build water storage in California. We need to be solving our own problems, and the New WATER Act helps us with that financing. Belowground water storage projects, water recycling, and desalination projects are also eligible. We want to look at all water in California, but this allows us a Federal financing plan to match State and local dollars as well. Also, I included the lower San Joaquin County Army Corps chief’s report in this bill to enhance flood protection for more than 50,000 valley residents in San Joaquin County. This will reduce annual property damage and enhance security at 262 critical infrastructure sites, including French Camp. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an additional 15 seconds. Mr. DENHAM. French Camp will be the Army Corps’ first VA project, building a megaclinic for our veterans 
in our local community right in this area in between Lathrop and Manteca. We look at revitalizing America’s infrastructure. This is a monumental step forward in America’s water infrastructure, and I ask my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ). (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill before us, S. 3021; and specifically, Mr. Speaker, the Fair Ratepayer Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards Act written into title III, culminating more than 4 years of work on this issue. In 2014, due to an unintended loophole in the Federal Power Act, my constituents were locked out of challenging a nearly $2 billion rate increase, because at the time the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was deadlocked 2 to 2 on whether to approve or deny the change. With this bill before us today, we can close that loophole and ensure that no ratepayer suffers the same consequence that continues to threaten the bank accounts and pocketbooks of my constituents. It is especially important today given that the commission currently has only four sitting commissioners. While this is not the bill that I first introduced more than 3 years ago and it is not the one that the House unanimously passed each of the last two Congresses, it is a compromise with our Senate colleagues and is an important step in the right direction. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill before us, H.R. S. 2031. Specifically I rise in support of the Fair Ratepayer Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards Act, written into Title III, culminating more than four years of work on this issue. As my colleagues have heard time and time again, my constituents in New England pay among the highest retail electric rates across the country. And in 2014, due to an unintended loophole in the Federal Power Act, my constituents were locked out of challenging a nearly $2 billion rate increase because at the time, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was deadlocked twototwo on whether to approve or deny the change. As written, the Federal Power Act allows for rate changes to take effect by operation of law if FERC fails to act within the statutory 60day time period. Due to a deadlock in 2014, no action was taken. And as we have since learned, the Federal Power Act only allows for appeals of official FERC Actions, not rates that take effect by operation of law, including deadlocks like the one that left my constituents voiceless. With this bill before us today, we can ensure no ratepayer suffers the same consequence. It is especially important now given the current status of the Commission with only 4 sitting commissioners. This bill represents a compromise with my Senate colleagues. The bill states that any rates that take effect by operation of law, due to a deadlock or a Commission that lacks sufficient members for a quorum, are appealable both at FERC and in the courts. It is intended to ensure that FERC and the courts consider the merits of a rate change and whether such a change is just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act. It would not allow FERC or the courts to simply dismiss a challenge because FERC failed to issue an order. Additionally, I would like to highlight two concerns with this language and make clear congressional intent in the process. First, this bill would not apply to rates that the Commission either chooses, or inadvertently allows, to take effect upon expiration of the statutory clock. It has been my understanding and my experience that FERC can and will continue to address all rate filings with the due diligence and scrutiny each deserves, and I hope FERC will continue to do so even on the most contentious of cases. I expect FERC will abide by the requirements of this legislation and not take advantage of any loophole to avoid a contentious filing. Second, while unusual, this bill would require each of the sitting commissioners to explain in writing their view on the rate change. To my knowledge, there is no other similar requirement in any part of the Federal Power Act or Natural Gas Act. However, it is my belief that if and when the time comes to address a deadlock, commissioners will use the opportunity to explain their views for purposes of transparency and good government. While this is not the bill I first introduced more than three years ago, the one that passed the House unanimously in each of the last two Congresses, it is a good compromise and a significant step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ), a hardworking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and a member of the Rules Committee. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on the committee. Mr. Speaker, this is probably the most important bill that most members of the United States of America citizenry will never have heard of. When I go back home, folks ask me to make smart and prudent investments that will make a difference in people’s lives. They ask me to repeal unnecessary regulations that stand in the way of making those improvements. They ask me to pay for those things rather than passing the bill on to our kids and our grandkids. The bill that the chairman and the ranking member have brought before us today fulfills every single one of those challenges. In my district, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about preserving water quality in Lake Lanier, the sole water source for most of the metro Atlanta area. We are talking about funding the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, a project of economic significance for the entire southeastern United States. We are talking about offering local officials the financing tools they need to bring projects to bear faster and cheaper than ever before. Mr. Speaker, median household income has never been higher. Small business optimism has never been higher. Unemployment is at its lowest point in decades. Job openings are at a record high. Manufacturing jobs are at a record high. This does not happen by accident. This happens when you create an environment in which success can breed. I want to thank the ranking member from Oregon. I particularly want to thank my chairman from Pennsylvania. Chairman SHUSTER said he was going to bring three bills to the floor. He said we are going to get back in the business of doing the people’s business, not sometimes but always; and here, at the end of his third term as chairman, we are bringing our third WRDA bill to the floor. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ), my good friend and another hardworking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act, a critical piece of legislation that authorizes water infrastructure projects across our Nation. One particular project is near and dear to my heart, critical to the State of Michigan and our national economy and security: the Soo Locks. This lock is the only waterway, the only connection between Lake Superior and the rest of the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Right now, that one lock accommodates almost all of the shipping of iron ore and many other goods from Minnesota through the Great Lakes. If that lock fails, the damage is instantaneous: economic damage—11 million people would lose their jobs within the first 90 days—and risks our national security. That is why construction of a second lock is so vital. This upgrade was authorized over 30 years ago. I guess it shouldn’t surprise us that it has languished a bit. We now have bipartisan support, both sides of the aisle supporting the need to get this lock, a second large lock, built. We have recognition by the administration that this lock is critical for our economy and our national security. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill as the next step in building the 1,200foot lock at the Soo Locks so we can ensure that our national security and our economy is not devastated by the failure of one lock. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time if the gentleman has more speakers. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I have three more speakers. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ). 
b1345 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, safe drinking water for our families is something that we all should agree on, and this bill delivers on that promise. It makes certain that communities like Parchment, in my district, are able to deal with the PFAS contamination issue. In Parchment, thanks to the proactive efforts of the State of Michigan, we discovered PFAS in the water, and we immediately sprang into action to solve the problem in the short term—local, State, and Federal folks all working in tandem to fix the problem. Specifically, the bill does that by increasing authorization for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. It critically works to modernize our aging water infrastructure by providing more resources. Drinking water quality remains high across the country, but improvements can and must be made now. This bipartisan bill is yet a very important step forward. I look forward to supporting it and would urge all of my colleagues on both sides to do the same. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER  for getting this bill to the floor, and I look forward to ultimately getting it to the President for his signature. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ), our conference chair. Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership and yielding the time. Today, I am proud to stand in support of the Water Resources Development Act. I appreciate all the work that has been done to help strengthen our Nation’s ports, dams, and waterways. In this legislation, we are keeping our promise to the American people to rebuild our Nation’s infrastructure. I was proud to offer two significant provisions to help the people of eastern Washington. The first is the Port of Whitman Economic Expansion Act. This will allow the Port of Whitman to purchase land from the Army Corps of Engineers to continue their mission of economic development in our region. The other provision is from bipartisan legislation that passed this House earlier titled the Hydropower Modernization Act of 2017. In Washington State, hydropower makes up nearly 70 percent of our electricity, and it is the Nation’s largest source of clean, renewable, reliable, and affordable energy. We have some of the lowest electricity costs in the country because of clean hydropower, but there is still room for tremendous potential to increase the production of renewable energy as hydropower, but FERC doesn’t incentivize investing in dams. Capital intensive projects like updating turbines or improving fish ladders are only included in the lifespan of a dam’s license during the relicensing window. My provision will require FERC to include all protection, mitigation, and enhancement measures during the relicensing process. I appreciate Chairman SHUSTER and Chairman WALDEN and the staff for all of their work. Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON ). Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, unnecessary government red tape is preventing us from taking advantage of clean, renewable hydropower generation at existing nonpowered dams. The current regulatory process simply takes too long, taking up to a decade for the project to be approved. We can change this by supporting America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which includes the Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act, which I authored. This legislation instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to create an expedited permitting process that will result in a final decision on an application in 2 years or less. The legislation also requires FERC, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of the Interior to develop a list of existing nonpowered dams that have the greatest potential for hydropower development. Streamlining the permitting process will incentivize investments in clean hydropower development and help modernize our existing infrastructure. I ask my colleagues to join me today in supporting this legislation. Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, I want to particularly congratulate the chairman on his accomplishment of resuscitating regular WRDA reauthorizations, and this, of course, will be the last time in which he will be on the floor on this particular issue. I would also like to thank the staff, Ryan Seiger, Mike Brain; from Representative NAPOLITANO ’s office, Joe Sheehy; and a special thanks to legislative counsel, whose staff tells me was absolutely fabulous on this, Kakuti Lin. And then, of course, I believe the chairman will thank his staff, but I would also extend thanks to them but not name them individually if he is going to do that. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I thank my partner in this, Ranking Member DEFAZIO, for his efforts on the bill, but also Ranking Member NAPOLITANO and Subcommittee Chair GARRET GRAVES for their great work on this bill. I thank the entire Republican staff on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The following staff spent hours working on behalf of the Members of Congress to produce this final product: Ian Bennitt, Elizabeth Fox, John Pawlow, Victor Sarmiento, Peter Como, Geoff Gosselin, Fred Miller, Chris Vieson, Kathy Dedrick, Ryann Seiger, Joe Sheehy, Alex Burkett, Mike Brian, Richard Russell, Brian Clifford, Lizzy Oslen, Pauline Thorndick, Andy Hardy, Craig Thomas, Marry Francis Repko. John Drake, Andrew Rogers, Chris Baysinger, Mary Martin, Jerry Couri, Mike Bloomquist, Ryan Long, Karen Christian, Brandon Mooney, Annelise Rickerts, Jackie Cohen, Rick Kessler, Jean Fruci, Kakuti Lin, Allison Hartwich, Geoff Antell, Kiel Weaver, Cindy Herrle. Madam Speaker, I thank the Democratic staff for their partnership in crafting this legislation and now passing on the floor, and, hopefully, ultimately, we get it to the President’s desk and signed into law. Thanks to all the folks on the other side of the aisle, the staff, for their willingness and hard work and the effort they put into it. I want to point out, though, Chris Vieson and Geoff Gosselin, the staff director and deputy staff director, for their great work and leadership on the committee. But also the Water Resources staff, Ian Bennitt, Jon Pawlow, Elizabeth Fox, Victor Sarmiento, and Peter Como for their efforts and long hours that I know they took to put this all together. And finally, I would just like to say, passing WRDA is personally very gratifying to me. When I became chairman, we had not passed a WRDA bill in 7 years. Prior to that, for over 20 years, WRDA bills were passed every Congress. It was regular order. Today, we will pass the third WRDA bill in three Congresses, and I want to thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for working with us and helping us to get it to the floor. I thank all of my colleagues in the House. As I think we maybe said earlier, when we passed it out of the House, it was 408–2, overwhelmingly. And again, I can’t thank my colleagues enough for working with me and helping to bring back regular order to WRDA. I ask all my colleagues to support this bill, and let’s move on to the next bill. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. FOXX). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3021, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘An Act to provide for improvements to the rivers and harbors of the United States, to provide for the conservation and development of water and related resources, to provide for water pollution control activities, and for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NATIONAL QUANTUM INITIATIVE ACT Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6227) to provide for a coordinated Federal program to accelerate quantum research and development for the economic and national security of the United States, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6227 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act, and this Act and such amendments shall be carried out using amounts otherwise available for such purpose. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE  JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 6227, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, this bipartisan National Quantum Initiative Act is cosponsored by House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Ranking Member EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , as well as 24 other committee members. The bill has earned widespread support and was unanimously approved by the committee on June 27. Before I explain what the bill does, I would like to explain why it matters so much. In our lifetime, we have seen remarkable advances in the size and speed of our computers. Most of us carry phones in our pockets that are several thousand times more powerful than all the combined computing power available to NASA during the Apollo missions. Yet, as impressive as these advances have been, quantum computing has the power to affect an even more dramatic transformation of our society and worldwide technology. Computers today rely on tiny onoff switches within a processing chip. Technological advances have made possible supercomputers that can perform series of onoff operations at astonishing speeds. But classical computing technology is nearing its limits. Each switch can only operate in one of two positions, off or on, zero or one. Quantum computing is different. Rather than onoff switches, quantum computers rely on qubits. These are subatomic particles that can be both on and off at the same time. This enables quantum computers to perform complex calculations at speeds that are potentially millions of times faster than today’s most advanced supercomputers. Countries that harness the power of quantum computing will be able to revolutionize cybersecurity, healthcare, communications, financial services, and transportation, just to name a few of the industries. The flip side of this is that quantum computing will make traditional IT security programs obsolete. The nation that develops quantum communications technology first may be able to decode, in a matter of seconds, other countries’ sensitive national security information, proprietary technologies, and personal information. Other countries are investing billions of dollars in new research facilities and equipment for quantum computing. China has publicly stated a national goal of surpassing the U.S. during the next decade. That is why it is imperative that we act now to develop a national quantum strategy and preserve America’s dominance in the scientific world. The National Quantum Initiative Act achieves this by creating a 10year Federal program to accelerate quantum research and development in the United States. The bill leverages the expertise and resources of U.S. industry, academia, and government to move quantum information science to the next level of research and development. The legislation enables a National Quantum Coordination Office within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. This office will oversee interagency coordination and strategic planning, serve as a central point of contact for stakeholders, conduct research, and promote commercialization of Federal research by the private sector. The bill also supports basic research, education, and standards development at the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy. Madam Speaker, $225 million a year of these agencies’ baseline funding will now be directed to new quantum research centers and laboratory research. Their activities will address fundamental research gaps, create a stronger workforce, and develop revolutionary knowledge and transformative innovations to give U.S. companies and workers an enduring competitive advantage. The bill ensures that U.S. hightech companies, which are investing heavily in quantum research, and a surge of quantum technology startups will contribute their knowledge and resources to a national effort. H.R. 6227 was developed with input from industry, academia, national laboratories, Federal agencies, and the administration. It was an open and bipartisan process. b1400 The input of those stakeholders has yielded a strong consensus bill. Additionally, Senator THUNE and Senator NELSON , the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, have introduced a companion bill in the Senate. With bipartisan, bicameral support and the backing of the administration, I believe this bill could become law by the end of the year. Let’s take action to spur America’s quantum development. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the National Quantum Initiative Act. I want to take a moment to thank Chairman SMITH for introducing this good legislation, of which I am a proud original cosponsor. I also want to express my appreciation for the deliberative, bipartisan process by which this bill was developed over the past year. H.R. 6227 is the product of engagement with key stakeholders in industry, academia, and the Federal Government. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a hearing on quantum technology last October. At that hearing, we heard from agency, university, and industry representatives about the recent breakthroughs in quantum sensing, quantum communication, and quantum computing. We also heard about the priorities for Federal investment in quantum research and the need for a strategic and coordinated approach going forward. In addition to the hearing, committee staff held numerous bipartisan meetings and roundtables to inform the development of this bill. Quantum information science and technology promises to revolutionize the way we solve problems. Many believe that quantum computing technology has the potential to accelerate progress on some of the most pressing challenges, including how to address climate change and understand complex diseases like cancer. While it is difficult to predict how farranging the societal and economic impacts of quantum computing will be, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that we are rapidly clearing the necessary engineering hurdles. It is truly an exciting time for this bill and for the wide range of innovators who are planning to take advantage of these new breakthrough capabilities. The race is on to build the world’s first quantum computer capable of solving problems that have long eluded conventional computers. Not unlike the space race in the 1960s, the stakes in today’s quantum race are high. Global leadership in quantum computing brings with it a military and intelligence edge, as well as a competitive advantage in what many expect to be a massive industry in decades to come. At this time, when China, Europe, and Russia are investing heavily in quantum research and technology development, it is imperative that we do everything we can to maintain our global standing as the leader in this area. We must invest more in research. We need to ensure that we are educating and training the next generation of top quantum scientists and engineers. And we should do more to encourage partnerships between academia, industry, and government. The National Quantum Initiative Act will set us on the right path. H.R. 6227 directs the President to establish a 10 year National Quantum Initiative Program, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy playing lead roles. Through the establishment of a national coordination office, an outside advisory committee, and an interagency working group, the program will take an integrated government approach to accelerating progress in quantum research and development. I want to express my appreciation for the deliberative, bipartisan process by which we developed this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON ) for those nice comments. And she is right, this was a very bipartisan effort and a very bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ), who is also the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the National Quantum Initiative Act. H.R. 6227 coordinates a Federal program to accelerate quantum research and development for the economic and national security of the United States. Quantum technology is a field positioned to fundamentally change the way we move and process data. Theoretically, quantum computing could allow for the solutions to exponentially large problems, things that cannot be accomplished by even the fastest supercomputers today. It could allow us, Mr. Speaker, to visualize the structures of complex chemicals and materials, to model highly detailed flows of potential mass evacuations with precise accuracy—with hurricanes abounding today, that is very, very important for us—and to quantify subatomic interactions on the cutting edge of nuclear research. Quantum computing may also have profound implications for cybersecurity technology. And the gentlewoman from Texas alluded to this: Should China and Russia beat us to achieving quantum encryption, our current security encryption measures would be rendered obsolete. You heard Chairman SMITH, in his remarks, say that we could possibly decode their encryptions in a matter of seconds, if not minutes. It is absolutely imperative, Mr. Speaker, that the U.S. maintain its leadership in this field. In order to achieve this kind of revolutionary improvement in technology, we need foundational knowledge in the advanced computing and materials science required to construct those quantum systems. The Department of Energy, the DOE, Office of Science is the leading Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and robust quantum technology research. At Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, NERSC, allows scientists to run simulations of quantum architectures. At Argonne National Laboratory’s Center for Nanoscale Materials, researchers study atomicscale materials in order to engineer the characteristics of quantum information systems; and at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, scientists are applying their experience in highenergy physics to the study of quantum materials. Earlier this year, I was privileged to invite several of my colleagues to join me on a visit to Argonne and Fermi labs, and we had the privilege of speaking with those very scientists conducting this groundbreaking research. It really is breathtaking and really is groundshattering, if you ask me, in what it is going to do for science. Support for basic research in computer science and for computational partnerships between industry, academia, and the national labs is absolutely necessary to develop the technology needed for future commercial quantum systems. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6227. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ). 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. JOHNSON for yielding, and I thank her for her leadership on this bill. I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation that will make a significant national commitment to the field of quantum science and engineering, which is critical for our global scientific and technological leadership. While the benefits of quantum technology may still be a ways off, there is fierce international competition in this field, most notably from China, and we can’t afford to waste any time. It is through strategic investments like this that we became the world’s economic scientific and technology leader, and we can only maintain that position through continuing significant investment in cuttingedge basic research. We already know that other countries are increasing their investments in quantum technology, in some cases guided by longterm strategies, and this bill will make sure that we develop a coherent strategy of our own. This bill is a bright spot in what is otherwise a long, downward trend in Federal R&D funding as a percentage of GDP. Much as today’s unbalanced budget leads to future debt problems, today’s underinvestment in R&D leads to future innovation deficits. I commend my colleagues from both parties for working together to bring this important bill to the floor, but we want to be clear that this is just a first step. We need to double down on our efforts and to reprioritize Federal research and development. I want to highlight and commend an organization that is a leader in the field of quantum information science and engineering and that made significant contributions to this bill. The Chicago Quantum Exchange is a partnership between the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. I want to thank Chairman WEBER for bringing the Science, Space, and Technology Committee’s Subcommittee on Energy out to Argonne and Fermi earlier this year. He spoke about some of the great work that they are doing there. The Chicago Quantum Exchange was created to develop and grow interdisciplinary collaboration for the exploration and development of new quantumenabled technologies and to help educate a new generation of quantum information scientists and engineers. Partnership with the private sector is also an important element of the exchange. The Chicago Quantum Exchange serves as both an excellent model for the Multidisciplinary Centers for Quantum Research and Education envisioned in this bill and for what the future of R&D and quantum information science will look like. Finally, I want to thank Chairman SMITH for his leadership on this bill and for working with us to make this a good, bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ), who has been a longtime and active member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and also the former vice chairman of the committee. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the National Quantum Initiative Act. This act will move us toward a new millennium of computing. Computers used to be big, really large, and the ways to make them more powerful was thought to be by making them bigger and bigger. Enormous mainframes filled entire office floors. Well, after some very significant discoveries and development in the technological arena, we advanced this technology, making computers smaller, lighter, and more capable so we could send, for example, astronauts to the Moon. That led to more and more improvements, and now computers are in cars, are in our coffee machines and everything else that we do. They have gotten so small that most of us can carry them around and, perhaps, right now, are carrying them around in our pocket. At this point now, we stand on the cusp of another giant leap forward for mankind, the quantum leap. By harnessing the natural properties of atomic and subatomic particles, we can develop the capabilities in the next decade that are far more capable than the systems that we marvel about today. This act will coordinate our Federal activity, reduce waste and redundancy, and ensure that our efforts are strategic. This will keep us in advance, and way in advance, of our adversaries around the globe and ensure our security and our prosperity. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this act and supporting a better future for America and the world. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, so I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ), who is one of the few members of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to actually be a member of three subcommittees. He is a member of the Energy Subcommittee, the Research and Technology Subcommittee, and the Space Subcommittee, and we appreciate his active service on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SMITH. I appreciate all of his hard work and success. And I also want to thank Ranking Member JOHNSON for her bipartisan work on this legislation, as well as her work on H.R. 589 that we will be getting over the finish line a little bit later in this series. b1415 Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in the way that we are able to ask questions and comb through data when doing complex computational problems. Like many things we do at the Office of Science, this endeavor requires time, effort, and commitment. Quantum computing was first theorized in the 1980s with researchers such as Richard Feynman, the physicist in my district I now know very well. While every particle physicist draws Feynman diagrams to explain the interaction of subatomic particles, his later work in this field may have just as lasting an impact that he has had on the field. I am proud to represent Fermilab in my district with the Feynman Computing Center on campus, and Fermilab is also a partner in the Chicago Quantum Exchange with Argonne, the University of Chicago, and other partners to further develop quantum systems outside of just computing. I look forward to the advancements this research will provide, but, more importantly, the people we will be able to help. We are getting to the point where we can actually use the reams of data we first got out of our genome project, and our ability to better use this and other data will help us find more targeted cures and develop better treatments. Similar to what we are doing in this legislation, I also want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their efforts on the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act. This legislation contains a number of sections from legislation I introduced to improve the ability of our national labs to get ideas out of the lab and into the private sector. The increased flexibility this legislation gives to the labs will allow them to better work with universities and the private sector when there are capabilities that only exist in our labs. These labs have been a passion of mine, with the ability to see two of them up close in Illinois. I have seen the innovation engine they can be, not just for our Nation, but for local and regional economies. It is vital that we continue to support our laboratories, which host more than 32,000 researchers from across the Nation, touching nearly, if not every, university in the United States. This legislation gives the Office of Science clear direction on their mission, and I am pleased that we could work with the Senate to get this to the President’s desk after this vote series. Again, I thank the chairman for yielding. I urge passage of these important bills. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other requests for time either, 
and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WOODALL ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6227, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION ACT Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 589) to establish Department of Energy policy for science and energy research and development programs, and reform National Laboratory management and technology transfer programs, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE  JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 589, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act, is the product of more than 4 years of work by the Science Committee to advance basic research in science and technology and set clear science priorities for the Department of Energy. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on the Science Committee who have sponsored this legislation with me, particularly Ranking Member EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , Vice Chairman FRANK LUCAS , Energy Subcommittee Chairman RANDY WEBER , Energy Subcommittee Vice Chairman STEVE KNIGHT , and Energy Subcommittee members DANA ROHRABACHER , M OBROOKS , N EAL DUNN, RANDY HULTGREN , MARC VEASEY , ZOE LOFGREN , D ANLIPINSKI , and P AUL TONKO , as well as full committee members BARBARA COMSTOCK , BRIAN BABIN, ANDY BIGGS, CLAYHIGGINS , ELIZABETH  ESTY, and E DPERLMUTTER . Six standalone Science Committee energy research bills from last Congress are included in this legislation. The DOE Research and Innovation Act prioritizes critical basic research and science at the DOE national labs. It provides the first comprehensive authorization for Office of Science programs, which conduct and support more than $6 billion in research each year. This legislation also requires DOE to coordinate research across the Department. It provides private industry with increased access to the unique user facilities and capabilities of the national labs that will help to develop advanced technologies for the next generation. Title I of H.R. 589 improves the technology transfer process between DOE and private industry. The innovative early stage research performed at the national labs can have great value to the private sector. While the labs consistently develop ideas and technology that have commercial potential, Federal red tape and bureaucracy discourage the cooperation needed for the private sector to take technologies to market. Title I enables national lab directors to better partner with industry and ensure that the United States can remain a world leader in science and technology. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois, Representative RANDY  HULTGREN , and the gentleman from Colorado, Representative EDPERLMUTTER , for their initiative on this issue and for sponsoring similar legislation in the last Congress to advance these important reforms at our national labs. Title II of the legislation requires DOE to better manage and coordinate research efforts at the Department of Energy. This title also requires DOE to provide a regular analysis of science and technology activities within the Department. This will identify key areas for collaboration across science and applied research programs, and allow the Secretary to identify programs that cost too much and could be better undertaken by the private sector. Title III establishes priorities and provides statutory direction for the basic research programs within the DOE’s Office of Science. This includes research and basic energy sciences, biological and environmental research, highperformance computing, nuclear physics, highenergy physics, and fusion energy science. These basic research programs are central to the mission of the Department. Investment in this research can lead to new scientific discoveries that will maintain U.S. leadership in technology and innovation. This title also authorizes basic research programs in solar fuels, electricity storage, exascale computing, and lowdose radiation. The House has previously passed Science Committee legislation by Energy Subcommittee Vice Chairman KNIGHT and subcommittee member HULTGREN to authorize these four key basic research programs. H.R. 589 represents a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to modernize and increase the productivity of the DOE national lab system, streamline DOE research programs, and prioritize the basic scientific research that will maintain American leadership in science. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the final passage of H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act, for which I am pleased to be a cosponsor. The bill before us today is a result of constructive negotiations with our majority and with our colleagues in the Senate over the last 2 years. I am also pleased to note that many of the provisions in this bill actually were proposed first in the version of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act, and that was sponsored by every Democratic member of the committee last Congress. This bill includes what would be the first comprehensive authorization of the DOE Office of Science, which is the largest supporter of physical sciences research in the country. This is a $6.6 billion office that manages 10 of our national laboratories, often called the crown jewels of our national research infrastructure. Yet, thus far, unlike NSF, NASA, and nearly every other major scientific research agency stewarded by the Federal Government, the Office of Science has not received the statutory guidance and support that its capabilities and mission warrant. So passing this portion of the bill into law alone would be a big step in the right direction. The bill also includes a number of important technology transfer provisions that previously passed the House as part of a bipartisan bill that I and many of my colleagues on the committee cosponsored. In addition, it would provide the first authorization of the promising Innovation Hub model for energy research, and it would enable greater private sector management of ARPAE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman SMITH and his staff for working closely with us and our Senate counterparts to find common ground in each of these areas, as I believe they will be critical to ensuring our Nation’s competitiveness and our clean energy future. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ), who is the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the Science Committee. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SMITH for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act. H.R. 589 provides policy direction to the Department of Energy on basic science research and coordination, and implements important reforms to DOE national laboratory management that will modernize the research pipeline. This legislation gives Congress the opportunity to enact energy research and development policy that prioritizes critical programs at the Department of Energy. From advanced scientific computing to nuclear physics to fusion energy science, focusing on basic research at our national labs provides the best opportunity for U.S. economic growth and technology innovation. Significant investments, Mr. Speaker, in basic science research by foreign countries like China, as has been alluded to, threatens America’s global standing as the leader in scientific knowledge. To maintain our competitive advantage as a world leader in science, we must continue to support the research and research infrastructure that will lead to the next generation of energy technologies. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member J OHNSON and many of my Science Committee colleagues for cosponsoring this very important legislation. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with members of this committee to guide research that will help America compete around the world and be the leader around the world. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 589. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ), who is the vice chairman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee of the Science Committee. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act, sponsored by my friend and the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Representative SMITH. This bipartisan bill advances basic research and sets explicit science priorities for the Department of Energy, which is critical for our future innovation. H.R. 589 also authorizes the core program in my bill, the LowDose Radiation Research Act, which unanimously passed the House earlier this year. The provision directs the Department of Energy to carry out a research program on lowdose radiation, which will increase our understanding of the health effects low doses have on biological systems. Research has consistently shown us the adverse health effects associated with high doses of radiation, but we are a long way from accurately assessing the effects of low doses of radiation. As a product of industrial activities, medical procedures, and naturally occurring systems, humans are exposed to low doses of radiation every day, and it is imperative we can accurately assess this risk. There is broad consensus among the radiobiology community that more research is necessary for Federal agencies, physicians, and related experts to advance the use of radiation technologies. We have invaluable diagnostic tools today, such as CT scans, which emit low doses of radiation. It is vital physicians are able to inform patients of the health risks associated with these types of imaging processes. As a physician in my home State of Kansas, I certainly have firsthand understanding of the crucial importance of verified research and ensuring the best medical outcomes for our patients. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. b1430 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have further speakers, but I will yield to the ranking member if she has any speakers. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I support passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ), who is the vice chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act. This bill makes important investments in science and technology research to ensure the United States protects its edge in novel, efficient, and commercially viable energy production. H.R. 589 makes needed reforms to the national laboratories’ relationship with the private sector to streamline the transfer of commercially ready technologies to American businesses. This will allow the benefits of public investment and critical research to be passed on to American entrepreneurs with greater speed and reinforced economic growth and job creation. In addition, this bill directs the Department of Energy to establish energy innovation hubs to pull together and create efficiencies in key scientific areas across basic and applied research programs. This bill also includes authorization of the solar fuels initiative, incorporating the text of my bill last Congress, the Solar Fuels Innovation Act. This provision builds on research that is now being undertaken up and down the coast of California, from Berkeley to Caltech, to produce fuels from sunlight. The solar fuel process, also known as artificial photosynthesis, converts sunlight into energy to create a range of storable chemical fuels, overcoming the biggest obstacle to maximizing the benefits of renewable technologies. Basic research and artificial photosynthesis and related efforts could lead to a solar fuel system that consolidates solar power and energy storage in a cohesive process. This would transform the economy in California and the rest of the Nation. The solar fuels initiative would solve the critical challenge posed by wasted renewable energy and enlarge incentives to invest in new solar businesses. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman SMITH and my colleagues who have helped me advance this bill for their foresight in identifying research initiatives that promise new approaches to energy technology that will be good for our economy and our environment. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his comments and also for his initiatives on the subject of energy in so many ways. Several other bills that we are considering are a result of that initiative. Mr. Speaker, I have no other requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 589. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION CAPABILITIES ACT OF 2017 Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 97) to enable civilian research and development of advanced nuclear energy technologies by private and public institutions, to expand theoretical and practical knowledge of nuclear physics, chemistry, and materials science, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 97 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE  JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 97, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in support of S. 97, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. I want to thank Senator CRAPO , Senator W HITEHOUSE , Senator MURKOWSKI , and Senator B OOKER , 
as well as Ranking Member J OHNSON  and Chairman SMITH for cosponsoring this important legislation, and for their years of leadership in advocating for nuclear energy research and development. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to work alongside my Senate counterparts to prioritize fundamental research that will support nuclear innovation and keep America safe, independent, and most importantly, globally competitive. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee who have worked alongside of me with advancing this legislation. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which I introduced in the 114th Congress and the 115th Congress, provides updated statutory direction to the Department of Energy’s nuclear research activities to ensure that fundamental research is prioritized and precious resources are not wasted. Mr. Speaker, this bill lays out a clear set of parameters and a definite timeline for DOE to complete an advanced research reactor facility, which is a crucial part of ensuring innovative materials and nuclear fuels R&D can take place right here in the United States instead of overseas. While modeling and simulation can accelerate R&D, nuclear energy research must be validated through direct experimentation in the lab. This type of research requires access to a source of fast neutrons, and today, these are only available for civilian research in Russia. The versatile neutron source authorized in this bill will provide the United States with this vital capability. S. 97 also directs DOE to partner with industry to construct and operate reactor prototypes at DOE national labs. Mr. Speaker, our national labs provide a very unique environment that safely allows for creative testing and development for advanced nuclear technology without a burdensome regulatory process that can slow progress to a crawl. In order to maintain our nuclear capabilities, the United States must continue developing cuttingedge technology right here at home. Without the direction provided in this bill, Mr. Speaker, we will continue to rely on foreign research. We will fall further and further behind. We will lose the ability to develop innovative nuclear technology and be left importing nextgeneration reactor designs from overseas. This is unacceptable. S. 97 will maintain America’s ability to influence security and proliferation standards around the world as more developing nations look to nuclear energy to grow their economies. The language in this bill is the product of many Science, Space, and Technology Committee engagements with relevant stakeholders and nuclear research and development. Mr. Speaker, last Congress this language passed the House three times as a standalone bill, with the House amendment to S. 2012 and in the NDAA, each with overwhelming bipartisan support. This language also has a history of strong support in the Senate. It passed as an amendment in the Senate during the 114th Congress and again as a standalone bill this Congress. S. 97 is vital to ensure that this important research and development is carried out. We cannot afford to miss the economic opportunity provided by nextgeneration nuclear technology. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 97, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support S. 97, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. It is the Senate companion to H.R. 431, which I am very pleased to cosponsor. Today, nuclear power plays a vital role in providing our country with clean, reliable energy. I happen to be one of those who live in an area where we have nuclear energy. Looking toward the future, one of my top priorities is preventing and mitigating the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. I believe that this clean energy resource can and should play a key role in our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our electricity sector. But there currently are technical, economic, and policy challenges that prevent nuclear energy from playing a larger role in enabling our clean energy future. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act takes several positive steps to address these challenges. Implementing the provisions of this bill will help accelerate the development of advanced nuclear energy technologies that are safer, less expensive, more efficient, and produce less waste than the current generation of nuclear reactors. I hope it will also help ensure a brighter future for the U.S. nuclear energy industry. I would like to express my appreciation for the process we followed to put this bill together. Majority and minority staff in both the House and Senate worked closely together, from engaging stakeholders, through crafting and incorporating suggested changes to the bill language. This is a great example of what we can achieve when we leave politics at the door and look for common ground to address challenges facing our Nation’s research enterprise. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the great gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ) for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, S. 97, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, directs the Department of Energy to enable the American nuclear power industry to conduct civilian nuclear energy research and development that will advance our leadership in nuclear technology. While we are considering the Senate version of this bill today, I would like to credit the author of the original legislation, Energy Subcommittee Chairman RANDY WEBER , his primary cosponsors, and Science, Space, and Technology Committee Ranking Member EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON for their years of leadership on this issue. The originating Science, Space, and Technology Committee legislation was developed over 4 years of collaboration, including hearings, coordination with DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and countless meetings with stakeholders. Every effort has been made to ensure this legislation will provide the resources necessary to more effectively and efficiently develop the next generation of nuclear power. Advanced nuclear energy technology is the best way to make reliable, safe, and emissionfree electricity available throughout the modern and developing world. The legislation authorizes the research facilities and infrastructure necessary to help development of new, advanced nuclear reactors here at home, maintaining American leadership in the global nuclear technology sector. This technological edge allows us to better influence global nonproliferation standards and prevent civilian nuclear energy technology from being misused for weapons development overseas. S. 97 directs DOE to develop plans for longterm research and authorizes critical infrastructure at the DOE national labs. This includes leveraging DOE stateoftheart super computers to accelerate the theoretical development of advanced reactors. The bill also authorizes construction of a research reactor at a DOE site. This research reactor will provide access to the fast neutrons necessary to develop advanced nuclear reactors. By investing in research infrastructure, DOE can maximize the impact of Federal research dollars and facilitate the development of a wide variety of nuclear technologies. Finally, S. 97 creates a reliable mechanism for the private sector to partner with DOE labs to build DOEcertified prototype reactors at DOE sites. While the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has heard from dozens of companies with innovative reactor designs, the ability to move new nuclear technology to the market has been stalled by government approval and licensing red tape. S. 97 provides an alternative pathway for these nuclear entrepreneurs. The safe development of advanced nuclear technology at DOE sites will provide access to DOE resources and expertise, and fast track the commercial regulatory process by involving nuclear reactors at the earliest stages of prototype design and construction. 
Nuclear power has been a proven source of safe and emissionfree electricity for over half a century. By enacting this legislation and investing in the capabilities needed by the private sector to develop advanced reactors, we can build on the history of American leadership in nuclear power and reduce emissions around the world. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman WEBER and Ranking Member JOHNSON for their work on this bill, as well as our Senate colleagues, including Senator MIKECRAPO , Senator J IM RISCH, Senator L ISAMURKOWSKI , Senator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE , and Senator CORYBOOKER for leading the effort to pass this bill through the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support and clear this legislation for President Trump’s approval. b1445 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. S. 97 is vital to ensuring America’s leadership in nuclear research and development. By harnessing the expertise and unique capabilities of our Nation’s national labs, universities, and entrepreneurs, American industry can take the lead in developing groundbreaking advanced nuclear technology for the next generation. I especially thank my colleagues in the Senate and on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee who have worked hard to get this legislation passed: Senators CRAPO , W HITEHOUSE , MURKOWSKI , and B OOKER , and, of course, Ranking Member JOHNSON and Chairman SMITH, as well as my other colleagues. I also thank the dozens of researchers and stakeholders who provided critical feedback over the past several years as we have been developing this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 97. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 5895, ENERGY AND WATER, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH, AND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1059, I call up the conference report on the bill (H.R. 5895) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1059, the conference report is considered read. (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of September 10, 2018, at page H7946.) The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELING HUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present the conference report for H.R. 5895. This conference report includes the Energy and Water Development, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch Appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019. It is a product of months of negotiations between the House and the Senate. This conference report is a responsible compromise that addresses shared priorities: funding for programs that benefit all Americans, including national security, energy development programs and water resources infrastructure, care for veterans, and operations of the legislative branch. Critically, this conference report represents the next step toward fully funding the Federal Government for fiscal year 2019. This is the first time since fiscal year 2017 that Congress will have passed any Appropriations bill before the end of the year and the first time in over a decade—since fiscal year 2007—that Congress will be sending more than one Appropriations bill to the President’s desk before September 30. We have done our best to repair a broken appropriations process. This is a welcome and long overdue return to regular order and fulfills our promise to the American people to deliver results. Passage of this legislation also provides certainty to the Federal Government—most importantly, for our troops and their families, who rely on military infrastructure to sustain their quality of life and accomplish their missions, and for our veterans, who deserve full access to their benefits and healthcare. It is my sincere hope that we will continue this progress with the consideration of additional conference reports. The Energy and Water portion of the report provides $44.6 billion for Department of Energy, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of Defense’s nuclear programs. Investments in national security programs help our Nation maintain its strongest possible nuclear deterrence posture, support our Navy’s nuclear powered fleet, and keep nuclear materials out of the hands of terrorists. And the bill also targets an array of energy programs that support our goal of energy independence and directs muchneeded funds to water resources infrastructure across the country. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs portion of the report totals $98 billion in discretionary funding. This includes the largest dollar amount ever for the Department of Veterans Affairs, $86.5 billion, a substantial investment that will improve access to and quality of care for veterans. Importantly, this also includes additional funding for the VA MISSION Act and will support ongoing care for our veterans through community care centers, caregivers, and other medical services. This funding is provided within the existing discretionary spending caps. Also, the bill provides strong investments for our defense infrastructure and military installations. This will support the rebuilding of our Armed Forces, help counter threats and aggression abroad, and support our troops and military families. The third portion of this conference report includes the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. This legislation continues the operations of Congress and its support agencies, ensuring that Members of Congress are best able to serve the American people. Within the total of $4.8 billion, provided for both the House and the Senate, funding is prioritized for security and safety within the Capitol complex, including increases for the Capitol Police. The legislation helps the legislative branch improve its functions. Of note, for the first time, we have included dedicated funding for paid internships, which will allow more young Americans and students from all backgrounds to serve Congress. I want to express my deep gratitude to the chairs and ranking members of the three subcommittees who spearheaded this legislation—Energy and Water Chairman SIMPSON of Idaho and Ranking Member KAPTUR of Ohio; Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Chairman CARTER of Texas and Ranking Member WASSERMAN SCHULTZ of Florida; and Legislative Branch Chairman FORTENBERRY of Nebraska and Ranking Member RYAN of Ohio—along with all our conferees. I also want to especially thank Ranking Member LOWEY for her service, support, and friendship throughout many years on the Appropriations Committee. Lastly, I would like to thank our committee’s hardworking professional and associate staff. Over the past months, they have been working without a break to complete negotiations and get this conference report and other reports to the floor. They are a 
remarkable group of men and women, and I salute them. Support for this conference report today indicates that Congress is willing and able to get its work done on behalf of the American people on time, under regular order, and within our set budget limits. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this conference report, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this threebill minibus, which delivers important victories for the American people. The fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch bill is a bipartisan rejection of President Trump’s extreme budget cuts. It restores $8.1 billion in funding for programs that create jobs and strengthen our economy. Instead of cutting energy efficiency and renewable energy programs within the Department of Energy, as House Republicans proposed, we have increased its funding. That means more resources to develop clean energy technology and accelerate job creation in this growing sector of the economy. And this bill gives an emphatic thumbsdown to President Trump’s proposed elimination of the highly successful ARPAE program, which promotes and funds research and development of advanced energy technology. Turning to the Military ConstructionVeterans Affairs division, I am pleased that the bill provides a second installment of $2 billion for VA infrastructure improvements. And, as more veterans suffer from our country’s devastating opioid epidemic, we are doing right by our veterans by providing $400 million for opioid treatment, prevention, and safety initiatives. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those who have sacrificed for us in our Armed Forces, and we must ensure they receive the benefits and assistance they deserve. Unfortunately, when it comes to the VA MISSION Act, the White House and House Republicans refuse to live up to that sacred trust. Despite the inclusion of nonbinding report language, the legislation before us utterly fails to address the transition of the VA Choice program from mandatory to discretionary spending. It is deeply disappointing that we have been unable to address this issue with a bipartisan, bicameral compromise. Instead, Congress has left behind a shortfall that will lead to cuts to vital domestic programs, including for our veterans. It is now imperative for next year that we find a responsible, longterm solution to protect domestic priorities and veterans’ healthcare. b1500 Finally, I would be remiss if I did not celebrate one of the successes in this bill that is closer to home. I am delighted that we have secured $8.8 million in the new dedicated funding stream for Members’ offices to pay interns. Congressional interns should be reflective of the country we serve. This new funding will help a more diverse range of young people follow their dreams and begin a career in public service. I appreciate the hard work of my friend, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , and the subcommittee Chairmen SIMPSON , CARTER , and F ORTENBERRY , as well as our Senate counterparts in crafting this compromise. I am grateful for the leadership of Ranking Members MARCY  KAPTUR , T IM RYAN, and D EBBIE  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ fighting on behalf of our priorities for the American people. Of course, I thank the staff on both sides of the aisle who work so very hard night and day to help us deliver this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this minibus, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON ), who is the chairman of the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Idaho? There was no objection. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I will include my complete remarks for the RECORD . Mr. Speaker, I just want to say how thankful I am for Chairman FRELING HUYSEN and Ranking Member L OWEY  for their leadership on this bill, and for all the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members on both sides of the rotunda for the work they have done to complete this bill. Mostly, I want to thank the staff that the chairman has already thanked for the hard work they did. Most people don’t realize that, when we are at home in August, they are here working hard every day, sometimes all night long, trying to come up with a compromise that maintains our House priorities. I think they have done a good job in this. It meets the NDAA requirements that were passed in the House and the Senate, and it meets the requirements of the Nuclear Posture Review and other things. So they have done a great job protecting House priorities. We didn’t get everything we wanted in this bill. The Senate didn’t get everything they wanted in the bill either. That is kind of the nature of a compromise. But this is a good bill. It should pass. It is our first step in restoring regular order, and I want to thank everybody who has been involved in creating this. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report for H.R. 5895, the fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. Before I get into the details of the bill, I would like to thank several Members involved in this effort—my Ranking Member, MARCY  KAPTUR ; our Senate partners, L AMAR ALEXANDER and D IANNE FEINSTEIN ; our full committee leadership, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN  and Ranking Member LOWEY here in the House and Chairman SHELBY and Ranking Member LEAHY in the Senate; and all the conferees who participated in producing this final product. I’d like to assure my colleagues that the House conferees on this minibus worked diligently to ensure that House priorities were well represented in the final package. The Energy and Water bill totals $44.64 billion, which is $1.44 billion more than last year’s level. Increases over last year are targeted to those areas where they are needed most to provide for our national defense and to support our nation’s infrastructure.5895, the Fiscal Year 2019 ilitary Construction The conference report reflects the House priority of strong support for the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons security programs, including Weapons Activities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors. It aligns with the Administration’s Nuclear Posture Review, or NPR, which calls for maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent to meet the challenges of a changing security environment, revitalizing the nuclear complex, and supporting effective arms control and nonproliferation efforts. Since the NPR was released after the budget submission, the House worked hard to ensure funds above the budget request were included for critical NPR recommendations. Overall funding for the national nuclear security programs totals $15.23 billion—an increase of $560 million above the fiscal year 2018 enacted level and $138 million above the President’s budget request. Within this amount, $65 million is provided to support the NPR’s recommendation to pursue a lower yield ballistic missile warhead to enhance the credibility of our nuclear deterrent and $1.07 billion is provided to address the growing backlog of deferred maintenance and to recapitalize aging nuclear weapons infrastructure. Also within this amount, the budget request for Naval Reactors is fully funded, an increase of $169 million above fiscal year 2018, to support the Navy’s nuclear propulsion program. The conference report provides funding increases across the Department of Energy to defend against cyber attacks and to strengthen energy sector cybersecurity preparedness, response, and recovery. Addressing our nation’s critical infrastructure needs is another House priority strongly reflected in the final conference report. Funding for the Army Corps of Engineers totals $7 billion. Harbor Maintenance activities are funded at $1.55 billion, which is $150 million more than fiscal year 2018. The level exceeds the WRDA annual target and represents 92 percent of estimated revenues compared to the fiscal year 2019 target of 77 percent established in WRRDA 2014. Within the Bureau of Reclamation, the bill provides an additional $343 million for water 
conservation and delivery projects, including $134 million for water storage projects authorized under the WIIN Act and $99 million for rural water projects. The bill advances an ‘‘alloftheabove’’ energy strategy that will support a strong national economy well into the future. Specifically, the bill promotes innovation and growth in nuclear energy, funding research, development, and demonstration activities at $1.2 billion, an increase of $108 million above fiscal year 2018. Research to advance coal, natural gas, oil, and other fossil energy technologies is funded at $740 million. Basic science research funding totals $6.6 billion, $325 million more than last year. Increased funding will advance U.S. leadership in high performance computing and improve science research infrastructure at our national laboratories. Finally, the conference report registers the grave concerns of many Members of Congress over judicial interference in the operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System hydroelectric dams. All in all, this appropriations package, including the Energy and Water division, is a strong bill that incorporates many high priorities of the House. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), who is the ranking member of the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this threecornered minibus before us. It is really the opening pitch of 12 bills of which we are a part, and it partially funds our Nation’s energy and water development requirements; military construction; the legislative branch; and, of course, programs to serve our Nation’s veterans who put their lives in service to liberty at home and abroad every day. Please let me thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Ranking Member LOWEY , and our very able subcommittee chair, MIKE SIMPSON , as well as our committee staff for their tireless efforts to bring this first set of appropriation bills over the finish line. Though it is fair to say Republican leaders took the long way to a bipartisan agreement, we now find ourselves passing three appropriations bills before the October 1 deadline of the beginning of the new fiscal year. Something that should not be a momentous occasion has thus turned into one. While I don’t think that our subcommittee deserves a pat on the back for simply doing our job, let me note that this is an achievement we have not seen in many, many years with our bill, Energy and Water Development. This House must move toward regular order again, and this sets the pace. Our specific title contributes to ensuring the critical availability of energy and water for our Nation’s domestic stability, as well as our national security, not just for today, but for the tomorrows to come. America has made enormous strides in increasing our energy independence to close to 90 percent in the short term. No bill is more important than this one in reaching 100 percent independence as the strategic goal for our Nation. But it is not yet time to declare mission accomplished. Future energy security is the ultimate goal we must continue to strive for. The nearly $7 billion in funding also in this bill for the Army Corps of Engineers will ensure continued forward progress across all project areas. The Corps can contribute mightily to infrastructure investment for modernization and job creation across our Nation. The Corps’ role in essential flood control is critical as we watch the approach of Hurricane Florence and we think about navigation and the responsibilities of the Corps, as well as environmental restoration. I am grateful for the chairman’s continued partnership to address the Asian carp threat to our freshwater Great Lakes ecosystem, as well as for funding to keep our Great Lakes ports open to shippers. Our Nation has a wonderful navigation system that drives economic investment and undergirds our essential industrial manufacturing base. This bill makes many other important investments for our Nation, including reversing the misguided cuts to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in the House bill. The compromise yielded an additional $57 million to sustain the momentum to rapidly falling prices for wind and solar energy as critical to achieving an all oftheabove energy platform. This funding also allows us to continue investing in the Office of Advanced Manufacturing, vehicles technology, and bioenergy. These programs are an investment in clean energy technologies, and they drive our global leadership in innovation and set us on the path for continuing job creation. This bill strongly funds programs that were eliminated in the President’s budget, including weatherization assistance to conserve energy and the pathbreaking office of the Department of Energy’s advanced research, ARPA E, which unlocks science to build our future and the progress that goes with it. Additionally, harmful, controversial policy riders that have no place in this bill were removed. One dealt with the waters of the U.S., and one would interfere with an ongoing judicial process. Both would have seriously hindered passage of this bill. With regard to funding the VA, I am concerned we have set ourselves on a course for another selfinflicted crisis when funding for the VA MISSION Act runs out. Our veterans deserve the best treatment in the world, not to have their care used as a political weapon for partisan gain. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my colleagues and friends from the committee, Chairmen SIMPSON and FRELINGHUYSEN , and Ranking Member LOWEY , for their persistent leadership for our Nation, and to the Senate for bringing such a good example of bipartisanship, which I hope we can continue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this package. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY ), who is the chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for all of his dedicated, hard work on this bill and his leadership through many years of service. We are really grateful for the gentleman’s mentorship and all of his exhaustive efforts to make America truly a much better place. In that regard, Mr. Speaker, while I was on my way over here, I was reflecting on something. The dome of the Capitol that connects our two bodies here continued to be constructed during the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was encouraged to stop it, given all the other demands of the crises all around him. He refused. He said that, one day, that dome will unify our Nation once again. Here we are with the legislative branch bill. Even though it is the smallest of the appropriations bills, I believe it does capture the richness of the American experience and captures the heart of the narrative of our Nation. In that regard, we have worked very closely, of course, with the former chairman, KEVIN YODER , as well Ranking Member TIMRYAN, as well as the United States Senate to develop a very good bill here. The final product, I believe, is solid and reasonable. The legislative branch division provides about $4.8 billion in funding, and that is a 2.8 percent increase over last year. But the priorities, Mr. Speaker, were placed on security, transparency, and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The bill provides about $1.2 billion for the House of Representatives, which is a 2.7 percent increase. However, it needs to be noted that this is still below funding levels from the year 2010. As the chairman mentioned, this includes $8.8 million for a new account for the compensation of interns, which is a widely agreed upon new initiative, allowing each Member to spend up to $20,000 a year. In the areas of security, about $30 million is going to our Capitol Police to enhance the safety and security of this campus, as well as to protect Members when they are offsite. About $733 million is going to the Architect of the Capitol to ensure safety and security improvements to our historic buildings and to address a growing deferred maintenance list that we have. A particularly new initiative is that we are directing the Architect to design plans for a more welcoming arrival area around the Capitol South Metro Station. Regarding the issue of transparency, there is about $589 million for the Government Accountability Office, which 
will enable them to hire 130 new persons to assist with GAO’s critical oversight work that provides us in Congress accurate, nonpartisan reporting of how taxpayer dollars are being appropriately used. The Congressional Budget Office will also receive a slight increase to be better responsive to Members of Congress. Regarding fiscal responsibility and new initiatives, we have included language supporting the Library of Congress’ visitor experience project, which has the potential to transform how our Library, the Library of America, welcomes the millions of visitors that it receives each year. We expect that this will become a model of publicprivate partnership in the years to come. Finally, I would like to draw attention to the expansion of the popular House Wounded Warrior Program that will now offer 110 2year fellowships for those who have already sacrificed so much for our country and wish to pursue public service here among us. Mr. Speaker, a lot goes on in our Capitol, from the dedicated Capitol Police officers who stand guard around the clock, to the employees of the Architect of the Capitol who work to preserve and maintain this important physical infrastructure, to the IT professionals who have successfully defended our networks from 4.5 billion attempted cyber attacks last year alone, and to the committed staff that is a part of this legislative process. We owe them all. We also, again, are thankful to Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for his dedicated leadership. I would personally like to wish the gentleman all the best in his future endeavors. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), who is the ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my congratulations to my friend from New Jersey for his work on this and so many other issues, and for his constant dedication to this Congress. I also sit on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee with Congressman FRELINGHUYSEN . I just want to thank the gentleman for his leadership, hard work, and his years of travel around the world to make sure that the men and women in our military are safe and protected and have the equipment that they need. So I thank the gentleman for all his service. I rise in support, Mr. Speaker, of this conference agreement. Once again, we see that the Congress can pass decent legislation when Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, all work together to reach a bipartisan agreement instead of one party trying to make all the decisions behind closed doors. This bill and these bills reflect that. The bill we are sending to the President’s desk takes care of our veterans; it funds our civilian and military infrastructure and energy needs; and it pays for the operations of the legislative branch institutions essential to our democracy. Almost every agency in the legislative branch division of this bill receives its full budget request. One of the highlights of the bill is the funding for the Government Accountability Office, which works to root out waste, fraud, and abuse governmentwide. With so many safeguards having failed against mismanagement and corruption in our government over the past few years, the GAO is more important than ever. By providing the resources for the GAO to take another step toward restoring its presequestration capacity, we are helping to save taxpayers money and prevent some of the worst abuses of the administration. Another key accomplishment in this measure is the restoration of the dedicated funding for paid internships in the House of Representatives. I also want to thank the gentlewoman from New York and the gentleman from New Jersey for helping make that possible. It has been 25 years since we have had a paid internship program here in the United States Congress. Once more, when a young person from a middle class family comes to Washington, D.C., and desires to enter public service, they can worry a little bit less about the costs here in Washington, D.C., for rent and grocery bills, and compete with other applicants based on merit instead of economic background, which is just a matter of basic fairness. b1515 There are so many other issues. One more, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to mention in this bill is that we have ensured we are doing all we can to address the epidemic of harassment and discrimination that has existed since time immemorial but rightly showed up in the headlines in the last year or two. The Office of Compliance is given over $1.3 million more than last year so they can have the resources to tackle the problem and to handle the increased workload we have given them by expanding their jurisdiction. In the near future, we expect their mission to expand further, and these funds will help them prepare for that. Again, I extend my sincere thanks especially, again, to Chairman FRELING HUYSEN , who is leaving, N ITALOWEY , Chairman FORTENBERRY , Senator DAINES and Senator M URPHY , and so many others. Also, thank you to the staffs on both sides, including Anne Sokolov, Ryan Keating, Adam Berg, Jenny Panone, Tim Monahan, and Reyn Archer, for making this bill possible and, as Congressman SIMPSON said, for the long hours that they have put in over the August recess to make this happen. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ), chairman of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to congratulate Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY for their incredible patience and deft negotiating to bring us to this point. I also want to thank Ranking Member DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ  for her rocksolid support and keen analytic eye. I also think we need to remember Mr. Charlie Dent, who retired early from this committee. He was the chairman and had a strong hand in the product that came out here today. I am pleased to describe for my colleagues the good news in the Military ConstructionVA division of the minibus. We are able to provide long overdue support to our military and their family members, with a total of $10.3 billion for military construction, which is an increase of $241 million, or 2.4 percent, above FY18 levels. With that funding, we are able to provide $465.3 million for the Guard and Reserve components’ projects in 20 States and territories, $352 million for two medical facilities, $267.5 million for five DOD schools, and just over $8 billion for military construction projects in the U.S. Members will appreciate that we are able to provide $693.2 million in unfunded requirements requested by the services, which includes $100 million for upgrades for antiterrorism and force protection at military installations. The bill also includes $921.4 million in OCO funding, an increase of $171 million over FY18. Our bill fulfills Congress’ commitment to our Nation’s veterans with total discretionary funding of $86.5 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a $5 billion, or 6.2 percent, increase over 2018. These funds provide important medical services to veterans, to include supporting the new and expanding programs resulting from the recently passed MISSION Act, as well as disability compensation, post9/ 11 education benefits, and a host of insurance and lending programs. Of note, we were able to provide $1.1 billion for the new electronic health record contract, the same record as DOD’s, which will allow the exchange of veterans’ health records with DOD and community providers. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. CARTER of Texas. In addition, consistent with the budget caps agreement, the bill includes $2 billion in medical infrastructure assistance: nonrecurring maintenance, seismic improvement activities, major construction, and minor construction. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on the package. Help us do the right thing for our servicemembers and veterans and their families who have given so much. 
I would also be remiss in not thanking all those involved in the committee work to get this bill forward. I am very grateful we had a conference. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ), a member of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, Mrs. LOWEY , for yielding and for the wonderful work she has done as our leader in the Appropriations Committee. I certainly want to thank, also, the chairman for his leadership and the bipartisan work that both individuals, Mrs. LOWEY and Mr. F RELINGHUYSEN , have done in working together to make sure we pass this legislation and bring these three bills to the floor. I would like to highlight a couple of things that some Members have included. First of all, on the MILCONVA, we are talking about a $5 billion increase. My friend from Texas (Mr. CARTER ) and Ms. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ have worked together in a bipartisan way. There is $86.5 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which includes funding for mental health services, modernizing the VA’s health record system, and addressing the claims backlog that every Member knows has been so difficult. So that extra $5 billion is going to do a lot to help the veterans. There is also $10.3 billion for military construction projects that will support our troops and our freedom at home. I know that in my part of San Antonio, San Antonio’s Military USA, this is an important type of assistance. Certainly, we have $1.3 billion for telehealth. This amount is $30 million above what we just provided earlier this year. This will further expand the telehealth capacity to rural areas. There is also $206 million for suicide prevention outreach for veterans. Again, whether it is this or the Energy and Water bill—and I see the two leaders over here, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations— these are monies that will be helpful to the San Antonio area for flood mitigation or even for Corpus Christi to improve the channel project that will make sure that they will be able to handle the capacity to export petroleum products, which is a $13 million increase. Again, I want to say thank you to everybody working together in a bipartisan way. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ). Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, since coming to Congress, I have made it a priority to ensure that our men and women in uniform are prepared for success once their military service ends. The members of our Armed Forces serve and sacrifice for this Nation. We have a moral obligation to help them thrive when they transition to the civilian world. That is why I am so pleased the final version of this bill includes the bipartisan amendment I coauthored to increase funding for the Wounded Warrior Program. This initiative places disabled veterans in paid, 2year fellowships in House offices, providing them with potentially lifechanging opportunities for professional and personal growth. It also enables Members of Congress to better serve the American people, because veterans can use the unique skills they gain in the military to improve public policy and help constituents. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. In an era of partisanship, bipartisan legislation like this bill is sorely needed. A little over a year ago, Houston was devastated by Hurricane Harvey. Recovering from a storm of that magnitude doesn’t happen in a single year. The Houston ship channel is still in need of dredging just to return to the authorized depth that we were at before the storm hit. That is why bills like this one are so important. In this legislation, the Army Corps of Engineers will receive just under $7 billion, $171.5 million above the 2018 enacted level. The Army Corps works hand in hand with local organizations like the Port of Houston and Harris County Flood Control in our district to repair damage from previous storms and mitigate future risk. It is essential that we fund the corps at an adequate level that ensures that we are constructing projects that limit future damage, not just repair the damage already there. I am pleased to see that funding levels have increased in this year’s bill, but more needs to be done. This issue is not a partisan one and affects districts far and wide. I am also pleased to see that the harbor maintenance trust fund will receive $1.55 billion, $149 million over the 2018 allocation and $584 million above the request. Ports are the economic drivers are our country. At the Port of Houston, we had drafting restrictions that affected safety and commerce for months because of Hurricane Harvey. While I am pleased that we are increasing the allocated money this year, there is still an injustice that needs to be corrected with the harbor maintenance trust fund. Around $1.8 billion in harbor maintenance tax is collected every year through port user fees. When Congress enacted this fund, it intended to use the revenue to ensure that no port would be in need of dredging and that the people who use the port have a hand in funding the maintenance. It is essential that, in future years, Congress rectifies this issue and ensures that all money collected from usage of our ports goes directly to funding their maintenance, generating further economic activity. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act.

While there is work still to be done, this bill moves the ball forward and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I would like to thank Mrs. LOWEY for our close working relationship of well over 24 years. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the ranking members who put this package together here, the remarkable men and women who make up our professional staff on the Appropriations Committee, and our personal staff who dedicated most of their August, part of July, and certainly this part of September to doing the work of 
the people. I am enormously grateful to all of them for their hard work and their dedication. Mr. Speaker, I salute my colleague, Mrs. LOWEY , and all members and staff for their work. Particularly, I’d like to thank: Nancy Fox, Maureen Holohan, Shannon O’Keefe, Jason Gray, Marta Hernandez, Tammy Hughes, Rachel Kahler, Parker Van de Water, and Tom Doelp in the Front Office; Angie Giancarlo, Loraine Heckenberg, Perry Yates, and Amy Murphy on the Energy and Water Subcommittee; Sue Quantius; Sarah Young; and Kiya Batmanglidj from the MilCon/ VA Subcommittee; Jenny Panone and Tim Monahan from the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank my friend, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN . It has been far too long since multiple spending bills were enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year. It is a testament to the chairman’s leadership that we are set to clear three today, and I hope we send at least one more package to the President before the end of the month. Additionally, I would like to thank the staff for their tireless efforts, particularly Adam Berg, Jaime Shimek, Matt Washington, and the majority staff, including clerks Jenny Panone, Sue Quantius, and Angie Giancarlo Clark. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today, I voted in support of the Conference Report for H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2019. The legislation includes several provisions that I strongly support, including nearly $7 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers. Specifically, this legislation provides $1.55 billion, $149 million above the 2018 enacted level, to Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund projects to ensure that critical harbor and port projects receive the funding they need. It also includes $86.5 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, including $8.6 billion for mental health, $348 million for opioid treatment and prevention, and $206 million for suicide prevention programs. Despite funding these vital programs, I have concerns with a number of provisions included in the Conference Report. This legislation authorizes more than $97 billion, including $921 million to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, an account which is not counted in the budget and is not paid for. It adds to the deficit and is used as a slush fund by the Pentagon. Unlike every other federal agency, the Department of Defense (DOD) has yet to complete a financial audit; taxpayers deserve to know how the biggest bureaucracy in the federal government spends their money. Additionally, the bill prohibits the closing of Guantanamo Bay, which costs more than $100 million each year to house 41 prisoners and has been used as a top recruiting tool by terrorists. The bottom line is that the prison has been a black eye for the United States, has eroded relationships with our allies, undermined U.S. missions abroad, and put U.S. citizens and our troops at risk of retaliation. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for funding appropriated to the Office of Compliance contained within the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 5895. This important funding will support efforts to the ongoing reform of the Congressional Accountability Act to better enable legislative branch offices and agencies to receive proper training regarding workplace conduct. I strongly oppose slush fund settlements being paid out with taxpayer dollars, and I am pleased that no funding contained in this bill will go towards money for settlements. I appreciate the work of the Conference Committee in getting this critical funding included in this appropriations package. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1059, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the conference report. Pursuant to clause 10 of rule XX, the yeas and nays are ordered. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on adoption of the conference report will be followed by a 5minute vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, if ordered.

SECTION 1. HAROLD D. MCCRAW, SR., POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
Mr. D ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 606, a bill to designate the United States Post Office at 1025 Nevin Avenue in Richmond, California as the ‘‘Harold D. McCraw, Sr., Post Office Building.’’ Harold D. McCraw, Sr. began working for the Richmond Post Office in 1956 as a Career Substitute Carrier, and worked in various supervisory positions during his tenure of more than 45 years. From the time of his appointment as Officer inCharge of Richmond in August of 1973, Harold was active in the National Association of Postmasters of the United States (NAPUS). He began with the East Bay Chapter and served in the state chapter as Area Director, Chapter Secretary Chapter President, and Chairman of the 1989 National Convention held in San Francisco. Harold served NAPUS at the national level as Western Region Liaison Officer, EEO Committee Chairman, Advisory Board Member, and Postmasters Representative. In January 1988, assumed the office of National Vice President for Area 22. Harold also served as the Editor of the state publication, The California Postmaster, and of the national publication, Postmasters Gazette. In addition to serving the community in his job as Richmond Postmaster, Mr. McCraw also served on various boards and commissions. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Greater Richmond Community Social Services Corp., where he facilitated the development of a childcare facility that has expanded to five locations and cares for hundreds of children. Harold also helped bring about great change in the Richmond area through his service a member of the Richmond Management Service Corp and the Greater Richmond Housing Corp., which established housing projects and expanded retail space for small businesses in the area. The post office on Nevin Avenue has operated as Richmond’s main post office since 1938. The building is located in the heart of downtown and is a driver of the city’s economy. During World War II it served as an air raid shelter, and to this day remains a landmark and meeting point for community residents. It is also a classic example of Art Deco architecture that is an essential piece of Richmond history and culture. I am honored to name the post office in Richmond, California after Harold, a man who dedicated his life to the United States Post Office and the Richmond Committee. I would like to thank Chairman GOWDY and Ranking Member CUMMINGS for their support of this legislation. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
SGT. MAJ. WARDELL B. TURNER POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 4913) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 816 East Salisbury Parkway in Salisbury, Maryland, as the ‘‘Sgt. Maj. Wardell B. Turner Post Office Building’’, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4913 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SGT. MAJ. WARDELL B. TURNER POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, today the House will pass H.R. 4913, renaming the Salisbury, Maryland Post Office, the ‘‘Sgt. Maj. Wardell B. Turner Post Office Building’’ In honor of Sgt. Maj. Wardell Turner who was killed in action in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, this legislation honors the memory of a fellow serviceman, devoted husband, loving father and valorous soldier. It is my sincere hope that the designation of this post office in Sergeant Turner’s name will help our community on the Eastern Shore, and our country, celebrate and remember the legacy of service and sacrifice left behind by this true American hero. Sergeant Turner was a local legend on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. He graduated from Bennett High School in Salisbury, Maryland in 1984 where he was a standout fullback and middle linebacker. He helped lead the Bennett High School Clippers to backtoback undefeated seasons and state titles in 1982 and 1983. His leadership and ability earned him an athletic scholarship from Towson University. He was a fouryear letter winner and in 1989, graduated with a bachelor’s degree in management. Years later, in 2011, he would earn his master’s degree in criminal justice from Central Missouri State University. In 1991 he married his wife, Katherine, whom he met at a New Year’s Eve dance on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. In 1993, looking for an opportunity to serve, he enlisted in the Army. According to those closest to him, the Army was more than just a career, it was a calling. 
His military career took him across the United States and to bases in Germany and South Korea. While in Germany, Wardell Turner was recognized for saving a young woman’s life as she attempted to jump off a bridge. He was later deployed to Bosnia in the 1990’s and then to Iraq in 2003. He served in military police units beginning in 1993, most recently with the 720th Police Battalion based at Fort Hood, Texas. Earning the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and other Meritorious Service Medals along the way, he steadily climbed the enlisted ranks and was promoted to Sgt. Maj. in 2013. Sgt. Maj. Turner was assigned to the headquarters of the U.S. Army Garrison at Fort Drum in New York when he was sent to Afghanistan in July of 2014 during Operation Enduring Freedom. There he served as the senior enlisted advisor for the Combined Security Transition CommandAfghanistan in Kabul whose primary mission was the training of Afghan security forces. Sgt. Maj. Turner had planned for this to be his last deployment, hoping to retire in a year or so and spend more time with his family. Those that knew him described him as highly organized and a devoted family man. Prior to his death, just before Thanksgiving, he had found time to gather and ship Christmas gifts to his family back home. According to his wife, Katherine, despite his being unable to be home for the holidays, these gifts, and the effort he made to make sure they arrived on time, highlighted just how much his family meant to him, and him to them. Sergeant Turner was killed on November, 24, 2014, when his convoy was hit by an IED while on patrol in Eastern Kabul. Sergeant Turner’s son, Devin Turner, who was also enlisted in the Army and was deployed to Afghanistan at the time, planned to share Thanksgiving with his father. Tragically, he was informed a few days before the holiday that his father had been killed. Specialist Turner escorted his father’s casket home. After his father’s funeral, Specialist Turner, despite his loss, returned to Afghanistan to finish his tour. According to Devin, his father would have supported his decision to return to duty and didn’t believe in leaving your business unfinished. Sgt. Maj. Turner was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery in January of 2015. Members of his family say that they found peace in his sacrifice knowing he died doing what he loved . . . serving his country. Sgt. Maj. Wardell Turner has left a lasting legacy in our community. In 2016 Towson University created the ‘‘Wardell Turner Scholarship’’ to be awarded annually to a defensive back on the football team that is in good academic standing and demonstrates the qualities and attributes exemplified by Mr. Turner. Those enumerated qualities include leadership, selfless service, and commitment. Last year, friends, family and high school teammates gathered at the Wicomico Presbyterian Church to retire his Bennett High School jersey and to celebrate his life and his military service. During the ceremony, Mayor Jake Day of Salisbury, Maryland proclaimed October 28, 2017, as ‘‘Sgt. Maj, Wardell Turner Day’’. His legacy survives and continues with his five children, Shayla, Quinton, Devin, Wardell II, Xavier, several grandchildren, and his devoted wife, Katherine. Mr. Speaker, Sgt. Maj. Wardell Turner is a true American hero. His life of courage and service provides an example for us all. It is my pleasure to offer this bill to rename the Salisbury post office the Sgt. Maj. Wardell B. Turner Post Office building. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that honors one of the Eastern Shore’s favorite sons. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

BILL HARRIS POST OFFICE Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 5868) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 530 Claremont Avenue in Ashland, Ohio, as the ‘‘Bill Harris Post Office’’, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.

H.R. 5868 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer legislation to honor a good man, a faithful public servant, a veteran, and a friend to the people of the great state of Ohio by renaming the Post Office in Ashland, Ohio after former Ohio Senate President, Bill Harris. Bill served our nation as a United States Marine for 23 years. He completed tours of duty in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. His actions led to him being awarded the Bronze Star twice and the Vietnam Medal of Honor. He rose to the rank of Major and retired in 1977. Shortly thereafter, Bill found himself moving to Ashland, Ohio and opening a car dealership. It is still run by the Harris family. Bill was an active member of his community, serving as chairman of the Ashland Area Chamber of Commerce and was a member of the Board for the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University. I got to know Bill when we served in the Ohio legislature together. While he was in the Senate, I served in the House. Bill was Ohio Senate President when he led them to enact major reforms to Ohio’s tax code. He also had a passion for making Ohio’s higher education system better and more affordable. But I also got to know Bill on a personal level. After Bill broke his leg slipping on ice in 2009, he was unable to drive. Since I lived the closest to him, I drove him down to Columbus while he was recovering. We spent many hours talking, sometimes about politics and state government, but mostly about family and life. He told me stories and imparted his wisdom on those drives from Ashland to Columbus and back. Bill Harris dedicated his life to his family and friends, his community and country. I offer this legislation as a way to honor Bill’s legacy and recognize his achievements. I ask for my colleagues’ support of this bill to rename the Post Office in Bill’s hometown of Ashland after him as thanks for his commitment to Ashland, the State of Ohio, and to America. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
LOGAN S. PALMER POST OFFICE Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 5935) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1355 North Meridian Road in Harristown, Illinois, as the ‘‘Logan S. Palmer Post Office’’, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SERGEANT DONALD BURGETT POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 6020) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 325 South Michigan Avenue in Howell, Michigan, as the ‘‘Sergeant Donald Burgett Post Office Building’’, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6020 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of my legislation, H R. 6020, a bill to rename the Howell Post Office after a local, and really a national, hero: Sergeant Donald Burgett. Mr. Donald Burgett was born in Detroit, Michigan on April 25, 1925. On his 18th birthday he followed in his brother’s footsteps and joined the Army. He joined the newly formed paratroop company and became a member of the famous 101st Airborne. Assigned to A Company, he fought in battles throughout the European Theatre. His story is quite simply amazing. He dropped over 12 miles away from his drop zone at just after one in the morning. He fought in the battle at Ravenoville in a little village along the coast of Normandy, where he was among the group of Americans that liberated the first village in Europe—and this was all before sunrise that day. From there, he fought in battles all down the coastline, being attacked by the Germans at every turn and even being attacked by Russian cavalry at one point on his way to Carentan where he was wounded twice in action. After surviving Normandy, Mr. Burgett went on to fight in Operation MarketGraden in Holland and survive the bitterly cold siege of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge. Sergeant Burgett returned to the States on January 1, 1946—at the age of just 20 years old. After the war, Sergeant Burgett picked up flying, became a pilot and visited all the states in his own plane. He married his wife in 1953, and they had 5 children which they raised in Howell, MI. He was a very active member of his community, including extensive service with the VFW, American Legion, and Disabled American Veterans. He authored four books which gave firsthand accounts of the paratroopers’ experience in WWII. The first of that series was ‘‘Currahee!: A Screaming Eagle at Normandy’’, which was endorsed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He also wrote ‘‘The Road to Arnhem: A Screaming Eagle in Holland’’, ‘‘Seven Roads to Hell: A Screaming Eagle at Bastogne’’, and ‘‘Beyond the Rhine: A Screaming Eagle in Germany’’. Mr. Burgett passed away on March 23, 2017, at the age of 91. As a lifelong Michigander, Mr. Burgett was truly a member of the ‘‘Greatest Generation’’ and he spent a great deal of time making sure the efforts of his comrades would be known and remembered. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring his life and his service to the country by making sure his name and legacy lives on in his community. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
COLONEL ALFRED ASCH POST OFFICE Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 6116) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 362 North Ross Street in Beaverton, Michigan, as the ‘‘Colonel Alfred Asch Post Office’’, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows:

The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. JUDGE RUSSELL B. SUGARMON POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 5349) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1320 Autumn Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, as the ‘‘Judge Russell B. Sugarmon Post Office Building’’, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SECTION 1. JUDGE RUSSELL B. SUGARMON POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: 
SECTION 1. JUDGE RUSSELL B. SUGARMON POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
Mr. RUSSELL (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. The amendment was agreed to. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this body’s action to pass HR. 5439, a bill I introduced to designate the U.S. Postal Office at 1320 Autumn Ave. Memphis, Tennessee as the ‘‘Judge Russell B. Sugarmon Post Office.’’ I want to thank my colleagues from the Tennessee House delegation, Representatives ROE, D UNCAN , F LEISCHMANN , D ESJARLAIS , COOPER , BLACK , BLACKBURN , and K USTOFF , all of whom cosponsored this legislation honoring a great American. I also want to thank Chairman GOWDY and Ranking Member C UMMINGS  for reporting this bill favorably out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1929, Judge Russell B. Sugarmon is heralded for his contributions to the City of Memphis and his work to reverse the tide of racism in Tennessee, paving the way for future black leaders in the area and inspiring their efforts to increase their representation in elected, Democratic bodies. Working alongside notable Memphis pioneers and leaders in the fight for racial justice and equality, Judge Sugarmon was instrumental in using the courts to desegregate public transportation, restaurants and public facilities and the desegregation of Memphis public schools. As a trailblazer for AfricanAmericans in public office and a leader in the Civil Rights Movement, it is only fitting that we enshrine our recognition of Judge Sugarmon’s contributions to the City of Memphis and the African American community by naming the 1320 Autumn Ave. Post Office in Memphis, Tennessee in honor of his legacy. I thank my colleagues in the House for voting to pass this measure honoring Judge Russell B. Sugarmon, an exemplary American and titan of his time. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly take up this bill and send the legislation to the President’s desk. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1325 Autumn Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, as the ‘Judge Russell B. Sugarmon Post Office Building’.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF KENNETH PALMER (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, this September marks Kenneth Palmer’s 60th anniversary as a member of the Mohawk Fire Department. A courageous fighter, a teacher, and a survivor of quadruple bypass surgery, Ken has inspired our community through his deep passion for service. Ken has left his mark on firefighters and first responders in Herkimer County through his leadership as the Mohawk Fire Chief, Department Training Officer, president and vice president of the Herkimer County Fire Chiefs Association, Chaplain for the Mohawk and Newport Fire Departments, and Chief Fire Chaplain for New York State. Now, even at the age of 80, Ken remains ready for the fire alarm to sound. But his journey hasn’t always been easy. On February 25, 2000, Ken underwent successful quadruple bypass surgery. Despite the hardships he endured during this stressful time, Ken had a strong support system. He often credits his beautiful wife, Sharon, and so many family members and friends praying for him from New York to California during his enduring struggle. Now, as a Red Cap Ambassador for the American Heart Association, Ken provides compassionate support to others suffering from heart disease and heartrelated illnesses. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize a dear friend, Kenneth Palmer, such a strong force for good, who has risked so much to protect our families. I ask all my colleagues here today to join our community in extending our gratitude to Kenneth Palmer for his incredible 60 years of service. f 
INDICTMENT OF NORTH KOREAN HACKER PARK JIN HYOK (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Justice Department unveiled the latest in a string of criminal complaints against America’s cyber adversaries. The extremely detailed document lays out a damning case against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean hacker, and the regime that supports him. From the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack to WannaCry to attempts to undermine the global financial system, the North Korean regime is a destabilizing presence in cyberspace. I commend the members of the law enforcement community who are working this case. Mr. Speaker, cyberspace is often thought of as a domain where bad actors can act with impunity. This indictment shows that this is not the case. America is getting more and more sophisticated at being able to track down and unveil and unmask these cyber bad actors. 
To those who would attempt to target our networks and systems, I have a message for you: We will find you. Malign activity in cyberspace that targets critical infrastructure or causes immense property damage is not the behavior of responsible nations, and we will not tolerate it. 
b1615 THE ONEMINUTE STORY OF A ONEYEAROLD (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is the 1minute story of Kelly Dore. Kelly’s biological father began trafficking her for sex in the first year of her life. The evildoer continued to do so for 14 years. Kelly spent her childhood in a living hell most of us cannot even contemplate. Her kindergarten memories are not of playtime and story time; instead, they consisted of hiding in the bathroom because the repeated trauma caused uncontrollable bleeding. The evildoer threatened to kill Kelly’s mother if Kelly ever told. At 14 years, Kelly liberated herself from this depravity by testifying against her father in a courtroom. Miraculously, she not only survived the ordeal, but she became an advocate. Today, Kelly works to strengthen trafficking laws, giving an inspirational voice for victims of human trafficking like her. No child should ever have to go through what Kelly went through. Congress must join Kelly in the fight against the buying and selling of our children on the marketplace of sex trafficking. And that is just the way it is. 
SYRIA (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago, President Trump and Vice President PENCE delivered solemn speeches about the attacks on 9/11, talking about how much they care about the victims of alQaida’s attack on our country, but they are now standing up to protect the 20,000 to 40,000 alQaida and other jihadist forces in Syria, threatening Russia, Syria, and Iran with military force if they dare attack these terrorists. This is a betrayal of the American people, especially the victims of al Qaida’s attack on 9/11 and their families, first responders, and to my brothers and sisters in uniform who have been killed or wounded in action and their families. For the President, who is Commander in Chief, to act as the protective big brother of alQaida and other jihadists must be condemned by every Member of Congress. HEALTHSOUTH’S 35TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize HealthSouth Nittany Valley Rehabilitation Hospital on 35 years of excellence in rehabilitation care. HealthSouth is a rehabilitation hospital in Pleasant Gap, Pennsylvania, that offers comprehensive inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services designed to return patients to leading active and independent lives. Mr. Speaker, I know firsthand the dedicated work these highly skilled professionals perform each day at HealthSouth. Before coming to Congress, I worked for 30 years as a therapist, a rehabilitation services director, and a licensed nursing home administrator. There is no greater joy than to see your patients make progress after a debilitating event such as a stroke, a spinal cord injury, a brain injury, or a motor vehicle accident. HealthSouth is fortunate to be led by Chief Executive Officer Susan Hartman, a longtime rehabilitation professional who joined HealthSouth in 1994 and was named CEO in 2005. I congratulate CEO Hartman and the entire staff at HealthSouth on 35 years of dedicated service to the community. They are committed to providing patients with comfort, professionalism, and respect throughout their rehabilitation experience, and we are grateful for their high level of care. f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to act to reauthorize and extend the Violence Against Women Act. Enacted back in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has provided invaluable support and resources to women impacted by domestic violence across Minnesota and across our country. It has funded hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to groups like the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault, and Cornerstone Advocacy Services, which provides counseling and therapy services to victims. The Violence Against Women Act, Mr. Speaker, is critical to preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and helping victims get the treatment and justice they deserve. I have authored a provision that has been included in past reauthorizations. For decades the Violence Against Women Act has been reauthorized with strong bipartisan support, but it expires at the end of this month, and I urge my colleagues in joining me in calling for its extension, because victims of domestic violence are counting on it. f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 years, members of the Judiciary Committee and my committee, the Criminal Justice Subcommittee, which I serve as the ranking member, have worked extensively with groups all over the Nation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and we have done so in a bipartisan and nonpartisan manner. The bill is written. It was introduced on July—just a month ago—26, 2018. Victims are waiting for the reauthorization that will improve the Violence Against Women Act. In fact, law enforcement are waiting, victims are waiting, those who have experienced sexual assault and sexual harassment. And I would just tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, Republican leadership needs to put that bill on the floor of the House and put it on the floor now. Again, this is not a partisan bill. It has been crafted and supported by faith organizations and advocacy groups for women and victims. It is supported by law enforcement. So, Mr. Speaker, we can do our job and we should do our job. When we come back from our recess that we work in our districts, let us put on the floor the Violence Against Women Act and let’s vote for it now. 
CONDEMNING IRAN’S PERSECUTION OF MEMBERS OF THE BAHA’I FAITH (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 274, which was introduced by my colleague, Ms. ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN . This legislation condemns the government of Iran’s statesponsored persecution of its Baha’i minority and its continued violation of international covenants on human rights. Following the Islamic revolution of Iran in 1979, members of the Baha’i Faith, the largest nonMuslim religious minority in the country, have been subjected to relentless persecution. In Iran, no rights or protections are accorded to those who are adherents of religions not recognized under the Iranian constitution. The Iranian government refuses to recognize the Baha’i Faith as a religion and justifies persecution of the Baha’i under this pretext. Iran has criminalized ordinary Baha’i religious practices of worship, religious training, and fellowship. It has also denied Baha’i people government pension 
benefits, higher education, business licenses in about 2 dozen fields, and even the right of selfdefense. Mr. Speaker, I call on the House to pass H.R. 274 to show that this chamber and our Nation support the Baha’i people and stand with them in the face of Iran’s tyranny. 
PROSTATE CANCER DISPARITY (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, this morning I met with the Prostate Health Education Network and leaders from across the country who are on the frontlines of the fight against prostate cancer. It is critical for African American men and their families that leaders like us raise awareness and funding to end the racial disparity in prostate cancer research. African American men are more likely to get prostate cancer, are diagnosed at more advanced stages, and are twice as likely to die as our Caucasian counterparts. Fighting cancer requires sustained efforts at all levels to raise awareness to ensure individuals and their families have quality and affordable access to screening and treatment. It is critical that Congress continues putting resources toward ending racial disparity in prostate cancer and healthcare more generally. 
THANKING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FOR EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERN (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the public often has the impression that we in Congress are not caring people who work together on issues. I want to say to the American people that in the last few days, you could not find a group of people more concerned about their fellow Members than we have here. We know this hurricane is hitting North Carolina, it is likely to hit South Carolina and possibly Georgia, and I want people to know how much I appreciate Members on both sides of the aisle who have come up to me to ask what impact this is going to have on me, on my district, on the people of my district, and on North Carolina in general. It is very heartwarming to have those concerns expressed. People have said, ‘‘We are praying for you.’’ I know that is the case throughout the country, but I want to particularly say to all of my colleagues—I thanked them all personally—but to all of my colleagues, those who haven’t spoken to me but have spoken to other Members, thank you very much for your concerns and prayers. I certainly will pass those along to my constituents, but I think it is important that people know we care a great deal about each other and we express that to each other. f 
SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MAST). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our country’s veterans, who make great sacrifices to keep America safe. When they return home from service, it is our responsibility to ensure they receive the care and support of a grateful Nation. For far too many veterans, that responsibility is not fulfilled. The government’s failure has tragic consequences for those struggling with mental health illnesses. September is Suicide Prevention Month. Americans across the country take time to raise awareness about the tragedy of suicide. We lose an estimated 20 veterans to suicide each day, and that is unacceptable. Every year since I have been in Congress, we have brought together Republicans and Democrats to draw attention to veteran suicide and send a clear message that this epidemic must end. Honoring our commitment to veterans is not a partisan issue. We know the only way to achieve real, lasting change for our Nation’s bravest men and women is to bring both parties together to solve this problem. Today, Members from both sides of the aisle have joined me to bring awareness to veteran suicide and we are working together to find solutions. I know we can make bipartisan progress, because we have done it before. We have shown it is possible for both parties to work together to improve veterans’ mental healthcare. After hearing the tragic story of a young Arizona veteran who lost his life to suicide in 2013, my team worked across the aisle to pass a bill that improved lifesaving VA mental health services for veterans with classified experience. It took 3 years of hard work, but our bill is now law, and it helps veterans successfully transition to civilian life. It is important progress, but there is still so much work left to do. We must serve our bravest men and women, just as they have served us. We challenge the VA, the Department of Defense, and our fellow lawmakers to join us in confronting the tragedy of veteran suicide. We must do more to honor our commitment to American’s veterans. Today and every day, we stand with military families who have lost a loved one to the tragedy of suicide, and we say to you, your family’s sacrifice will not be forgotten. We will not stop until every veteran receives the care that he or she needs. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ), my friend and colleague, and I am grateful to be joined this afternoon in this Special Order for his comments. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak of a solemn topic, one of utmost importance for sure, and I want to thank my colleague and my friend, KYRSTEN SINEMA from Arizona, and for all the work that she is doing for the veterans’ community and for hosting this Special Order. Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s veterans are our finest citizens, to whom we owe the most. Their sacrifice in defense of freedom allows us to stand here today in this chamber, a testament to our values and a symbol of hope. All too often, we see our Nation’s veterans struggle upon their return home. Issues with depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder serve as constant reminders of the price they paid to protect our way of life. b1630 Tragically, we have seen a rising percentage of these heroes resorting to taking their own lives. This is beyond unacceptable and statistics paint a grim picture of this epidemic. Between 2005 and 2015, Mr. Speaker, suicide rates for all veterans increased by 25 percent—25 percent between 2005 and 2015. Additionally, veterans account for nearly 15 percent of suicides in U.S. adults. Mr. Speaker, we can do better, and we must do better. I am proud to stand here today with my colleagues in solidarity against veteran suicide. I am thankful for the establishment of the third Veterans Crisis Line call center to provide guidance, support, and critical resources to those in need. While steps are being taken to prevent veteran suicide, we still have a long way to go because one hero’s death is one too many. As Congresswoman KYRSTEN SINEMA  had pointed out, Mr. Speaker, September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, but this issue will continue to transcend any time frame. For those who sacrificed for us, we owe them and will continue to fight to eradicate this public health crisis of veteran suicide. Mr. Speaker, I want to, once again, thank Congresswoman SINEMA for hosting this Special Order. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, for many veterans, the return to civilian life can feel overwhelming. Ensuring enough community support and mental health resources are available is essential. We recently heard from Andrew, who lives in Chandler, Arizona. He joined the Marine Corps at 17 years old when he said he was ‘‘full of motivation and excitement’’ to serve. ‘‘I wanted to do my part to protect America,’’ Andrew said. As an antitank assaultman, Andrew fought beside incredible marines in Iraq, and when he finally returned 
home, he said he returned with memories of death. Andrew leaned on loved ones and his faith to pull him out of his darkness. Ever since, he has continued his healing journey by serving his fellow veterans. He presses forward with the values instilled on him by the Marine Corps: honor, courage, and commitment. Responsibility to care for our veterans belongs to all of us. That is why we are working with those who interact with veterans each and every day: letter carriers, librarians, grocery store clerks, and academic advisers. We are giving community members the tools they need to support veterans every day right where they live and work. We are also working to increase the number of peer supports available to veterans. There are veterans like Andrew who used their experiences, struggles, and accomplishments to help fellow veterans successfully navigate the transition to civilian live. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have a colleague and friend of mine joining us in this Special Order this evening. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ), my friend. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for yielding and for hosting this Special Order on this important issue. Every single day, we ask the men and women who serve our Nation in uniform to make incredible sacrifices on behalf of our Nation, and they never fail to deliver for us. These brave Americans and their families know the true meaning of service, but that service often comes at a price. Our men and women in uniform, our veterans, cannot be cast aside once they have returned home. The prevalence of suicide among servicemembers and veterans is a stain on our collective conscience. Servicemembers throughout the history of our country have had harrowing experiences in their service to defend this country and protect our way of life. But it has only been recently that the scope of the trauma of war has been truly understood. Since the time of Abraham Lincoln, we, as a country, have made a solemn vow to care for those who have borne the battle, a vow that has made caring for veterans one of the few bipartisan issues in this era of divisiveness in Washington. Today, we must ensure that our solemn promise to veterans extends to effective mental healthcare. No veteran should ever have to wait for this type of care, which can be just as crucial for recovery as physical health services. My father, Malcolm McLane, flew fighter planes during World War II. He was shot down in the Battle of the Bulge, and spent 6 months in a German POW camp. When I was a child, he rarely spoke about his experiences during the war, but now, in hindsight, I believe that he was experiencing what we now know to be PTSD. We understand so much more today about the brain and the impact of trauma that so many of our servicemembers endure, and it is critical that the VA and our society use that knowledge to improve care for veterans when they return home. We must ensure that the unseen wounds of war receive the attention they deserve. Many of us today voted to fund veterans’ mental health and suicide prevention programs. And while it is commendable that Congress is taking important steps to address this issue, much more needs to be done to ensure that no veteran is left behind. As a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I fight for the men and women who fight for us. During National Suicide Awareness Prevention Month, we should all pledge to work together to ensure that no veteran ever has trouble accessing the mental health services that he or she needs and deserves. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona, KYRSTEN  SINEMA , for her commitment to this issue. She was very effective in the testimony that she brought to the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and I appreciate her perseverance. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST), my friend and colleague. I thank the Congressman so much for the work that he has done to join us today. I appreciate it. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I guess I found in my time that suicide is an epidemic of purpose, and worth, and value. I come to this line of thought because I have had countless veterans call me; reach out to my office; find me on Facebook; find me on some other form of social media; had a member of their family call my office or reach out, a mother, or a spouse, and talk about the fact that their veteran wants to take their life. And in seeing that play out time and time again, I realize each and every time that somebody is out there searching for their value in their life. They are searching for where is their value? Where is their worth to the rest of the world? And for me, that helps me to recognize that this can be prevented. I think veterans face this challenge in a unique way and in an elevated way, not because the challenge of war or recovering from injury is something that cannot be overcome. I think most of us end up finding in our lives that when we have overcome something incredibly difficult, those are the most memorable and purposeful moments of our life. No person, veteran included, should have to believe that their greatest contribution to the world, or to their Nation, or to their family, or their community is something that is behind them. That is something that is especially difficult for a veteran to overcome because their worth, and their value, and their work every single day was tied directly to serving all of those things at the highest possible level, serving their brothers and their sisters to their left and right, knowing that on any given day, they might have the opportunity to save a life, to save the life of one of their closest friends that they could ever have in life, a friend that would be willing to do absolutely everything for them, to include sacrificing their own life for that friend of them. It is hard to replicate, maybe impossible to replicate, that purpose, and that worth, and that value. And I believe that it is in that that we find such a challenge to overcome suicide with our veterans because of everything that they have already given this country, and the drive, and the determination, and the will, and the intestinal fortitude inside of our veterans to want to go out there and find the next greatest thing in life, the next greatest way to serve. That is the difficult challenge that we find ourselves trying to overcome. In having so many veterans reach out to me, I have learned this about veteran suicide. Each of them who were prevented from taking their life have said that there was nothing I could do, if somebody else didn’t reach out to them. Because I could have not known anybody else that they could have told, that they didn’t tell, they wouldn’t have known. It is in that that I believe it is important that we as veterans make a commitment to one another about being there for one another; about the fact that we had an oath that we never leave a fallen comrade. We always used to say, we always place the mission first, and that mission doesn’t end when we take off that uniform. That mission, that commitment to one another, has to continue. As veterans, we make it a point to put the most important things that we care about in word, in verse, things that we memorize. Whether it is the Soldier’s Creed, or the Ranger Creed, or the Special Forces Creed, or some other ethos that we recognize as part of our service. We put it in words and we speak about it, and we say it time, and time, and time again. And that is why I believe that it is important that we as veterans make known in word our commitment to one another; that we are never going to let one of our brothers or sisters be left behind; that our commitment to one another never ends; that we are never going to allow one of them to bring harm to themselves; that our love for each other never ends. That willingness of what we would go out there and do for one another on the battlefield has no time limit on it, has no fuse. It will never be a wick that burns down. That has to be our commitment to one another, to demonstrate that kind of love and caring for each other as veterans. It is the only solution that I have been able to 
find in my life toward helping with this one veteran, one person at a time, one commitment at a time, a commitment that never ends, and a commitment that has no limits to it. I believe all of our veterans want that and are capable of that, and I am proud of every one of them for that commitment that I know they have inside of them. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ) for holding this Special Order. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to thank my colleague and friend, Congressman MAST. While he spoke very eloquently about his fellow veterans, and commitment to service, and leaving no man behind, he is very humble, and didn’t share all of his own experiences. Congressman MASTserved as a staff sergeant in the United States Army and has earned a Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and many other awards for his bravery during battle. And when Congressman MASTjoined Congress, I will never forget the first time we had a few moments to spend together, and I asked him about his own experiences in the military and since then, and the change that happened in his life after he was injured in battle defending our country. I will never forget Congressman MAST’s response, which is one of such strength and character, and, I believe, provides such inspiration to other men and women in our country, both those in uniform and those who have returned to civilian life as veterans. I want to thank him for his service and for his incredible dedication to helping his fellow men and women who have returned home from battle as well. Earlier in our Special Order, I mentioned the story of a young veteran in my district. His name was Sergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran of two tours in Iraq. He served on Task Force Lightning, an intelligence unit. He ran over 400 combat missions as a machine gunner in the turret of a Humvee. Part of his role required him to interrogate dozens of terror suspects. His work was deemed classified. Like many veterans, Daniel was haunted by the war when he returned home. He suffered from flashbacks, nightmares, depression, and additional symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, made worse by a traumatic brain injury. Daniel needed help. He and his family asked for help, but, unfortunately, the VA enrolled Sergeant Somers in group therapy sessions, which he could not attend for fear of disclosing classified information. b1645 Despite requests for individualized counseling, or some other reasonable accommodation to allow Sergeant Somers to receive appropriate care for his PTSD, the VA delayed providing Sergeant Somers with support and appropriate care. Like many, Sergeant Somers’ isolation got worse when he transitioned to civilian life. He tried to provide for his family, but he was unable to work due to his disability. Sergeant Somers struggled with the VA bureaucracy. His disability appeal had been pending for more than 2 years in the system without resolution. Sergeant Somers did not get the help he needed in time. On June 10, 2013, Sergeant Somers wrote a letter to his family. I share a part of his letter every year here on the floor, in memory of Daniel’s pain and in love for his family. In this letter, Daniel said: ‘‘I am not getting better, I am not going to get better, and I will most certainly deteriorate further as time goes on.’’ He goes on to say: ‘‘I am left with basically nothing. Too trapped in a war to be at peace, too damaged to be at war. Abandoned by those who would take the easy route, and a liability to those who stick it out—and thus deserve better. So you see, not only am I better off dead, but the world is better without me in it. ‘‘This is what brought me to my actual final mission.’’ No one who returns home from serving our country should ever feel like he or she has nowhere to turn, which is why I am committed to continuing to work on both sides of the aisle to ensure that no veteran ever feels trapped like Sergeant Somers did and that all of our veterans have access to appropriate mental healthcare. But Sergeant Somers’ story is too familiar to many military families. His parents, Howard and Jean, were devastated by the loss of their son, but they bravely shared Sergeant Somers’ story and created a mission of their own. Their mission is to ensure that their son’s memory brought to light America’s deadliest war: the 20 veterans that we lose every day to suicide. Many of my colleagues here in Washington have met with Howard and Jean. They are working with Congress and the VA to share their experiences with the VA healthcare system and find ways to improve care for veterans and their families. We worked very closely with Howard and Jean to develop and sign into law the Sergeant Daniel Somers Classified Veterans Access to Care Act. This is a law that ensures that veterans like Daniel, who have had classified or sensitive experiences, can access appropriate mental health services at the VA. Our law directs the Secretary of the VA to establish standards and procedures to ensure that any veteran who participated in classified missions or served in a sensitive setting may access mental healthcare that fully accommodates his or her obligation to not improperly disclose classified information. The law also directs the Secretary to disseminate guidance to employees of the Veterans Health Administration, including mental health professionals, on standards and procedures about how to best engage veterans during the course of mental health treatment with respect to classified information. Finally, our law directs the Secretary to allow veterans with classified experiences to selfidentify, so they can quickly receive care in an appropriate setting. But that victory is just one small step forward. We still have so much work left to do. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining us this evening to talk about the scourge of veteran suicide. This is our sixth year of hosting this Special Order in a bipartisan way together. I look forward to the year when we do not need this Special Order because we have ended the crisis of veteran suicide in our country. Until such time, I pledge to continue working with my colleagues to not just tell the stories of veterans who are struggling, veterans who have made it, or veterans we have lost, but to celebrate our victory of overcoming this crisis and ending this scourge. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), my friend, who is going to share some of his thoughts and close out our Special Order hour. I thank Congressman HILLfor joining us this evening. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ), my good friend, for yielding. She and I have the pleasure of serving on the House Financial Services Committee together and cooperating on many legislative measures and regulatory measures that benefit our economy, so I thank her for that work. I greatly appreciate her stepping up and reaching out across the aisle on the subject of suicide, particularly during Suicide Prevention Month, and letting all of us have an opportunity to share our perspective on this national tragedy. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. There is an average of 123 suicides per day. What could be more tragic than that? Yet, I don’t see nearly the people on the floor tonight that there should be, because this affects all our districts so tragically. One in five are suffering with some form of mental illness in our country, a problem that has disrupted so many families, caused too much violence and pain, and caused far too many lives. Representative SINEMA and I talk about this every time the subject comes up. When I was a high school senior, I can’t remember a friend that was a victim of suicide. But, Mr. Speaker, my kids just turned 19 and 21, and within 4 or 5 years of their ages, I can think of six families who have lost a child to suicide—different reasons, same tragedy. So our families are hurting from the scourge of suicide. 
In Congress, this is an area where we work together, the 21st Century Cures Act, where we attacked the first comprehensive approach to mental illness treatment in decades, where we say we want people with mental illness and who need treatment to get it. We worked together most recently on the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act for American veterans, and the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act— small steps, but concrete steps that call attention to suicide, particularly in our veterans community. The VA is helping on this issue and marked Suicide Prevention Month with its Be There campaign. This campaign highlights the risk factors and warning signs for suicide, provides information about VA mental health and suicide prevention resources, and helps individuals and organizations start the conversation around veteran mental health in their communities. Our VA employees must have the necessary resources to offer guidance to veterans while providing essential suicide prevention services. This is a together thing. This is an ‘‘all of us in this together’’ thing. Mr. Speaker, I have a chair in my front office in my district office in Little Rock that was handpainted to raise money for suicide awareness and suicide prevention. On that chair, it says: ‘‘We Are The 22.’’ This is a nonprofit organization in my community started by veterans helping veterans, because it is not an ‘‘us and they’’ thing. It is an ‘‘us’’ thing. It is a ‘‘we’’ thing. We are all in this together. We are the 22, the number that we have as the estimate of veterans who are taking their own lives. So I want to echo the Speaker pro tempore this afternoon, a distinguished American and distinguished veteran and brave, heroic representative of our Armed Forces, our patriots, the people who defend our liberties, when he said we don’t leave people behind. We don’t leave a sailor, a marine, or a soldier on the battlefield. We bring them home. Just last week, we honored John McCain on the floor of this House. And SAMJOHNSON , leaving the House this year—Representative SCHWEIKERT was there—he was in the Hanoi Hilton with John McCain. We don’t leave a man or woman behind on the battlefield. But when they come home, we equally should not leave them behind. I really commend the Speaker’s comments that the mission is not over. All of us have that partnership and sense of duty to carry that mission forward on the home front when we are out of harm’s way and out of theater. To me, it is that buddy system that we all learn, whether it is in boot camp or swim team, you team up; you check in on each other; you don’t leave people alone. That is the secret, I think, to preventing suicide. I lost a good friend of mine, a fraternity brother, a partner in a law firm in Houston, Texas. He never once intimated to his wife, to his children, or to his law partners that anything was wrong, and they got the call that he had been found. Check in: How are you doing? So we are the 22. We are on the buddy system. We don’t leave our warriors behind. The mission continues here. All those things are true. I carry in my wallet, Mr. Speaker, the veterans crisis hotline as a reminder to me that we want our veterans to reach out if there is a moment of crisis. If somebody is watching this or hearing the words of brave BRIAN MAST, or the emotional content and leadership of Representative KYRSTEN SINEMA  from Arizona, and you are having that moment now as a veteran, I urge you to call 1–800–273–8255 for yourself, for a friend, for a neighbor. We, in Congress, are fighting to make sure that that veterans hotline is a value, that it is answered, and that we are part of that thin thread of connectivity between all of us that keeps us right on the moment. Mr. Speaker, I see my friend from Arizona is here. It was a pleasure to have both of my friends from Arizona talk about their senior Senator last week, John McCain, and what he meant to each of us and what he has meant to our country. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT ), my friend, now on the House Ways and Means Committee, formerly of the best committee in the House, the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HILLfor yielding. And to the gentlewoman from Arizona, I thank her for doing this every year. This is one of those moments where you are walking toward the microphone because we just got out of votes in Ways and Means, and you are sort of discussing in your head whether you ultimately tell the personal story. I have two I want to share. My reason for doing this is, if someone is watching, we have someone in our life, and you are having selfdestructive thoughts, please, please reach out, get the help, and understand the devastation that happens and the pain that happens when someone takes their life. My two stories. When I very first got elected in the PhoenixScottsdale area, one of the very first constituent meetings I had was with a mom. Her son had been part of the Phoenix VA. She always felt that the prescriptions he was given put him into an emotional spiral. They kept trying to get him mental health services. They felt all that he was receiving was more prescriptions and a future date for mental health services. And he took his life. That mother, the pain, the tears, the crushing blow, what the loss of her son’s life meant to that family. I believe now, a few years later, the Phoenix VA is better. They have learned a lot, they understand how to be almost a quick reaction force in helping an individual. But we need to make sure these things never happen again. Now for the personal one that I have never told in public. b1700 I was born in an unwed mothers’ home in L.A. I was adopted. It turns out the gentleman who adopted me had multiple sclerosis. But he was a veteran, and he was receiving his medical treatments from VA. This is a long, long time ago, but this is about the pain that comes when a veteran takes his or her life. Because of the pharmaceuticals he was given, the lack of emotional counseling, and the failure to properly diagnose his disease, he put himself in a car in a garage, turned on the motor, and took his life. That was my dad. Some time later, my mother remarried Mr. Schweikert. I got readopted, and I was blessed to grow up in a wonderful household that had brought me to Arizona. Many years later when I was a young adult, my mom sat me down and told me the story. You could tell there was still that burning hole in her heart of finding her husband, my dad, dead in that car, having taken his own life, believing it was the failure of the very services he was receiving from the VA. Now it is decades later, and I believe we have learned a lot. This body has tried as hard as it can to get their heads around: Are we allowing too many pharmaceuticals to be prescribed? Are we not providing emotional services? Do we need to put resources into having that communal gettogether, the quick reaction force? I believe it is getting better. But understand the pain that Mom shared with me when I was first elected about the loss of her son. Even these many, many years later, it is still part of our family’s legacy of that pain. If this body can do anything, if we can find ways to make that pain come to an end, then we will have done something very honorable and very powerful. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HILLfor yielding to me. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for participating, and I thank his colleague, Representative SINEMA , for her heartfelt tribute that she has carried on since she has been in the House to bring attention to suicide prevention. I also commend the House for the efforts that it has taken on mental health and on suicide prevention, particularly for our veterans. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF RON ROBINSON The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of one of Arkansas’ marketing and public relations geniuses and a dear friend, Mr. Ron Robinson, who recently passed away at the age of 75. Born and raised in my hometown of Little Rock, Ron had a natural talent for media and journalism at a very young age. As a teenager, he worked as a sports writer for the Arkansas Gazette and was paid $1 an hour. After graduating from the University of Arkansas with a degree in journalism, Ron joined the Air Force, serving as a public information officer. He quickly rose to the rank of captain and earned a Bronze Star for his service in Vietnam and the Air Force Commendation Medal in 1969 for his support of the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon. A year later, he joined Cranford Johnson Robinson Woods, CJRW, as director of public relations. He would eventually become chairman and CEO until his retirement in 1996. Ron received many awards for his contributions to Arkansas and the journalism industry. He was honored in 2005 as a distinguished alumnus of the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences and inducted into the Lemke Journalism Society Hall of Honor in 2016. Ron was a role model and friend for many across the State of Arkansas, and I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, his family, and his many, many mentees during his years of service. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVID W . MULLINS , JR. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today to honor the life of a longtime work colleague and friend, David W. Mullins Jr., who recently passed away at the age of 72. David had a remarkable career of public service, including working in both the Department of the Treasury and as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. It was a pleasure to work with him in Domestic Finance at the Department of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush. David’s journey began in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where his father was president of the University of Arkansas. David attended Fayetteville High School before graduating from Yale University with a degree in administrative sciences. He then pursued graduate work at MIT, and there he completed his Ph.D. in economics and finance. David’s public service began shortly after the stock market crash in 1987, and his expertise proved vital toward the rejuvenation of the economy and the resolution of the savings and loan crisis under the Reagan and Bush administrations. Mr. Speaker, he was a thoughtful leader, a friend to many, and I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and loved ones. HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MR . DON 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of one of Arkansas’ statewide leaders, Mr. Don Zimmerman, who recently passed away at the age of 75. Don worked as executive director for the Arkansas Municipal League for over four decades and was there at the time of his death. A graduate of the University of Arkansas with a degree in business administration, Don first joined the Arkansas Municipal League back in 1966 as a field representative before working his way up to the executive director position in 1974. Two years ago, he became the first State Municipal League employee to be recognized by the National League of Cities for 50 years of service. Don also served two terms on the board of directors of the National League of Cities. Mr. Speaker, he was a friend to many across our State of Arkansas, and I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and loved ones. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize one of Arkansas’ finest, Olan Wages, who recently died at the age of 95. A veteran of the Army, who served in World War II, Olan Wages was at the Battle of the Bulge. Mr. Wages’ story is one that makes all Arkansans proud. For his service, he was awarded two Purple Hearts with oakleaf cluster, four Bronze Stars, a Good Conduct Medal, a World War II Commemorative Medal, a Normandy Jubilee of Liberty Medal, and a French Legion of Honor Medal, among others. Mr. Wages is survived by his three loving daughters, Brenda, Marcia, and Kay. Mr. Speaker, Olan’s example is one all Americans and Arkansans can admire, and I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and loved ones. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the achievements of Kevontae Carter, a junior at Philander Smith College in my hometown of Little Rock. I am pleased to announce that the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities has named him an inaugural Competitiveness Scholar. Competitiveness Scholars are students who have exhibited exceptional academic achievement, engagement with their communities, and an entrepreneurial spirit. Kevontae, who is majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics, was personally nominated for this honor by Philander’s president, Dr. Roderick Smothers. A leader on campus, he serves as a student ambassador for the United Negro College Fund, of which Philander is the only member in the State of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I honor Kevontae’s commitment to excellence and commend him on being named to this distinguished fellowship. RECOGNIZING MS . ANNIE ABRAMS  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, it gives me a lot of pleasure today to recognize a dear friend and a civil rights icon from Arkansas, Ms. Annie Abrams, and wish her a very, very happy 87th birthday. Ms. Abrams has served her State and country tirelessly throughout her career, from her involvement in the desegregation of Central High School to her role with the Arkansas Teachers Association, including becoming the first African American PTA president at Central High. Born in Arkadelphia, Ms. Abrams moved to Little Rock at the age of 13 to pursue a better education, and she graduated from Dunbar High School and later Philander Smith College with a degree in special education. She continues to be involved in many local community service organizations, including the Little Rock Central High Integration 50th Anniversary Commission, a commissioner for the Fair Housing Commission, and treasurer of the Arkansas Democratic Black Caucus. As a local educator and civic and community leader, Ms. Abrams has enriched the lives of countless Arkansans and Americans. She is the busiest woman I know, particularly for someone on the cusp of an 87th birthday. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to our next opportunity to be together, and I thank her for her lifetime of service to our community. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, 61 years ago today, all eyes were on South Park Street that fronts the beautiful facade of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. Just days before, the Arkansas Governor, Orval Faubus, had called out the National Guard to prevent nine Black students from entering that school on September 4. Central High and its beautiful neighborhood had become ground zero in the march to end the fivedecade legacy of Plessy v. Ferguson, separate but equal. Now, just over 3 years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, it was time for action. In a few days, on the 25th of this month, we will celebrate the successful integration of Central High School when the Little Rock Nine entered the school, escorted by the 101st Airborne Division. It is fitting today, Mr. Speaker, that we pay tribute to the Little Rock Nine, their defenders, and the successful end to separate but equal. I am proud to recognize this important milestone today on this House floor and remember passing the bill 1 year ago that I authored that expands the park boundary of the National Historic Site at Little Rock Central High School. This is a historic and an important touchstone for all those modernday history travelers retracing the steps of the civil rights movement. 
The National Historic Site Visitor Center was opened in 2007 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Central High’s integration. My bill extended the park boundaries to take in the houses that fronted the school along South Park Street so that future generations will be able to picture that street just as it was and reflect on those 21 days of trauma back in 1957. Bringing the properties into the boundary of the site provides the National Park Service with more tools and flexibility for partnering with the homeowners to historically preserve their front facade and the yards of those homes. Together with the school, the seven homes across the street from Central High will now stand as a living monument to the civil rights movement in Arkansas and the United States. I want to thank the National Park Service superintendent at that site, Robin White, for her leadership and her persistent work with the community to enhance it as an educational resource and a key stop on the Civil Rights Trail. The Little Rock Nine’s brave actions integrating Little Rock Central High will forever be remembered for their unparalleled role in ending socalled separate but equal. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the 61st anniversary of these brave actions by those young people. b1715 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the important accomplishments of women throughout history and to call attention to the millions of women across the globe who lack access to education and are denied access to opportunity. Small businesses are the engines of our economy in Arkansas and across our entire Nation. They create and support jobs within our local communities and employ approximately half of all privatesector workers in the United States. According to the Small Business Administration, 30 million small businesses in the U.S. make up over 99 percent of our Nation’s businesses; and of those, 11.4 million are womenowned businesses, employing nearly 9 million people. They are centers of innovation, discovery, and opportunity, empowering and equipping Americans for success. Everyone should have the opportunity to rise, but in America, women entrepreneurs face barriers to certain business resources that many males with similar aspirations don’t. We have got to work hard for our hardworking Americans and our hardworking American families. In Arkansas, Winrock International is doing just that through its Arkansas Women’s Business Center. The Arkansas Women’s Business Center provides training, counseling, and access to capital for women who want their business to grow and become competitive. Though obstacles to entrepreneurship and opportunity also exist outside the U.S., there are entities, including Winrock, supporting solutions that promote prosperity and provide a means for women to flourish around the world. I had a chance to visit with a very hardworking, enterprising, caring young woman from my hometown of Little Rock, recently, whose innovative efforts were to eradicate hopelessness and give hope to those in poverty by lifting them up and aiding their pursuit of happiness and promoting the fruits of the dignity of work. Anna Taylor is the founder of the clothing company Judith & James of the nonprofit James127 Foundation. She started her remarkable journey during her family’s mission work in Africa. Inspired by the desire and drive of the Kenyan women she encountered, Anna set out to work with them to ensure that they have the opportunity to provide for their loved ones and themselves. Today, her foundation provides practical and handson sewing training to Kenyan widows, offering hope and a future to women whose communities have been ravaged by poverty and disease. When you empower women, you empower their communities. For too long, too many young girls and women throughout the world continue to be denied an effective education. We must continue to work to address this injustice and ensure that all women are provided fundamental freedoms in the political, social, cultural, economic, and civic fields. So I would like to applaud the House on its recent passage of H.R. 5480, the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, and commend my fellow Arkansan, Senator JOHN BOOZMAN , for introducing its companion in the Senate. As the proud father of a daughter studying hard in college—I hope she is studying hard—I believe that it is critical that we all support all of our aspiring young women. I urge the Senate to act quickly on this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers will continue for the folks who are in harm’s way with the hurricane coming ashore. I am grateful for all of those who are serving, State, Federal, and local officials, trying to keep people safe. They will continue to be in our thoughts and prayers. I am very grateful that President Trump hasn’t waited. They mobilized. They have got Federal folks on the ground ready to go. I am also glad it got downgraded to some extent, but it is still going to be a rough go for folks, their homes, and their goods. So we will continue to remember them. I am grateful for those first responders out there ready to serve. We just remembered 9/11 this week. Those of us who were old enough to know what happened that day will never forget what happened. We will never forget where we were. I will never forget the next day, September 12. In my hometown of Tyler, just like in hundreds of thousands of towns and cities around the country, people came together and we prayed together. We sang hymns together. We held hands and sang together. It was a powerful day. And I will always remember there were people from all different races, ages, both genders, people of all walks of life, but we gathered there in solidarity. What I noticed that day was that there were no hyphenated Americans. We were just Americans. That is what everybody said, and that is what everybody was. It was an incredible day that an act of sheer hatred, evil, wanting to destroy freedom and the freest country with the best founding document that would allow freedom, they wanted it all destroyed. But there was a lot of love that next day. It is unfortunate that, 17 years later, we don’t see that kind of harmony. It used to be that, in this body, we would disagree, but, as the House rules require, we wouldn’t call into question any other elected official’s motivation, intentions. We would say we all want is what is best for the country. We all want to keep our oath to the Constitution. But it appears that some don’t want to follow those rules anymore. In fact, some of the very people who have been in this room, in the Senate, here in Washington, in front of the press around the country, people who have demanded that the Federal Government get involved and stop bullying at all levels, including threatening, harassing little children in elementary school because the Federal Government felt like it had to intervene and prevent bullies even at such an early age, yet some of those same people who have been calling for Federal intervention to stop bullying have become the biggest bullies in the United States of America. It is unbelievable how people would be encouraged by elected officials to bully, harass people with whom they disagree. If you can find them in public anywhere, intimidate, scream at them, run them out. Don’t let them eat. Don’t let them do anything. Don’t let them shop. Bully them until you drive them out and you intimidate them so much that they are afraid to express 
their political opinion or to continue to work in a Republican administration or as a Republican in the House. It is just unbelievable. It has, clearly, incited people to go out and commit bullying and sometimes physical assaults. But you also look at some of the other things that have gone on: people who are completely disloyal to the President for whom they work will go to the extent of committing crimes because they don’t like the President, even to the extent of, as a former judge, what I would call committing a fraud upon the FISA court. That is the way it appeared to me. The FISA judges granted four different warrants to surveil people in the Trump campaign and administration, one of whom, Rod Rosenstein, I have asked him if he even read the applications and affidavits. He never would answer the question, which, as we know from Watergate days, that is a nondenial denial. Clearly, when they would not admit that Rosenstein had read the application, he said: I didn’t know how things work. Well, I know how they are supposed to work. If you come before a judge and you sign a document in an effort to get that judge to encroach on the constitutional rights of American citizens, you better know what you are doing. Rosenstein defrauded the court. But the reason they possibly did not defraud the court is if the court was engaged in fraud itself. The only reason I would raise that is because the FISA judges who were granting warrants based on false information, incomplete information, misleading information, it is possibly because they were okay with helping to use the color of the law to violate American citizens’ rights. Maybe there is a 1983 civil rights action there against judges and those who participated. Who knows. I can’t help but wonder about the integrity of judges who are not upset that lawyers came in from the Justice Department and manipulated them into signing a warrant four times when it should never have been signed once. Then we find out this guy, Halper, who is supposed to have identified Mike Flynn and the relationship with Russians, it turns out he had gotten contracts from the Defense Department—I think one was over $600,000, another over $400,000—and it was flagged by a very dedicated, devoted employee of the Defense Department whose job it was to analyze contracts to make sure they were legitimate and people were doing what they were supposed to. His name is Adam Lovinger. He saw those contracts and thought: This is very strange, two contracts worth over a million dollars to one person and there doesn’t appear to be anything that he is getting. Well, he was being paid by the Federal Government to set up somebody in the Trump campaign as someone who had been dealing with Russians, who had been paying Russians to come speak at his conferences or seminars, who had an ongoing relationship with Russians, so he would later say: Gee, this guy from the Trump campaign was getting too cozy with the Russians, so I quit. You mean the guys that you had this ongoing relationship with and paid them to come and speak at your conferences, you were concerned about someone from the Trump administration or who worked with Trump in the campaign actually speaking to the people you have been hiring for a number of years? b1730 It is just fraudulent what they were doing. Incredible. And I had hoped, when Christopher Wray took over at the FBI—well, I don’t really know him—but maybe he’ll help clean up the disaster that was created by the weaponization of the Department of Justice, and particularly the FBI, by Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, so many of those—Bruce Ohr—who were working at DOJ or FBI. But we got a solid piece of evidence that Christopher Wray is not the answer; he is part of the problem. And that came as was reported in this story Wednesday, August 29, 2018. As the headline from Newsmax says: ‘‘FBI: No Evidence Clinton Server Hacked Despite Trump Tweet.’’ Well, Christopher Wray had to approve that, and either he is completely, objectively incompetent or he intended to slap the President with a fraud by omission and also to slap—figuratively speaking—our Intel community. It wasn’t the FBI that found that Hillary Clinton’s server had been hacked and that over 30,000 of her emails—all but 4, and the 4 really didn’t amount to anything—all went to a foreign country’s intelligence apparatus. They had hacked it, put instructions on there. So then, we know that because the Intel community has made—they knew with 100 percent certainty that that had happened. They found it. They found the anomaly. They found the embedded instruction that was placed when her server was hacked. And I know there have been allegations that perhaps Hillary Clinton’s classified information that went through the unclassified private server may have gotten some of our undercover people killed in China. I don’t know if that is what got them killed or not, but it certainly wouldn’t have helped. Nonetheless, the Intel community inspector general, who back then was Chuck McCullough, and Investigator Frank Rucker are the ones who found that. And I haven’t talked to Mr. Coats, but this was a slap at the Intel community, basically saying, Hey, we at the FBI didn’t find any evidence her private server was hacked, so anybody who says they did is just totally wrong because, if the FBI doesn’t find it, nobody in the Intel community of the United States is competent enough to find such a hacking. Well, Chris Wray and whoever fed him this statement to put out publicly were wrong. Our Intel community was good enough. They did find that her private server was hacked. And the emails did not go to Russia or any representatives or agency affiliated with Russia. Richard Pollock wrote that he had confirmed that it went to China. I didn’t say that when I questioned Mr. Strzok, but that has been reported. If Mr. Wray is going to continue in his efforts to slap—fraudulently, really—at the President and our Intel community, he really ought to just voluntarily step down. The FBI has had so many thousands and thousands of honest, ethical, upright FBI agents, because I have known many. And they need somebody who will help the FBI get its reputation back. When the current FBI director engages in this kind of fraud by omission, then he is not the answer; he is trying to salvage a great reputation that has been destroyed during the Obama administration, and he is not going to get it back by misrepresentations, by omissions. Hopefully he’ll do the right thing and let us get somebody to replace him soon who will clean things up. In the meantime, that is a little scary. Now, I also had noted an article I had never noticed before and a friend pointed it out. I had never heard of this. I had to go back and look. A New York publication by Chris Smith, October 20 of 2003. The byline under it says: ‘‘Mr. Comey goes to Washington.’’ Byline says: ‘‘Just as his terrorism and corporatecorruption cases here are heating up’’—apparently in New York— ‘‘United States Attorney James Comey is heading south to become John Ashcroft’s deputy. What’s a nice, nonpartisan prosecutor going to do in a Justice Department like that?’’ Well, it doesn’t sound like they were big fans of John Ashcroft, who is really a fine, dedicated, upstanding individual. He must have been feeling a little bit giddy. He is going to be the deputy, Department of Justice. And so he said far more than was good for his reputation. It says, in the fourth paragraph: ‘‘Comey has been savaged by William Safire and lauded by CHUCK SCHUMER ; just what kind of Republican is he, anyway? This sets Comey howling again.’’ Then the quote from Comey. He says: ‘‘I must be doing something right. In college, I was left of center, and through a gradual process I found myself more comfortable with a lot of the ideas and approaches the Republicans were using.’’ The article says: He voted for Carter in 1980, but in 1984, Comey said: ‘‘I voted for Reagan.’’ These are Comey’s words: ‘‘I’d moved from Communist to whatever I am now. I’m not even sure,’’ Comey says, ‘‘how to characterize myself politically. Maybe at some point I’ll have to figure it out.’’ It says in the article: ‘‘On the surface it’s an odd pairing: Comey—who cites 
liberal theologian Reinhold Niebuhr as a formative influence,’’ which is a little disturbing, ‘‘and who can sing along with Good Charlotte poppunk hits— and Ashcroft.’’ But anyway, that was interesting. I did not know that Comey had admitted to being a commie, but Comey the commie is no longer in charge of the FBI. And it still boggles the mind that Rod Rosenstein would do a memorandum telling the President: You need to fire Comey. He hasn’t been intellectually honest. You need to fire him. Causes are all here. So the President relies on Rosenstein and fires Comey; and then, what, the next day Rosenstein turns around and says: Oh, well, there is cause to appoint a special counsel to investigate the President for supposedly obstruction of justice for firing Comey, because the President followed Rosenstein’s recommendation. The mere fact that Rosenstein would appoint a special counsel to investigate the President for doing what Rosenstein said should have been enough to get him fired back then. What kind of manipulative little demon would say, ‘‘Fire Comey,’’ and then the advice is followed and then he appoints a prosecutor to try to disrupt him and remove him from office. I mean, it is like some kind of game: Oh, I know. I will set up the President. I will tell him to fire Comey, and then we can use that to investigate him for the rest of his time as President. Well, hopefully—and I have been hoping for a long time that Rosenstein’s days are numbered. Of course, he was the U.S. attorney who was in charge of the investigation investigating Russia and their illegal efforts to obtain American uranium. He would also be the same person, along with FBI Director Mueller and a guy named Weissmann, who is currently working for Mueller, who made sure that their undercover guy who was gathering information to show how illegally Russia was acting, make sure he signs a nondisclosure agreement. They threaten him, we are told, that he either sign the nondisclosure or they would prosecute him. So he signs it. Because they did not want anybody talking about how illegally Russia was acting because, if they had, then the committee that had to approve foreign investments in the United States, CFIUS, they could not have voted to allow Russia to get a hold of 20 or so percent of American uranium. And if they were not allowed to get hold of that much uranium, then, of course, there would not have been the $145 million or so that went into the Clinton Foundation. Then we get this reporter from FOX News: ‘‘John Kerry slammed for ‘shameful’ shadow diplomacy after admitting to meetings with Iran.’’ Now, I think there is a word for it, but when someone goes and tries to undermine the United States President’s administration from protecting the country, America, from the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world, I don’t know what you would call that, but it seems like, if you have a President, in President Trump, trying to protect America from terrorist attacks that would be funded by the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world, Iran, and you have somebody else from America go over and try to save the deal that was going to help Iran be more of a threat to America—gee, that seems like people used to get prosecuted about things like that. Seemed like there was somebody named Rosenstein or Rosenberg back there that was not a help to the United States. I think back then they were hanging traitors. But, in any event, interesting. Also yesterday, committee chair RICHARD BURR from North Carolina, who has bent over backwards, done everything he can to get Justice and Intelligence to produce any kind of evidence whatsoever showing Trump or his administration colluded with the Russians, he comes out yesterday and says the panel has found ‘‘no hard evidence of collusion’’ between the Trump campaign and Russia. So it is just amazing. It sounds like we still need a housecleaning at the FBI at the very top. And this out today from the New York Post that Strzok and Page texts are a disaster and embarrassment to the FBI, DOJ. And it has this tweet from the President: ‘‘More text messages between former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are a disaster and embarrassment to the FBI and DOJ. ‘‘This should never have happened, but we are learning more and more by the hour. ‘Others were leaking like mad’ in order to get the President.’’ b1745 ‘‘In the lengthy exchange, the two exlovers talk about a leak operation for ‘political’ purposes. ‘‘‘Oh, remind me to tell you tomorrow about the Times doing a story about the RNC hacks,’ Page wrote to Strzok, who replied, ‘And more than they already did? I told you Quinn told me they pulling out all the stops on some story . . . ’ ‘‘‘Quinn’ could be referring to Richard Quinn, chief of the Media and Investigative Publicity Section in the FBI’s Office of Public Affairs. . . . ‘‘Strzok then texted Page, ‘Think our sisters have begun leaking like mad. Scorned and worried, and political, they’re kicking into overdrive.’ ‘‘It’s unclear,’’ the story says, ‘‘whom he was referring to as ‘sisters,’ but retired FBI Special Agent John Iannarelli told Fox it could be another government agency. ‘‘Earlier this week, a report from Rep. MARKMEADOWS . . . a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said a new Strzok Page text from April 2017 showed them discussing a ‘media leak strategy’.’’ So this is serious stuff. And, apparently, we don’t have somebody at the top of the FBI who will get this cleaned up. There are plenty of FBI agents across the country that could get things cleaned up. We know there is at least one here in Washington, D.C., that is good at coverups, but most of the rankandfile FBI agents are classy, honorable, decent, upright investigators who honor their oath every day, and, who, I keep hearing from different times, different places, are really upset with the damage that the people like Comey, Strzok, Page, Ohr, the damage they have done to their reputation for what used to be a sterling FBI. So it is time to clean house. Rosenstein has got to go. Chris Wray needs to be replaced by somebody that is not going to try to keep slapping the President when he is wrong about the FBI. Hopefully, we are going to see that come in the next few weeks. We will see. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f

JERRY MORAN , PATRICK J. L EAHY , PATTY MURRAY , RICHARD J. D URBIN  (Except Senate receding on Senate section 252), Managers on the Part of the Senate. JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE The managers on the part of the House and Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 6157) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, submit the following joint statement to the House and Senate in explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the managers and recommended in the accompanying conference report. This conference agreement includes the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019, and the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019. The Senate amendment included the Senate version of the Defense Appropriations bill (S. 3159) and added the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies bill (S. 3158). The House bill included the House version of the Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 6157) only. H.R. 6157 was passed by the House on June 28, 2018 and used as the vehicle for the Senate amendment, which passed the Senate on August 23, 2018. The agreement also includes continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2019. Section 1 of the conference agreement is the short title of the bill. Section 2 of the conference agreement displays a table of contents. Section 3 of the conference agreement states that, unless expressly provided otherwise, any reference to ‘‘this Act’’ contained in any division shall be treated as referring only to the provisions of that division. Section 4 provides a statement of appropriations. The conference agreement does not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined by clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives. DIVISION A—DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 The conference agreement on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, incorporates some of the provisions of both the House and Senate versions of the bill. The language and allocations set forth in House Report 115–769 and Senate Report 115–290 should be complied with unless specifically addressed in the accompanying bill and statement of the managers to the contrary. 
ACTIVITY  For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), as amended by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100– 119), and by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508), the terms ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ for appropriations contained in this Act shall be defined as the most specific level of budget items identified in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, the related classified annexes and explanatory statements, and the P–1 and R–1 budget justification documents as subsequently modified by congressional action. The following exception to the above definition shall apply: the military personnel and the operation and maintenance accounts, for which the term ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ is defined as the appropriations accounts contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. At the time the President submits the budget request for fiscal year 2020, the Secretary of Defense is directed to transmit to the congressional defense committees budget justification documents to be known as the ‘‘M–1’’ and the ‘‘O–1’’ which shall identify, at the budget activity, activity group, and sub activity group level, the amounts requested by the President to be appropriated to the Department of Defense for military personnel and operation and maintenance in any budget request, or amended budget request, for fiscal year 2020. REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE  The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts as specified in the report accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110– 279). The dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall be $10,000,000 for military personnel; $15,000,000 for operation and maintenance; $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation. Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue to provide the congressional defense committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II and quarterly, spreadsheetbased DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense wide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of a military personnel (M–1), an operation and maintenance (O–1), a procurement (P–1), or a research, development, test and evaluation (R–1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest items are established elsewhere in this statement. 
FUNDING INCREASES  The funding increases outlined in the tables for each appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. 
CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided or items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. 
CLASSIFIED ANNEX  Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the accompanying classified annex. 
OTHER TRANSACTION AUTHORITY  The conferees support the use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) pursuant to section 2371b of title 10, United States Code for prototyping projects to enhance the mission effectiveness of the Department of Defense. However, the conferees are concerned with the lack of transparency surrounding the employment of OTA, particularly for followon production. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to provide quarterly reports to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not later than 30 days after the close of each fiscal quarter, detailing the Department’s execution of funds for OTA prototype projects. Such reports shall be submitted beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and shall include a classified annex, if necessary. The report shall list each active OTA agreement characterized by Service or agency, major command, contracting activity, appropriation, budget line item, minimum and maximum award value, vendor, obligations and expenditures to date, product service code, and period of performance. Other Transaction Authority agreements that include an option for followon production shall be clearly annotated in the report and include a description of the scope of the followon production, including estimated cost, period of performance, deliverables, delivery dates, and source of funding. Further, the conferees direct the Comptroller General to review the Department’s use of OTA pursuant to section 2371b of title 10, United States Code to determine whether the Department’s employment of this authority conforms to applicable statutes and Departmental guidelines, to include the identification of any potential conflicts with section 1301 of title 31, United States Code. As part of this review, the Comptroller General shall also report on the extent that OTAs have been utilized since fiscal year 2016 and quantify OTA prototype agreements, including those with options for followon production, by Service or agency, appropriation, and other characteristics, as appropriate. The Comptroller General shall provide the congressional defense committees the assessment not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act. INDIRECT FIRE PROTECTION CAPABILITY  In support of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) program of record, the Army’s fiscal year 2019 budget includes procurement requests totaling $173,204,000 for AIM–9X interceptors, MultiMission Launcher (MML) components, and other ancillary costs. This request is in addition to $50,056,000 of fiscal year 2018 funding that remains unexecuted. The request also includes $208,740,000 for continued research, development, test and evaluation of the current IFPC program of record, while prior year funding also remains available due to the decision not to award the IFPC milestone B Engineering and Manufacturing Development contract. The conferees note that following the submission of the fiscal year 2019 budget request, the Army initiated reviews of the existing IFPC program of record and alternate courses of action (COA) prior to the milestone B decision. These alternate COA include the development and integration of an alternate interceptor to the previously proposed AIM–9X interceptor with modifications to the MML, as well as the analysis of at least two other distinct weapons systems. The conferees further note that section 112 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 directs the Army to deploy two batteries of an interim, fixed site cruise missile defense capability by September 30, 2020, subject to the availability of appropriations. The conference agreement supports the Army’s pursuit of this defensive capability; 
however, the conferees remain concerned that the current budget request does not support any change in acquisition strategy or procurement and integration of available interim defense capabilities and is unexecutable as requested. The conferees direct the Secretary of the Army to provide a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act that details the results of the Army’s internal review, revised acquisition strategy, and resulting resourcing requirements. The report shall also include an analysis and recommendations on the multiple COA under review; the supporting cost estimates for each COA across the future years defense program (FYDP); a program schedule for the selected COA; an analysis and recommendations for interim capabilities and proposed acquisition schedule; the proposed execution of prior year available balances and current IFPC resources by appropriation, budget line, and project across the FYDP for both the program of record and interim capabilities; and a plan to resource any identified shortfalls for the selected program of record COA and interim capabilities that will be pursued through the reprogramming of available resources and other means, as necessary. 
CLOUD COMPUTING  The conferees believe cloud computing, if implemented properly, will have far reaching benefits for improving the efficiency of day today operations of the Department of Defense, as well as enabling new military capabilities critical to maintaining a tactical advantage over adversaries. The conference agreement includes a general provision directing the Secretary of Defense to provide a comprehensive strategy for cloud computing and to propose a plan for a budget accounting system that provides greater transparency to evaluate the cost and progress of transitioning to a cloud computing environment. The conferees are not suggesting that the Department implement a separate, new financial management system for cloud computing, but urge the Secretary of Defense to adapt the current system to provide reliable and timely data on the budgets requested and funds expended to procure cloud computing services, and the budgets requested and funds expended to prepare and implement legacy systems for migration to the cloud environment. ADVANCED BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  The conferees support the Air Force’s new approach to battle management, the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), but are concerned with the nearterm risks in cancelling the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System recapitalization program. The conferees direct the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act on a revised ABMS plan and execution strategy, updated costs and schedules of each activity within the ABMS plan, and a gap and threat assessment of both the ground moving target indicator and battle management command and control mission areas. This language replaces the language under the heading ‘‘Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System Recapitalization’’ in House Report 115–769 and the language under the heading ‘‘Advanced Battle Management System’’ in Senate Report 115–290. 
CIVILIAN PAY RAISE  The conference agreement includes sufficient funding to provide for a 1.9 percent pay raise for civilian employees of the Department of Defense and other agencies funded by this Act, if authorized by another provision of law. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS RESTRUCTURING  On July 30, 2018, the Secretary of Defense approved a Secretary of the Army memorandum identifying specific actions the Army will take in support of the Administration’s proposed reorganization of the United States Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Civil Works Program. The reorganization includes taking the Civil Works program out of the Army Corps of Engineers with navigation going to the Department of Transportation for infrastructure grants and the remaining accounts to the Department of the Interior. The conferees are opposed to the reorganization as it could ultimately have detrimental readiness and operational impacts on Department of Defense functions and activities, to include USACE support to ongoing military operations, international partners, and support to United States military installations around the world. The conferees are extremely concerned that the Secretary of the Army failed to provide any notification or engage in any discussion with Members of Congress, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, or their staff on an action of this magnitude, which crosses multiple jurisdictional lines and has farreaching consequences. This type of proposal, as the Department is well aware, will require legislative language which has not been proposed or requested to date. Therefore, no funds provided in this Act or any previous Act shall be used by the Department or the Secretary to plan, prepare, or implement this proposal. TITLE I—MILITARY PERSONNEL The agreement provides $138,537,041,000 in Title I, Military Personnel, as follows: 
For Military Personnel, funds are to be available for fiscal year 2019, as follows:

MILITARY PERSONNEL OVERVIEW  The conference agreement provides the resources required for an additional 15,600 active forces and 800 selected reserve forces above fiscal year 2018 levels, as requested and authorized by current law, in order to meet operational needs for fiscal year 2019. The conference agreement also provides the funding necessary to support a 2.6 percent pay raise for all military personnel, as authorized, effective January 1, 2019. 
PERSONNEL ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2019 appropriations accounts not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any purpose other than originally appropriated until the aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in the Services’ military personnel accounts between budget activities in excess of $10,000,000. 
MILITARY PERSONNEL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided or have been specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or reduce funding from congressional special interest items as identified on the DD Form 1414. RESERVE OFFICER TRAINING CORPS  The conferees support Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at universities and colleges. The ROTC program provides necessary tools for young men and women to serve in the military. The House included two provisions which would ban the termination or closure of Senior ROTC or ROTC programs at Historically Black Colleges, Hispanic or Tribal Universities/Colleges. The Department of Defense has advised the conferees that they have not initiated any efforts for the past several years to terminate these programs and/or units. The conferees urge the Secretary of Defense to continue to foster these programs, especially at Historically Black Colleges, Hispanic or Tribal Universities/Colleges, to ensure the best and brightest remain interested in military service. 
BLENDED RETIREMENT SYSTEM  Pursuant to sections 631 through 635 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, the Department of Defense began modernizing the retirement system for members of the uniformed services by implementing a Blended Retirement System (BRS) that incorporates Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) contributions, Continuation Pays (CP), and a reducedrate version of the traditional definedbenefit pension. Servicemembers who enter military service on or after January 1, 2018 are covered automatically by BRS. Those who began serving prior to December 31, 2017 are grandfathered under the legacy retirement system, with the ability to optin to the BRS from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, if the member has less than 12 years of service in active duty or has accumulated less than 4, 320 points for reserve members. For servicemembers separating from the military with fewer than 20 years, the new system provides for retirement benefits outside of the standing definedbenefit pension, enabling a larger population of servicemembers to obtain retirement benefits. The fiscal year 2018 budget submission was the Department’s first opportunity to request appropriations for TSP and CP requirements. Initial estimates were consistent across the military Services based on budgeting assumptions informed by valuations of the military retirement system via the Department of Defense Office of the Actuary. Following the markup of the Department of Defense Appropriations Acts by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the Department submitted an omnibus reprogramming request identifying $1,679,947,000 in base military personnel funding available for realignment to higher priorities, of which the Department identified $442,475,000 as excess to need due to overestimation of BRS. In addition, another $77,000,000 was identified as BRS resources available for a future reprogramming action. The conferees understand that this new approach to military retirement will take the Department time to educate and enroll participants, gather data, formulate revised assumptions, and more accurately inform budget projections. However, given that the fiscal year 2019 budget request was formulated by applying similar BRS assumptions as those used in fiscal year 2018, the Department has revised its fiscal year 2019 BRS projection and identified an estimated $732,000,000 asset based on current actuals experienced in the year of execution. As such, the associated reductions have been distributed throughout the military personnel appropriation accounts and redistributed to title II in a general provision to mitigate higher than anticipated fuel costs. The conferees expect budgeting for the BRS will become more accurate over time. MILITARY PERSONNEL , ARMY The agreement provides $42,690,042,000 for Military Personnel, Army, as follows:

SECURITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS  The conferees recognize and appreciate the efforts made in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 and the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 to reform several programs that provide security assistance to international partners. Changes have touched on several Department of Defense programs, including the Coalition Support Fund, border security programs, and building partner capacity/security cooperation programs. While largely supportive of these efforts, the conferees are concerned that confusion exists, within the Department of Defense and among recipient countries, about the remaining disparate and stillchanging authorities. The conferees are also concerned with the lack of stability, transparency, and fungibility of funds appropriated for security assistance activities and believe that changes may be needed in various appropriations to ensure that appropriate levels of funding are provided for each newly authorized or modified program. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to conduct a review of security assistance programs, including, but not limited to, security cooperation programs authorized in Section 333 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, border security assistance programs authorized by Section 1226 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 as modified, and the Coalition Support Fund authorized by Section 1223 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 as modified. The review should include a survey of Department of Defense security assistance requirements of each combatant command and a study of whether existing authorities are sufficient to meet the security assistance needs of the Department of Defense, including whether funding limitations inhibit security assistance requirements. The conferees direct that the results of the review be submitted to Congress with the fiscal year 2020 budget request submission, and include proposals for any needed modifications to security assistance authorities and appropriations funding levels or language. The conferees further direct the Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, in conjunction with the geographic combatant commanders, to provide a spend plan for fiscal year 2019, by combatant command, for security assistance funding to the congressional defense committees not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act. The spend plan should be provided in a form that compares the plans for both the base and overseas contingency operations requests and provides an annual comparison for the preceding five years. A similar plan shall be provided outlining fiscal year 2020 requirements concurrent with the submission of the fiscal year 2020 budget request. 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS  The Administration has announced plans to wholly transfer the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB) to the Department of Defense. The conferees expect the Department of Defense will use the existing NBIB skilled workforce as part of the plan to maintain continuity and to support a successful transition of services. The conferees recognize the importance of this workforce in reducing the backlog of investigations and in establishing new processes for streamlining the current system. 
DEFENSE SECURITY SERVICE  The Defense Security Service (DSS) is preparing to accept responsibility for all civilian and defense agency background investigations. The conferees note with concern that DSS provided multiple and amended budget documents during the fiscal year 2019 budget cycle, which indicate changing plans and corresponding budget requirements. The conferees expect that DSS will improve its resource planning to ensure future budget requests support a consistent strategy. The conferees direct the Director of DSS to provide quarterly execution briefings to the congressional defense committees on activities related to background investigations during fiscal year 2019. COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE  
END OF WORLD WAR II  The United States will celebrate the occasion of the seventyfifth anniversary of the end of World War II in 2020. In order to honor the nation’s veterans, educate the public, and recognize the contributions of the home front and allies during the war, the conferees urge the Secretary of Defense to evaluate ways in which the Department can support the commemoration, to include providing resources for related activities. 
CYBERSPACE SOLARIUM COMMISSION  Section 1652 of the John S. McCain National Defense Act for Fiscal Year 2019 establishes the Cyberspace Solarium Commission to develop a consensus on a strategic approach to defending the United States in cyberspace against cyber attacks of significant consequences. The conferees encourage the Secretary of Defense to provide the resources necessary to support this effort.

ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation. Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly, spreadsheetbased DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defensewide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research, development, test and evaluation (R– 1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest items are established elsewhere in this statement. FUNDING INCREASES  The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. 
PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement.

STRYKER DOUBLE V HULL  Following the submission of the fiscal year 2019 budget request, the Chief of Staff of the Army approved an Army Requirements Oversight Counsel (AROC) decision to upgrade and pure fleet all FlatBottom Hull (FBH) Stryker combat vehicles to the Double V Hull A1 variant (DVHA1) in an effort to improve troop survivability and mobility. The Army’s fiscal year 2019 budget request includes $21,900,000 to upgrade three FBH Stryker vehicles to DVHA1 variants. Subsequent to the AROC decision, the Army requested a funding transfer of $149,390,000 to fund additional conversions. With the transfer, the Army can resource 53 DVHA1 conversions totaling $171,290,000. The conferees have also included a congressional adjustment of $94,000,000 for 29 additional conversions. The conferees note that there is a fiscal year 2018 reprogramming request to repurpose $285,000,000 of congressionally directed funding for 91 DVHA1 conversions. If the reprogramming action is approved by the congressional defense committees, the Army will have sufficient resources to fund conversions for half the vehicles in a Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), which is the Army’s optimal rate of modernization. The conferees support the netzero fiscal year 2019 transfer request, reprogramming action, and additional funding for DVHA1 conversions. However, the conferees are concerned that the Army decision on Stryker modifications are not being synchronized with the budget cycle, are currently under resourced, and have been subject to sudden change. The conferees direct the Secretary of the Army to submit a report outlining the revised acquisition strategy for Stryker vehicles, to include a resourcing strategy for funding Stryker DVHA1 conversion at a rate of onehalf of a SBCT per year, an explanation of Stryker lethality requirements, an acquisition and resourcing strategy for fielding required lethality modifications, and an explanation and cost estimate for any validated requirements for Stryker modifications. This report shall be submitted to the congressional defense committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act. This language replaces the language under the heading ‘‘Stryker’’ in House Report 115– 769 and under the heading ‘‘Army Stryker DoubleV Hull A1’’ in Senate Report 115–290.

LAND ATTACK WEAPON  The conferees are concerned by the Navy’s management of the Tomahawk missile program. In the previous two fiscal years, the Congress has added funding above the budget requests for the Tomahawk program due to the fact that the Navy has requested fewer missiles than necessary to maintain a minimum sustainment rate of production while missiles have continued to be expended in the Central Command area of operations. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018, provided $102,000,000 above the request to procure additional munitions pursuant to the Navy’s fiscal year 2018 enhancement request following enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. However, despite the request by the Navy and the direction by the Congress to procure additional munitions, the Navy has proposed to repurpose the congressionally provided funding for various activities, negating congressional intent. Therefore, the agreement includes a rescission of $115,657,000 of fiscal year 2018 funds from the Tomahawk program. The fiscal year 2019 budget request for Tomahawk does not include funding for new production of all up rounds, reflecting the Navy’s strategy to transition from new production to recertification and modernization activities. The conferees direct the Secretary of the Navy to conduct a full review of the Tomahawk program including the current inventory requirement and stockpiled levels of munitions; an analysis of the viability of new production in fiscal year 2020; an analysis of the capacity for concurrent new production and recertification activities within existing facilities; revised cost and schedule projections for modification and recertification activities, to include alternatives with and without concurrent new production; a detailed review of the execution of the fiscal year 2017 and 2018 new production congressional adds; an analysis of surface and subsurface launched land attack weapons inventory and requirements projections through the Next Generation Land Attack Weapon initial operational capability date, to include other weapons systems that may provide an interim capability. The Secretary of the Navy shall provide a report detailing the results of the review to the congressional defense committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act. Additionally, the reporting requirements related to the Long Range AntiShip Missile included under the heading ‘‘Next Generation Land Attack Weapon (NGLAW) and Interim Capabilities’’ in Senate Report 115–290 are still valid. This language replaces the language under the heading ‘‘Tomahawk Production’’ in House Report 115–769 and under the heading ‘‘Next Generation Land Attack Weapon (NGLAW) and Interim Capabilities’’ in Senate Report 115–290.

FORD CLASS AIRCRAFT CARRIER PROCUREMENT  The conferees include a proviso consistent with section 121 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which allows the Secretary of the Navy to potentially use fiscal year 2019 funds to enter into a contract for an aircraft carrier designated CVN–81 if certain requirements are met by the Secretary of Defense. However, the conferees note that the congressional defense committees have not received information justifying the validity of a proposed ‘‘two carrier block buy,’’ including an Independent Cost Estimate, an analysis of the impact on other Navy shipbuilding programs, an updated future years defense program, or an extended planning range budget. This language replaces the language under the heading ‘‘CVN 80’’ in Senate Report 115– 290. OTHER PROCUREMENT , NAVY The agreement provides $9,097,138,000 for Other Procurement, Navy, as follows: 
For Other Procurement, Navy, funds are to be available for fiscal year 2019, as follows:

ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation. Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue to provide the congressional defense committees quarterly, spreadsheetbased DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defensewide accounts in titles III and IV of this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or research, development, test and evaluation (R– 1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest items are established elsewhere in this statement. 
FUNDING INCREASES  The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. 
EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. 
BLAST EXPOSURE RESEARCH  The conferees understand that further research is necessary regarding blast exposure on the cellular level of the brain in order to develop blast protection requirements for helmets and other personal protective equipment. The conferees encourage the Secretary of Defense to increase efforts to develop a predictive traumatic brain injury model for blast. Such research may help reveal the cellular response to blast impulses and the interaction of the human brain and protective equipment related to blast exposure. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TEST AND  
EVALUATION INFRASTRUCTURE  The 2018 National Defense Strategy addresses the increasingly complex global threat environment driven in part by rapid technological advancements. The fiscal year 2019 budget request proposes investments in several programs that support a more capable and lethal force to prepare for this threat environment, including directed energy, hypersonics, advanced computing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, and robotics programs. The conferees believe that concurrent with investments in leapahead technological advancements, an investment in the Department of Defense test and evaluation infrastructure is required to increase testing range space and availability and to ensure continued independent and objective assessments of weapon system capabilities. Therefore, after consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, the conferees recommend increases for the Air Force, and Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation to modernize the Department of Defense test and evaluation infrastructure in areas such as hypersonics, directed energy, augmented intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and cyberspace. The conferees direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering), in conjunction with the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, to conduct an indepth assessment of the Department of Defense test and evaluation infrastructure and to identify improvements required to address future warfighting capabilities. The assessment shall be provided to the congressional defense committees not later than with the submission of the fiscal year 2020 budget request and shall include proposed coordinated investments by warfighting area in priority order and with associated cost estimates. 
TEST FLEET  The conferees agree to modify a provision proposed by the House allowing the Secretary of Defense to use funds appropriated in this Act for F–35 procurement and research, development, test and evaluation to modify up to six aircraft, including two aircraft of each variant, to a test configuration. The conferees understand that the cost of modifying each aircraft is approximately $5,000,000. The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary of the Navy, to notify the congressional defense committees not fewer than 30 days prior to obligating and expending funds for this purpose. The notification shall contain the costs of modifying the aircraft, the sources of funding by account and the reasons for their availability, and a statement that the use of such funds will not adversely affect the F–35 operational fleet. The conferees expect that any such use of funds will not unduly hinder or harm other critical aspects of the Joint Strike Fighter program. Finally, the conferees direct that normal reprogramming procedures be followed as necessary to execute funding for this purpose. ENERGETICS RESEARCH  The conferees direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) to submit a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act on current investments of the Department of Defense in energetics research. The report shall include a comparison of investments in energetics among the Services as well as a strategic roadmap for future energetics research. 
HYPERSONICS RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS  The conferees support hypersonics partnerships between the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the military Services and recommend fully funding these partnerships. The conferees understand that the development of hypersonic weapons will require a longterm vision, beyond the Services’ current mission needs and capabilities. Therefore, the conferees encourage the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) to consider establishing a partnership with one or more universities focused on hypersonics research and education with the mission of developing nextgeneration hypersonics capabilities and building a highlyskilled, technicallytrained workforce.

ACCELERATED ACQUISITIONS  The fiscal year 2019 budget request includes $1,402,333,000, an increase of 150 percent over amounts enacted in fiscal year 2018, for programs designated as accelerated acquisitions in accordance with Chief of Naval Operations and Secretary of the Navy Instructions 5000.53 and 5000.42, respectively. The conferees support efforts to rapidly deliver capability to the warfighter in a responsible manner and recommend $1,072,585,000 for these programs in fiscal year 2019. The conferees are concerned by repeated instances in which the designation as an accelerated acquisition program has led to imprudent program management decisions affecting contracting actions and funding execution. Therefore, the conferees direct the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller) to submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, on acquisition strategy management and fiscal controls in place to ensure the appropriate management of resources for Navy accelerated acquisition programs. The conferees direct the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) to provide the congressional defense committees, with the submission of the fiscal year 2020 budget request, the acquisition strategy for each designated accelerated acquisition program. The conferees further direct the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller) to certify that the fiscal year 2020 budget request fully funds such acquisition strategies, to include the associated test requirements identified in the detailed test approach developed for each program, as agreed to by the Chief of Naval Operations, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition), and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation per previous congressional direction. The conferees reiterate previous congressional direction with respect to the role of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation under accelerated acquisition and rapid prototyping, to include early insight into service acquisition intentions. Finally, the conferees direct the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) to identify to the congressional defense committees with the fiscal year 2020 budget submission, any additional training requirements levied on the acquisition workforce associated with the execution of accelerated acquisition programs. RESEARCH , DEVELOPMENT , TEST AND  EVALUATION , AIRFORCE  The agreement provides $41,229,475,000 for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force, as follows:

TEST AND EVALUATION SUPPORT  The conference agreement provides funding as requested within the Major Test and Evaluation Investment program element for the planning and design of three military construction projects under the Defense Laboratory Modernization Pilot Program authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. These specific projects are authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, but the conferees understand that funding for construction will be requested in fiscal year 2020. This language replaces the language under the heading ‘‘Test and Evaluation Support’’ in House Report 115–769. 
SPACE SOLAR POWER PROGRAM  The conferees understand that the Space Solar Power Program is a priority for the Air Force but have concerns that the submitted budget justification materials do not include sufficient requirements, scheduling, or cost detail to adequately judge the merits of rapid acquisition or the ability of the Space Rapid Capabilities Office to achieve it. Consequently, the conference agreement reduces funding for the program’s air demonstration by $105,000,000 and designates the program as a new start and congressional special interest item. The conferees direct the Secretary of the Air Force to submit detailed funding plans for the Space Solar Power Program with the fiscal year2020 budget request submission.

HEALTH PROGRAM  The conferees remain concerned about the transfer of funds from the InHouse Care budget subactivity group to pay for contractorprovided medical care and the reprogramming of funds from the Private Sector Care budget subactivity group to Department priorities outside of the Defense Health Program. To limit such transactions and improve oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and maintenance account, the conferees direct that the In House Care and Private Sector Care budget subactivities remain designated as congressional special interest items. Any transfer of funds into or out of these subactivities requires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior approval reprogramming procedures. This should not be interpreted as limiting the amount of funds that may be transferred to the InHouse Care budget subactivity from other budget subactivities within the Defense Health Program. Additionally, the conferees direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense committees on budget execution data for all of the Defense Health Program budget activities and to adequately reflect changes to the budget activities requested by the Services in future budget submissions. 
CARRYOVER  The conferees recommend one percent carryover authority for the operation and maintenance account of the Defense Health Program.

PEER REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM  The conference agreement provides $350,000,000 for a peerreviewed medical research program.

The additional funding provided under the peerreviewed medical research program shall be devoted only to the purposes listed above. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS  The conferees direct the Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Defense Healthcare Management Systems (DHMS), in conjunction with the Director of the Interagency Program Office (IPO), to provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense committees on the cost and schedule of the electronic health record program, to include milestones, knowledge points, and acquisition timelines, as well as quarterly obligation reports. These reports should also include any changes to the deployment timeline, including benchmarks, for full operating capability; any refinements to the cost estimate for full operating capability and the total lifecycle cost of the project; and the progress toward developing, implementing, and fielding the interoperable electronic health record throughout the medical facilities of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The PEO DHMS is further directed to continue briefing the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees on a quarterly basis, coinciding with the report submission. The conferees also direct the Director of the IPO to continue to provide quarterly reports to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, Subcommittees on Defense and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies on the progress of interoperability between the two Departments. Additionally, the conferees direct the Comptroller General to perform a review of the implementation of MHS GENESIS at the four currently active sites and submit a report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act. The report should include, but not be limited to, how MHS GENESIS is addressing the concerns raised by the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation report; the performance of MHS GENESIS in meeting the demands of each of the medical facilities; underlying issues with implementation; anticipated delays in implementation; and the impact on the execution of funds.

The report should include recommendations on how to best coordinate trauma teams of the Department of Defense with trauma partners in the civilian sector, including evaluating how trauma surgeons and military physicians can best partner with civilian level I trauma centers that are verified by the American College of Surgeons, including those that are linked to a bum center that offer bum rotations and clinical experience, to provide adequate training and readiness of the next generation of medical providers to treat critically injured bum patients and other military trauma victims. 
LEAD ASSESSMENTS AND TESTING FOR INFANTS  The conferees recognize the importance of screening and testing children for elevated blood lead levels to prevent childhood lead toxicity. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to provide risk assessments and targeted blood testing for elevated blood lead levels to all TRICARE beneficiary children during their 12month and 24month wellness checks or annual physical examinations.

KURDISH PESHMERGA  The Peshmerga forces of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the United Statesled campaign to degrade, dismantle, and ultimately defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Iraq. A lasting defeat of ISIS is critical to maintaining a stable and tolerant Iraq in which all faiths, sects, and ethnicities are afforded equal protection and full integration into the government and society of Iraq. In support of counterISIS operations and in conjunction with the central government of Iraq, the United States should provide the Ministry of Peshmerga forces of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq $290,000,000 in operational sustainment, so that the Peshmerga forces can more effectively partner with the Iraqi Security Forces, the United States, and other international coalition members to consolidate gains, hold territory, and protect infrastructure from ISIS and its affiliates in an effort to deal a lasting defeat to ISIS and prevent its reemergence in Iraq. AFGHANISTAN SECURITY FORCES FUND BUDGET

However, the Department remains unable to provide an accurate accounting of current and prior year spending at the budget justification request line level, which challenges effective congressional budget analysis and oversight. The conferees are also concerned that the budget flexibility allowed with the ASFF appropriation has led to unclear funding requirements and a lack of budget discipline and risks wasteful spending. Therefore, the conferees continue to direct that the Secretary of Defense shall provide budget justification materials that include the budget request amount, the prior year appropriated amount, and the actual obligation amount by line item for the prior two years. In addition, concurrent with the submission of each FAP, the Secretary of Defense shall provide the congressional defense committees with line item detail of planned funding movements within each ASFF sub activity group using line item titles from the appropriate year’s budget justification submission. Any line item that did not appear in the budget justification submission shall be delineated as a new line item in the line item detail accompanying the FAP. The conferees agree to forgo the more stringent reprogramming requirements outlined in Senate Report 115–290 in order to provide the Department more time to improve the ASFF budget submission. However, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees intend to revisit this issue during the fiscal year 2020 budget appropriation process if budget justification material continues to be deficient. PROCUREMENT  The agreement provides $12,627,028,000 for Procurement, as follows:
