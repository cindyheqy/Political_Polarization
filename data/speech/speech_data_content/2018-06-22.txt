Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I want to enter into the RECORD two haunting stories from migrant mothers reported this month. The first, ‘‘Don’t take my child away,’’ said a mother, and her child started screaming and vomiting and crying hysterically. And she asked the officers, ‘‘Can I at least have 5 minutes to console her?’’ They declined. And next, another mother set her 2 yearold daughter down and an agent began to run gloved hands across her body. Immediately, the girl began to scream. It all happened so quickly, and the girl’s despair was so complete in those few seconds. She would be taken from her mother when the van reached its destination. There are more than 2,300 similarly heartbreaking and unimaginable stories. The Trump administration cannot undo the trauma and terror they have caused, but they must immediately outline their plan to reunite these loved ones. 
KNOB NOSTER HIGH SCHOOL LADY PANTHERS ARE STATE CHAMPIONS (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Knob Noster High School Lady Panthers track team on winning the 2018 Class 2 Missouri State Track Championship. The Lady Panthers’ win marks the first women’s team State championship in their school’s history. The Lady Panthers took home the title with 50 team points after rain delayed the final track events for nearly 2 hours. In addition to winning the State championship, the Lady Panthers’ Jessica Sader recorded the second furthest javelin throw in Missouri history to claim the Class 2 title. Sader won her third straight title, throwing 143 feet, breaking her own Class 2 State record of 134.6 feet. The team’s outstanding accomplishments mark a great milestone for the girls track team and its coaches and creates a legacy that will be cherished and heralded for years to come. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Knob Noster High School Lady Panthers on this momentous achievement. PRESIDENT TRUMP’S IMMIGRATION POLICY (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the thousands of families being ripped apart by President Trump. Like the majority of Americans, I vehemently oppose Trump’s cruel and immoral zerotolerance policy. In less than 2 months, nearly 2,000 children have been snatched from their parents. Why? Because this administration is willing to use toddlers as bargaining chips for a wall. This Trumpcreated nightmare is absolutely unacceptable. This executive order does nothing to stop immigrant families from being detained. What a shame. Congress has the responsibility to act and create a bipartisan solution. The Ryan immigration bill is not that. It codifies hatred, putting families at greater risk. I urge my colleagues to abandon this hyperpartisanship and find a way to keep all families together and to reunite these children with their parents. f 
TAX CUTS PROMOTE JOBS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week the National Federation of Independent Business released their May Small Business Optimism Index, which is the highest Small Business Optimism rating in history. The NFIB reports that expansion plans for small businesses have hit an alltime high. The positive sales trends for independent businesses are at their highest level since 1995. These statistics show that the Republican tax cuts and President Donald Trump’s economic deregulation have promoted jobs. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the National Association of Manufacturers, led by President Jay Timmons, reports 77 percent of manufacturers plan to increase hiring, and 72 percent plan to increase wages or benefits. Current unemployment is 3.8 percent, the lowest level in almost 50 years. In addition, African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy to the family and talented associates of Charles Krauthammer, a megastar for truth on FOX News. 
RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF DOM BETRO (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the career of Dom Betro, a resident of my district, who is retiring this month as the president and CEO of the Family Service Association of Western Riverside County. Over the last 33 years, Dom has overseen phenomenal growth in the impact of this agency, which today helps more than 75,000 people a year. Under Dom’s leadership, the FSA developed more than 90 units of senior housing and provided counseling and childcare service to countless individuals. Dom’s record of public service includes volunteer work for organizations such as the Nonprofit Policy Counsel of California. He is a lecturer at California State University San Marcos and served for 4 years on the City of Riverside City Council. The legacy of Dom’s dedication to the Inland Empire will continue long after his retirement. He has made our community a better place to live. On behalf of my constituents, I want to thank him for his service. f 
HOW MUCH POLLUTION IS TOO MUCH? (Mr. MAST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, today is day 22 of water exactly like this being discharged into my community in Lake Okeechobee. You can see exactly how disgusting it is. What you cannot see is the disgusting smell that emanates from it. You cannot see the toxins that are inside of it. You cannot see the airborne pathogens that come off of it. What you see behind me is a satellite image of the hundreds of square miles of algae bloom that are in this lake that are being discharged miles and miles away into my community. My community did not put the algae bloom on the lake; they did not put the nutrients into the lake that caused this algae bloom; but my community pays the price, all under the umbrella of flood control for other communities. I believe my community is owed, at a minimum, one answer: How much pollution is too much? How much danger to our community is too much? How much before this will stop? 
CELEBRATING GROWN FLOWER MONTH (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, this July, our Nation will come together to celebrate American Grown Flower Month and the contributions of the cut flower industry to our country. The cutflower industry generates thousands of jobs across our State and produces $1.13 billion in economic activity each year through flower farmers, distributors, and florists. 
Whether it is celebrating Mother’s Day, an anniversary, or a graduation, flowers have been used to mark special occasions for thousands of years. California, alone, produces a staggering threequarters of all cut flowers grown in the United States. During my visits to flower growers and artistic florists on the central coast of California, I have seen firsthand the value of the flower industry as an economic engine in our region. By designating July as American Grown Flower Month, we celebrate the incomparable beauty of flowers and what they bring to our homes and our celebrations yearround. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ALIVEA COX (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Alivea Cox of Richmond Hill, Georgia, a kindhearted 14yearold who passed away on June 4, hours after being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. We can all be inspired by her passion for life, exemplified in her hobbies and her ability to make everyone around her a little happier every day. Alivea was musically talented, playing the French horn, the trumpet, and the piano. Her middle school band teacher recognized her for both outstanding musical talent and outstanding character. Alivea cofounded a weekly prayer club for students modeled after 1 Timothy 4:12. In a letter to a teacher, she mentioned important life lessons she learned: to be patient with yourself and others, and that bad days do not define you. I offer my deepest sympathy to her parents, her family, schoolteachers, and her friends. 
RECOGNIZING NEPHCURE KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of NephCure Kidney International. Roughly 31 million Americans live with kidney disease, and 3 in every 100,000 people suffer from nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is not a disease itself; rather, it is an umbrella term for the signs and symptoms that result from damage in the kidneys’ filtering units. NephCure Kidney International is the only organization committed exclusively to supporting research into finding the cause of the kidney disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, and nephrotic syndrome. I am proud of the work of this organization and their leaader, Dr. Irving Smokler, NephCure’s president and founder and a constituent of mine. In 1999, Dr. Smokler launched the NephCure Foundation, inspired by his son, Matthew, who was diagnosed with FSGS when he was just 11 years old. Dr. Smokler has since dedicated himself to the fulfillment of the foundation’s mission: to find the cause of and cure for FSGS and nephrotic syndrome. Mr. Speaker, today I call on all of our colleagues to recognize and support the goals of this important organization and to support robust funding for research at NIH to help find a cure for FSGS and nephrotic syndrome. f 
SUBSTANCE USEDISORDER PREVENTION THAT PROMOTES OPIOID RECOVERY AND TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS AND COMMUNITIES ACT 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CARTER of Georgia). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 949 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 6. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b0916 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 6) to provide for opioid use disorder prevention, recovery, and treatment, and for other purposes, with Mr. BACON in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. Pursuant to the order of the House of June 21, 2018, general debate shall not exceed 1 hour, with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 20 minutes. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman Oregon. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6. This is the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, or the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. I was proud to introduce this bill with my bipartisan colleagues: Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member, my friend from New Jersey, Mr. PALLONE ; Ways and Means Committee Chairman KEVIN BRADY ; and Ways and Means Ranking Member RICHARD NEAL. These past 2 weeks, this House, the people’s House, has dedicated tremendous amounts of time and energy to send a simple message to millions of Americans impacted by the opioid crisis. And that message is: Help is on the way. Not only are we passing legislation, dozens and dozens of bills that will save lives, but also we want to leave no doubt in the minds of those suffering from addiction that the United States House of Representatives, Republicans and Democrats alike, stand with them together. For too long, embarrassment and stigma surrounded the disease of addiction. It is time for that to change. If you are struggling with addiction, if you are fighting that invisible battle, please know that it is okay to seek help. Opioid overdoses take the lives of more than 100 Americans each and every day. In fact, Mr. Chairman, a thousand people in our country will go to an emergency room in the next 24 hours, suffering an overdose from opioids. We don’t want those people to become part of that deadly statistic. You matter. You are worthwhile. And I pray that the various legislation we vote on here today, and that we voted on throughout the last 2 weeks, can help you begin your journey of recovery. H.R. 6 includes several bills that went through regular order at the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees, but the bill we will vote on today also includes dozens of other pieces of legislation that have recently passed the House, most unanimously or with very strong bipartisan majorities. You see, at a time when it seems we couldn’t be more divided, it is clear that striking back against addiction is something that transcends politics and brings us together as a community, as a country, and as a Congress. Remember, this legislation is not the first action that this Congress has taken to combat the opioid crisis, and I am sure it will not be the last. I guarantee you that. The Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act, both of which were signed into law nearly 2 years ago, and an additional $4 billion in resources for States and communities that was provided in the omnibus appropriations bill just a few 
months ago, indicate we have been at this for awhile, and we will be at this for a while longer. Taken together, this is one of the most significant congressional efforts against a drug crisis in our Nation’s history. But we must continue to legislate, evaluate, conduct oversight, and work together to provide new solutions, so that we can rise to this ever challenging situation. Today, we have an opportunity to continue our work to combat this crisis, an opportunity to save lives, and we cannot let it pass. The legislation before us will help advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention and educational efforts, protect our communities, and bolster our efforts to fight deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl. We owe it to the families we have heard from. We owe it to our friends. Our communities need this and our country needs this to lift our people out of addiction and, together, win this fight. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This bill makes incremental changes to support those affected by the opioid crisis, but it is far from perfect. H.R. 6 does not adequately deal with the magnitude of the crisis that this country is facing, and there are provisions that I did not support at the subcommittee or full committee markup, including provisions that most Democrats voted against. Nonetheless, I am pleased that Democrats were able to secure positive provisions in the final package that we are considering today. Most notably, H.R. 6 includes provisions from a bill introduced by Representative TONKO and Representative LUJA´Nthat would extend access to evidencebased, medicationassisted treatment. Specifically, this section of the bill will allow advanced practice registered nurses, including midwives, to treat patients with buprenorphine for opiate use disorder for 5 years. The bill will also allow nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat patients with buprenorphine permanently, and allow qualified providers to treat up to 100 patients instead of 30 patients in their first year. This is a critical step forward in the expansion of treatment, one of the major challenges that we continue to face in the fight against this epidemic. Mr. Chair, I commend Representative TONKO and Representative L UJA´Nfor their ongoing leadership in this area. This bill also expands coverage through Medicare by adding methadone clinics to the Medicare program. Right now, methadone clinics are not Medicare providers. Seniors who want to get treatment from methadone clinics have to pay out of pocket. Adding methadone clinics will address an important coverage gap in the Medicare program and meaningfully expand access to treatment for opiate use disorders. The bill also improves coverage for vulnerable populations in Medicaid, ensures coverage for former foster youth up to the age of 26 nationwide, and supports State efforts to ensure continuity of coverage for people with substance use disorders as they leave incarceration. The bill will also provide funding to Medicaid substance use disorder health homes, give States money to expand the treatment capacity of Medicaid providers, and raise reimbursement rates. It also mandates coverage of Medicaid for all forms of medication assisted treatment for 5 years. The legislation also mandates comprehensive substance use disorder benefits in the Children’s Health Insurance Program, better known as CHIP. I am also pleased that H.R. 3528, the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act, authored by Representative CLARK of Massachusetts, is included in the bill. Eprescribing is an important tool that will reduce opiate diversion and prescription fraud. Further, the bill gives the Secretary of HHS the authority to expand the use of telehealth services in Medicare for substance use disorder treatment to help reach more people across the country. These were all important Democratic provisions and priorities that we worked hard to have included in the final package. I think these will all make a real difference in our fight against the opioid epidemic. Having said that, Mr. Chairman, I still have concerns with some of the provisions included in this final negotiated bill and the process by which we arrived here. For instance, there are two Medicare bills that I opposed through the committee process that I am concerned may not have a meaningful impact on the opioid crisis. H.R. 5804 would increase reimbursement for certain interventional pain injections in the ambulatory surgery setting under Medicare. I have seen no evidence that increasing reimbursement for these injections would have a meaningful impact on opioid prescribing. While it is important that Congress finds ways to promote nonopioid therapies that will reduce opioid prescribing, this legislation endorses and incentivizes interventions that may not be effective for a majority of the patients receiving them. I also have some concerns about H.R. 5809, which would extend a temporary passthrough payment for nonopioid analgesics for postsurgical pain management from 3 to 5 years in Medicare. I do question if this bill will have a meaningful impact on the opioid crisis. I am also disappointed that partisan legislation that would direct the FDA to issue guidance on how the agency will apply the criteria for accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation to nonaddictive pain and addiction treatment was included in this package. This legislation would set the precedent of having the FDA opine on how expedited programs may apply differently for therapeutic areas. It requires the agency to host a public meeting to discuss this and other topics, but provides no resources for the agency to complete these tasks. This is not legislation that FDA asked for or highlighted as a priority in fighting the opioid crisis. While they may now be comfortable with the changes that have been made to the bill, I am not comfortable with the policy. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I think it is essential that we keep this opioid package in the context of a larger healthcare debate in Congress. As I have stated before, my Republican colleagues are interested in taking credit today for some policies that helped those affected by the crisis while at the same time actively threatening and sabotaging the very healthcare coverage that many of the same people rely on in the first place. The ongoing efforts by House Republicans and the Trump administration to repeal or sabotage the Affordable Care Act have only harmed those affected by this crisis. Earlier this month, Republicans directly threatened the healthcare of people with opioid use disorder when the Trump administration asked a Federal court to strike down key patient protections in the Affordable Care Act. If successful, the Trump administration’s action would eliminate protections that ensure more than 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions cannot be denied coverage. And guess what is considered to be a preexisting condition? Opioid use disorders and people with it. Republicans also continue with their attempts to gut the Medicaid program, which is our most important weapon in the fight against this epidemic. Both the consumer protections of the ACA and Medicaid have saved countless lives that would have otherwise been destroyed by the opioid crisis. So it is nice that we are passing this bipartisan package today, but we should not forget the tremendous harm Republican policies would inflict elsewhere on the same people we seek to help with this opioid package. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ), the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, a great leader on these issues and more. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in support of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. Kentucky has been one of the hardest hit by our Nation’s opioid crisis, and I have heard from many Kentuckians 
across the Second District about the devastating effects the opioid crisis is having in the Commonwealth. Parents have lost children to opioid use disorder. Employers are having a hard time finding employees. And the opioid crisis has taken a terrible toll on our communities. Last Congress, I was proud to work with my colleagues as we crafted the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. We also passed the 21st Century Cures Act. We have come together to build on those two laws with more legislation to address the ongoing opioid epidemic. Over the past 2 weeks, we have passed more than 50 bills out of the House, including my bill, the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act. Today, we vote on the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, the culmination of our work over the past year to combat the opioid crisis. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill that will help all Americans affected by this awful epidemic. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ). Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6, and I thank our ranking member for yielding time to me. There isn’t any question that our country is in the midst of a destructive opioid epidemic that claims 142 lives every day. This is a national crisis, and it is our duty as Members of Congress to do everything in our power to stem the tide of addiction and the devastation that this epidemic is causing. It is claiming more lives than were lost in the Vietnam war. They are staggering figures. b0930 H.R. 6 includes policies to expand the number and types of providers who can administer medication such as buprenorphine and naloxone to opioid addicted patients, and it allows Medicare to pay for opioid treatment programs. That is a very important addition in the legislation. This will help people suffering from opioid use disorder to get access to the critical treatment they need on the day this legislation is signed into law. H.R. 6 also creates a payment structure that incents rather than discourages the use of nonopioid alternatives. I think this is a very important provision in the legislation because it will help to decrease the number of opioids prescribed and keep patients from becoming addicted in the first place. I want to point something out that I believe is deeply troubling, and the ranking member did as well. The majority has repeatedly voted to gut funding for the benefits offered by Medicaid, which is the single largest payer of mental health services, providing health coverage to 27 percent of adults with a serious mental illness. The majority has also consistently and repeatedly undermined the Affordable Care Act, including refusing to defend the protections for patients with preexisting conditions. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30 seconds. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, this is very serious because this would provide critical access to treatment for substance abuse disorders. So the majority gives with one hand and takes away with the other. These policies will harm millions of vulnerable Americans and limit our responsibility to respond and recover from this epidemic. This is an important first step. We need to do more to address the causes of the epidemic, stem the tide of addiction, expand meaningful access, and pay for it so that we can help the very people who need the most help. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ), who has been a fierce fighter to resolve this issue in his State and our country. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6. Over the past 2 weeks, America has witnessed something impressive. Both parties have come together, once again, to take action on one of the more challenging issues of our time: the opioid epidemic. But this health threat is not unique. In the past, Congress faced the AIDS epidemic that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans, and stared down the Ebola nightmare. Congress responded methodically and thoughtfully by investing massive resources into medical research at the NIH and into treatment and prevention programs. That is exactly what Congress is trying to do today. In this bill, we are funding NIH to develop alternatives to opioids for pain management, increasing treatment and prevention programs, and equipping our law enforcement to stop dangerous drugs like fentanyl from coming into America. This bill is going to make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans. Congress is building on the work that it started with CARA and with the 21st Century Cures, but this isn’t the end. It is vital to continue working together. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. PETERS ). Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I want to take a moment to say a special thank you to Mr. PALLONE and his committee staff for their tireless work to address this crisis. The opioid crisis has ravaged our Nation. It twice has been declared a national public health emergency under Federal law. More than 100 people will die from an overdose just today. That is why this bipartisan effort to address it is so important. There is certainly work to be done, but I am happy that legislation that I worked on with my colleague, Dr. BUCSHON , is included in this bill, and it aims to stop addiction where it frequently begins: after surgery. Millions of Americans are prescribed opioids following routine surgeries because they are cheap and accessible, and nearly 70 percent of those pills go unused. Our bill reverses the perverse incentive that put so many cheap pills in people’s hands in the first place. It allows innovators to receive extra compensation for nonaddictive opioid alternatives if they can show that their alternative therapies have substantial clinical benefit. In the short term, the policy reduces the incentive to simply use the cheapest postsurgical pain treatment, which is typically an opioid. In the long term, it will spur innovation by providing additional compensation for the future development of nonaddictive alternatives. That means as long as this crisis takes to solve, there will be an incentive to continue to develop nonopioid alternatives. Of course, access isn’t enough. These treatments must also be affordable. We will continue to work with CMS and FDA to ensure that safer and more effective nonopioids are affordable for the people who need them most. We must find better ways to treat this problem where it starts. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, we were glad to work with Mr. PETERS on his legislation to make it bipartisan and get it across the line. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ). Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, a bipartisan bill that will aid our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis. I am proud that two provisions of mine are included in the final package of the bill. These provisions would establish a mandatory drug management program for atrisk beneficiaries in Medicaid and Medicare. This bipartisan effort shows that we can do things when we put partisan politics aside and work together. I want to thank Chairman WALDEN  for all of his hard work over the past year as we crafted this bill. He led the charge, and I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman, so much. I also want to thank Congressman BENRAYLUJA´N, my Democratic colleague and friend. Five years ago we developed the first drug management program in Medicare, and now we developed a drug management program in Medicaid. Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK ). 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding and for all his work on this issue and continuing to underscore the need to actually fund access to healthcare so that we can curb this horrible epidemic in a meaningful way. One of the many factors that contributes to the opioid crisis is the sheer volume of opioids in circulation. According to the CDC, over 214 million prescriptions were written for opioids in 2016, and we can see that in our own Federal programs. A 2016 study showed that one in three Medicare part D recipients received opioids. That is almost 80 million prescriptions for a cost of $4.1 billion. The sheer volume makes it hard to prevent abuse, addiction, waste, and fraud. Almost 90,000 beneficiaries of Medicare are at serious risk for abuse and overdose, receiving over 2
1⁄2times the recommended dosing. This study eliminated anyone who is on hospice care. Additionally, 70,000 recipients receive an extreme amount of opioids. That is the equivalent of 24 Vicodin every single day. That is why I, along with my colleague, MARKWAYNE MULLIN , have introduced the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act. This bill will require that every prescription written for a Medicare part D beneficiary be prescribed electronically by 2021. We know this technology will save lives by making it harder to forge prescriptions, easier for doctors to know if a patient is doctor shopping, and be able to prevent fraud and save the government money. Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense bill that can help fight the opioid crisis. I am very grateful to Chairman WALDEN and the ranking member for including it in this package. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Ms. CLARK and Mr. M ULLIN for bringing that issue to our attention. We were proud to work with them to get it in the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON ), who is one of our doctors on the committee. Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This bill will help our struggling communities combat the opioid epidemic ravaging our Nation by focusing on providing care to those in need while addressing prevention of opioid misuse and abuse. I am proud that two pieces of legislation that I introduced are included in H.R. 6 as sections 202 and 203. Section 202, which I worked closely with Representative PETERS on to introduce, would incentivize development of nonopioid pain alternatives for postsurgical pain. Section 203 would increase screening for chronic pain, address possible nonopioid pain alternatives, and increase early detection of opioid use disorder in seniors as they enter Medicare. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on solutions to this serious crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ). Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act incorporates legislation that I introduced along with my good friend and colleague, Representative BENRAYLUJA´N of New Mexico, which will provide a meaningful expansion to addiction treatment across our country, especially in rural areas, and for vulnerable populations like pregnant and postpartum women and the 13,000 babies born on average each year with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Our legislation includes three main policy changes to expand access to treatment. First, it eliminates the current sunset provision that would prohibit nurse practitioners and physician assistants from treating patients with addiction medicine after 2021. By ending this sunset, we can provide certainty to our healthcare community and encourage more NPs and PAs to become part of the addiction treatment workforce. Second, this legislation would expand the classes of practitioners eligible to prescribe buprenorphine to other advanced practice nursing professionals to include nurse midwives, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse anesthetists. This provision was included based on feedback that my office has received from medical groups such as the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who are on the front lines of this crisis who have made the case that adding additional classes of highly skilled nurses can help more people access treatment and find that important road to recovery. In many rural areas, advanced practice nurses play an outsized role in providing care, and this legislation will help expand addiction treatment capacity in these rural areas where it is most needed. In addition, these advanced practice nursing professionals are already providing primary care for some of our most vulnerable populations: pregnant and postpartum women. By allowing these skilled providers to provide addiction treatment as well, we can bolster continuity of care for our moms and for our babies. Finally, our legislation would make a technical change that would allow DATA 2000 waivered providers to treat up to 100 patients in their first year if they possess additional credentialing or are practicing in a qualified practice setting. Taken together, these three changes will make a meaningful difference in moving toward a system of treatment on demand for individuals struggling with the disease of addiction. To those who would say we need more data or we need to be cautious about expanding access to treatment, I would respond that more and more people are dying in our streets every day. We don’t have time to drag our feet any longer. Finally, I want to thank Ranking Member PALLONE , Chairman W ALDEN , and their staffs for the continued efforts on these provisions through many months of back and forth. In a personal way and a very upfront way, let me thank Representative PALLONE , our ranking member, and his outstanding staff for the intellect and the energy they poured into this because it truly made this a better bill, and it is going to save lives. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6. Mr. WALDEN. It is now my great honor, Mr. Chairman, to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), who is the majority leader of the United States House of Representatives. He has been extraordinarily helpful in our efforts to move this entire bipartisan package forward to save lives and help people in addiction. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to congratulate the gentleman for his work, his tireless effort, and his passion for those who have been afflicted with the addiction and have lost the battle. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge the passage of H.R. 6 which contains more than 50 opioidrelated bills which we have considered in the past 2 weeks. We have in this body the opportunity nearly every day to approve legislation of great consequence to millions of people. But rarely do the consequences feel so immediate and so vital as they do for the opioids package we are considering. That is because this legislation has to do with the deadliest drug crisis in our Nation’s history. b0945 The grim truth is this: More Americans have died from drug overdoses since the turn of the century than died in the Civil War. Yes, you heard that right. In less than two decades, more than 630,000 people have died because of drugs. Half of those deaths had to do with opioids. This death toll is the ‘‘American carnage’’ that President Trump referred to in his inaugural address. My hometown of Bakersfield has been devastated by illegal drugs, mostly heroin and meth. In 2016 alone, 54 people in my county died of an opioid overdose. This is a statistic made up of 54 stories of unimaginable sadness. They are stories of happy families torn apart by deceit, abuse, and death; stories of parents robbed of children, children robbed of parents, and friends robbed of friends. My local news talked 
to one man in Bakersfield who has lost four friends to overdoses in the past few years alone. Of course, these tragic events are not confined to just my district; they are happening everywhere across the country, coast to coast. So I would like to tell you another story, this time from the other side of the country. It is the story of Eamon Eric Callanan, age 28. He did not live to see age 29. Eamon came from a family with deep roots in Rochester, New York. One of his greatgrandfathers was a chief of police in Rochester. His grandfather was a judge, and his parents are attorneys. They were the very definition, in other words, of a lawabiding family. But in early 2012, a series of events took place that sent Eamon down a different path and stole him from his family forever. At age 25, Eamon hurt his back—a story that many in America have seen—while he was on his job. He began taking opioid painkillers in response to his pain. When the pills became too expensive, Eamon, like many Americans, switched to heroin. Before long, the loyal, goofy kid his family once knew was gone. Drugs had dampened the beautiful music of his life and turned it into a sorrowful echo. Eamon Eric Callanan died of a drug overdose on June 8, 2016. Last Wednesday marked the 2year anniversary of his funeral. In many respects, Eamon’s story is not unique. He was one of 169 people in his county—42,000 people in our country—to die of an opioid overdose that year. Eamon was just one body in a grim tide of overdose deaths. So why am I telling you this story? I am telling it to remind you that each one of those victims had a name and a life and friends and family whom they loved and left behind. One of those people Eamon loved and who loves him deeply in return is actually sitting in this Chamber right now. Her name is Erin. She is Eamon’s sister and my press secretary. Erin was 24 days from her wedding when she learned that she would never see her brother again and that he would not be there to celebrate with her on one of the happiest days of her life. Let that be a lesson to all of us. There is no event so joyful, no place so safe that it is untouched by the drug crisis—even a wedding chapel, even here in the Halls of power, even in my office. Mr. Chair, if we hope to defeat the deadliest drug crisis in history, we will need the biggest response in history. Rest assured that the response is already underway, led by this administration and this Congress. We are wrapping up voting on more than 50 bills to help millions of Americans affected by the opioid crisis. We are about to vote on a package that contains almost all of those bills, H.R. 6. Among others, it contains a bill by Congressman MIKEBISHOP that will reduce the flow of Chinese fentanyl into our country by giving law enforcement new tools to detect suspicious packages in the mail. It includes a reform to the socalled IMD exclusion, an outdated regulation that restricts Medicaid funding for large inpatient treatment programs, programs with the potential to heal substance abuse patients like Eamon. Those are just two of the important bills that are part of this package. It is no exaggeration to say that they can save lives and save families from the immeasurable grief of losing a loved one to an overdose. Yes, I am confident these bills will help stem the tide of drug abuse, but I will end on a note of caution. If defeating the opioid crisis is left to government alone, then we will surely fail. Healing the wounds of drug abuse will take more than just this body can provide; it will take the commitment by every citizen to fulfill our duties to one another. We have all been touched by this tragedy, so we all have a part to play in its resolution. That means supporting people near us who are struggling with drug addiction. It means rebuilding families and towns torn apart by isolation, addiction, distrust, and death. It means supporting the many charities, ministries, and nonprofits that are already healing the sick in our communities. In Bakersfield, that means groups like The Mission, the Christian charity where I volunteer. The Mission operates a faithbased addiction recovery program that is changing lives, even knitting together families that have come apart at the seams. Because of The Mission, a husband and wife with five children overcame their past of drug addiction and drug dealing, and they did it together. Then they convinced their niece to get clean, too. We need more stories like that. In the days ahead, this House has a chance to do its part to ensure that more stories of abuse and despair have their own happy ending. We will do this work for the healers and protectors, for the suffering, and for all those like Eamon who are now at rest. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS). Ms. BASS. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6 and the foster youth who will benefit from its passage. One of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act allows young adults to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they turn 26. It is only fair that young adults who age out of foster care should keep their coverage until they turn 26, too. But when the ACA was implemented, the Department of Health and Human Services gave States the option of covering young adults who aged out of foster care in a different State. For example, if a young adult aged out of the system at 18 and had coverage in California but then moved to New York, New York would have the option to cover them under Medicaid until they turned 26 or not. This extended coverage was never supposed to be optional. After all, former foster youth should have every opportunity to move freely without the fear of losing lifesaving health insurance. This is why I introduced the Health Insurance for Former Foster Youth Act. Last month, over 100 former foster youth were on the Hill and shadowed their Members of Congress. We celebrated that many of the young adults had been accepted to college, some out of State. This bill will ensure that when former foster youth age out of the system, they can keep their healthcare coverage until 26, no matter where they live. This is about fairness. Former foster youth should be treated the same way we treat all young people. I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for including my bill in this bipartisan opioid package. Just this week, The Hill reported the States hardest hit by the opioid epidemic have seen the number of children in foster care or State care increase dramatically. Again, I thank my colleagues for working with me to clarify this law, and I thank Chairman WALDEN and Ranking Member PALLONE for their leadership on this issue. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from California for bringing this issue to our attention and helping us help these kids who need this assistance. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. RYAN), the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, I first want to start by thanking the chair and the ranking member. But for a moment, I would like to address another issue. I want to pause to honor the life of Dr. Charles Krauthammer. Dr. Krauthammer was a widely respected conservative thinker. He wrote columns for which he won a Pulitzer Prize. Paralyzed since college, he wrote the most vigorous commentary of our age. He was a Harvardeducated psychiatrist and had the perfect training to analyze our politics. He passed away yesterday, leaving behind a family that loved him, colleagues that admired him, and grateful friends and readers like myself. If I had to think about this, Charles was a good friend of mine. He had a beautiful mind, and he had a wonderful, wonderful way about him. Simply put, I loved this man. I loved his work. I would marvel over not just what he said, but how he would say it. 
He had a unique ability to take the issue of the moment and place it perfectly in the context of bigger things. ‘‘America is the only country founded on an idea,’’ he would say, and his vocation was the defense of that idea. As great as his intellect was, there was absolutely no arrogance about him. Charles was good company, so gracious, so curious. Take any topic and he had already thought through his argument, your argument, and all the counterarguments before you even got started thinking. He was always willing to enjoy the fight, but with good cheer—he enjoyed it; he reveled in it; he excelled at it. Charles used his immeasurable gifts to contribute to our civic discourse— and he did it civilly—and we are all the better for it. We will be wiser for what he has done for us. I only hope and pray that we can try to emulate his spirit and his sense of wonder and civility. The House and this Nation are in his debt. Our prayers are with his family. Mr. Chair, I rise to express my wholehearted support for H.R. 6. Today, our Nation is fighting a grave opioid epidemic. It is a threat to a generation of young people and the very fabric that holds our communities together. But to me, this legislation is about hope. I have had the honor of speaking with and knowing three brave Wisconsin families who have dealt with this, families that I have gotten to know over the course of time. Kyle Pucek is a guy I know from Janesville. He had an ankle injury treated with opioid medication, just like a lot of people have. He developed a dependency and eventually turned to heroin. He is now clean, and he works with nonprofits in Janesville to encourage others to seek treatment. He is helping make sure people don’t make the mistakes he made. He is making a huge difference. Michelle Jaskulski has two sons, former high school athletes, who became addicted to heroin. They are in recovery. She understands the loneliness that comes with being a mother in this situation. She understands how isolating it can all feel. Now she advocates for more resources to fight this epidemic and supports other families so that they don’t feel like they are facing this fight alone, like she did. Jason Simcakoski was a marine who served our country. He went to a VA hospital looking for help for his anxiety. He was overprescribed opioids, and he lost his life. His family has made it their mission to ensure that others do not experience the same fate. This is the heart of America. After suffering such unspeakable pain, these families overcame. Now they are making it their mission in life to make sure others have a place to turn to and that others don’t have to go down the path they went. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness; it is actually an act of strength. We all have a role to play in this, and it begins with reaching out, with listening, and with being there for one another. All of our institutions at every level should emulate and encourage this kind of fellowship. We should make sure to make clear that no one is alone, that every life matters. This bill has the perfect title: SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. It is bipartisan. It is high time we do it. It is a very, very strong and good step in the right direction. It will advance treatment and recovery; it will improve prevention; it will give resources to communities; and it will fight deadly drugs like fentanyl. So I thank Chairman WALDEN and Chairman BRADY . I also thank Mr. PALLONE and Mr. N EAL. I thank all the members of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee. Let’s not stop here. Let’s not stop until we have instilled hope in all of those who may be struggling. Let’s not stop until we have ended this epidemic. I urge the entire House to vote ‘‘yes.’’ b1000 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CA´RDENAS ). Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Chair, I thank the authors for all the hard work coming to this moment to get this very important bill on the floor. Mr. Chair, I rise today to say how glad I am that my bill, the AtRisk Youth Medicaid Protection Act, has been included in today’s opioid package. According to a June 2017 MACPAC report, the opioid epidemic disproportionately affects Medicaid beneficiaries. Therefore, State Medicaid programs are taking the lead in identifying and tailoring strategies to prevent and treat opioid use disorder. Among those affected are our most vulnerable American population, our youth. Currently, most children who are covered by Medicaid and come into contact with the criminal justice system end up having their enrollment terminated by States. While some States are beginning to suspend instead of terminate their enrollment, only a few States and the District of Columbia suspend their enrollment for the exact duration of the incarceration. This results in unnecessary, costly delays. I say again: When somebody is terminated rather than suspended, this results in an unnecessary, costly delay, delaying their coverage and preventing them from receiving timely and much needed health and mental care upon the child’s release. The AtRisk Youth Medicaid Protection Act would require States to automatically restore the child’s Medicaid enrollment upon their release. Further, States would be required to process applications for medical assistance by or on behalf of the child and make access to medical assistance for children under foster care consistent with the Affordable Care Act by extending the age of eligibility to age 26. Mr. Chairman, we owe it to the American people to do everything in our power to decrease the already 64,000 families broken by this epidemic and restore faith in our government system. While this package covers many fronts, the inclusion of this commonsense bill, the AtRisk Youth Medicaid Protection Act, extends the effort to attack this epidemic from all angles, modifying the package’s foundation. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from California for working with us. We were happy to include his bill in this compilation of legislation. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), our resident pharmacist in the United States Congress and on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for introducing this critical legislation. Since this committee began tackling the opioid epidemic, I have said there are three major parts to the crisis: prevention, treatment, and law enforcement. This legislation touches all three prongs of the opioid crisis with a number of creative solutions, in addition to providing offsets to ensure that solving a public health crisis does not lead to a fiscal one. I voted for many of these bills when they came before the committee for mark up, and I want to offer my full support for this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I want to enter into the RECORD my extended remarks regarding a provision included in H.R. 6 that does not enjoy bipartisan support. Section 301 was passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on a partyline vote. Had a committee report been filed, I would have filed the dissenting views that I am now seeking to have added to the RECORD . Mr. Chair, H.R. 5806, the 21st Century Tools for Pain and Addiction Treatment Act, would require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to hold a public meeting regarding the challenges and barriers of developing non addictive pain and addiction treatments and to issue guidance regarding the eligibility of such treatments for either the Accelerated Approval Program or Breakthrough Therapy Designation. This legislation could undermine FDA’s implementation of the Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation programs and divert critical financial and personnel resources away from activities related to addressing the opioid crisis for purposes of incentivizing an industry that is already taking advantage of these programs. This legislation is a solution in search of a problem. Opioid overdose death rates are now the leading cause of unintentional, nontraumatic deaths in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), overdose deaths from opioids have quadrupled in the last 20 years. Approximately 116 deaths per day occur from an opioid overdose resulting in over 42,000 deaths per year. 
Of those deaths, 40 percent are due to a prescription opioid. Every day, over 1,000 individuals are treated in emergency departments for complications due to the misuse of opioids, and hospitalizations have increased by over 60 percent since 2005. It is within this context that there has been increasing interest in developing nonaddictive treatments for pain and substance use disorders. FDA, led by Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, has acknowledged that the agency has a role to play in addressing the opioid crisis, including ensuring that fewer individuals become addicted through medical use of these products. According to Commissioner Gottlieb, this includes ‘‘helping support the development of new, safe and effective treatments for pain that don’t carry all the same risks of addiction as opioid medicines.’’ One of his first actions was the creation of the Opioid Policy Steering Committee (OPSC) that has been tasked with fostering the development of novel pain treatment therapies, and the advancement of non addictive drugs and devices to treat pain was also included as one of the agency’s priorities in FDA’s 2018 Strategic Policy Roadmap. Despite this, concerns have been raised from some pharmaceutical manufacturers that more could be done to help incentivize manufacturers to develop nonaddictive treatments for pain and addiction. This included legislation that would direct FDA to issue guidance clarifying how and when the agency would provide accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation for medicines to treat pain or addiction. In addition, the proposal includes requiring a detailed annual report in which the agency would account for the number of requests received, granted, or denied for consideration under the expedited programs, the common reasons for granting or denying an application for expedited programs, timelines for drug development, timelines for product review, comparison of metrics among review divisions, common reasons for longer timelines for drug development and product review, as well as recommendations as to how the expedited programs could be better utilized. This legislation was subsequently released by Representative BURGESS  (RTX) and was one of the bills noticed for a hearing on March 21, 2018. At this hearing, a representative from BIO testified that the legislation is needed to ‘‘serve as a powerful signal to stakeholders and investors that treatment and therapies that improve and protect the lives of patients suffering from pain and addiction is a top public health priority.’’ H.R. 5806, the 21st Century Tools for Pain and Addiction Treatment Act, was formally introduced on May 15, 2018, with Reps. BUCSHON and G RIFFITH joining as coauthors. As introduced, the legislation would direct FDA to hold at least one public meeting within one year of enactment to discuss the challenges and barriers of developing nonaddictive medical products intended to treat pain or addiction, including the application of novel clinical trial designs and the use of real world evidence and patient experience, as well as the application of eligibility criteria for the Accelerated Approval program and the Breakthrough Therapy designation. In addition, the bill would also direct FDA to issue final guidance or update existing guidance regarding how the agency would apply eligibility criteria for the Accelerated Approval program and the Breakthrough Therapy designation to nonaddictive medical products for pain or addiction, including considering the risk of addiction to controlled substances for pain when establishing unmet medical need, and considering whether pain, pain control, or pain management in assessing whether a disease or condition is a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition. The guidance must also cover the methods by which sponsors may evaluate acute and chronic pain, endpoints for nonaddictive medical products intended to treat pain and how the endpoints would be evaluated for efficacy. FDA has repeatedly noted that it is actively working with industry and other government partners to encourage the development of nonopioid treatments for pain and addiction. Both former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and current FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb have stated that FDA will use all of the tools at the agency’s disposal to move alternatives to opioids as expeditiously as possible. This is a commitment that Commissioner Gottlieb has continued to echo in testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee (the Committee), specifically noting that ‘‘This includes programs such as Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations that are intended to facilitate development and to expedite review of products that, for example, are intended to treat a serious condition for which there is an unmet medical need. As a part of these efforts, FDA is meeting with innovators who are pursuing nonopioid alternatives for the treatment of pain to provide guidance on their individual products.’’ However, FDA’s commitment to this development has not been limited to testimony before Congress or through meetings with industry. In the last five years, FDA has taken a number of actions to help with development of alternative pain and addiction treatments, including convening the Science Board to discuss issues related to challenges facing FDA in supporting the development of pain medications; issuing final guidance and hosting two public meetings regarding the development of opioids with abuse deterrent properties; and as mentioned previously, the advancement of nonaddictive drugs and devices to treat pain was also included in FDA’s 2018 Strategic Policy Roadmap. Further, the agency also participated in a publicprivatepartnership under the Critical Path initiative, the Analgesic Clinical Trial Translation, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION). ACTTION is a collaboration among a broad range of national and international groups working to advance the science in nonopioid and nonaddictive pain medications, and includes participation from academia, government agencies, pharmaceutical and device companies, professional organizations, and patient advocacy groups. The agency has also approved non opioid medications for treatment of chronic pain, including gabapentin, pregabalin, milnacipran, and duloxetine, among others. These actions are all in addition to the consultation and meetings offered by FDA to sponsors in this space in a oneonone setting. FDA has committed, to discussion with individual sponsors related to questions about the development of nonopioid and nonaddictive medical products for pain or addiction. No evidence has been provided by supporters of this legislation, or by the Majority, that has shown otherwise. FDA has in place four pathways by which review and consideration of a drug can be expedited—Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, and Fast Track. These pathways provide the sponsor of certain drugs with access to assistance and streamlined review from the agency. At issue in H.R. 5806 is the application of Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Accelerated Approval, first established in 1992 and codified in 2012, allows drugs for serious conditions that meet an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. The use of a surrogate endpoint may predict the clinical benefit of a drug earlier, and FDA is able to require the manufacturers to conduct postmarket confirmatory studies to verify the clinical benefit. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation, established in 2012, provides sponsors of drugs to treat a serious condition with preliminary evidence that they demonstrate substantial improvement over other available treatments with access to intensive guidance regarding their drug development program, more frequent meetings and communication with FDA, and rolling review. Both pathways are desirable from a manufacturer’s perspective as it can allow products to come to market sooner. A recent study conducted by Friends of Cancer Research found that cancer drugs that received Breakthrough Therapy Designation received FDA approval nearly three months sooner than drugs that did not, and their development time was reduced by nearly two years. The additional guidance, communication, and expedited review provided by these two programs does have an impact on both the financial and personnel resources of FDA. In fact, the Breakthrough Therapy Designation program received far more interest than originally projected, and given the access to FDA staff throughout the development and review process and has been described by the agency as posing a ‘‘strain’’ because the creation of the designation did not come with any additional resources. According to testimony from Dr. Janet Woodcock, Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, over the first four years of the program the agency had received 492 requests for designation, and of those, granted 165 requests. As a result, industry and FDA negotiated to increase the number of staff dedicated to the Breakthrough Therapy Designation program by 36 fulltime employees as part of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act reauthorization signed into law as a part of the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act. While user fee resources may help to address the issues associated with the implementation of the Breakthrough Therapy Designation program, the Office of New Drugs within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) continues to be shortstaffed with one estimate noting that the Office is 10 percent under the authorized staffing ceiling. As previously mentioned, proponents of the legislation have argued it is necessary in order to help ‘‘enable the utilization of Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy pathways’’ for nonaddictive pain and addiction treatments. ‘‘Enactment and implementation of this legislation would provide FDA and the biopharmaceutical industry with a greater understanding of what is required to meet criteria for these expedited approval pathways and ensure processes intended to expedite development and approval meet the unique needs of 
pain and addiction medicines,’’ noted Ms. Cartier Esham, Executive Vice President, Emerging Companies Section and Senior Vice President, Science & Regulatory Affairs at BIO, in testimony before the Committee. Despite the claims of lack of clarity, there is evidence that industry has been taking advantage of both of these pathways currently. Accordingly, in technical assistance provided by FDA the agency stated, ‘‘We believe, however, that sponsors and potential sponsors of [nonopioid and nonaddictive medical] products are already aware of these programs, and have been taking advantage of them. We also believe that to the extent there is a need for additional outreach on application of the expedited programs to these products, FDA has, and is committed to using, other means to accomplish this, such as public meetings . . . and discussion with individual sponsors.’’ More than 60 percent of new molecular entities and biologics license applications approved in 2017 were eligible for one of the expedited programs—Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review, or Accelerated Approval. This includes products in the pain and addiction space. On Breakthrough Therapy Designation, there have been 19 requests for designation from drugs with pain indications since the program was created, three of those were granted, 14 were denied, and two were withdrawn. According to FDA, ‘‘In general, if a drug meets the statutory criteria it will get the designation.’’ In regard to Accelerated Approval, there has been one drug with an indication for pain; another product has received Fast Track designation. All evidence indicates that sponsors of nonopioid and nonaddictive medical products for pain and addiction are receiving access to FDA and have been able to take advantage of the expedited programs if they meet the statutory criteria. The opioid crisis has made everyone rethink how we treat pain and addiction in this country and there is broad agreement that this conversation should include examining alternatives to opioids that are nonaddictive. Patients and providers deserve to have options other than opioids for pain and addiction. It is clear that FDA has prioritized this effort and has been assisting sponsors in their development. No evidence has been provided that demonstrates otherwise. H.R. 5806 is legislation in search of a problem. A key provision of H.R. 5806 is directing FDA to issue, or update, guidance regarding how the agency will apply the Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation program to nonaddictive medical products for pain or addiction. This would include the circumstances under which FDA may apply eligibility criteria to these products, how FDA will consider the risk of addiction of controlled substances approved to treat pain when establishing unmet medical need, and how FDA will consider pain, pain control, or pain management in assessing whether a disease or condition is a serious or lifethreatening condition. Such an effort would be precedentsetting for the agency as it would be the first time the agency would do such a regulatory guidance for a product specific area. In order to help drug sponsors make determinations about whether or not their products would be eligible for expedited programs pathways, as well as Fast Track and Priority Review, the agency issued comprehensive guidance outlining the requirements and features of each of the pathways in May 2014. As noted in the guidance, ‘‘The purpose of this guidance for industry is to provide a single resource for information on FDA’s policies and procedures for these four programs as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a drug is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs.’’ H.R. 5806 would move to change this by requiring the agency to issue new guidance for nonaddictive pain or addiction treatments. According to technical assistance received from FDA: 
Typically, FDA refrains from issuing product areaspecific guidance documents unless there is a need to address scientific or clinical issues specific to those products. It is not clear what scientific or clinical issues specific to application of our expedited programs to nonopioid or nonaddictive medical products to treat pain or substance use disorder would benefit from FDA guidance. To the extent sponsors have questions about how FDA’s expedited programs apply to their specific products, such questions are better addressed in our existing guidance on the use of expedited programs in general and in meetings or other communications between FDA and individual sponsors. These latter interactions with FDA permit targeted, productspecific discussion of a type that is typically not possible in guidance— even product areaspecific guidance. 
By requiring the agency to issue such guidance, despite FDA’s concerns, H.R. 5806 is now raising questions regarding whether or not the criteria for the expedited programs applies differently for each product area, and could expose the agency to a multitude of additional requests from other therapeutic areas for product areaspecific guidance about the eligibility for these pathways. In addition, H.R. 5806 would also require the agency to host at least one public meeting to examine challenges and barriers facing nonaddictive medical products for pain and addiction, including application of novel clinical trial designs, use of real world evidence and patient experience data, as well as the eligibility criteria for Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Public meetings and guidance require considerable staff time and financial resources, diverting time away from other activities such as meeting oneonone with sponsors or responding to questions regarding submissions. This legislation does not provide any new resources for these activities, and would have been more appropriately discussed during consideration of the user fee reauthorization that could have accounted for the need for additional resources to implement these activities. As FDA has noted, the agency grants access to the expedited programs if products meet the statutory requirements of such programs. Proponents have argued that legislation is necessary to incentivize industry to develop nonaddictive pain and addiction treatments as well as to make sure that the expedited programs and processes ‘‘meet the unique needs of pain and addiction medicines.’’ This makes clear the legislation is not about greater clarity as supporters have argued, but is instead about reinterpreting the requirements of the expedited programs to ensure that nonaddictive pain or addiction treatments will be eligible. H.R. 5806 as such could be used in the future for stakeholder to request the eligibility for the expedited programs be changed to guarantee that their products can receive Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation should the guidance provided under this legislation not be suffice. This could have the effect of unintentionally weakening the benefits of Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation pathway by expanding it to even more products, and put strain on FDA’s resources by expanding such programs to products that were not planned for under the user fee reauthorizations. While we all want to bring alternatives to opioids to market sooner, we must seriously consider the implications of expanding FDA’s expedited programs. Finally, this is not legislation that FDA has asked for or highlighted as a priority in fighting the opioid crisis. While the agency has indicated that they are not opposing the legislation and believe the changes that have been made are helpful, this legislation can have real and serious implications for the drug approval process. It is for all these reasons that Democrats unanimously opposed H.R. 5806. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ), who has been very, very involved in this effort. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this bipartisan package, H.R. 6. The Energy and Commerce Committee, under the leadership of Chairman WALDEN , has again delivered for the American people on the pressing public health challenges facing the Nation. From combating childhood cancer, to improving mental health care, to fighting the scourge of drug addiction, the Energy and Commerce Committee produces results. The menace of drug abuse and addiction has manifested itself in opiates. Every corner of this country has known the heartache of losing a life from this terrible problem. Congress has acted before with passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, but CARA needs reinforcement. H.R. 6 delivers more resources, treatment, and mitigation tools to fight opiate addiction. Included in this package is the Eliminating OpioidRelated Infectious Diseases Act, legislation I have authored with my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Congressman JOSEPH P. K ENNEDY III. Infectious diseases compound and complicate the lifelong path toward recovery from substance abuse, and threaten the lives and safety of the loved ones of those addicted, especially children. This is how Congress is supposed to work, both sides coming together to confront a national crisis, going through the committee process with bipartisan bills, and getting to the root of the country’s challenges. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ), who has been very involved in this effort as well. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for your leadership and for the work my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee are doing to tackle the opioid crisis. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. Everywhere I go around Michigan, I hear about the opioid crisis plaguing our State and country. It is a deeply personal and painful issue for many of our friends and loved ones, including the family of Jessie Grubb, whose life was cut short. Her family grieves that a mistake was made that, because of our legislation, hopefully, will never happen again. Over the past 2 weeks, the House has considered more than 70 bills to enhance treatment and recovery programs, increase prevention efforts, protect communities, and fight the synthetic drug fentanyl. These measures include two bipartisan bills I introduced with Congresswoman DEBBIE  DINGELL . They have been incorporated into legislation we are voting on today, including Jessie’s Law. This is an urgent crisis, and I urge the Senate to take swift action and advance these solutions. There is not a moment to waste. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN ). Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman WALDEN and the entire Energy and Commerce Committee for their work on this important legislation. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is yet another bipartisan effort aimed at preventing further opioid abuse and assisting those currently dealing with this addiction. This legislation will strengthen our efforts to advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and bolster the fight against deadly illicit drugs. We have made meaningful progress in our fight against the opioid epidemic throughout the country by passing more than 50 bills in the House, but our work is far from over. No community is immune from this crisis. In 2016 alone, more than 1,300 Georgians lost their lives to opioid abuse. Many of them in my community, my closest friends, have had to deal with this. Our Senate colleagues should take note of this important work that we have done here in the House over the past 2 weeks to combat the opioid crisis, and I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the staff who worked so hard on H.R. 6 and the opioid bills, in general. Democrats worked to make H.R. 6 a better bill, even though we have concerns about the overall impact of the opioid package. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We have had individual Members come to the floor today from both parties. Together, we have broken through what others might see as dysfunction in Washington to achieve a comprehensive legislative package that will provide treatment; save lives; stop illegal fentanyl from coming into this country; and, in no small measure, move America forward in a much better direction. I want to share with you, Mr. Chair, a letter to the Speaker and to Ms. PELOSI , urging us to support H.R. 6. It comes from not 1 or 2 but, literally, 161 different groups that are very involved in the recovery effort. I want to share a couple of comments, Mr. Chairman: ‘‘Substance use disorder not only impacts the individual, but the family and community as well. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, approximately 9 million children across our Nation live in a home with at least one parent who uses an illicit drug. ‘‘Tragically,’’ they write, ‘‘children in these homes are at an increased risk for depression, suicide, poverty, delinquency, anxiety, homelessness, and substance use disorder. In addition, while our Nation has made significant strides in both our understanding and response to the drug crisis, it is clear that too many communities across our Nation still have fragmented prevention, treatment, and recovery infrastructures.’’ Introduced by myself, Mr. PALLONE , Mr. NEAL, and Mr. B RADY , they write: ‘‘The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act,’’ this bill, ‘‘would strengthen key Federal lowincome assistance and senior health insurance programs to better respond to our Nation’s drug crisis. In addition to serving as the vehicle that will advance many other significant proposals already considered in the House, this legislation will give critical Federal safety net programs more tools to prevent and help treat substance use disorder.’’ They write: ‘‘We applaud the champions of H.R. 6 for treating addiction like the disease that it is and for their bold leadership, in their respective committees and on the House floor, to advance so many innovative, bipartisan proposals that will have an immediate and positive impact to address addiction. We respectfully urge the full House to immediately consider and pass H.R. 6, which represents a significant step toward building the comprehensive response needed in our Nation so that fewer lives are lost to substance use disorder.’’ Mr. Chair, this comes from the people who live this every day, who help our neighbors, our friends, our families, and our American citizens get the help they need to beat the disease of addiction and to reclaim their lives, their families, and their future. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 6, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, the opioid crisis has impacted every community in America and robbed countless individuals of their potential. A recent poll found that more than 4 out of 10 Americans who are young, in their 20s and 30s, personally know someone who has dealt with opioid addiction. It is a staggering number, and it shows that this crisis touches a huge part of our society. All too often, we hear stories of loved ones exposed to opioids, and then quickly addicted, from routine surgeries that may not have required opioid treatment in the first place. This can be prevented. That is why I rise today in support of H.R. 6, known as the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This bill, which incorporates legislation recently approved by the Ways and Means Committee, addresses this crisis by putting in place many commonsense measures to reduce the unnecessary prescription of opioids and also to help those who have become addicted. One important policy within H.R. 6, which has been championed by Congressman PETER ROSKAM , who leads our Subcommittee on Health, will prevent abuse by making sure folks are not able to game the system by visiting multiple doctors’ offices in order to receive an opioid. H.R. 6 ensures that patients have selected prescribers and selected pharmacies that will be best able to address their needs. Another important measure expands access to more forms of really broad, holistic treatments for addiction through the use of medicationassisted treatment. Americans who are struggling with addiction must be able to find treatment that works for them. b1015 While we still have a long way to go to solve this crisis, this bill, which is made up of many commonsense, Republican and Democrat proposals, takes meaningful strides to help millions of Americans recapture their lost hopes and dreams. I thank Representatives MIKE BISHOP , D AVE REICHERT , C ARLOS  CURBELO , PETER ROSKAM , ERIKPAULSEN, and J ACKIE WALORSKI for their leadership on this important issue. And I thank all of our committee members, Republicans and Democrats, for their hard work on this important legislation. I look forward to working with the Senate to ensure that we send this important bill to the President’s desk. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6. It has become all too clear that the ongoing opioid epidemic has gripped our Nation’s families and communities. It crosses social spectrums and is a public health, safety, and economic crisis as well. In Massachusetts in 2016 there were 2,083 confirmed cases of opioidrelated overdose deaths. This is a 26 percent increase from 2015 and a 54 percent increase from 2014. In 2017 there was a small decrease, but clearly there was still a strong need to address this devastating trend. This week, the House has considered opioid bills in committee and on the floor, and some of these, in fact, will expand treatment options for the care that is necessary. However, a number of the Democratic priorities here, I think, really provide real investment and opportunity. For example, it incorporates a bill I introduced that would expand Medicare coverage for opioid treatment programs. Currently, Medicare does not cover this sort of treatment. This would give Medicare beneficiaries access to a broad range of treatment options, leading to opportunities for lasting recovery. Although many think of opioid use disorders as a problem faced by young people, many may be surprised to learn that it is rapidly growing among our Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare part D spending on opioids for treatment outpaces enrollment, growing 165 percent from 2006 to 2015. In 13 States, the over65 population has the highest rate of opioidrelated inpatient stays. H.R. 6 also expands coverage of medicationassisted treatments and allows nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe or dispense certain opioid treatment drugs. The measure also provides consistent Medicaid coverage for atrisk youth and expands Medicaid coverage for foster youth until the age of 26. These bills are pieces of a large, complex puzzle. We need to find realistic solutions with longterm outcomes. Part of this approach is to protect and strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. The ACA guarantees parity and nondiscrimination for people who need substance use disorder treatment and mental health treatment. Thanks to the ACA, millions of previously uninsured adults now have access to health insurance and, I might add, the expansion of Medicaid. There are many efforts here, I think, time and time again, to dismantle the Medicare proposal, as well as cutting back on many of the initiatives that we have proposed in the past. Instead of strengthening and ensuring a sustainable future for the ACA and for Medicaid, some of our colleagues want to cut them to pay for a $2.3 trillion tax plan. Efforts to sabotage the ACA, coupled with premium hikes, slashing preexisting condition protections, and increasing drug prices will lead to more uncertainty. Dismantling current health benefits would damage any progress that we are making today with the opioid crisis. It would also increase healthcare costs and lower coverage and quality of life for Americans and their families. I urge my colleagues to recognize that many families, who are devastated by addiction, are going to need the opportunities that we are embracing today. The impact of the opioid crisis on the labor participation rates in America should concern all of us. According to a recent report, the economic burden from opioids was estimated at $95 billion. The American people are facing two pronged obstacle health challenges. Uncertainty remains one of them. We want to make sure that we don’t sabotage the ACA. And part of the path forward today is highlighted by the achievement we are all about to recognize. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROSKAM ), the leader of the Health Subcommittee. Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman BRADY for his leadership on this. I have done a lot of work over the past several months, as I know we all have, of listening to my constituents in suburban Chicago, and here is what I have heard: They want us to take a multifaceted approach. One of the things that I am doing this morning is highlighting a portion of this bill that Mr. BRADY mentioned in his opening statement, and that is a lockin phenomenon. Here is the story: The power of this molecule, when it gets into our bodies, is breathtaking and is sobering. Here is one statistic that should make us shudder: Onethird of part D Medicare beneficiaries were prescribed an opioid in 2016—onethird of Medicare part D beneficiaries were prescribed an opioid in 2016. There is nothing good that is going on with that. So here is what we are trying to do: We are saying that we need to resist pharmacy shopping. We need to resist doctor shopping. And we need to make sure that people can be identified who have a predisposition towards this addiction. So what this bill does—what part of this bill does—is it says: Medicare part D programs don’t just have the option of requiring a lockin program, we are now locking in on lockin. We are saying: You have got to do this. Unambiguously, it is a mandate, it is a good mandate, and it is something that has been a long time coming. TRICARE uses this, and a number of other distribution systems use it, but the time is ripe and we have absolutely got to get this done. It is part of a holistic approach that I think is really welcome. Mr. Chairman, I congratulate and thank Mr. LEVIN, the ranking member; Mr. BILIRAKIS ; and Mr. L UJA´N, also who similarly worked on this legislation. I am confident that in 10 years’ time, our country, based on the work that this House is doing now, is going to reflect back, and it is going to say: America responded. We did it on a bipartisan basis. And we are going to be having a better and different conversation. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS). Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. NEALfor yielding. Mr. Chairman, I support H.R. 6 as a step to the puzzle to address substance abuse. However, I think we need to expand this bill in an important way as it moves forward. To prevent opioid addiction, we must address the social and emotional harm caused by trauma that often underlies opiate use. Research demonstrates that exposure to four or more adverse childhood experiences, such as neglect, experiencing a parent battling addiction, witnessing violence, or observing domestic violence, makes an individual 10 times more likely to misuse illicit narcotics. These drugs serve as a coping response to traumatic life experiences. The Senate’s bipartisan Opioid Crisis Response Act included provisions from my TraumaInformed Care Act with Senator DURBIN to help improve the Federal response to trauma to help prevent opioid abuse. These provisions would expand the workforce capacity to help children exposed to trauma, they would improve our understanding of trauma by improving Federal data and best practices, and they would increase services for children exposed to trauma to help these young people heal. Our efforts to prevent the opioid crisis will be insufficient unless we address the role of trauma in it, which is why 28 organizations supported my effort to amend H.R. 6 to focus on trauma—organizations like the Child Welfare League of America, the Jewish Child and Family Services, the National Association of Social Workers, Partners for Our Children with the University of Washington, and the YMCA USA—but my amendment was not made in order. The science is clear that trauma has devastating effects on a child’s healthy development well into adulthood. When children experience traumatic events, stress alters the developing brain, which harms them physically and mentally. Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD this outline of the research by 
the Society for Research in Child Development documenting the harm caused by trauma and parental separation. 
[From the Society for Research in Child Development, June 20, 2018] STATEMENT OF THE EVIDENCE —THESCIENCE  ISCLEAR : SEPARATING FAMILIES HASLONG TERM DAMAGING PSYCHOLOGICAL AND  HEALTH CONSEQUENCES FOR CHILDREN , FAMILIES , ANDCOMMUNITIES  After the United States Department of Justice announced the ‘‘Zero olerance Policy for Criminal Illegal Entry,’’ Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE—an arm of the Department of Homeland Security) separated approximately 2,000 children from their parents in April and May 2018 as they approached the U.S. border. Children and parents were placed in separate facilities as they were being processed and were not told when or how they would be reunited. This policy and its consequences have raised significant concerns among researchers, child welfare advocates, policy makers, and the public, given the overwhelming scientific evidence that separation between children and parents, except in cases where there is evidence of maltreatment, is harmful to the development of children, families, and communities. Family separations occurring in the presence of other stressors, such as detention or natural disaster, only adds to their negative effects. 
CHILD SEPARATION  The evidence that family separation is harmful dates back to studies on the effects of parentchild separations on children’s wellbeing during World War II. This research documented far reaching effects of these separations into adulthood, including increased risk for mental health problems, poor social functioning, insecure attachment, disrupted stress reactivity, and mortality (Pesonen & Raikkonen, 2012; Rusby & Tasker, 2009; Mitrani, Santisteban, & Muir, 2004). Other research similarly documents the harmful effects of parental separation on child wellbeing in a variety of other child populations including children in Romanian orphanages (Zeanah, Nelson, Fox, et al., 2003), children in foster care (Flannery, Beauchamp, & Fisher, 2017) and children of incarcerated parents (Geller, Garfinkel, Cooper & Mincy, 2009; Miller, 2006). More recent work has documented the increased mental health risk faced by both parents and children when they are separated in the immigration process (SuarezOrozco, Bang, & Kim., 2011; Rusch & Reyes, 2013). Parent child separation has longterm effects on child wellbeing, even if there is subsequent reunification. After being separated, reunited children can experience difficulty with emotional attachment to their parents, selfesteem, and physical and psychological health (Smith, Lalonde, & Johnson, 2004; Gubernskaya & Debry, 2017). For some children, time does not appear to fully heal these psychological wounds (Shonkoff et al., 2012). 
EFFECTS OF TOXIC STRESS  Parental separation is considered a toxic stressor, an experience that engages strong and prolonged activation of the body’s stressmanagement system (Bridgman, 2014) The physiological and psychological toll of early life stress, including parental separation, changes how the body responds to stress in the long term, disrupting higher order cognitive and affective processes as well as negatively altering brain structures and functioning (Lupien, McEwen, Gunnar, & Heim, 2009; Pechtel & Pizzagalli, 2011; Kumar et al., 2014). Such stressors put children at greater risk for a multitude of health and psychological impairments, including anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, lower IQ, obesity, immune system functioning, physical growth, cancer, heart and lung disease, stroke, and morbidity (Granqvist, Sroufe, Dozier, Hesse, & Steele, 2017, Heim & Nemeroff, 2001; Mamam, Antornadis, & Morris, 2014; Pechtel & Pizza galli, 2011; Shirtdiff, Coe, & Pollak, 2009; Taylor, 2010). Children depend on their primary caretakers to successfully navigate stressful and traumatic events. Children’s physiological responses to stress can be significantly reduced by access to their primary caretaker (Hostinar, Sullivan, & Gunnar, 2013). The separation of the family unit under extreme conditions of stress worsens the psychological and physiological ramifications of that stressor on children, especially younger children (Masten & Narayan, 2012). Conversely, ongoing contact with primary caregivers under conditions of stress can protect against risk (Rodriguez & Margolin, 2015). CHILD SEPARATION FROM PARENTS IMPACTS  
CHILDREN AT ALL AGES  Much of the research on family separation has focused on the impacts on children early in development. However, puberty is also an especially vulnerable time of rapid change (Doom & Gunnar, 2013). Stressors during adolescence can have lasting impacts—the effects of which may not become evident until adulthood—(Humphreys, Gleason, Drury, et al., 2015; Lupien, McEwen, Gunnar, & Heim, 2009). Further, the effects of traumatic experiences are cumulative; children and adolescents who have already faced previous adversity are particularly susceptible to long term further negative consequences (Brown, Anda, & Tiemeier, et al, 2009, MacKenzie, Bosk, & Zeanah, 2017) Thus, the research shows that across infancy, childhood, and adolescence, childfamily separations can be related to negative outcomes across the lifespan. 
U.S. CITIZENS  There is also evidence that family separations harm U S. citizens whose family members experience border detention or deportation. Parental separation increases the risk for these U.S. children’s mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, behavior problems, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (Allen, Cisneros, & Tellez, 2015; RojasFlores, Clements, Hwang Koo, & London, 2017; Zayas, AguilarGaxiola, Yoon, & Rey, 2015). U.S. citizens of Latino descent also report heightened worries and concerns for their families and their communities as a result of changes in implementation of immigration policies such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy (Roche, Vaquera, White, & Rivera, 2018). Moreover, countries with supportive integration policies are more likely to have child populations with better overall health and mental health indicators than those with less supportive approaches (Marks, McKenna, & Garcia Coll, 2018). Thus, there is evidence that policies about parental separations can negatively affect American citizens. 
THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE CLEAR  The scientific evidence is conclusive. Parentchild separations lead to a host of long term psychological, social, and health problems that are not necessarily resolved upon reunification. In particular, the disruption of biological stress regulation mechanisms in the body induced by the need to seek refugee or asylum status are further taxed by the absence of parental support. The science is clear: policies that separate immigrant families upon entry to the U.S. have devastating and longterm developmental consequences for children and their families. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. That is why the administration’s intentional infliction of trauma on children by separating children from their parents is so cruel and inhumane. Causing intentional harm to children is a human rights violation and is un American. We must stop this appalling policy immediately, reunite parents and children without delay, and provide intensive services to help these families heal. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BISHOP ), the leader of the STOP Act, which prevents illegal smuggling of fentanyl into the United States. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman BRADY for his steadfast leadership in finding a solution to this crisis. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. I am pleased that we are voting on this legislation today, which includes important reforms to Medicare and Medicaid policies, to help combat the opioid crisis in our country. Mr. Chairman, the opioid crisis has affected every segment of our Nation’s population. Every Member of this Chamber has a community in crisis. Each and every day, 115 Americans die from opioid overdoses. We are talking about valued members of our communities: mothers, fathers, and, especially, so many young children who have left us way too early because of the tragedy of opioids. As I travel across my district in Michigan, I hear frequently from constituents about this crisis at townhall meetings and roundtables I have hosted. I have heard personal stories from constituents about the devastating impact this crisis is having in southeast Michigan. I have also been meeting with elected officials across the district on this crisis, including firefighters, police officers, emergency responders, and medical professionals. They all want me to do something, do it urgently, and for Congress to be involved. While there is no silver bullet to address this issue, I am pleased that over the past several weeks the House has passed over 70 bills to address the opioid crisis. It includes the legislation that I authored, the STOP Act, to stop the flow of synthetic opioids into the country. H.R. 6 will do more than that. It will expand the Medicare coverage for opioid treatment services, like substance abuse counseling, individual and group therapy, and medicationassisted treatment. These reforms will empower our Americans to overcome addiction and once again become productive members of our society. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank Chairman BRADY and Chairman W ALDEN for 
their leadership in crafting this legislation, and for their steadfast leadership to address the opioid crisis. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING ). Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chairman, I would like to highlight the importance of medicationassisted treatment in combating the opioid epidemic. This epidemic has pervaded all populations, including our seniors. Medicare beneficiaries have among the highest and fastest rate of opioid use disorder, yet they do not currently have coverage for the most effective treatment. The SUPPORT Act, which will be before the House today, would change that. This bill provides for a fully coordinated, bundledcare model that will help patients through medication assisted treatment, which combines the use of medication with counseling, group therapy, and drug testing. Just this week, the NIH released a study that found delivering medicationassisted treatment to patients following an opioid overdose dropped the death rate by 59 percent. The President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis also cited the value of medicationassisted treatment in reducing overdoses and relapses while retaining patients in a treatment program. For example, a constituent named Jeff from North Carolina became dependent on opioids after a difficult back surgery. He initially tried to stop cold, but went into withdrawal and relapsed. Fortunately, Jeff was able to receive treatment from the Goldsboro Comprehensive Treatment Center where he went through counseling. His progress was monitored, and monthly drug screens kept him accountable. He—Jeff—now says that his life has changed 100 percent for the better. b1030 Every Member of this House has constituents just like Jeff who have struggled with addiction but can regain their life with the right treatment. While there is no silver bullet to this crisis, we need to ensure patients and doctors have all options at their disposal to combat the opioid epidemic. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ), a leader on the opioid crisis. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman BRADY for all of his work. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support for the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. It includes my bill, the Dr. Todd Graham Pain Management, Treatment, and Recovery Act, that passed the House earlier this week. H.R. 6 is also vital for equipping those on the front lines with important treatment and recovery initiatives. This includes people in my district like Erin LaCourt at Victory Clinical Services in South Bend. Victory provides comprehensive treatment for individuals with substance abuse disorders, but H.R. 6 will help them expand those services to include seniors. This bill will also help Justin Phillips, who founded Overdose Lifeline, which is dedicated to helping those affected by addiction, assist even more Hoosiers on their road to recovery. Solving the opioid epidemic requires every one of us to work together. I want to thank Erin, Justin, and all the other hardworking Hoosiers in my district who deserve recognition and to let them know we have noticed all their hard work. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I want to close by thanking Chairman KEVIN BRADY and acknowledging Chairman WALDEN and Ranking Member PALLONE for their hard work on what is really a good step forward. As I said earlier in my remarks, this bill is not going to solve the opioid crisis tomorrow, but it does include a number of important provisions that will expand access to treatment and recovery options for all Americans. This was a bipartisan piece of work in our committee. I think we can be proud of it. We know many who need treatment now cannot access it, and this bill will take significant steps to change that. I want to thank Jessica Shapiro and Karl Hagnauer from the House Legislative Counsel for their hours of work in helping us to put together H.R. 6; the staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Office of Legislation, in particular Ira Burney and Jennifer Druckman; and the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, including Rebecca Yip and Lara Robillard. Finally, I want to thank the Ways and Means Republican staffers led by Emily Murry, the Energy and Commerce Democratic staff led by Tiffany Guarascio, the Energy and Commerce Republican staff led by Josh Trent, and my own Democratic staff at Ways and Means, which is always superb, led by Amy Hall, Melanie Egorin, and Rachel Dolin. A lot of hard work goes into this sort of legislation and a lot of complexities have to be addressed during the process, and oftentimes that is not the sort of information that finds its way to the public light. But acknowledging here those people who helped to put this together as well as the men and women of the committee, I think, frequently is missed, and we want to do that so that they receive the, I think, due praise that they are entitled to. I hope that this, when matched with Senate provisions, will quickly become law. One of the things that unites every one of us in this Chamber is that we all know somebody—a family member, somebody who lives down the street, or a coworker—who has an opiate addiction. I think that Congress taking this step today in this direction will provide some sense of hope for those families and friends who find themselves, for a variety of reasons, suffering from the pain economically and physically that comes from opiate addictions. I think, as we close here, this is a good day for the Ways and Means Committee, Energy and Commerce Committee, and, I think, for the members and the staffers whose work is reflected in this product. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chair, I agree with Mr. NEAL. Republicans and Democrats have come together from the Ways and Means Committee and Energy and Commerce to help millions of Americans through prevention of overprescribing, education for patients and prescribers, and access to treatment. This is a major step forward. Mr. Chair, I urge Congress to pass this bill. I look forward to getting it to the President’s desk. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. POEof Texas). All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate all the work that has been done on this bill up to this point, the great bipartisan work, the biggest effort, I think, Congress has ever undertaken to address this terrible, terrible addiction problem of opioids and everything related to it. This amendment before us is a bipartisan manager’s amendment. It is filed by chairmen and ranking members of the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means. This amendment makes simple technical corrections and conforming changes to the underlying H.R. 6 bill that the leaders of our two committees introduced last week. As has been noted, the policies in H.R. 6 were moved through regular order in our two committees. I appreciate the bipartisan cooperation and teamwork of my colleagues and our terrific staffs who have joined me in introducing H.R. 6. Mr. Chair, I encourage support of the amendment, and I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally.

Pursuant to House Resolution 949, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 6. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about it. My amendment strikes language that would expand the classes of healthcare workers who would be authorized to dispense narcotics for narcotic treatment. Let me be clear at the outset. H.R. 6 is, in large part, a great bill; however, as currently written, it allows nurse specialists, nurse midwives, and nurse anesthetists to prescribe buprenorphine. I believe this is a significant and impulsive expansion of prescribing authority. Allowing more providers with less clinical experience to provide buprenorphine, a highly addictive opioid, opens up dangerous new potential for increased opioid abuse. The point of H.R. 6 is to decrease opioid abuse, but this provision increases the potential for abuse and vastly increases the supply of a dangerous opioid that is one of the major causes of opioid overdose and death in Europe. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to bring these concerns to light in this amendment. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a letter in support of my amendment from The OTP Consortium. 
THEOTP C ONSORTIUM , June 19, 2018. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Jr., Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. RICHARD NEAL, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMEN WALDEN AND BRADY AND  RANKING MEMBERS PALLONE AND NEAL: On behalf of the Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) Consortium we would like to offer our support for H.R. 6, the Substance UseDisorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act. In particular, we strongly support Section 207 which would provide Medicare beneficiaries with lifesaving MedicationAssisted Treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) in the highlyeffective OTP setting. This policy was introduced by Ranking Member Neal and Congressman George Holding as part of H.R. 5776, the Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act of 2018. The OTP Consortium is comprised of nearly 350 OTPs across the country that provide care to more than 140,000 patients daily in 37 states, including at our 22 facilities in Massachusetts, 16 facilities in Texas, nine facilities in Oregon, and two facilities in New Jersey. OTPs are highlyregulated, highlystructured, comprehensive treatment programs that provide MAT—which the National Institutes of Health states is the most effective solution to treat OUD. OTPs are the only provider where patients are guaranteed to receive MAT—including individual and group counseling, random toxicology screens, medication, and other supportive services such as case management, primary care, mental health services, HIV and Hepatitis C testing and more. Medicare beneficiaries have the highest and fastest growing rate of OUD, yet they do not currently have coverage for the most effective form of treatment—H.R. 6 provides such coverage. More than 300,000 Medicare beneficiaries have been diagnosed with OUD—your legislation could end up saving their lives and many more. Medicare hospitalizations due to complications caused by opioid abuse or misuse increased 10% every year from 1993 to 2012—your bill would help reverse this alarming trend. We do, however, have concerns about the policies contained in Section 303. While we are pleased that the 275patient threshold was not codified, we do not support expanding or making permanent buprenorphine prescribing authority to nonphysician providers before policymakers can fully analyze the data resulting from the critical questions asked in subsection (e). Americans need effective treatment and decades of evidence and outcomes show that medication simply assists the other treatment interventions. Medication should never be the sole aspect of treating SUD—thus the term MedicationAssisted Treatment. Officebased practices that focus on medication alone run the risk of becoming the nextgeneration pill mill. We hope that Congress will revisit officebased buprenorphine prescribing thresholds once this quality assessment has been completed and it can be determined whether or not patients are indeed truly receiving MAT in these settings. Improving access to buprenorphine is important, but it must be paired with the evidencebased MAT services that are proven to lead to recovery. We support H.R. 6 and stand ready to work with you see that this critical Medicare OTP benefit is signed into law, without delay. Sincerely, PETER MORRIS , Division President, Acadia Healthcare. ALEXDODD, CEO, Aegis Treatment Centers, LLC. DAVID WHITE, PH.D., CEO, BayMark Health Service. JAYHIGHAM , CEO, Behavioral Health Group. JOHNSTEINBRUN , CEO, New Season. 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I certainly appreciate Dr. DUNNand the good work that he has done on many of these issues, and I also appreciate his willingness to withdraw his amendment. 
As a result of our committee process and various member conversations we have had, we have reached bipartisan compromise on the underlying bill on the issue of concern to Mr. DUNN. I understand that thoughtful Members can find themselves on different sides of an issue at different times, and I certainly respect the gentleman’s position. That being said, we believe our underlying policy represents a fair middle ground, and it ensures rigorous analysis on the issue going forward. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman from Florida withdrawing the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ). Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman WALDEN for yielding. Although I know my colleague plans to withdraw, I rise in opposition to this amendment, and I just want to articulate a bit of my reasoning. I think my colleagues and I both share the same goal of safely expanding access to addiction treatment. Where we differ is that I believe that the provisions in H.R. 6 expanding buprenorphine prescribing privileges to advanced practice nurses meet that test. We all know that there is a dire need for expanded treatment capacity to meet the demands of this current epidemic. As many as 40 percent of counties across the country lack even a single provider that is able to offer buprenorphine. Advanced practice nurses play an outsized role in providing care in rural America, and H.R. 6 will help expand addiction treatment capacity into these communities where it is most needed. Expanding buprenorphine prescribing privileges to APRNs is supported by medical groups that serve on the front lines of this epidemic, such as the American Society for Addiction Medicine and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. All advanced practice nurses who wish to prescribe medicationassisted treatment would have to receive a special waiver from the DEA and would have to undergo three times as much specialized addiction training as their physician colleagues. In addition, in order to receive a waiver, practitioners are required to be able to provide appropriate counseling and ancillary services that are the hallmark of highquality addiction treatment. All APRNs wishing to prescribe buprenorphine would still be subject to State laws regarding prescription authority, scope of practice, and collaboration or supervision requirements with a physician. While I understand that providing addiction treatment is a complex and nuanced area of medicine with potential complications if done poorly, I would point out that we don’t restrict advanced practice registered nurses in Federal law from providing such high risk services as delivering babies, administering anesthesia, or prescribing as many opioids as they wish. Why would we want to maintain an outdated barrier in Federal law that prevents these practitioners from being part of the solution to the opioid epidemic? So in closing, I appreciate that my colleagues are withdrawing this amendment today, and I would urge that, as we move forward toward a potential conference committee, we continue to recognize the role that advanced practice nurses can play in addressing this epidemic. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), the chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. As a practicing physician for over 30 years, I have incredible respect for nurses and the work they do. I married a nurse. Some of the best employees I have worked with were nurses. I could not appreciate the job they do more, Mr. Chair, but care for patients is better directed with physician oversight. Even with my training, we need fewer doctors like me writing these prescriptions and more physicians trained in pain management. The American Society of Addiction Medicine is establishing approved fellowships in training in addiction medicine today. Expanding the scope of practice for nonphysician providers to dispense drugs like buprenorphine goes in the wrong direction, in my opinion. There are many factors that contribute to the explosive growth in opioid use, but clearly a big factor was the lack of knowledge about opioids’ addictive qualities. I would argue that we have a similar lack of knowledge about buprenorphine today, and allowing providers who have less training and less knowledge about these substances exponentially increases the chances of abuse in these substances. b1045 If we remove the most highlytrained specialist from administration of buprenorphine, I fear that all the good we are trying to do in this bill could be negated. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DUNN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. There are plenty of provisions to support in this underlying bill. It is a good bill, but section 303 is not one of them. I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ). Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Chairman, I thank Dr. DUNNfor leading this amendment. I had an over threedecade experience and great working relationship with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, as well as nurse anesthetists. I believe one of the secrets to that great work that we did was the collaboration between us and how we worked together. I firmly believe that whenever narcotics are involved, there needs to be a very close working relationship between the supervising physician and these other groups and societies. As narcotic and opioid abuse has become a national crisis, we need to be working even more closely together so as not to exacerbate the problem. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chair, buprenorphine was introduced in Finland in 1997, and now it has become the most widely abused opioid in that country. Buprenorphine can kill people. It does kill people. And officebased practices involving merely prescribing buprenorphine run a large risk of harming patients, not helping them to recover. In closing, I want to thank you for working with me on this amendment, and I thank Chairman WALDEN for his gracious commitment to continue to examine. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . BARTON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 115–766. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title III, insert the following new section: 
SEC. 304. HIGHQUALITY, EVIDENCEBASED OPIOID ANALGESIC PRESCRIBING GUIDELINES AND REPORT.

(f) DEFINITION .—In this section, the term ‘‘evidencebased’’ means informed by a robust and systemic review of treatment efficacy and clinical evidence. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 949, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, we have a great piece of legislation before us today. Chairman WALDEN and Ranking Member PALLONE have been great leaders in shepherding dozens of opioidrelated bills through the Energy and Commerce Committee. This particular bill, H.R. 6, is the crown jewel of all that legislation. We all know what a scourge the opioid epidemic is. Since 2015, more Americans have died annually from opioid overdoses than from the AIDS epidemic at its peak. The amendment that is before us today is very simple. It requires the FDA, after consultation with all the stakeholders in open meetings and workshops, to develop some opioid prescription guidelines based on hard evidence. This amendment gives the FDA 2 years to develop these guidelines. It requires the FDA to post the guidelines on their web page and to send the guidelines to the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House and to the Education and Workforce committee over in the Senate. It is a bipartisan amendment. Congresswoman ANNIE KUSTER of New Hampshire and Congressman MARK MEADOWS of North Carolina have both worked with myself and other members of the committee to develop this amendment. Opioids are a little bit different than some of the other drugs that are abused and lead to addiction in that most people are exposed to opioids the first time because of a prescription. They have some sort of acute pain that opioids can help manage and in prescribing these opioids the doctors are trying to help alleviate the pain. But everyone reacts to opioids somewhat differently, and sometimes what is acceptable in terms of the dosage for one individual is not acceptable with another individual. These guidelines will, again, be based on facts, be based on evidence. They are advisory only. We are not trying to intervene in the doctor/patient relationship. It will still be up to the doctor to determine what is best for the patient. But at least the doctor will have some factbased guidelines with which to make the decision on what level to prescribe these opioids if, in fact, opioids are necessary. To quote the head of the FDA, Dr. Scott Gottlieb: ‘‘Without evidence based dosing recommendations at the point of care to support and inform rational prescribing, we’re at serious risk of both undertreating some patients who could benefit from opioid therapy, and overtreating a lot of patients who are then placed at a higher risk of addiction.’’ I will say that the amendment has drawn some concern, or at least interest, from the stakeholders, the chairman, the ranking member, myself and others are committed to working on this as it goes through the process. If we can finetune the amendment in some way, we are willing to at least consider that. But as it is constructed today, Mr. Chairman, this is a good amendment, and I hope that the body will adopt it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to request time to speak in favor of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Does anyone claim time in opposition? Mr. WALDEN. I claim time in opposition, Mr. Chairman, although I am not opposed to the amendment, and I will yield to my friend from New Jersey in a second, but I do ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, and I want to thank Representatives BARTON and MEADOWS and K USTER . They have really worked hard on this and it is a good amendment. There is wide variation in the way acute, shortduration pain is treated with opioids, and there are concerns that patients may be over or underprescribed opioid analgesics to treat that pain. This amendment would direct the FDA Commissioner to develop high quality, evidencebased opioid prescribing guidelines for the treatment of acute pain. By arming physicians with this type of information, we can give them more of the tools they need to treat patients’ pain without overprescribing addictive medications. The intent behind this policy is that evidencebased guidelines would add to the universe of available data in a way that would empower providers, patients, caregivers and others to make determinations about treatment in a more informed manner. I understand that some stakeholders have raised some concerns about limitations on how these evidencebased guidelines can be used; so as we continue to work on these policies with our counterparts in the Senate, we are committed to working to ensure that the language accomplishes what the sponsors intend without having any unintended consequences. I encourage my colleagues to support adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) such time as he may consume. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in order to speak on the amendment offered by Representatives BARTON , MEADOWS and K USTER . FDA Commissioner Gottlieb testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee about the work the agency is doing currently to analyze and assess opioid analgesic use in situations of acute pain, such as following surgical procedures. The goal of this analysis is to provide evidencebased recommendations for appropriate opioid doses by indicators ensuring that prescribing more closely aligns with clinical need. I believe this is a goal that we all support, which is why I support giving FDA the authority to conduct such work so as to inform policies that will better protect public health, and help to reduce the unneeded opioids from reaching individuals that are at risk for addiction. Since this amendment has been filed, we have heard some concerns from stakeholders about the amendment possibly impeding the use of the FDA’s evidencebased guidelines in making decisions related to dispensing or coverage of opioid prescriptions. I believe that such decisions should be informed by evidencebased guidelines such as those developed by the FDA, and I hope that we can work with the amendment’s sponsors and the chairman to address these concerns moving forward. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on this matter. Again, I thank my friend, the former chairman of the full committee, Mr. BARTON , for his good leadership on this effort, along with other Members on both sides of the aisle. I encourage our colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, can I inquire how much time I still have. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ), who is an original cosponsor of the amendment and has worked very hard on it. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Barton amendment. This amendment would require the FDA to create high quality, evidencebased opioid prescribing guidelines for acute pain. These would complement prescribing guidelines for chronic pain created in 2015 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Taken together, these guidelines would finally provide providers evidencebased recommendations on best practices for all types of pain. While the opioid epidemic has many origins, it is universally agreed upon that the treatment of pain over the latter half of the 20th century is a significant contributing factor. In recent years, efforts by this Congress and the public to reconcile addiction and chronic pain has had a real and positive impact. One of the most impacted communities are veterans, and in just the last few years, the VA has reported a remarkable decline in opioid prescriptions. Yet, the focus until very recently has been on chronic pain. Acute pain impacts more people and is responsible for a massive share of opioid prescriptions. The country needs evidence based guidance on treatment of acute pain. FDA is armed with a trove of data on acute pain prescription rates and patterns. They are uniquely positioned to provide this needed guidance. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told my colleagues on the Energy & Commerce Committee that this is something he wants to do and he underscored the importance of evidencebased opioid prescribing guidelines at the 2018 National Rx Drug Abuse & Heroin Summit. While these guidelines are focused on the prescriber practices and patients, given the nature of pain management as teambased, we intend these recommendations to inform better practices by providers that have collaborative working relationships with prescribers. I am committed to working with all stakeholders to improve this amendment as Congress continues to consider opioid legislation to ensure that these guidelines are considered consistent with law while still providing effective pain care for all Americans. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . CURTIS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 115–766. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add at the end of title III the following: 
SEC. 304. REPORT ON OPIOIDS PRESCRIBING PRACTICES FOR PREGNANT WOMEN.

(b) NOADDITIONAL FUNDS .—No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated for purposes of carrying out subsection (a). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 949, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to improve research and public awareness of opioid use during pregnancy. I introduced the POPPY Study Act earlier this year to address this issue, and I am pleased that it is being considered here today in this form. We all know the opioid epidemic has widespread and devastating effects. Nearly all of us know someone who has been affected by the crisis, and many of us have grieved through the heartbreak of losing loved ones to addiction. Sadly, the impact this has had on Utah has been overwhelming. In my State, six Utahns die every week as a result of the opioid overdose, and we rank among the highest in the Nation for drug overdose deaths. Areas of my district have some of the highest rates of opioid prescriptions dispensed nationwide. Tragically, Utah also leads out in prescribing the most opioids to pregnant women. Across the Nation, 1 in 5 women receive an opioid prescription during pregnancy but, in Utah, that number is doubled. Of course, opioid use during pregnancy can have dramatic consequences for a mother and her unborn child. Neonatal abstinence syndrome presents itself as babies go through withdrawal, constant screaming, shaking, vomiting, and difficulty sleeping and eating. b1100 This condition often requires long and expensive hospitalization. For Medicaidcovered babies, this syndrome costs more than $460 million in 2014 alone. Tragically, from 2004 to 2014, the rate of infants diagnosed with opioid withdrawal symptoms increased more than 400 percent nationwide. Across the Nation, women have been disproportionately impacted by the opioid epidemic, and little is known about the effect this has had on pregnant women. Healthcare experts, providers, and patients agree there is simply too much we don’t know about why pregnant women are being prescribed opioids and what possible alternatives might provide better healthcare outcomes for mothers and their unborn children. My amendment calls for increased research on current opioid prescribing practices during pregnancy, more data on prescription opioid misuse during pregnancy, and evaluates and encourages nonopioid pain management therapies that are safe and effective during pregnancy. I am proud of the work we have done here to curb the opioid epidemic, and I applaud the chairman, ranking member, and members of the committee for the work they have done to fight this crisis. Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this vital amendment as well as the underlying bill that will help us better serve our suffering communities, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, although I am not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of the amendment and to thank my friend from Utah, Mr. CURTIS , for his hard work on this very thoughtful piece of legislation. It is important that women who take opioid pain medications are aware of the possible risks during pregnancy. You heard him delineate those tragic, tragic risks, such as premature birth and neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS. While there is increasing awareness and use of nonopioid approaches in the management of pain over all, information about their use in pregnant patients and unique considerations of mother and child are simply lacking. So this amendment requires the Department of Health and Human Services to report on the opioid prescribing practices and opioid misuse during pregnancy, and evaluate nonopioid alternatives to pain management during pregnancy. 
This will complement the efforts of the Protecting Our Infants Act, which required a report on prenatal opioid exposure and NAS, presenting a strategy and clinical recommendations for preventing and treating infants withdrawal. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE ), a very important Member not only of the U.S. House of Representatives as our whip, but a very influential and effective member on our Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time and for leading on this important issue. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my friend from Utah’s amendment. As he mentioned, Mr. Chairman, you look at this crisis in our country, and I am so glad that Congress is taking a wide array of actions to address the opioid crisis in our country, because it doesn’t affect just one community or another. Everybody might think ‘‘mine is the only problem,’’ and then you talk to other Members of Congress from around the country, and you find out they are experiencing the same kind of crisis. And it is widespread. It is killing people every single day. But as we are talking about on this amendment, Mr. Chairman, we are talking about children, children that are born to a mother that is addicted to opioids. I highlight Kemper, a young boy from my district in Slidell, Louisiana. He was born addicted to opioids because his mother, while she was pregnant, was addicted to opioids herself. Now, I wish that this was the only time that it had happened. Fortunately for all of us, Kemper is now a healthy young boy, but he spent his first 11 days of life in the hospital fighting to beat a drug addiction that was not created, of course, on his own. We would like to think that this might be an isolated example, but, Mr. Chairman, this example highlights something the Centers for Disease Control has noted, and that is, once every 25 minutes in America, a baby is born addicted to opioids—one every 25 minutes. That is how widespread it is just for babies that are born. When we talk about this entire package of bills, today, H.R. 6 is going to pull together 50 different bills covering many different parts of this problem. It is an incredibly bipartisan effort. I know, Mr. Chairman, so often we hear about the partisan wrangling in Congress. Clearly, there are divided lines on some highprofile issues, but this is an issue where Republicans and Democrats have come together. I want to thank my friends from both sides of the aisle for recognizing this problem and coming together in a bipartisan way to solve it. This is going to give real tools to our communities so that they can combat this at every different level we are seeing, including treatment, including law enforcement to stop these deadly drugs from getting on the streets so that more babies like Kemper are not born addicted to opioids. Mr. Chairman, I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying package of bills. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana and the chairman for their speaking out in support of this important bill. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is essential in helping us improve our understanding of the impact of using opioid prescription during pregnancy and, ultimately, preventing opioid use disorder entirely. It is vital that we have sound and accurate research to guide us in the best ways to help pregnant women suffering from addiction. Mr. Chairman, this is a critical amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. WEBER of Texas). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . KEATING  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part B of House Report 115–766. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title III the following: 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue guidelines for prescribing an opioid overdose reversal drug. (b) CONTENTS .—In issuing guidelines under subsection (a), the Secretary shall address the following: (1) Coprescribing an opioid overdose reversal drug in conjunction with any prescribed opioid. (2) Dosage safety. (3) Prescribing an opioid overdose reversal drug to an individual other than a patient. (4) Standing orders. (5) Other distribution, education, and safety measures as determined necessary. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 949, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment that directs the Department of the Health and Human Services to issue and expand guidelines for medical providers for prescribing naloxone to reflect a major shift that has occurred in the opioid health crisis that we continue to work to counter today. Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, I sat in a room with my colleagues on the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force and listened to Dr. Francis Collins and the NIH leadership present data revealing how we have seen a shift in the opioid crisis. For the first time, we learned that opioid overdoses from prescriptions of opioid drugs have dropped. That is good news. The shocking news was that overdose rates for illicit opioids, heroin and fentanyl, had risen at an alarming rate. If we are going to save lives of people overdosing from increasingly prevalent and increasingly unpredictable illicit compounds, we need to make sure naloxone gets in the right hands. My amendment would provide necessary guidance to patients, providers, public health professionals, first responders, and loved ones on the ability to obtain effective doses of naloxone to combat overdoses of all types of opioids, prescriptions or otherwise. It is so crucial that people dealing with this brain disease know how to use naloxone in an emergency and, importantly, understand that it is okay to have naloxone in the home. I was proud that I and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), who also joins me as a cosponsor of this bipartisan amendment, were able to insert legislative language on prescribing guidelines into the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that passed Congress and became law last year. But giving HHS the option to issue guidelines didn’t go far enough. This amendment before us is firm in its requirement, and I believe my amendment will more explicitly and more expansively direct and yield necessary change. Mr. Chairman, I conclude by reaffirming our commitment to ending this devastating epidemic that takes the lives of 115 people every day on average in our country. I share this commitment with the Members of the House, and I pledge to work with you all to see this amendment’s passage and to effect necessary change that reflects the evershifting landscape in this battle. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), the cosponsor of this amendment. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge my colleagues to support this amendment to H.R. 6, and I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ), for his work on this effort. We have worked before on this issue of naloxone, and it is great that he is bringing forth this amendment. I am happy to be cosponsoring it with him. The House has been doing amazing, wideranging work over the last 2 weeks to combat the opioid crisis, and 
I am proud to have assisted with these efforts. The amendment that I have cojoined with Congressman KEATING today is simple. It instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give additional guidance to prescribing naloxone. Naloxone is the drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, a situation that far too many Americans have found themselves in across the country and across western Pennsylvania. Opioid addiction is tearing families apart. Unfortunately, an overdose is frequently the grim end to a long struggle. If we can help some of our fellow Americans come back from the brink with increased knowledge for our Nation’s medical professionals, I see no reason not to do it. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I again thank Congressman KEATING for his leadership on this. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, although I am not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of the amendment that requires the Department of Health and Human Services to issue guidelines for prescribing an opioid overdose reversal drug. The guidelines would cover dosage safety, standing orders and other education, and distribution measures. In April, the Surgeon General issued an advisory calling for more people to carry naloxone. Expanding the use of this lifesaving drug is a key part of the public health response to the opioid crisis, along with effective prevention, treatment, and recovery programs for substance use disorder. I can just tell you, Mr. Chairman, from my own district, I have had multiple roundtables in every corner of the district. I have, of course, met with families that have been affected. I have met with addiction treatment specialists. I have met with medical providers. But I have also met with law enforcement. In Oregon, we lead in a lot of this recovery effort, but also in making sure naloxone is available. This is the antidote. Mr. Chair, these fentanyls that are coming into our country illegally, if I had a little salt shaker here and put out, I don’t know, a half a dozen, a dozen grains of salt, and you put your hand on it, you would likely absorb that through your skin and pass out. And if somebody in this Chamber didn’t have naloxone, or the medical people who are nearby didn’t get to you in time, you would be one of those 115 people who will die in the next 24 hours, or one of the thousand that will show up in our emergency rooms. So moving forward with guidelines for prescribing an opioid overdose reversal drug really makes sense. Moving forward with naloxone really makes sense. We will save lives with this amendment, and I commend my colleagues from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania for their good work on this. We are happy to accept it as part of H.R. 6, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, in Cape Cod, the islands, and South Shore and south coast of Massachusetts, the real cause of death in overdoses now is fentanyl. It is being mixed with cocaine. It is being mixed with marijuana. And this is very important. This bipartisan amendment will save lives. I want to thank Chairman WALDEN. I want to thank Chairman B RADY . I want to thank my cosponsor Mr. ROTHFUS . I want to thank Ranking Member PALLONE and Ranking Member NEALfor their work on an amendment that will truly save lives. Mr. WALDEN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, because the gentleman raised the issue of these synthetics on other—we have talked a lot about fentanyl being cut into heroin over the course of this debate over 2 weeks. We haven’t talked as much about these synthetics being sprayed on marijuana or other things that you go: Oh, that is natural, mom. I can smoke that. And what these evil people are doing is taking these deadly synthetics and literally creating a liquid or a spray and then spraying it. And I talked to a father the other day whose daughter died of a heroin overdose, but when they did the autopsy, they discovered it was 100 percent fentanyl. So I thank the gentleman for his good work on this amendment. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part B of House Report 115–766. 
AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MS . MAXINE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in part B of House Report 115–766. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add at the end of title III the following new section: 
SEC. lll. REQUIRING A SURVEY OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROVIDERS RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDING. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall conduct a survey of all entities that receive Federal funding for the purpose of providing substance use disorder treatment services. The survey shall direct such entities to provide the following information: (1) The length of time the entity has provided substance use disorder treatment services. (2) A detailed description of the patient population served by the entity, including but not limited to the number of patients, type of addictions, geographic area served, as well as gender, racial, ethnic and socioeconomic demographics of such patients. (3) A detailed description of the types of addiction for which the entity has the experience, capability, and capacity to provide such services. (4) An explanation of how the entity handles patients requiring treatment for a substance use disorder that the organization is not able to treat. (5) A description of what is needed, in the opinion of the entity, in order to improve the entity’s ability to meet the addiction treatment needs of the communities served by that entity. (6) Based on the identified needs of the communities served, a description of unmet needs and inadequate services and how such needs and services could be better addressed through additional Federal, State, or local government resources or funding to treat addiction to methamphetamine, crack cocaine, other types of cocaine, heroin, opioids, and other commonly abused drugs. (b) REPORT .—Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall develop and submit to Congress a plan to direct appropriate resources to entities that provide substance use disorder treatment services in order to address inadequacies in services or funding identified through the survey described in subsection (a). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 949, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California. b1115 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, first I would like to say that I appreciate the bipartisan work of the bill’s sponsor, Chairman GREG WALDEN , and, of course, Chairman KEVIN BRADY and our cosponsor F RANK  PALLONE and cosponsor R ICHARD NEAL on this bill, H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. The bill, as drafted, includes many positive provisions and extends wellintended legislative efforts to address the opioid crisis in this country. That said, as we all know, in the United States, people suffer from a wide range of substance use disorders, including alcoholism and the abuse of illegal drugs like heroin, methamphetamine, crack, and other forms of cocaine. Likewise, there are a range of entities that provide different types of substance abuse treatment services. 
The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that we have a clear understanding of the substance abuse treatment services available, the communities and the populations that are being served, the types of substance use disorders being addressed, and any other unmet needs or inadequacies in the way we are addressing substance abuse issues. My amendment would direct that the Department of Health and Human Services conduct a nationwide survey of entities that provide substance use disorder treatment services. Based on the results of that survey, my amendment directs HHS to develop and submit to Congress a plan to direct appropriate resources in order to address inadequacies in services or funding identified through the survey. The survey called for by my amendment is intended to complement existing efforts by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, to examine substance use treatment services in order to develop a concrete plan to address unmet needs. Mr. Chairman, let me just say that I appreciate the information that was shared by the majority whip, Mr. SCALISE, when he talked about the baby who was born addicted, and we are going to have a lot of that. I have one regret, having worked on the issue of crack cocaine, that we did not do something to do the research that was necessary on these babies that are born addicted, to find out what happens to them later on in life and whether or not these children are handicapped and disabled in some ways, have learning disabilities, and on and on and on. So I would like to work with Mr. SCALISE to do the followup for the research that is so necessary. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, although I am not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of this amendment and to thank my friend, Ms. WATERS , for her work on this initiative. Before I go through that, I just want to say we are more than happy to team up with the gentlewoman on this issue of crack cocaine and its effects, and I am sure that Mr. SCALISE , although I can’t officially speak for him, I am sure that he would work in partnership with the gentlewoman. The gentlewoman has raised an issue that we have dealt with in other parts of this legislation but not in the part that the gentlewoman has brought to us. There will be more going forward, I assure you, and we would be happy to work with the gentlewoman on that. Mr. RUSHbrought an amendment on the IMD issue to make sure that those suffering from cocaine and crack cocaine addiction also could get treatment under expansion in the IMD, so we would be happy to work with the gentlewoman on that. This amendment directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a survey of organizations that provide substance abuse treatment services and then develop a plan to direct resources to address any identified gaps in services for specific types of substance use disorders. This information will help us better understand how our Federal dollars are invested in interdiction treatment at the local level and what more can be done with Federal resources to yield even better returns in reducing drugrelated crimes, accidents, overdoses, and deaths. So I certainly appreciate the gentlewoman’s work on this effort. It is important work that will help save lives and bring about the kind of treatment we need in our communities. I encourage adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE  WATERS ). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. WALORSKI ). The Chair understands that amendment No. 8 will not be offered. There being no further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. WEBER of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mrs. WALORSKI , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 6) to provide for opioid use disorder prevention, recovery, and treatment, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 949, she reported the bill, as amended by that resolution, back to the House with sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. TONKO. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Tonko moves to recommit the bill H.R. 6 to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 84, after line 14, insert the following:

Mr. TONKO (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. For more than a year and a half, Republicans in the House have been engaged in an allout ideological assault to weaken healthcare for Americans by working to repeal the Affordable Care Act and gutting protections for preexisting conditions. Republicans have repeatedly voted to strip Medicaid coverage for millions struggling with addiction. Thanks to Republican policies, we are seeing this uninsured rate rise sharply for the first time in years. This attack on our healthcare has had serious consequences for our ability to adequately address the needs of those struggling with the opioid epidemic. I remind my friends that we can’t have it both ways: We either are for fighting this epidemic every way we can, or we are not. I have seen the carnage this epidemic can produce in my own backyard, where my hometown of Amsterdam, New York, with a population of a little over 18,000 people, saw four overdose deaths and a dozen close calls within a single month. We know that, as of today, less than 20 percent of Americans who need substance abuse treatment are able to receive it. We need to move toward a system of treatment on demand so that, when an individual has that moment of clarity, we are ready with a helping hand to pull them away from the deadly grip of addiction. While I am pleased that the bill before us will make some incremental progress in our fight against the opioid epidemic and is the product of a significant amount of bipartisan work, every single Member of this Chamber knows that we can and we should be doing more. This motion to recommit is our chance to do just that and to make additional progress in this fight. First, the motion would invest in our addiction workforce by incorporating a proposal advanced by Representatives CROWLEY and C OSTELLO to add 500 new resident physician slots to hospitals that have developed or are developing training programs in addiction medicine, addiction psychiatry, or pain medicine. We all have seen firsthand the need for more addiction specialists out there, and we have a chance to take action on that right now. Secondly, this motion would allot an additional $1 billion annually to States through 2021 so that we can continue to invest in locally designed prevention, treatment, and recovery solutions. It is clearly going to take more than 2 years to battle the epidemic, and we need to let providers in States know that we are making sustained, meaningful investments in this area. Finally, our motion to recommit includes a commonsense prescription drug policy which will reduce prescription drug prices for all Americans by reducing gaming by drug manufacturers to prevent generics from coming to market. The CREATES Act, introduced by Representatives MARINO and C ICILLINE , is estimated to save the Federal Government some $3.8 billion and patients far more. This legislation has been passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis, but we have been denied a vote on the House floor to consider this practical, positive policy to halt pharma gaming and mischief. Each of the policies contained in this package is bipartisan, fully paid for, and would bolster our ability to respond to the crisis. We have the opportunity to provide a more robust response for the American people and to save the lives of countless of our friends and neighbors all across this country who could be the next to fall victim to this deadly disease of addiction. Every day, every week, every month, every year that passes, the challenge rests in our collective laps: Will we do more? We need to do more. Let’s do it for those families living with the pain and loss. Let’s do it for those individuals who struggle with the illness of addiction. Let’s be the light, the candle that brightens their darkness. Let’s go forward with the recovery that is inspired by this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, like a lot of our work here that has been bipartisan, we would hope, going forward, this, too, could become bipartisan, because we believe that getting prescription drug prices down is essential. The Trump administration believes that as well and is doing some things administratively. We are going to be working on this in the committee. We also agree that this unmet workforce need is important as well. Over the course of five hearings, a full markup in subcommittee, two full markups in the full committee, this issue was never fully brought and vetted. There is more work to be done here, and we are committed to doing work on both the CREATES Act and on the Opioid Workforce Act. As the gentleman from New York, my friend, knows, we have worked out our differences on many, many issues on this and other topics, and we intend to move forward. It is just that the agreement we have today, Mr. Speaker, is about all of us coming together with bills that were ready for prime time that would not somehow cause problems with the underlying document. This proposal, while wellintended and, frankly, on the big scope of things makes a lot of sense, it is just not ready and agreed to yet. The gentleman knows that. We know that. We appreciate his passion on this issue. We share it. But I have to reluctantly oppose the motion to recommit because we have agreement that only issues we all agree on are going into this bill— that is, Republicans and Democrats at the top of both committees. So I take the signal that he remains committed to this effort to fill the gap. We will work with him and others going forward because we have a lot more work to do, Mr. Speaker. This one is just not ready for prime time. Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, if ordered.

FIREFIGHTER CANCER REGISTRY ACT OF 2017 Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 931) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a voluntary registry to collect data on cancer incidence among firefighters, with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the Senate amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Senate amendment: Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: 
This Act may be cited as the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2018. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in this section as the Secretary), acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in coordination with other agencies as the Secretary determines appropriate, shall develop and maintain, directly or through a grant or cooperative agreement, a voluntary registry of firefighters (referred to in this section as the Firefighter Registry) to collect relevant health and occupational information of such firefighters for purposes of determining cancer incidence. (b) USE OF FIREFIGHTER REGISTRY .—The Fire fighter Registry may be used for the following purposes: (1) To improve data collection and data coordination activities related to the nationwide monitoring of the incidence of cancer among firefighters. (2) To collect, consolidate, and maintain, consistent with subsection (g), epidemiological information and analyses related to cancer incidence and trends among firefighters (c) RELEVANT DATA.— (1) DATA COLLECTION .—In carrying out the voluntary data collection for purposes of inclusion under the Firefighter Registry, the Secretary may collect the following: (A) Information, as determined by the Secretary under subsection (d)(1), of volunteer, paidoncall, and career firefighters, independent of cancer status or diagnosis.

Mr. COLLINS of New York (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from New York? Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I want to thank Representatives CHRIS COLLINS and FRANK PALLONE and Senators M ENEN DEZand L ISAMURKOWSKI for the support and work to get this bipartisan bill to protect the health and wellbeing of our Nation’s firefighters across the finish line. I am pleased this bill, which has the strong support of the firefighter community, will finally be on its way to the President’s desk. I look forward to working with all the stakeholders to create a firefighter cancer registry with this bill. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), my friend, the majority leader. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and at 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes are expected no later than 3 p.m. On Friday, no votes are expected in the House. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today. In addition, the House will continue our work on appropriations by taking up the 2019 Defense Appropriations bill sponsored by Representative KAY GRANGER . Mr. Speaker, Republicans are committed to national security and rebuilding our military. This bill fully funds a welldeserved 2.6 percent pay raise for our brave men and women in uniform, their largest pay raise in 9 years. It prepares for the future by investing more than $90 billion into the research and development of new defense systems and technology. Above all, it ensures American Armed Forces have the equipment and training necessary to successfully carry out their missions around the world. This bill passed 48 to 4 out of subcommittee, so I hope my friends across the aisle will consider voting for this important bill when it reaches the floor. Speaking of national security, the House will also make a motion to go to conference on the National Defense Authorization Act, which the House passed last month. Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the House, including two bills from the Committee on Natural Resources. First, H.R. 200, the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act, sponsored by Representative DON YOUNG : This bill would reauthorize MagnusonStevens and replace one sizefitsall regulations with a tailored approach that will ensure vibrant American fisheries. Next, H.R. 2083, the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act, sponsored by Representative JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER : This bill will allow State and Tribal authorities to respond more quickly to predators of the native salmon population. Mr. Speaker, the House is also expected to consider legislation related to border security and immigration. As soon as our schedule is finalized, I will be sure to inform all Members. With that, I thank my friend. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information. Mr. Speaker, I note that the bill that was supposed to be on the floor either yesterday or today dealing with DACA and dealing with the children, who are an object of great concern by all the country, is not mentioned in the gentleman’s remarks for legislation that will be considered next week. The DACA bill was supposed to be voted in the second immigration bill pursuant to the rule that we adopted this week. That vote, I thought, had been postponed until next week. Now, however, I do not see it being announced as a bill that is going to be considered. It is disappointing that, after months of committing to working together on a solution to the DACA crisis, Mr. Speaker, this week, the House considered two partisan bills. I would like to point out that Speaker RYAN, on September 5, 2017, some 8 months ago, said: ‘‘It is my hope that the House and Senate, with the President’s leadership, will be able to find consensus on a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this country.’’ Speaker RYANsaid more recently, on February 8, 2018, when he urged people to support the caps bill—that is, setting the limits of expenditures—‘‘my commitment to working together,’’ and he looked at our side of the aisle when he said that. But, Mr. Speaker, the only persons who apparently will be included in ‘‘working together’’ are between the Freedom Caucus and others on the Republican side of the aisle. He went on to say: ‘‘My commitment to working together on an immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment. Let me repeat,’’ the Speaker said, ‘‘my commitment to working together on an immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment. We will solve this DACA problem.’’ He said that February 8, 2018, from that rostrum on the floor of this House. There has been no ‘‘together.’’ Now, my friend, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, said this: ‘‘This all started when I was at Camp David with the President this weekend.’’ We know that the majority leader is probably the closest ally that the President has in the Congress of the United States. ‘‘He was telling me how, earlier last week, he was with some Republican Senators talking about DACA. They all agreed, but he said we can’t solve that unless we bring Democrats into the room, too.’’ That was Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY on FOX News on January 10, 2018. So I ask my friend, the majority leader, can the gentleman clarify whether or not changes will be made to H.R. 6136—that is, the RyanTrump so called compromise that, from our perspective, ‘‘together’’ meant simply together among Republicans trying to decide what the Republicans wanted to do. Can you tell me whether there will be changes to that socalled compromise bill and whether or not that 
bill may be brought to the floor anytime soon? I yield to my friend. b1215 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate him watching me on TV. Mr. Speaker, if I could just restate, so maybe I could speak more clearly. The House is also expected to consider legislation relating to border security immigration. So the answer is yes. As I said before, we are bringing that bill to the floor. We have been working very closely with the entire Conference, taking all ideas in. We had a very productive conference last night. We will work through the weekend, and you will see that bill on the floor next week. And I look forward to Mr. HOYER ’s support as well. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, together, working with their Conference, not with us, not, frankly, with a bipartisan group that has support on this floor of 240 Members. 240 Members of the House of Representatives, and you need 218 for a majority, support an option and have been asking for that option for a long period of time. Now, the majority leader is looking somewhat quizzical, Mr. Speaker, and he wants to know how you get to 240; 193 plus 47. There were 54 Republicans who asked for the rule putting four bills on the floor, but 7 were, apparently, encouraged to take their name off of that, so only 47 Republicans remain. All 193, that is 240. That is a majority of the House. What was asked for was to put four options, giving everybody a chance to put the option that they liked on the floor. Notwithstanding Speaker RYAN’s commitment and notwithstanding the comments that Mr. MCCARTHY made following his meeting at Camp David with the President of the United States where they needed to bring Democrats in, all we have seen is a deeply divided Republican Party negotiating with itself. They brought a bill to the floor, and they passed the rule. The only real effect of the rule, because the bill lost, was to negate the 216 signatures—and we believe there would have been more but for armtwisting—to bring those compromised bills to the floor, which had both Republicans and Democrats working together and supporting. Two of those bills, the principal sponsors were a Republican and a Democrat. Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman, he says he is going to bring a bill to the floor—I presume he is talking about the bill that was going to be brought to the floor yesterday then changed to today, and then changed to next week—whether there will be amendments in that bill and, if so, will they be discussed with us and will we have input into that process? The gentleman concluded, Mr. Speaker, his comments with he hopes he could have our support. We are not included. We are shut out. The compromise has been rejected and undermined, and the Speaker ignored 216 people who asked for those bills to be brought to the floor, and he said no: no openness, no transparency, closed rules, consistent with the policies that have been followed in this, the most closed Congress in which I have served. So I would ask my friend again, Mr. Speaker: What changes will be affected in the bill that would be brought to the floor, or are we going to be told when they are brought to the floor what those changes are? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, it is quite interesting to me to listen to my friend. He is complaining that somehow he is not involved. Mr. Speaker, he is complaining about the number of hours that he sat in my office, not just himself—Senator DURBIN , the chief of staff to the President, the Secretary of Homeland Security as well, and Senator CORNYN —and we worked time and again. But every time, we tried to find compromise. We even went to the point of their number one issue, and the President went beyond what they even asked. But they said: No, we can’t do anything else. They said all they wanted to do was go do a discharge petition. That is all they wanted. They didn’t want to work through the system. But that was not unusual, because my friend, Mr. Speaker, likes to quote people—I don’t have it written. I just have it by memory, the number of times my friend told me he would never vote to shut down the government. He doesn’t care about politics; he would never do that. But we found it was a different year and a different time. Then we talked about children’s health, CHIP. A number of times, Mr. Speaker, we would go to the other side, we would go to the ranking member, and we would go to those individuals on the committee, but they were told not to work with us. So we would run a bill, Mr. Speaker, with everything that they had ever said they would want in it, and yet they would get to the day and they would vote against it. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time just to remind the majority leader of what I asked. The majority leader likes to talk about what we did in the past. His party shut down the government, and he says I voted to shut down the government. That is absurd that he could cite a vote of mine against some sort of proposal that they put forward. The question is: He refuses to put on a bipartisan, to give even the House the opportunity to consider a bill that is supported by 240 Members of this House. And, frankly, my perception— and I am not bad at counting, Mr. Speaker, which is why I am standing at this podium and why the majority leader is standing at his podium. We understand counting. I dare him, Mr. Speaker, I dare him to put the HurdAguilar bill on the floor, and I guarantee him it will get 240 votes. The people’s House will be allowed to speak. But they are afraid to do that, Mr. Speaker. All of this stuff about we had meetings in his office, we had meetings in his office and he knew, from the start, that the two things they were asking for were nonstarters. Very frankly, I have had discussions with the Secretary, who said: Well, we will just stick with border security and DACA. But that is all in the past. What we are talking about is today. And what they did was shut down the people who wanted to vote on their option, on our option, and on two other options in this, the most transparent House that would take issues one by one and would face the tough issues headon. While people are twisting in the wind and while children are being separated from their parents, ripped from the arms of their moms and their dads, we fiddle while Rome is burning, and we talk about shutting down government. Their party shut down government a number of times since I have been here. They did it intentionally. And, very frankly, their Speaker and the head of the OMB voted ‘‘no’’ and to shut it down; they voted not to open it up. That is not the issue, Mr. Speaker. The issue is: What are we going to do to solve a problem the President of the United States said we ought to solve? Now, the President of the United States, of course, this morning, says: No, forget it. Go deal with it. His tweet at 7:06 a.m. this morning: ‘‘Republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/ women in November’’—in other words, until we take over. This President who said: Well, you know, I met with Kim Jongun. He is loved by his people. And, boy, when he says stand up, his people stand up. Perhaps, that is what he wants us to do, Mr. Speaker, but we are not North Korea. We are a democracy, and, very frankly, they don’t have the courage, Mr. Speaker, to bring bills to the floor and allow this House to work its will. What they do is they negotiate with themselves and bring bills to the floor, neither of which would have passed yesterday. After all of their compromise, after all of their talk, and after all of their commitments to solve the problem, neither one of their bills would have passed yesterday. They have 240plus Members. They don’t need us, but they took the bill off the floor because they couldn’t get their own party to come to agreement. So, Mr. Speaker, my question is, and I will reiterate my question: What changes are going to be effected in the bill that would have been considered yesterday, had it not been pulled from the floor, that we will have to consider next week? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. 
Mr. M CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I just asked the gentleman if he would allow me the opportunity to answer questions. Mr. HOYER. Certainly. Mr. MCCARTHY. I know he likes to make long speeches before he gets to a question, and I know he likes to go back in decades for the decades that he has served, but I was only referring to this Congress. I was moving to the answer, but I was building and explaining why the answer is what it is. He doesn’t think the actions prior don’t take place until now. We have sat in those rooms and we talked about border security. The interesting part, though, Mr. Speaker: The other side of the aisle that said they were for border security, they were going to perpetuate the problem we currently have because they did not want to end this catch and release. They are going to put families in harm’s way. They question whether you could actually have a border of a wall. That is really the philosophical debate that we are talking about. Now, we will work through this bill. There are some other parts of the bill that we are working on this weekend. Any changes that come to a conclusion, of course, we will let you know. But much of what this bill is is the same thing that we talked down at the White House about and we talked for those numbers of hours inside my office about. But, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman on the other side said that he was never going to shut down the government, but he voted to do it this time. They said that they were concerned about CHIP, but they would vote against it when we bring it to the floor. Do you know what we had to do? We had to carry it on our own. And do you know what happened for the American children? The longest it has ever been renewed: 10 years. So, yes, we want to work with them. But if the idea is to stop anything from happening for the American public, do not expect me to stop. It is too important. If we have to push through on our own, we will. And my friend made a statement that this body is onesided. Don’t take my word for it. Let’s go to Quorum, a company that only focuses on data, that only focuses on measurements. Do you know what they said about this Congress? Seventy percent of the bills signed into law this Congress have one Republican and one Democratic cosponsor, the highest rate in the past 20 years for bipartisanship. The bills that we bring to the floor, despite the leadership’s push, every week, Mr. Speaker, we can see the actions. What was the action that they held everybody until the last minute for those 23 people who wanted to vote for the appropriations bill? They had to wait until the Republicans carried it, then they released them to vote for it. Or we talk about the farm bill. Every day, Mr. Speaker, I come back here, I see the ranking member on the other side put a letter out to her Members to not vote for whatever comes. And, yes, we on this side of the aisle want to solve DACA. But I know. I read your tweets just as well: Dreamers can still apply to renew DACA protections. But, do you know what? In our bill, we deal with the DACA situation. Do you know what else we also deal with? We deal with the border, and we deal with security, because we do not want to be back here in another 2 or 5 years with the same problem we have today. b1230 Even if you won’t work with us from the children’s health insurance, from funding of government, from appropriations for our veterans, you want to hold those votes back, I don’t think the public wants to hold those back. And you know what? If we have to push forward, we will. And I will not apologize for it. This country is too important, the problems are too big. And I can listen, Mr. Speaker, to every argument we make, but I will just think the American public can look at the data. Do you know what today is, Mr. Speaker? The 6month anniversary of the tax bill passing. You know what else it is? One million new jobs. You know what else it is? Unemployment below 4 percent. And in the last 49 years of this country, unemployment below 4 percent has only been 7 months in 49 years, but two of those 7 months were April and May of this year. Unemployment claims, 44year low. And for the first time in the history of this Nation, there are more jobs being offered than there are people looking for them. So all that rhetoric, all those arguments you made building up to that tax bill, the Armageddon, the crumbs, how terrible this is going to be, 6 months later, history proves different. And you know what, Mr. Speaker? If we had waited and waited for the Democrats, there would not be a million new jobs, there would not be unemployment where it is, because, Mr. Speaker, there wasn’t one Democrat to vote for it, even though a number of them privately told me on this floor they wanted to, but their leadership told them no. So if we have to solve the economy and we have to solve immigration on our own, we will. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, he didn’t answer the question, of course. He hardly ever does. 400,000 more jobs created in 2016 than 2017. He doesn’t say that. They inherited a growing economy. We inherited, when President Obama took office, a receding economy, hemorrhaging 787,000 jobs in January of 2009. He doesn’t talk about that. That was after the two tax cuts that they passed in 2001 and 2003 that they said would create the greatest economy we have ever seen. It didn’t. He didn’t say that. Mr. Speaker, he didn’t say that the only time we balanced the budget for 4 years was under President Clinton, and we created jobs and had the best economy he has experienced and I have experienced. He didn’t say that. And, Mr. Speaker, what he didn’t say is why we are not bringing to this floor four pieces of legislation, giving everybody on the floor the opportunity to express their opinion and say to the American people how they think we can address, yes, border security, which we want to address. But what the President asked us to do and the Speaker said he would do, and the Speaker has not done, and that is to address in a rational way, in a way that can get the majority of votes—the two bills they brought to the floor, they knew they couldn’t get the votes. The farm bill that he just talked about that is going to the Senate, it is dead on arrival. He knows it, Mr. Speaker. The 69 times they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, wasted time. He knows it. And he mentions, by the way, how bipartisan this Congress is. Let me tell you why it is bipartisan: we don’t control it, but we cooperate when we can. When we were in charge, it wasn’t nearly as bipartisan, because the Republicans did not cooperate when they could. And, Mr. Speaker, he talks about fiscal bills. Ninety percent of the fiscal bills could not have passed this House, kept the government open, opened the government up, give relief to those who were suffering from natural disasters without substantial Democratic help, and in many instances with the majority of Democrats and the minority of Republicans. But the answer I looked for, Mr. Speaker, what are we going to consider next week in terms of an issue that the Speaker said some 8 months ago we were going to solve and promised us in February 2018 he was going to address to solve DACA? And now we have this crisis in the country created by the President of the United States with children being wrenched from the arms of their moms and dads. That is what we ought to be discussing. The majority leader is a good friend of the President’s. I understand that. All the President has to do is pick up the phone and call and say to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security: stop wrenching those children from the hands of their parents. We don’t need legislation, but now we have legislation. And I would ask him if he would bring the Nadler bill to the floor, which will prevent children from being wrenched from the hands of their families simply because they have committed a misdemeanor of wanting to seek opportunity in the land of opportunity that we call America. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend for his response, but we need to know what is going to be considered next week. 
Apparently, they haven’t decided. So the majority leader says they will let us know as soon as they have decided what they are going to do—who they have to deal with to cobble the votes together on their side of the aisle. We have 240plus votes for an option, but they are being muzzled. They are being prevented to express the will of this House. Mr. Speaker, I ask the majority leader, does he believe that my representation that HurdAguilar has 240 votes on this floor inaccurate? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. My friend made a lot of points. Sometimes facts get caught up in them. So, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talked about the floor and the willingness of this side to allow Democratic amendments, or bipartisanship. As of June 7, Republicans in the 115th Congress—and we are not done with this Congress yet—have provided for the consideration of over 1,200 amendments on the House floor. Now, that includes 570 Democrat amendments. And I don’t want to compare apples to oranges, so let’s do apples to apples. So in the entire 111th Congress—that was their entire Congress when my friend was majority leader—Speaker Pelosi allowed less than 1,000 amendments to be considered on the floor. Now, despite the unified Democratic opposition, Republicans are still getting the work done, and we will continue to do that. Now, my friend made a few statements, said there are things I did not say. Maybe there were some things I did not say about the economy, but they are different than what he would, because there is some really good news, and it is not far from here. Mr. Speaker, you could go to my friend’s district. Each of the counties that make up Maryland’s Fifth Congressional District has seen a drop in unemployment since 2016. St. Mary’s County is down over a full percent to 3.7, Calvert County down to 3.5, Charles County down to 3.8, Prince George’s down to 4.1, and Anne Arundel County down to 3.2 percent. Now, the other point I did not make—and I thank the gentleman for bringing it up to me that I missed points—do you realize in America today, if you are African American, this is the lowest unemployment has ever been; if you are Hispanic, the lowest it has ever been. Yes, there are things we had to do on our own, but the numbers prove it is worth it. And what is even more telling about this and something that makes me prouder, it doesn’t just help Republican districts, it helps everybody’s districts. It helps all Americans. And that is what we are here for. My friend brought up that there are issues. Yes, there are. That is why we want to pass the immigration bill. We think there should be a border and the border should be protected. We think children should be with their parents, and that is what we are working on. So I look forward to next week, to us passing an immigration bill that solves a lot of these problems. And, Mr. Speaker, I hope my friend from the other side of the aisle would look at the bill and understand not everybody gets what they want, because in that bill there won’t be everything that I want, not one person in this room will get everything they want. But will America be safer? Will America be better in the future? Will we have a system that works? Those answers will be yes, and that is how I will cast my vote. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we will close now. Neither of the questions that I posed were answered. And certainly the fact that there are 240 votes on this floor was not disputed, by the majority leader, for the HurdAguilar, which addresses security at the border. By the way, cosponsored by Mr. HURD, a Member of the majority leader’s party. A Member from Texas who knows about the border and who, I presume, wants to keep it secure. The bill he has cosponsored has at least 240 votes on this floor. This is the most closed Congress in which I have served, the most closed rules. That is a fact. And apparently it is closed to the majority, who want to move ahead on a bill and just have the opportunity to vote on it and to give the Speaker the opportunity to put something on the floor and have the House consider it, and have Ms. ROYBALALLARD and Ms. R OSLEHTINEN , Republican from Florida, have a bill on the floor and have it considered, and have Mr. GOODLATTE , who did, in fact, have his bill on the floor, and it lost. So, Mr. Speaker, I regret that I don’t know what there is going to be next week, because we need to take action. And we need to take action not by compromising with one side of the aisle and seeing only capitulation by some. We do need compromise, we do need action, and we need action that can pass the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, JUNE 22, 2018, TO MONDAY, JUNE 25, 2018 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, June 25, 2018, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT IS GETTING RESULTS (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, today is the 6month anniversary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And few would have thought that 6 months ago we would have seen such progress so fast because of tax reform, and the results are significant: bigger paychecks and employers giving workers pay raises; we have got faster economic growth; we have got 1 million new jobs that have now been created since the beginning of the year already; unemployment is at one of its lowest rates ever, under 4 percent; and we actually now, for the first time in history, have more job openings than jobseekers. This is a good thing, with more business investment, record optimism among small businesses and manufacturers, and consumer confidence nearly at an alltime high. Mr. Speaker, tax reform was just the shot in the arm that our economy needed to put Americans back to work and get our economy back on track. f 
HONORING RON PLUMMER (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Ron Plummer, Manager of Orange County, Florida, Office of Emergency Management, who passed away last week. Ron was a dedicated public servant, husband, and father. Ron served in the Army and the Marine Corps for 27 years. Since 2002, he has helped our community through countless storms and disasters. As every Floridian knows, getting through hurricanes and other emergencies requires calm leadership and deep compassion. Ron lifted the spirit of stormstricken neighbors, brought kindness to those with special needs, and made hope a tangible presence. Ron united peers and partners to keep us safe, and shared his vast expertise throughout the State and the Nation. Ron Plummer will be greatly missed by all who knew him, and we owe him a debt of gratitude for a life well lived. 
b1245 RECOGNIZING THE NORTH PLATTE CANTEEN (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the community of North Platte, Nebraska, for its many decades of service to our men and women in uniform. Earlier this week, the North Platte Canteen came together once again to host more than 700 Army National 
Guard soldiers based in Arkansas who were returning from a training mission in Wyoming, not having eaten a hot meal in days. The North Platte Canteen traces its history to World War II, when the community came together to feed more than 6 million servicemen and women as they traveled by train across the country. The North Platte Canteen was organized this time to feed more than 700 soldiers, like I said. They were transported on 21 buses over 2 days, and these experiences included homemade birthday cakes for those celebrating, which is that timehonored tradition at the Canteen. I would like to thank Lisa Burke, Muriel Clark, Amanda Connick, Courtney Fegter, and Michelle Thomas at the North Platte/Lincoln County Visitors Bureau, who coordinated what became a wholecommunity effort with just a few days’ notice. This is really what Nebraska’s support for our troops is all about. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR DEPUTY THERESA SUE KING, DEPUTY PATRICK THOMAS ROHRER, AND ALL FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, there are no words to describe the tragedy that occurred in my district in Kansas last week. Two Wyandotte County deputies, Theresa Sue King and Patrick Thomas Rohrer, lost their lives while transporting an inmate for a court hearing on Friday. This is, tragically, not the first time in recent history that law enforcement men and women in our community have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep the peace. We are reminded that we owe our police force, their deputies, and their loved ones a debt of great gratitude that we will never be able to repay. We pray for their families at this time, and we pray for Sheriff Ash, Kelli Bailiff, and Chief Ziegler as they lead their departments through this tragedy. Mr. Speaker, may God bless Deputy King and Deputy Rohrer. May they rest in peace. Mr. Speaker, along with our colleagues from Kansas, RONESTES and I ask for a moment of silence for Deputy King and Deputy Rohrer and all of our fallen police officers. 
RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UTICA CURLING CLUB (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, remember the Miracurl on Ice, the stunning victory earlier this year when Team USA defeated Sweden to win the first ever gold medal for the U.S. Olympic curling team? It was a milestone for the support of curling around the Nation. I am a longtime fan of the sport of curling and a member of the team that won the 1975 Teenage Curling Championship held at the Utica Curling Club in Utica, New York. I rise today to recognize the Utica Curling Club, which recently celebrated its 150th anniversary. Established in 1868, the Utica Curling Club is one of the oldest rinks in the country. This ice sport was first played on openair rinks on Ballou Creek near Rutger Street in Utica. In 1916, the indoor club was built on Francis Street in downtown Utica, where I was able to hold my title as the 1975 Teenage Curling Champion. Tragically, the club was destroyed by fire in 1995. In 1996, a brandnew facility was built on Clark Mills Road in nearby Whitesboro. Today, the club hosts novice and competitive curlers from across the country and the world. Members range from 7 years old to 90 years old. The official curling season runs from October through March. This past winter, the Utica Curling Club held the Olympic Open House, which it has held every year for 4 years, and doubled its attendance to watch the U.S. curling team bring home their very first Olympic Gold Medal. The sport of curling has experienced many changes in Utica over the last 150 years, but the spirit of curling remains strong. Mr. Speaker, please join me in wishing a hearty congratulations to the Utica Curling Club for 150 years and many more Miracurls on Ice. f 
CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA—MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–136) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days before the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea declared in Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008, expanded in scope in Executive Order 13551 of August 30, 2010, addressed further in Executive Order 13570 of April 18, 2011, further expanded in scope in Executive Order 13687 of January 2, 2015, and under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13722 of March 15, 2016, and Executive Order 13810 of September 20, 2017, is to continue in effect beyond June 26, 2018. The existence and risk of proliferation of weaponsusable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula; the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea that destabilize the Korean Peninsula and imperil United States Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region, including its pursuit of nuclear and missile programs; and other provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 with respect to North Korea. DONALD J. T RUMP .THEWHITE HOUSE , June 22, 2018. 
CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE WESTERN BALKANS—MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–137) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days before the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans that was declared in Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001, is to continue in effect beyond June 26, 2018. The threat constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, 
in Kosovo, has not been resolved. In addition, Executive Order 13219 was amended by Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003, to take additional steps with respect to acts obstructing implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 relating to Macedonia. The acts of extremist violence and obstructionist activity outlined in these Executive Orders are hostile to United States interests and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans. DONALD J. T RUMP .THEWHITE HOUSE , June 22, 2018. 
IMMIGRATION The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. HANDEL ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2013, the gentleman from California (Mr. TED LIEU) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speaker, if the Statue of Liberty could cry, she would be crying today. As I stand here, there are 2,300 babies and kids who were ripped away from their parents by our government and are in detention facilities across America. America was a country founded by people fleeing persecution. We are a land of immigrants. President Ronald Reagan called us ‘‘that shining city upon the hill.’’ Unfortunately, Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen have perverted that grand legacy and have now engaged in the functional equivalent of kidnapping. You can believe in any God or no God at all and conclude that ripping kids away from their parents is immoral. I believe in Jesus Christ. Every single thing in the Gospels and what Christ taught goes against the policy of family separation. Imagine being a mother and father and losing your child to the government and not knowing if you are ever going to see your child again, the horror of that. Imagine being a child; when you are young, your parents are likely the most important people in your life. Imagine being ripped away from your mother or father and not knowing if you are ever going to see them again, and then being placed in a detention facility with strangers. Imagine the horror and fear you will see doing that. What must that sound like? (Audio being played.) The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. Mr. TED LIEU of California. For what reason, Madam Speaker? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is in breach of decorum. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Cite the rule, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Rule XVII of the rules of the House prohibits—— Mr. TED LIEU of California. There is no rule that says I can’t play sounds. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Why are you trying to prevent the American people from listening to what it sounds like in a detention facility? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Rule XVII of the rules of the House prohibits the use of that device. Mr. TED LIEU of California. These are babies and kids in a detention facility. Why do you not let the American people hear what they are saying? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. Mr. TED LIEU of California. There is no rule in the House that says I cannot play sounds from a detention facility. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend the use of the device. It is in violation of rule XVII. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Read the rule. It does not say I cannot play sounds from a detention facility. Why are we hiding this from the American people? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Rule XVII prohibits the use of an electronic device to produce sound in the Chamber. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Why are we hiding it from the American people? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Why are we hiding it from the American people? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend, per rule XVII of the rules of the House. Mr. TED LIEU of California. We have 2,300 babies and kids—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. Per rule XVII of the rules of the House, that prohibits the use of a device to produce sound in the Chamber. Mr. TED LIEU of California. We have 2,300 babies and kids in detention facilities who were ripped away from their parents. I think the American people need to hear this. b1300 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend per rule XVII of the rules of the House. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speaker, I think the American people need to hear this ProPublica tape of a detention facility of babies and children who were ripped away from their parents. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Sergeant at Arms will enforce the rules of decorum. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Texas has a proud history, and the names of Texas heroes—Sam Houston, Juan Seguin, and, my hero, William Barrett Travis—are still remembered and venerated by Texans. Two names that are often unjustifiably left out of this group are James and Jane Long. A veteran of the War of 1812, Dr. James Long was a doctor living in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1819. In that year, the United States and Spain agreed on the AdamsOnis treaty, in which Spain relinquished control over Florida and the United States rescinded claims to the land west of the Sabine River in Texas. Long and his friends didn’t like that they no longer had access to a land they considered their birthright. They decided to take action. Dr. Long proposed the establishment of Texas as an independent and sovereign nation. Together with eighty of his friends, as well as his wife, Jane, and their newborn infant, Long rode to Nacogdoches. By the time his group reached the Texas settlement, they were over 300 strong. Internal resistance and uncertainty had plagued Spanish Texas, and so Long’s party easily took control of Nacogdoches. They then gathered for a solemn convention. On June 23, 1819, under the heat of the Texas sun, the group proclaimed Texas a free and independent nation and elected Dr. Long as its first president. They became the first to champion the Lone Star. Indeed, the Lone Star featured prominently on their flag, which adopted the 13 red and white stripes of the American flag and placed a single star in the top lefthand corner. The fate of Long’s new Texas Republic was cruel and shortlived. Spanish forces, upon hearing of Long’s presence in Nacogdoches, marched east from Bexar (modernday San Antonio) and drove Long’s forces out, killing his brother in the process. Long traveled with his young family to New Orleans, and, determined not to give up on his dream, attempted to stir up support for a second expedition. He found a willing partner in Don Felix Trespalacios, and in 1829, the two departed by sea, bound for the Texas coast. After landing at a place they named Point Bolivar, in honor of the South American revolutionary, Long took forces inland while Trespalacios sailed onward to spread revolution elsewhere. When his forces took La Bahia, however, Spanish troops struck back and forced their surrender. Long became a captive and traveled to Mexico City to await his fate. Amid mysterious circumstances, Long was shot and killed while in Mexico City, leaving his young wife and two children alone to fend for themselves at Point Bolivar. Texas women are fiercely courageous, and Mrs. Long was no different. Though she was just twentyone years old, she was determined not to become a victim of her own circumstances. She fended off wouldbe Indian assailants while wintering in Galveston Bay, and in the spring, she traveled on horseback with her two young children and an enslaved woman to Bexar and then to Monterrey, hundreds of miles across the open, rugged Texas landscape. She was determined to bring her husband’s murderer to justice, but even her indomitable spirit could not overcome a turbulent political climate. Unsuccessful but not unbowed, she rode back to Mississippi with her children. She later made her way back to Texas, settling at Richmond near the coast, and died on Texas soil in 1880. Mr. Speaker, James and Jane Long are vital to the history of Texas. These two individuals helped sow the seeds of independence in the minds of Texans. Members of Long’s expedition, in particular Ben Miram and Jim Bowie, later played integral roles in winning Texas independence from Mexico. While their contribution has often been overlooked by history, their names should live beside those of Houston, Seguin, and Travis as true Texas heroes. And that is just the way it is. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to address a new wave sweeping the state of Alabama and the nation. In response to the Trump administration’s continued attack on women as well as the #MeToo movement, at least 70 African American women ran for office in the Alabama primary on June 5th. These women ran for their local school boards, for county judgeships, for state lawmakers, and for Congress. Black women have been the backbone of families and communities for generations, providing an unwavering source of strength. I know I stand on the shoulders of such women of strength, like Shirley Chisholm, Harriett Tubman, and Amelia Boynton Robinson. Moreover, I am inspired every day by my mother, Nancy Garner Sewell, who was the first African American female elected to the City Council of Selma, Alabama. These dynamic black women gave all they had to create a more just and free America. Yet, the fight is long from over. As the first AfricanAmerican woman elected to Congress from the State of Alabama in 2010, I am overjoyed to see so many others enthusiastic to serve their communities by running for office. Black women are refusing to sit idly on the sidelines. Whether it is on issues of access to quality healthcare, education, equal pay for equal work, or engagement in the political arena, we have women from around the country that are joining the fight to let the world know that we will hold our elected officials accountable on issues that affect us, our families, and our communities. As more black women continue to speak out and run for office, I look forward to welcoming them to the table. f 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. James Bok Wong, who passed away on May 25, 2018 at the age of 96. Dr. Wong was a lifelong leader in his community, an immigrant, a businessman, and a veteran. Dr. Wong was born in Canton, China in 1922. After immigrating to the United States in 1938, he served with the famous Flying Tigers Air Corps, the first American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force during World War II. Following his service, he earned a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture and Chemical Engineering from the University of Maryland under the G.I. bill, and went on to earn both a Master of Science and PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of Illinois. An entrepreneur and businessman, Dr. Wong rose to become a distinguished figure in the biochemical industry. He served as chief economist and director of international technologies for Dart Industries, and founded his own company, James B. Wong Associates, Inc., through which he licensed U.S. technologies to spearhead the dairy industry in China. In 1971, Dr. Wong founded the Chinese American Citizens Alliance Foundation to support the growing Chinese American community in Los Angeles. The foundation has provided educational and leadership opportunities to countless young people and played a key role in encouraging civic engagement. Dr. Wong was also a longtime leader in the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, serving as national marshal, president, and a member of the board of directors. Recognized with an L.A. Outstanding Volunteer Service Award in 1977, Dr. Wong later received a History Makers Leadership Award by the Chinese American Museum in 2014. Dr. Wong leaves behind an enduring legacy of dedication and service to his country and his community. He is an inspiration to all those who knew him and it is my honor to commemorate his life. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Margot James Copeland and acknowledge her achievements. She is known for her commitment to improve the local economy and foster inclusive multicultural and multiracial relations in Cleveland, Ohio. Mrs. Copeland is an integral force for change in shaping an inclusive urban community that welcomes constructive change by means of intercultural dialogue and cooperation. A native of Richmond, Virginia, Mrs. Copeland graduated from Hampton University with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics. She went on to receive her Master of Arts in Educational Research and Statistics from the Ohio State University. Mrs. Copeland began her corporate career at Xerox Corporation, Polaroid, and Picker International. She later served as Executive Director for Leadership Cleveland before becoming President and CEO of the Greater Cleveland Roundtable. Currently, Mrs. Copeland is Executive Vice President and Director of Philanthropy and Civic Engagement at KeyBank, one of the nation’s largest bankbased multiline financial services companies. In her role, Mrs. Copeland also serves as Chair and CEO of the KeyBank Foundation, where she guides strategic philanthropic investments promoting affordable home ownership, high quality education, and small business growth. By supporting organizations and programs, she helps make dreams become reality. Mrs. Copeland has been a proven leader in a number of community organizations and sits on several boards. She is the 15th National President of The Links, Inc., serving from 2010 to 2014. She served as President of the Junior League of Cleveland, sat on the Kent State University Board of Trustees, acted as a Protege Program Advisor for Morehouse College, and was a member of the Business School Advisory Board at Hampton University. Mrs. Copeland’s public service is marked by her appointment as Vice Chairperson of the Cleveland Bicentennial Commission and, subsequently, the Cleveland Millennium Commission by former Mayor Michael R. White, whose second term Inaugural Committee she chaired. She also served on the Transition Committee for current Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson. Mrs. Copeland’s extensive record of excellence in service to her community makes it truly an honor to know her, and it gives me great pleasure, Mr. Speaker, to celebrate her today. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Gerald ‘Jerry’ Eighmy, who passed away on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 after a lengthy illness. Jerry is survived by his wife of 56 years—Mary, his sons Scott and Harry (both of Erie) and eight beloved grandchildren who will proudly carry on the legacy of their admirable grandfather. Jerry was born on December 17, 1940 in Cleveland, Ohio. He moved to Conneaut early in life and has been a lifelong resident ever since. After graduating from Conneaut High School, Jerry worked on the ore boats for US Steel to gather up the money needed to go to college. He attended Heidelberg College in Tiffin, OH getting a degree in chemistry. Shortly after graduating, Jerry started working for his father at the family machining company, the Eighmy Corporation in Conneaut. Over the years, Jerry was instrumental in growing and advancing the company. In 1984, Jerry started American Turned Products in Erie, PA. American Turned Products has grown into a thriving manufacturing company, with two plants in Erie County that serve the automotive, appliance, military and hydraulics industries. During his time in the machining industry, Jerry became very involved with the National Screw Machine Products Association, now called the Precision Machined Products Association (PMPA). PMPA is an international trade association that represents the interests of the precision machined products industry and provides programs and services to ensure members stay ahead of the curve and ready to compete on a global scale. Jerry was actively involved in many PMPA committees over the years and also served on the PMPA’s Finance, Executive, and Pension Committees. Jerry served a five year term as Association Treasurer before transitioning to Association Second Vice President, First Vice President, and eventually President elect. In order to acknowledge his service to the association and industry in general, Jerry was presented with the merit award, the association’s highest honor. Jerry continuously strived to make a difference and better the lives of those around him, which he did through a number of capacities. He was a board member and past President of the NWPA Manufacturers and business association and served on the board of Brown Memorial Hospital for 25 years until becoming the chairman. In addition, Jerry was instrumental in the creation of the sports complex for the Conneaut School System, where he was not only the major monetary donor for the project but also donated the land for the track and soccer field, which bears his name today. In serving his family and community, Jerry was a leader in the truest sense of the word and a role model for those who were privileged to know him. He set a standard of excellence and generosity that is both admirable and praiseworthy. Furthermore, Jerry was a class act that will be remembered for his distinguished career and selfless personality. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the memory of Jerry Eighmy, a serviceminded individual who leaves behind a legacy of compassion and integrity that will positively impact the Conneaut community for years to come. RATIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION HON. TED POE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the year was 1787. The American experiment was in trouble. After the Revolution, the colonies came together to draft the Articles of Confederation, which enumerated the powers of the new government. This document, however, left the government unable to regulate interstate commerce, raise revenue through taxes, or support a national defense. Many of the colonists had become restless, and some like Daniel Shays even began openly revolting against the newly founded government. It was time to act. Fiftyfive men from around the colonies made the arduous trek to Philadelphia, where they crammed inside Independence Hall, the same venue where, just eleven years before, many of the individuals present hammered out and ratified the Declaration of Independence. Under the leadership of the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. George Washington, the delegates debated a new direction for the fledgling government. The document that was finally agreed upon by the delegates was what we know today as the United States Constitution. The document outlined a federal government made up of three branches that could each check and balance the powers of the others. After much debate, it was up to the delegates to gain the ratification of their respective states. They returned home and attempted to whip up support for the Constitution, needing nine states out of thirteen to successfully bring the Constitution into law. Some went to great lengths to promote the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay published the Federalist Papers under pseudonyms, a series of essays that highlighted the advantages of the document. Slowly but surely, the ratifications trickled in. Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut were the first to support the document. Massachusetts, Maryland, and South Carolina followed suit, and finally on June 21, 1788, New Hampshire provided the ninth and decisive ratification. The Constitution was adopted by the U.S. government on March 4, 1789, and the other colonies soon ratified the document, successfully uniting the nation. More than any individual or group, the documents drafted and adopted by our Founding Fathers shaped who we are as a nation. The Constitution provides us the structure to defend, govern, and implement the beliefs and freedoms enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. It establishes that we the people, not a king or tyrant, would govern our nation. Mr. Speaker, George Washington hailed the Constitution as ‘‘the guide in which I will never abandon.’’ Today, on the occasion of the 230th anniversary of the ratification of this document, let us remember the oath that we took before taking office to support and defend this guide, the very essence of our democracy. And that is just the way it is. 
RECOGNIZING HEALTH SERVICES INCOPORATED FOR 50 YEARS OF OUTSTANDING HEALTHCARE SERVICE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to congratulate Health Services Incorporated on its 50th anniversary of providing affordable health and wellness services to residents of Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. Throughout its 50year history, Health Services has provided extraordinary healthcare service to the City of Montgomery and its surrounding communities. As a participant in the Federal Health Center Program, Health Services has worked tirelessly to improve the health of the underserved by delivering primary care, pediatric services, dentistry, optometry, family planning, counseling services, veteran benefits, WIC services, and healthcare enrollment services. Health Services traces its origin back to the late Senator J. Lister Hill, an innovator in his own right who pioneered healthcare legislation such as the HillBurton Act. This act was instrumental in providing federal funds to construct medical facilities such as Health Services with the goal of expanding quality health coverage to all Americans, especially those in rural or lower income areas. Beginning as a small clinic in the basement of Montgomery City Hall in 1968, Health Services used funds made available by the Hill Burton Act to construct their first clinic in the early 1970s. The building was renamed the Lister Hill Health Center in 1973 to honor Senator Hill. After the renaming, Health Services began expanding its operation, opening its second clinic in 1981 to serve Montgomery County’s rural population. In 1995 Health Services opened its first schoolbased center and began expanding into other rural Alabama counties, including its Lowndes County office in 1998. Since then, the doctors and providers at Health Services have expanded to 10 locations across 5 counties. Health Services has grown to be the number one healthcare provider to the underserved in South Central Alabama. All of Health Services’ locations operate on a sliding fee schedule to ensure the availability of quality health care to all of those who need medical attention. In addition to helping patients register for federal healthcare programs, Health Services also pioneers programs to bring health information to the communities it serves. Presently, Health Services Women’s Pavilion sees an average of 450 obstetrical patients and another 300 women seeking gynecological services each month. For lowincome families without health insurance, Health Services’ low fees and accessible healthcare are invaluable. In Montgomery County, Alabama, 15.8 percent of the population is uninsured, and in Lowndes County, 17 percent of Alabamians are uninsured. Without groups like Health Services, it would be extremely difficult for underserved residents in Montgomery, Lowndes, and other counties across Central Alabama to have access to quality healthcare. On behalf of the 7th Congressional District, the State of Alabama and this nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the tremendous accomplishments and extraordinary contributions of Health Services Incorporated—an organization that has worked tirelessly to provide quality and innovative healthcare to the citizens of Alabama for more than 50 years. f 
RUSSIAN AND CHINESE NUCLEAR ARSENALS: POSTURE, PROLIFERATION, AND THE FUTURE OF ARMS CONTROL 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the world today is in a new era of great power rivalry. Resurgent Russia and China are challenging U.S. interests across the globe. Both are rapidly modernizing their militaries to directly challenge America’s dominance on the battlefield and to undermine our alliances around the world. The potential for major conflict is closer now than it has been since the Cold War. China and Russia’s rising power has huge implications for how we trade, how we target rogue regimes, and how the entire international system works. While we often focus on Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs, we tend to overlook the two atomic arsenals that pose the greatest danger to our security. But with Russia and China’s aggressive behavior in places like Ukraine, Georgia, and the South China Sea, we are forced to rethink our deterrence against such threats. Comparing our nuclear arsenals, it’s clear China and Russia have been intent on challenging U.S. dominance and coercing our friends for some time. While we have barely upgraded some of our nuclear systems since they were first deployed in the early 1980s, China and Russia have introduced new weapons. We may be reluctant to maintain and upgrade such devastating weapons, but our strategic rivals are not. If we allow Russia or China to achieve nuclear superiority over us, the results will be dire for our allies and for the international order we have spent decades building. Just in March, Vladimir Putin unveiled several new nuclear weapons intended to make our missile defenses ‘‘useless.’’ They include a new heavy ICBM, a nuclearpowered cruise missile with ‘‘unlimited range,’’ and a nuclear powered unmanned submarine designed to sneak into coastal cities and explode. Such a heavy investment in nuclear arms is concerning and demonstrates Putin’s priority is not disarmament but strategic dominance. However, Putin left something out of his threatening display. He did not include the new groundlaunched cruise missile which the State Department has said for years is violating the INF Treaty. This missile undermines years of arms control negotiations and the good faith we have hoped to build with the Russians since the end of the Cold War. With the New START treaty expiring in 2021, the INF violation casts real doubt on continued strategic arms limitations with the Russians going forward. If the START treaty expires, the Russians will be completely free to expand their nuclear stockpile to what it was during the darkest days of the Cold War. This will likely force others—including ourselves—to also build more bombs. Worse, now that China is a major rival, we could be pushed into a situation more dangerous than the Cold War. We have been fortunate that China has kept its nuclear stockpile relatively small, focusing on minimal deterrence. But China is building new delivery systems to match our own and is not restrained to arms control agreements like those between the U.S. and Russia. China is rapidly building new ballistic missile submarines and mobile ICBMs which will further strain our military’s ability to track. Beijing is also making advances in hypersonic missiles that will make early warning systems ineffective. Yet, the major concern with China is its willingness to proliferate nuclear technology to rogue regimes. Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan have all benefited from Chinese assistance. In many cases, China has directly sold nuclear and missile technology to these terrorist regimes. China’s low regard for nonproliferation standards has been irresponsible and created increased instability around the globe. For too long we have not addressed the source of these rising threats. North Korea and Iran are major problems, but they would be far more isolated and far less dangerous if they did not have backing from Russia and China. Even our need for missile defense— which China and Russia claim is so destabilizing—would be unnecessary if these rogue regimes did not have help from Moscow and Beijing. As we think about the future of our nuclear forces and the future of arms control, we must have a clear view of the threats we face. China and Russia are capable adversaries. Left unchecked they will surpass us and make the world less safe. Therefore, we must continue to engage them to restrict the number and capability of these terrible weapons while making clear we will not allow them to gain the nuclear advantage. Ronald Reagan once said, ‘‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.’’ We must continue his legacy by seeking a world without nuclear arms. And that’s just the way it is. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise, along with my colleagues from the Bay Area, Representatives MARK DESAULNIER , ANNA ESHOO , JOHN GARAMENDI , JARED HUFFMAN , BARBARA  LEE, JACKIE SPEIER , ERICSWALWELL and M IKE THOMPSON . As members who represent Bay Area communities, we are proud to stand in support of the Bay Area Climate Action Forum, which will be held both before and after the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco. Science continues to produce overwhelming evidence that climate change is accelerating and bringing increasingly negative impacts around the globe. The devastating, and in some cases irreversible, costs impact our economy, health and the general wellbeing of all residents in the San Francisco Bay Area and around the globe. 
The United States was one of the original United Nations member countries to vote to adopt the historic Paris Climate Accord, which commits to a global initiative to combat climate change and its effects. Unfortunately, this administration has withdrawn the U.S. from this vital global agreement. Many American cities and states, especially the San Francisco Bay Area and throughout California, are committed to meeting the objectives laid out in the Paris Climate Accord. As their representatives in Congress, we are dedicated to maintaining the United States’ role as a global leader and will continue to advocate for the U.S. to be an active participant in fulfilling the principles and objectives of the Paris Climate Accord. Mitigating the effects of rapid climate change is a global imperative that requires participation from all levels of government, as well as private industry, nongovernmental organizations and individuals in our global community. We applaud the collaboration of those stakeholders in the San Francisco Bay Area who have joined together to hold the Bay Area Climate Action Forum. They are leading by example to show that a regional commitment to climate action is a critical component to finding sustainable solutions. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the UNC Charlotte 49ers Men’s Rugby Team and congratulate them on their National Men’s DII 7s Championship. The 49ers defeated the University of Wisconsin Whitewater on May 20, 2018. Led by Coach Brent ‘‘Bo’’ Pasko, UNC Charlotte capped off an impressive undefeated 2018 season and won its third straight Southern Rugby Conference championship. In the quarterfinals, the team defeated Principia College and moved on to eliminate Bloomsburg University in the semifinals. In the championship game, the Niners bested the University of Wisconsin Whitewater (38–10) to secure a perfect record during the tournament. The 49ers jumpstarted the championship game with fly half and MVP Michael Basnett scoring the first two tries in rapid succession. Wisconsin Whitewater responded by drawing the game within two points before Basnett crossed once more—advancing the score to 19–10. In the second half, the 49ers opened the flood gates and tries were scored swiftly. Basnett dominated the second half, scoring at will and orchestrating the 49ers’ offense to perfection. It was an immense victory for UNC Charlotte. In defeating the University of Wisconsin Whitewater, the 49ers upset the reigning Division II Rugby 15s and 7s champions. As a proud UNC Charlotte Rugby Alumnus, it brings me great pride to recognize these extraordinary young men as well as all of the coaches and support staff that made this Championship possible. The hard work and dedication exhibited by each member of the team during the season will continue to serve them well in life. They are a source of pride to both UNC Charlotte as well as the surrounding community. I already can’t wait to see what 2019 has in store for the 49ers. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in congratulating the UNC Charlotte 49ers Men’s Rugby Team on their national title. Go mean green. f 
COMMEMORATING THE 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the countless brave men and women who worked to achieve integration on the campus of the University of Alabama (UA). This battle was finally won on June 11, 1963, nearly a decade after the U.S. Supreme Court declared segregation unconstitutional in the 1954 landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. On that day, school officials attempted to allow black students to enter the University of Alabama, while thenGovernor George C. Wallace took his infamous ‘‘Stand in the Schoolhouse Door.’’ During the stand, Governor Wallace stood at the doors of Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama to physically, and symbolically, block the entry of two black students: Vivian Malone and James Hood. While Hood and Malone’s attempt to desegregate the University of Alabama was historic, they were not the first black students to apply or attend the school. Autherine Lucy, a graduate student from Shiloh, had been accepted to the University and attended for three days in 1956. In response to her attendance, mob violence broke out on UA’s campus, and university officials said the school could no longer protect Lucy. She filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the University, which was used as an excuse to expel her. Five years later, with the help of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund of Alabama, Hood and Malone applied to enroll at the University of Alabama. Their applications were denied and the two students faced threats for even applying, but Hood and Malone persisted. After two years of court proceedings, District Court Judge Harlan Grooms granted Hood and Malone permission to enroll at the University of Alabama, ruling that the University was in violation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. Despite the ruling, Governor Wallace blocked the school doors, even as federal authorities demanded he step aside. When Wallace refused to budge, President John F. Kennedy called for 100 troops from the Alabama National Guard to assist federal marshals in helping Hood and Malone enter campus. At that point, Governor Wallace stepped aside. In 1965, Malone received a Bachelor of Arts in Business Management and became the first African American to graduate from the University of Alabama. Hood left the University after only two months, but returned in 1995 to begin earning his doctorate degree. On May 17, 1997, he received his Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Studies. The legacy of Wallace’s stand in the schoolhouse door is twofold. Although it is a reminder of the sacrifices made by African American students seeking a higher education, it also served as a turning point for the first steps toward racial equality at the University and within the State of Alabama. We commend the bravery and determination of the students who continued to fight for their rights and for equal access to education despite facing resistance from all levels of society. We also recognize the importance of continuing to work towards creating a more fair and just society for all citizens. In the years since the ‘‘Stand in the Schoolhouse Doors,’’ Malone, Hood, and countless others have been able to rightfully enroll at the University of Alabama. To this day, students of all ethnicities and backgrounds, including those involved in UA’s Black Alumni Association, have gone on to earn undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees from the University of Alabama. As Malone reflected on her time at the University, she hoped that her impact would be lasting. ‘‘I was just one person, but I think of the thousands of people who came after me, and I would just like to think their road might have been a little bit easier, [because of us]’’ Malone said. It is because of the courage shown by Vivian Malone and James Hood that students from the University of Alabama have since been able to create a Black Alumni Association dedicated to alumni engagement, scholarship support, mentoring, and networking. Since it was established in 2016, the group has contributed more than $16,000 in donations towards the AAAN Endowed Scholarship Fund. Since 1963, the University of Alabama has continued to solidify its legacy by exemplifying its continued commitment to inclusion and equality for all persons willing to learn and grow on their campus. Regardless of race, the University of Alabama promises to welcome all students through its doors. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating diversity and inclusion at the University of Alabama on the 55th anniversary of its integration. 
RECOGNIZING MR. NATHAN CHITTENDEN OF DUTCH HOLLOW FARM IN SCHODACK LANDING, NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I rise today to recognize the many achievements of Mr. Nathan Chittenden of Dutch Hollow Farm in Schodack Landing, New York. Nate has been named the recipient of Cornell University’s prestigious Hometown Alumni Award. This designation recognizes Cornell graduates who have returned to their hometown to start or develop a business while also being active and engaged members of their communities. Nate is a thirdgeneration farmer, carrying on his family’s rich dairy farming tradition. Following his graduation from Cornell in 2000 with a degree in dairy science, he returned to the family farm. Since then, he has grown 
Dutch Hollow Farm and has become an esteemed advocate and clarion voice for the dairy farming industry across New York State. Dairy farming is a vitally important part of our identity in Upstate New York, and Nate has worked tirelessly to ensure it remains the engine of our local economy. Through his active participation in the ColumbiaGreene Cornell Extension Board, the AgriMark Young Cooperators Board, and as a local 4–H dairy leader for over two decades, Nate has become a fixture within the farming community as well as the greater Rensselaer County community. This Hometown Alumni Award is a true testament to Nate’s steadfast commitment to his community and to dairy farming. I cannot think of anyone more deserving of this honor. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Nate on receiving this award. His lifetime of hard work is inspirational, and I am grateful for his many contributions to New York State and to our robust dairy industry. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, on June 20, 2018, during roll call vote No. 276 and No. 278 on the passage of H.R. 5797, the IMD CARE Act, and H.R. 6082, the Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act, I was not present on the floor to cast my vote. I fully intended to vote ‘‘yes’’ on both pieces of legislation which will help address the opioid crisis facing our nation. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career and community contributions of Walter J. Corter, of the Third Congressional District, who will retire on July 1, 2018, after over thirty four years of public service to Burlington Township. Walter has dedicated his career to serving the public. He was hired as a Burlington Township Police Officer in 1974 and held various assignments in the Patrol Division and Investigation Division. He was then appointed as the Public Safety Director in 1983 , and remained in that position until 1994. From 1995 to 2003, he served as the Chief of Investigations for the Burlington County Prosecutor’s Office. He additionally served 12 years as Burlington Township’s Emergency Management Coordinator. In 2004, he returned to the role of Public Safety Director where he remained until 2011. He was ultimately appointed as the Township Administrator in 2012 and has served in that position ever since. Walter has received numerous recognitions throughout his career, including several lifetime achievements from the Jewish Relations Council of South Jersey, the Burlington County Prosecutor’s Office, the FBI National Academy Associates, and the Burlington County Police Chiefs Association. He has served on FBI Director Mueller’s National Law Enforcement Advisory Committee and is a lifetime member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the FBI National Academy Associates. Through his efforts, several partnerships have been formed with various agencies and organizations, which continue to benefit the residents of Burlington Township. Walter is a highly respected individual whose leadership abilities, perseverance, and integrity are widely recognized and demonstrate his commitment to public service. He has continued to further initiatives and programs within Burlington Township that benefit the community as a whole. Mr. Speaker, the people of New Jersey’s Third Congressional District are tremendously honored to have Walter J. Corter as a member of their community. Walter has shown a desire to serve the public and to give back to his community, and has worked continuously to do so at the best of his ability. I am honored to recognize his career of public service and to commend him for all that he has contributed to his community. f 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize June as Scleroderma Awareness Month. Scleroderma is a chronic connective tissue disease generally classified as one of the autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Hardening of the skin is one of the most visible manifestations of the disease. The disease is also known as ‘‘systemic sclerosis,’’ a subset of the disease in which internal organ systems (such as kidneys, lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal track) and skin, or internal organ systems only, are affected. It is estimated that about 300,000 Americans have scleroderma with onethird of those having the systemic form of the disease. Scleroderma varies from patient to patient and often presents with symptoms similar to other autoimmune diseases, making diagnosis and treatment extremely complicated. There may be many misdiagnosed or undiagnosed cases. Currently, there is no cure for scleroderma. On behalf of the scleroderma community, I am proud to be the lead sponsor of H.R. 4638, the National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrotic Diseases Act. This bill would establish a National Commission on Fibrotic Diseases within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to evaluate and make recommendations regarding improvements to the coordination and advancement of NIHsupported research activities related to fibrosis and fibrotic diseases. I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation by becoming a cosponsor of H.R. 4638, which will increase research and treatments for the fibrotic community. COMMEMORATING THE GROUND BREAKING FOR THE STEPHEN D. ‘‘STEVE’’ HOGAN PARKWAY HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the groundbreaking for the Stephen D. ‘‘Steve’’ Hogan Parkway in Aurora, Colorado. Named in honor of Aurora’s Mayor Steve Hogan, who sadly passed away on May 13, 2018, this parkway represents a long awaited major improvement and expansion of Aurora, Colorado’s Sixth Avenue. The parkway is fittingly named to honor the life of this wellloved public servant, who I was fortunate enough to call a friend. The parkway’s design was finalized in February of 2017, and completion is scheduled to occur prior to the end of 2019. This expansion of Sixth Avenue will greatly facilitate east/west mobility in Aurora and provide substantial safety and congestion improvements at the 6th Avenue entrance to Buckley Air Force Base. Throughout his time serving the citizens of Aurora as a state legislator, as a member of Aurora City Council, and as its Mayor, Steve Hogan tirelessly worked on behalf of the citizens of the City of Aurora. During his time in elected office, Aurora has grown from a medium sized suburb of Denver to become Colorado’s third largest city with a full range of amenities, services, and its own distinct identity. The Stephen D. Hogan parkway will symbolize his lasting legacy as a public servant. I am pleased that this vital transportation project will do so much for Aurora, the wonderful city that Mayor Hogan loved, by bringing it new growth and economic opportunities. Steve Hogan was truly a model citizen and a great mayor of my hometown. It is my honor to take this opportunity to commemorate, here on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, this important event in the legacy and the life of Mayor Steve Hogan. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I pay tribute to a devoted and hardworking businessman, Mr. Jerry C. Grimsley. Mr. Grimsley passed away on Monday, June 11, 2018. A funeral service was held on Friday, June 15, 2018, at First Baptist Church in Colquitt, Georgia. A Georgia man through and through, Jerry was born on July 19, 1939, to Clarence E. Grimsley and Julia Tassie Odom Grimsley on their family farm in Miller County, Georgia. After graduating from Miller County High School in 1957, he attended Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton, Georgia. Mr. Grimsley was a highly trusted leader in the agriculture and financial services industries. He built quite an impressive career 
which began in 1962 at Farmers Fertilizer and Milling Company as VicePresident and Co Owner with his fatherinlaw. He became the President of Farmers Fertilizer and Milling Company in 1974 and helped it to grow from a small feed and fertilizer manufacturer into an internationally recognized leader in the peanut shelling industry. Mr. Grimsley also was the Founding Director of Peoples Bank, now Peoples South, when it was chartered on March 16, 1973. During his tenure as Founding Director, the bank grew from one small branch in Colquitt to twentynine branches across Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. He served in this capacity for 45 years until early 2018, when his health started to decline. Upon his retirement, he became the Director Emeritus of Peoples Bank and the owner of a local golf course which he named ‘‘Clydesdale Meadows’’. Throughout his career, Mr. Grimsley served on a number of boards and was affiliated with several associations. He was President and Chairman of the Board for the Southeastern Peanut Sheller’s Association (1975 to 1976); the Board of the National Peanut Council (1985 to 1987); and President of American Peanut Sheller’s Association (1990 to 1991). In addition to these roles, he also served as the Chairman of several peanutbased committees. In 2000, Birdsong Peanuts purchased Farmer Fertilizer and Milling Company, and Jerry served as a consultant in the Southeast Division. George Washington Carver once said, ‘‘No individual has any right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.’’ We are all so blessed that Mr. Jerry C. Grimsley passed this way and during his life’s journey did so much for so many for so long. He leaves behind a great legacy in public service to the countless residents of Colquitt whose lives he touched and brightened. He is survived by his sons, Gerry and Scott; and a host of family and friends who will miss him dearly. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, along with my wife, Vivian, and the more than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Congressional District in paying tribute to Mr. Jerry C. Grimsley for his remarkable leadership in our great State of Georgia. We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and the Colquitt, Georgia community during this difficult time and pray that they will be comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MAJOR GENERAL WAYNE P. JACKSON (RETIRED), UNITED STATES ARMY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major General Wayne P. Jackson, Retired, a true patriot and fellow veteran who I had the honor of joining in throwing out the first pitch earlier this month at Roger Dean Stadium. Born in Chicago in 1929, General Jackson was commissioned in 1951 as a Second Lieutenant after several years of enlisted service in the U.S. Army Air Force and U.S. Navy. His 37 years in the service was defined by profound courage and many accomplishments. He served in various overseas theaters of operation and has commanded Signal Corps, Military Intelligence and Civil Affairs units. As a General Officer he served as the Director of Counter Intelligence and Security, the Assistant to the Chief of Staff for Intelligence at the Department of the Army Headquarters, the Commanding General of the 352nd Civil Affairs Command, and the Deputy and Commanding General of the 97th Army Reserve Command. General Jackson has also been awarded the Expert Infantry Badge, the Parachute Badge, and the Master Aviator Badge. His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal and several other military awards and decorations. However, General Jackson’s life of excellence extends not only to his military service, but to his academic work as well. He received his Bachelor of Arts and Masters of Arts degrees in psychology at the University of Tulsa. He did post graduate work at the Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Southern California. His military education includes the basic and advanced officer courses at the Signal and Military Intelligence Schools. He has also completed the advanced courses at the Civil Affairs and Infantry Schools. He is a graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College and the U.S. Army War College. General Jackson and his wife, Lahoma reside in Jupiter, Florida. His son Wayne Jr. and two daughters, Jacky and Jennifer, four grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren also reside in Jupiter. In the tradition of his father, his son Wayne Jr., is also retired from the U.S. Army. General Jackson has lived a life of excellence and of many great accomplishments both in the military and as a civilian. Mr. Speaker, that is why I am honoring General Jackson and thank him for his many years of service to our country. I have no doubt that he will continue to accomplish great things in the years to come. f 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Lilia Elizabeth Giacomazzi as the 2018 Distinguished Dairyperson by the June Dairy Month Committee of Kings County, California. Mrs. Giacomazzi was born Lilia Elizabeth Curti on July 23, 1913 in Fresno, California to her parents Miro and Domenica Curti, immigrants from the small town of Albonico in the northern Italian Alps. The oldest of five siblings, Lilia graduated from Tulare Union High School in 1927. On July 12, 1936 Lilia married Fred Giacomazzi and the newlyweds moved to a home on the Hanfordbased Giacomazzi Dairy, Kings County’s longestcontinuouslyoperating dairy. Their initial home now houses the Giacomazzi Dairy offices. In October 1937, Lilia and Fred had their first child, their son Donald and three years later, in March 1940, welcomed their daughter, Patricia. Mrs. Giacomazzi was actively involved in her children’s education, serving as a room mother and president of the Hanford High School ParentTeachers Association. Additionally, she helped many Kings County 4–H participants learn to cook, sew, and garden. Her love of gardening led to her work establishing the LaCasa Garden Club and, eventually, LaCasa Park in Hanford, California. Her love and passion for gardening has remained a constant during her 105 years. On July 12, 1998, Mrs. Giacomazzi lost her beloved husband of sixtytwo years, Fred. However, she has found comfort from her seven grandchildren and to eight greatgrandchildren to whom she is known as ‘‘Nonna.’’ Mrs. Giacomazzi also served as President of the Kings County Dairywomen and Western United Dairy Women of California. This year marks Mrs. Giacomazzi’s fifty fith year of service to the Kings County Dairywomen. She has also been actively involved in the Sons of Italy Lodge, the Central Valley Hospital Auxiliary, the Kings County Republican Women Federated, the Kings County Historical Society, the American Theater Organ Society, the Kings Symphony Orchestra, and the Young Ladies Institute. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in commending Mrs. Lilia Elizabeth Giacomazzi on her lifetime of service to the Central Valley and on receiving the 2018 Distinguished Dairyperson Award. f 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor deceased Trumbull County, Ohio resident 1st Lt. Olof M. Ballinger, pilot of the 42–299–28 B–17 Flying Fortress that was shot down over Normandy, France during WWII 75 years ago on July 4, 1943. 2nd Lt. George C. Williams, Bombardier of Warren, Ohio, was also aboard the aircraft. Pilot Olof Maximilian Ballinger of Newton Falls, Trumbull County, Ohio evaded capture and walked alone, with no compass, over the Pyrenees Mountains during the winter. He reached safety in Spain in November 1943 and returned to the U.S. He eventually moved to California. George C. Williams, bombardier from Warren, Trumbull County, Ohio, was killed in action. While assisting the nose gunner, his chute accidentally opened inside the aircraft. Pilot Olof Ballinger offered up his own parachute, but George Williams refused. It is thought that George Williams attempted to fly the plane after all the crew had evacuated. Also aboard the aircraft was Harry W. Basucher Jr. of Cincinnati, Ohio and Albert Wackerman of Salinas, California who were killed in action by enemy cannon fire. Bryon J. Gronstall, of Van Nuys, California and John K. Lane, a radio operator from Deland, Florida, were captured by German patrol and were Prisoners of War at Stalag 7A. William C. Howell, of Goldsboro, North Carolina and Paul 
McConnell, the navigator from Montgomery, Alabama both evaded capture. Francis E. Owens, of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, also evaded capture, but he died of exposure in the Pyrenees Mountains while trying to assist other crewmen through the dangerous passage. He was awarded the Soldiers Medal for dragging wounded men out of harm’s way. Copilot, John Marshall Carrah, from Chico, California, evaded capture and escaped to Switzerland, to Spain, and then returned to the U.S. in March 1944. He continued to assist in the war effort. He was a career United States Air Force Officer, retiring as a Lt. Colonel. A documentary was created about these seven brave American aviators and will be featured at an event in Warren, Ohio on July 2, 2018. The son of copilot John M. Carrah will also be at the event to share his firsthand knowledge about his father’s experience. I am inspired by the stories of these brave Americans, and I’m so proud of the individuals who are keeping this history alive for younger generations.

IN RECOGNITION OF JACK MEINKE ON HIS OFFER OF APPOINTMENT TO ATTEND THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. I am pleased to announce that Jack Meinke of Millbury, Ohio has been offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Jack’s offer of appointment permits him to attend the United States Naval Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2022. Attending one of our nation’s military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country, but also guarantees a worldclass education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of a lifetime. Jack brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2022. While attending St. John’s Jesuit High School in Toledo, Ohio, Jack was active in the National Honor Society, National Spanish Honor Society, and was an Honor Roll student. Additionally, he participated in Buckeye Boys State, Ignatian Guild Scholars, and various leadership and mentoring programs. Throughout high school, Jack excelled on the football and wrestling teams, earning varsity letters and diligently serving as captain of the wrestling team. I am confident that Jack will carry the lessons of his student and athletic leadership to the Naval Academy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Jack Meinke on his offer of appointment to the United States Naval Academy. Our service academies offer the finest military training and education available. I am positive that Jack will excel during his career at the Naval Academy, and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to our Nation. f

IN RECOGNITION OF DEPUTY CHIEF OF POLICE BETTY MILLER STOCKS RECEIVING THE ROBERT JACKSON EURY MEMORIAL AWARD 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Concord Deputy Chief of Police Betty Miller Stocks for receiving the Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award. Deputy Chief Stocks has now become the first African American recipient of this award. A native of Concord, North Carolina, Deputy Chief Stocks has served with the Concord Police Department in North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District for 27 years. Education was of the utmost importance to Deputy Chief Stocks—graduating from Concord High School before earning an Associate’s Degree in Criminal Justice from RowanCabarrus Community College, a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice from BarberScotia College and a Master’s Degree in Public Administration from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Throughout her career, Deputy Chief Stocks has served as a Patrol Officer, Sergeant, Captain, and now Deputy Chief of Police. Deputy Chief Stock’s outstanding leadership and commitment in these roles for the Concord Police Department made her stand out in our community. The Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award is presented in memory of Robert Jackson Eury, a man who lost his life in the line of duty while serving as a Cabarrus County law enforcement officer. This award keeps Mr. Eury’s legacy alive through officers who share his same admirable and commendable spirit in Cabarrus County. Based on her career of service, I would say Deputy Chief Stocks fits the mold of esteemed law enforcement officers in our community set by Robert Eury. There is no doubt in my mind that Deputy Chief Stocks will continue her outstanding leadership and maintain her unwavering values while protecting the people of Cabarrus County; I am excited to see what the future holds for such a dedicated law enforcement professional. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in congratulating Deputy Chief of Police Betty Miller Stocks for receiving the Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award. We all wish her well as she continues to make a positive impact on our community. f 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to go on the record as fully supporting H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. I was detained off the floor and missed the opportunity to cast my vote on a bill that indeed supports our farmers and rural America. I would like to reflect that I voted in favor of this bill, H.R. 2, the first time it came to the floor on May 18, 2018. I commend Chairman CONAWAY on passage of the bill on the House floor. This new Farm Bill will benefit consumers and producers, and all those who make our food supply chain abundant and secure. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5788, the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act. The STOP Act requires the U.S. Postal Service to collect Advanced Electronic Data on international shipments, making it easier for U.S. Customs to target highrisk shipments for inspection and seizure. This is particularly important to stem the deadly flow of fentanyl 
coming from China. I understand the concerns about potential civil penalties that could be imposed if USPS fails to meet terms of compliance. But with the updated language added to the final version, I am confident this legislation provides sufficient flexibility allowing USPS to avoid those penalties as long as it is making a good faith effort to institute AED collection in a meaningful way. I will closely follow the implementation of this policy and will work to make sure USPS can comply without leading to costsaving actions such as reductions of service, consolidation or closing of post offices, or cuts to the employee workforce. We must stop these dangerous shipments to help save the lives of those who are addicted to opioids. Although there is more to be done to tackle the opioid crisis, this is one step forward that I support. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues, Representatives DEVIN NUNES and J IMCOSTA , to honor the life of Mr. John Carlos Martins, who sadly passed away on June 16, 2018. Mr. John Carlos Martins was born on April 21, 1964 in the parish of Altares, on the Portuguese island of Terceira. Just two years later, in 1966, John and his family immigrated to the United States and settled in Artesia, California. At a young age, John developed an interest in carpentry. After graduating from Cerritos High School in 1982, Mr. Martins attended Los Angeles TradeTechnical College where he advanced and honed his craft further, enabling him to build a successful development company with his father and brother. In 1997, Mr. Martins was appointed to the City of Artesia Planning Commission and in 2001, he was elected to serve on the Artesia City Council. Following his service as city councilman, John continued working for the people of Artesia as Mayor of the city from 2004 until his retirement in 2010. Although John and his family left the Azores Islands of Portugal early in his childhood, he remained deeply connected to his roots, as seen through his steadfast involvement in the PortugueseAmerican community. John participated in, and held positions on, many local and statewide PortugueseAmerican organizations. Mr. Martins was a Board Member of the California Portuguese American Coalition, President of the Artesia DES Portuguese Center in 2006 and 2013, Board Director of the LusoAmerican Fraternal Federation for eight years, and in 2000, he became President of that same Federation. Additionally, in 2015, Mr. Martins was appointed Honorary Consul of Portugal in Los Angeles. While John dedicated the majority of his free time to his community, he also pursued his musical passions. John began playing guitar when he was only ten years old, and throughout his time in school he learned to play various other instruments. In 1979, he and his siblings formed the group Aquarious and travelled the world playing music for over twentyfive years. In 2012, John teamed up with his son Cole and his old bandmate David to establish the band 562. The talented group performed throughout California at various events and festivals and to many sold out shows. Mr. Martins’ tireless and selfless dedication to his community was truly inspiring. Although he left us too soon, John made a lasting, positive impact on the people he met. John is survived by his wife Karen and their three children. Mr. Speaker, today we ask our colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join us in honoring the life of Mr. John Carlos Martins. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and community during this difficult time. f 
HORNORING THE DILLARD CENTER FOR THE ARTS JAZZ BAND IN WINNING THE 2018 ESSENTIALLY ELLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL JAZZ BAND COMPETITION 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today and recognize the Dillard Center for the Arts Jazz Band on their May 12, 2018 first place win at the 2018 Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition in New York City. Dillard High School, located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida has a long history of excellence in the arts. In 1948, Dillard’s wellknown jazz program attracted one of the greatest musicians in history, Julian Edwin ‘‘Cannonball’’ Adderley. Under the leadership of Director Christopher Dorsey, Dillard’s Jazz Band performed on stage at Lincoln Center for the Essentially Ellington Competition. They were judged by an esteemed panel of jazz musicians, lead by composer and trumpeter Mr. Wynton Marsalis, and deemed to be worthy of the first place prize out of fifteen band finalists. Additionally, Ms. Summer Camargo, a member of the band, won the Composition/Arranger Contest. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of the Dillard Center for the Arts Jazz band. I wish Director Dorsey and the entire jazz band ensemble a hearty congratulations.

SUPPORTING PASSAGE OF H.R. 6 AND URGING FURTHER ACTION TO PREVENT ADDICTION 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank all of the Members who have worked across the aisle on the opioid bills we’ve passed over the past two weeks. The bipartisan work that has gone into these bills is exactly what our constituents sent us to Congress to do. I have enjoyed working with Rep. PETER ROSKAM on H.R. 5773, the Preventing Addiction for Susceptible Seniors Act, which passed on Tuesday as a suspension. Since our committee has jurisdiction over the Medicare program, we found it necessary to 
work on legislation that helps the seniors impacted by the opioid crisis across this country. The bill included another bill I worked on with Rep. RENACCI , H.R. 5715, the Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid Abuse Act. The bill encourages greater data sharing between CMS and insurers. All the bills passed in recent weeks represent the first step in addressing a crisis that has impacted millions of Americans and their families. In 2016, we lost 64,000 American lives from drug overdoses. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death among Americans under the age of 50. After today, we must continue to focus on policies that lift our constituents out of the conditions that lead to addiction. Whether that results from social isolation, financial anxiety, emotional or physical trauma, inadequate access to primary or mental health care, we should consider how all of the policies we advance in this body will impact our constituents. The lessons from past drug crises and the evidence supporting the public health approach we are taking today can guide us as we seek an end to the current opioid crisis— without revamping the failed and costly War on Drugs. Opioid addiction is a disease that has spread to millions of Americans across the country, from our young students to our parents and grandparents, from our rural communities to our big cities. Alabama, which has the highest rate of opioid prescriptions in the country, is a battleground in our fight against this epidemic. Millions of Americans become addicted to opioids after being prescribed opioids after surgery or to manage pain. My congressional district and state is home to many retired coal miners and men and women who have spent their lives working in physically intensive jobs in manufacturing. I have no doubt that the chronic pain they have sustained from years in physically taxing work environments is real and requires pain medication. I also have heard from constituents with sickle cell disease and cancer, who require pain management to treat the pain that results from their conditions. Moving forward, I am committed to working on policies that advance and encourage the development and adoption of nonopioid alternatives for pain management. From increased access to physical therapy and chiropractic care to postsurgical nonopioid alternatives, I urge CMS to take the steps they can today to change reimbursement policies that discourage providers to prescribe nonopioid alternatives. The preventative action necessary for a crisis as such can be observed in the case of Jessica Kilpatrick, an Alabama woman in a small town in Northwest Alabama. As stated in the Washington Post, ‘‘for as long as she could remember, pills made the intolerable possible. Now, without them, she was a poor woman in a poor town with a swollen right foot from a 10hour shift [at Burger King] and a new key tag from Narcotics Anonymous that said ‘‘Clean and Serene for Eighteen months.’’ Susceptibility to relapse on this road to recovery is fueled by the lack of access to adequate treatment for both pain and addiction. I am deeply concerned about Alabamians who work hard every day but yet fall into the Medicaid gap. Workers who make more than 18 percent of the poverty line but less than the federal poverty line do not qualify for any assistance, making prevention and treatment more expensive in nonexpansion states and unaffordable for Alabamians in minimum wage jobs. I urge all Members of Congress to support H.R. 6 today because it marks a positive step in the right direction as we work to improve the lives of the millions of Americans impacted by the opioid and addiction crisis. 
HONORING THE CAREER OF LEGENDARY SPECIAL FORCES VETERAN MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL D. HEALY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy of Major General Michael D. Healy who passed away on April 15, 2018 at the age of 91. During his 35 years of dedicated service, Maj. Gen. Healy served valiantly, made history and showed us all how to be a family man. After enlisting in the United States Army in 1945, Maj. Gen. Healy began an illustrious career with deployments in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. After evading enemy machine gun fire in the Korean War, Maj. Gen. Healy was given the nickname ‘‘Iron Mike’’ and it has stuck with him throughout his entire life. His nerves of steel and unparalleled courage led him to become one of the first Green Berets to achieve the rank of General. Deployed on numerous operational assignments all over the globe and through some of our nation’s toughest times, Maj. Gen. Healy stood ready to answer the call to serve our nation. Throughout these operations, he delivered on the promise to keep America safe and confront our enemies under the most difficult conditions. Maj. Gen. Healy received numerous medals and recognitions for his service, including the Distinguished Service Cross, Bronze Star Medal, Distinguished Service Medal, two awards of the Silver Star, four awards of the Legion of Merit, and the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was truly a man of humility, bravery, and dignity. While fighting our nation’s battles overseas, Maj. Gen. Healy most important commitment remained to his family back home. He was married to his lovely wife, Jacklyn, for 69 years, and they raised six sons, ten grandchildren and eight great grandchildren. This country cannot repay the debt we owe to Maj. Gen. Healy and his family—the Healys are true American heroes. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the career of the Major General Michael D. Healy. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Giacomazzi Dairy as it celebrates its 125th year of continuous operations producing milk in Kings County, California. Founded by Luigi Giacomazzi, an immigrant from Moghegno, Ticino, Switzerland, Giacomazzi Dairy opened on property acquired from Southern Pacific Rail Road Company in 1893, the same year Kings County was formed. Mr. Giacomazzi developed the land and founded the dairy with just ten cows producing butter and cheese that he sold to locals and Chinese railroad workers. After marrying his wife, the former Gilia Pincini, Mr. Giacomazzi built their farm and dairy with the help of their four children: Florinda, Louis, Jr., Stephen, and Fred. In 1923, Giacomazzi Dairy became the first dairy to install milking machines in the region. These revolutionary machines simultaneously milked four cows. By 1937, Giacomazzi Dairy constructed their third Grade A barn in Kings County. Technological advances enabled the Giacomazzis to milk fortytwo cows at a time. Louis, Jr., Stephen, and Fred formed a new partnership—Giacomazzi Brothers—with each sibling handling a distinct aspect of operations. Once considered the largest dairy operation in the southern Central Valley region, Giacomazzi Brothers dissolved the partnership in 1969, however, Fred Giacomazzi continued to operate the dairy, purchasing land from the partnership. Joined by his son, Donald in 1974, Fred increased the dairy’s herd to 350 cows with approximately 300 acres of farmland. In 1985, the Giacomazzi Dairy herd grew to 600 cows and its farming operation expanded to 500 acres. Don and his wife Jackie, had four children: Gina, Dino, Cara, and Mia. In 2003, Dino returned to the farm after working thirteen years in the music and internet industries. Two years later, Dino married his wife, the former Julie Friebe, and took over daytoday management and operations of the farm. Since assuming operations, Dino has expanded the herd to 1,000 cows on 1,000 acres, including 375 acres planted with almond trees. Beginning with its first milking machine in 1923, Giacomazzi Dairy has established itself as a leader in agriculture innovation. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in congratulating the Giacomazzi Dairy, Kings County’s longest, continuously operating dairy, on its 125th year of producing milk. f 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 22, 2018 Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the leadership of David Fountain, North Carolina President of Duke Energy, as he completes his successful term of service as chair of the Leadership North Carolina Board of Directors. Leadership North Carolina is an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that engages current and emerging leaders from across the state. Its mission is to inform, develop, and engage committed leaders by broadening their understanding of and involvement in issues and opportunities facing the 
state. Each year LNC recruits committed individuals interested in learning more about North Carolina and connecting with fellow leaders. Through innovative programming, LNC teaches these engaged citizens about the challenges and opportunities facing North Carolina and offers tools to turn their knowledge into action for the benefit of the state. David Fountain has been an energetic and visionary chair of LNC’s board since 2016, as one might have expected from his successful rise through the ranks at Duke Energy. He holds BA, JD, and MBA degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a MoreheadCain Scholar. He practiced law at McGuire Woods in Raleigh from 1994 to 2000, after which he joined what was then called Carolina Power & Light as associate general counsel. From 2009 to 2012, Mr. Fountain served as general counsel and vice president of Progress Energy Inc. From there, he went on to serve as senior vice president of Enterprise Legal Support at Duke Energy and rose to the role of President in 2015. David was elected chair of Leadership North Carolina in 2016. He knew and believed in the program as an alumnus and has given it full benefit of his experience and dedication. He has helped position the program for sustainability for years to come and has strengthened its reputation among leaders in business, government, education, and the nonprofit sectors. The measure of a good leader is the legacy he or she leaves behind. Mr. Fountain leaves North Carolina with 1,157 informed and engaged leaders and has challenged them to exercise their influence for the benefit of our state and nation. I want to join David Fountain’s many friends and admirers in thanking him for the time and effort he has dedicated to Leadership North Carolina and to congratulate him for a job well done. He leaves the organization stronger than he found it, better equipped to nurture future generations of conscientious and effective leaders. For that, all North Carolinians are in his debt.
