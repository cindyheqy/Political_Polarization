Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Trenton Fire Department on the 90th Anniversary of its founding. The Trenton Fire Department has provided important fire prevention and lifesaving services to the City of Trenton and the surrounding communities. Founded in 1927 to replace the previous all- volunteer system, the Trenton Fire Department initially consisted of seven full-time firemen and one pumper truck. Since its inception, the Department has grown and expanded to ac-commodate the increased size and needs of the community. Today, the Fire Department has 29 personnel, three fire trucks and two Advanced Life Support ambulances housed in two stations that operate 24 hours a day. These resources help the department serve the approximately 2,500 calls for help that it receives each year with an on-scene response time of less than four minutes. The Trenton Fire Department is also a member of the Downriver Mutual Aid Group, which offers sur-rounding communities emergency assistance in times of need. The Trenton Fire Department’s effectiveness plays a critical role in keeping the Trenton community safe from fires, hazards and other emergencies. In addition to its emergency services, the department has engaged in com-munity-based initiatives to further protect the well-being of Trenton residents. These include offering free smoke detectors to residents on fixed incomes, as well as operating the Tren-ton Firefighters Charity Organization, which provides financial support to over 100 organi-zations that serve the community. Collectively, these efforts have had a tremendous impact in keeping Trenton and its residents safe from danger. It is my hope that the Trenton Fire Department continues its outstanding legacy of public service and care for the sick and in-jured in Trenton and the surrounding areas. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Trenton Fire Department on the 90th Anniversary of its establishment. The Trenton Fire Department’s wide spectrum of services are key to protecting public health and providing emergency support to the city.

RECOGNIZING UNITED STATES NAVY CAPTAIN MIKE STEFFEN 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 24, 2017 Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize United States Navy Captain Mike Steffen and his leadership as the 11th Com-manding Officer of Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base, which is located in the 12th District of Texas that I represent. Over his naval career, Captain Steffen has served numerous deployments overseas—in-cluding two combat tours conducting special operations forward deployed in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and earned a number of decorations for his service. In August 2015, I was pleased to speak at the ceremony when he assumed command of Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base, Texas. Captain Steffen has since worked tirelessly to grow the base and ensure it fully supports the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps commands to help them prepare for deployment around the world in these dan-gerous times. He has also done an excellent job of fostering a spirit of collaboration to make sure the base and the communities sur-rounding it grow and thrive. Fort Worth is proud of our nation’s military and proud of our base. It’s in our genes since the city started as a fort. Like Captain Steffen says whenever the roar of a fighter jet is heard overhead, ‘‘Texans love the sound of freedom.’’ Captain Steffen will be turning over com-mand of Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base this month on new orders. He will leave the base well-positioned for the fu-ture. On behalf of the people of the 12th Con-gressional District of Texas, I wish him and his family fair winds and following seas. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF BOY SCOUT TROOP 1721 ON THE 90TH ANNI-VERSARY OF ITS FOUNDING 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 24, 2017 Mrs. DlNGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Boy Scout Troop 1721 on the 90th anniversary of its founding. Since its establish-ment, Boy Scout Troop 1721 has served the Downriver area through its community service projects and the activism of its members. Founded in 1927 as Boy Scout Troop TN– 1, Troop 1721 has compiled an outstanding record of service and engagement with Tren-ton and the surrounding areas. The troop holds regular food drives and collections for nearby food pantries through its Scouting for Food initiative and other events. Additionally, the troop has completed projects including the installation of bat houses at the International Wildlife Refuge, as well as seating and sign upgrades at the cultural center. The troop has also excelled at leadership development, with 126 Boy Scouts receiving Eagle Scout awards since 1962. The Troop 1721 adult leaders have also been recognized for their service, with several receiving the District Award of Merit and Silver Beaver award. As the oldest troop operating in Downriver, Troop 1721 has played a key role in providing area youth with leadership opportunities while teaching them skills that will serve them throughout their lives. The troop has also maintained a partnership with the Exchange Club of Trenton, a service organization that helps with events like ChristNet and Veterans Matter. Through this collaborative effort, troop members have received mentoring opportuni-ties while providing community service to local organizations and nonprofits in need. It is my hope that Troop 4 continues to serve as a model for activism and helps inspire leader-ship and a spirit of service in the community in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Trenton’s Boy Scout Troop 1721 on the 90th anniversary of its founding. The troop has played an important role in the growth and development of the City of Trenton and inspired a new generation of young lead-ers. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE EX-CHANGE CLUB OF TRENTON ON THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS FOUNDING 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 24, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Exchange Club of Trenton on the 90th anniversary of its founding. The club has provided outstanding support to service projects and community initiatives since its es-tablishment. Founded in 1927, the Exchange Club of Trenton began as a professional gathering of prominent businessmen in the Trenton area and has since evolved into a community orga-nization that provides funding and support to a variety of different causes active in the city. The organization raises money through an an-nual spaghetti dinner, as well as other events like a 5K run and comedy night. Using these funds, the Exchange Club assists a multitude of initiatives to improve the Trenton area. These include supporting child abuse preven-tion services, as well as activities including an Adopt-a-Highway cleanup program on Fort Street and helping organize the Memorial Day and Christmas parades in the city. Addition-ally, the Exchange Club also works with Boy Scout Troop 1721 to provide community serv-ice and leadership opportunities for troop members. The Exchange Club of Trenton has been in-strumental in helping the Trenton community grow and develop over the past 90 years. By bringing together local leaders and concerned citizens, the Exchange Club has not only pro-vided an important forum to discuss solutions to issues facing the Trenton area, but also helped drive action to make the city a better place to live and work. The Exchange Club of Trenton’s longevity and record of success are testaments to the great work that it has done,

The Exchange Club has successfully supported important local initia-tives in Trenton since its founding.
