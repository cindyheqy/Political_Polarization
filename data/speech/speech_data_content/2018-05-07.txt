Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, as May marks Lyme Disease Awareness Month, I rise today to recognize the countless individuals currently living with Lyme and to honor the medical experts and advocates combating this epidemic throughout the Nation. 
In upstate New York, where I reside, we are aware of the real and continuing threat that Lyme and related tick borne diseases pose. With an estimated 300,000 new cases each year, the Lyme crisis is spreading. It is found in about half of all U.S. counties and in nearly 80 countries worldwide. Transmitted by tick bites, Lyme disease has no known cure, is difficult to diagnose, and can attack the nervous system, even sometimes leading to death if left untreated. There is no silver bullet to combat this devastating disease, but better public education and more Federal research can lead to significant advancements. The medical and public health communities urge you to check yourself and your loved ones, especially children, each day for ticks and to seek out the best information on best practices for preventing tick bites and Lyme disease. I look forward to continuing to work with members of the upstate New York community, Lyme disease advocates throughout America, and my colleagues here in Congress on both sides of the aisle to increase awareness and to find a cure, finally, for this devastating disease. 
CONGRATULATING THE CATHOLIC JROTC PROGRAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Marine Corps Junior ROTC program at Little Rock Catholic High School for raising $20,500 toward the construction of a Gold Star families monument on the State capital grounds in Little Rock. The Catholic High School Marine Corps Junior ROTC unit is celebrating its golden anniversary this year. The cadets were diligent in their fundraising: accepting donations at football games, selling food items, engaging the alumni association, and going door to door. I would also like to recognize Sergeant Major R.S. Jernigan and Colonel Charles Johnson, who have stewarded these young men in their dedication to service in their community, State, and country. As a proud alumnus of Catholic High School in Little Rock and a former company commander of this outstanding JROTC unit, I am proud of the hard work of these young men and how they have exhibited leadership in the pursuit of their goal. They exemplify what we mean when we say: Hard work pays off. Congratulations on this outstanding salute to our beloved Gold Star families and their future monument, and congratulations for 50 years of leadership and character development at Catholic High. Semper fi. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Children’s Advocacy Alliance in Conway, Arkansas, and the local first responders for their dedication to serving and protecting the children of central Arkansas. Children’s Advocacy Alliance was founded in 2000 as courtappointed special advocates for the 20th Judicial District of Arkansas. Currently it serves Faulkner, Conway, and Van Buren Counties in my district. Earlier this month, local law enforcement and other first responders came out to support the annual Heroes for Hope race held by Children’s Advocacy Alliance in Conway. In its seventh year, the race incorporates a central theme of being a superhero for each child in need. Every child needs a hero, but the abused child needs a superhero. This year, 160 participants ran in support of the race. Thank you to all the dedicated workers at the Children’s Advocacy Alliance and to the dedicated law enforcement people for being those superheroes for kids in need. WELCOMING HEAD COACH DARRELL WALKER TO  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University of Arkansas at Little Rock’s new men’s basketball coach, Darrell Walker. A former Razorback, Mr. Walker was drafted by the New York Knicks in 1983 and played professional basketball for 10 years before assuming an assistant coaching role for the Toronto Raptors. Over the past two decades, Mr. Walker has demonstrated a high level of competency and competitiveness at coaching, having been a part of four different NBA coaching staffs and serving as the head coach for the Toronto Raptors from 1996 to 1998. More recently, he was head coach for two seasons at Clark Atlanta University, amassing a 45–18 overall record. His passion for excellence, leadership, and hard work are evidenced by the accolades and career accomplishments. I look forward to following his success at home at UA Little Rock during his time as head coach of such a dynamic basketball community. This will be a great partnership. Welcome home, Coach Walker.

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
DIANN SHADDOX FOUNDATION FOR ESSENTIAL TREMORS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last month, I had the opportunity to meet with Diann Shaddox of North Augusta, South Carolina, founder of the Diann Shaddox Foundation for Essential Tremors. Essential tremor is a neurological condition that causes the trembling of the hands, head, voice, legs, or body and affects nearly 10 million people in the United States. Despite its prevalence, it wasn’t until 2013 that essential tremor was given its own specific diagnosis apart from other tremors. Diann Shaddox was diagnosed with essential tremors in her early twenties. Since then, Diann has acted as an advocate for awareness and, for over 35 years, has dedicated her life to finding a cure for essential tremors. The mission of the Diann Shaddox Foundation for Essential Tremors is to educate and increase awareness about people afflicted with essential tremor, which is the largest movement disorder in the world. The foundation also collects donations for medical research in the hope of discovering the cause and a cure, and I wish them continued success on their important mission. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
MOTHER’S DAY WISHES (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish my mom a happy 60th birthday. I couldn’t ask for a better mom. Most likely her favorite son, I have known each and every day of my life that my mom loves me and she is proud of me. My mom hasn’t always had it easy. She has worked hard all of her life, both as a cook in a nursing home for nearly 40 years and by holding it all together at home as she cared for my dad, my two brothers, and me. What we need now more than ever is more moms like my mom, and as we celebrate Mother’s Day this weekend, we honor our moms and say thank you for their tireless work and sacrifices. Motherhood is a fulltime job and a lifetime commitment, but the impact that mothers make in the lives of their children is profound. I am grateful for all of the moms in my life, including my extraordinary wife, Amanda, who is raising three extraordinary little girls. Mr. Speaker, I wish my mom a happy birthday and wish all the mothers in northeast Indiana and across our country a happy Mother’s Day on Sunday. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN GOOD COMPANY (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, here are some excerpts from the book, ‘‘Presidential Courage,’’ by Michael Beschloss that might sound familiar: ‘‘Andrew Jackson said, ‘I was born for the storm, and calm does not suit me.’’’ ‘‘Warned that some decision of his would risk a public clamor, Jackson once said, ‘I care nothing about clamors, sir. . . . I do precisely what I think just and right.’’’ ‘‘Theodore Roosevelt genuinely thought of himself as a gladiator against evil. . . . Like Andrew Jackson, he was taking a large risk by challenging the citadels of wealth and power.’’ ‘‘T.R. boasted that the ‘farmers, mechanics, small tradesmen, hardworking professional men’ all considered him ‘their President’. . . . ’’ ‘‘Roosevelt had always inveighed against the ‘lies’ in the press ‘as foul and dirty . . . as ever was made by any dog.’’’ To me, President Trump is carrying on the legacies of Presidents Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt. 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO SHERRY A. MITCHELL (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, today, May 7, is my wife’s birthday. It may seem like a small thing to many, but it is hard to describe the sacrifice and commitment that it takes to be the spouse of someone who serves in government—the additional things she takes on when Dad is not home, the fun and games when the school calls, or the text message you get: Where did you leave whatever? I need to find it. So, today, I want to briefly say to my spouse, to Sherry: Thank you very much for understanding my need to serve and joining me in that effort in serving in the House. Happy birthday, and I will see you at the end of the week. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BANKS of Indiana). Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 4:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 6 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1630 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. BOST) at 4 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT A message in writing from the President of the United States was communicated to the House by Ms. Muriel Ridgway, one of his secretaries. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4910, the Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act, as amended, requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide an outer burial receptacle for each new grave in an open cemetery under the control of the National Park Service. The National Park Service controls 14 national cemeteries, two that are still active. They are Andersonville National Cemetery in Georgia and Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, veterans who want to be buried at these two cemeteries currently must pay the cost of their own outer burial receptacle, yet veterans buried in national or State cemeteries controlled by the VA’s National Cemetery Administration are provided such at no cost. This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate rules and regulations establishing the cost that must be reimbursed to the Department of the Interior by survivors. The survivors will then be reimbursed for the cost through a VA voucher. It has already passed the Senate, and I urge its passage today by the House. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4910, the Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act. If enacted, H.R. 4910 would require the U.S. Department of the Interior to provide outer burial receptacles, also known as grave liners, for veterans buried in cemeteries under the control of the National Park Service. Current law requires that the United States Department of Veterans Affairs provide an outer burial receptacle to a veteran buried in a national cemetery under the control of the National Cemetery Administration, which is a branch of the Veterans Administration. Additionally, the VA can provide a reimbursement if the family chooses to purchase a liner in lieu of the governmentfurnished grave liner. However, cemeteries under the control of the National Park Service are not covered by this statute, and neither the VA nor the National Park Service currently are able to provide this benefit for veterans buried in those cemeteries. The Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act simply amends the law to require the Department of the Interior to provide an outer burial receptacle for each new veteran’s grave in a national cemetery under the control of the National Park Service, just as would be provided if they were buried under the Veterans Administration. This bill also provides for the reimbursement of a veteran’s survivors who provide a privately purchased outer burial receptacle for use in a National Park Service cemetery. Of the 14 national cemeteries controlled by the National Park Service, two are still active: Andersonville National Cemetery in Georgia, which my colleague Mr. BISHOP currently represents, and Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in Tennessee. I am pleased to have introduced this bipartisan, commonsense legislation alongside my friend, fellow Georgian, and chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Senator JOHNNY  ISAKSON , to ensure our veterans receive equal burial benefits, regardless of where they are laid to rest. It is now more important than ever to close the gap in benefits for veterans who are buried in cemeteries managed by the National Park Service. In doing so, we will ensure that all veterans and their families are receiving the benefits and respect they have rightly earned. I urge support from my colleagues on this bipartisan measure and commonsense piece of legislation. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ), my good friend. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4910, the Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act. I joined my fellow Georgia Congressman AUSTIN SCOTT to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure that all of our veteran families receive the benefits that they have earned. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor, and I thank all of my colleagues for their help in moving it forward. Mr. Speaker, Andersonville, which is one of the two remaining National Park Service cemeteries, has a very, very interesting and unique history. Andersonville was the site of a Civil War prisoner of war camp, and, interestingly enough, it held prisoners of war for both the Union and the Confederates. Unfortunately, because of the 
unsanitary conditions, thousands of veterans, both Union and Confederate, died at Andersonville. Of course, in more recent years, Andersonville has been designated as the National Prisoner of War Memorial for our country, and, in that stead, we erected and funded the National Prisoner of War Museum, which is located on the grounds of Andersonville. The facilities there are controlled totally by the National Park Service. Currently, when veterans are buried in some of the Federal cemeteries, as you have heard, a number of the families are left to pay the burial costs that typically would be afforded them under other circumstances. Current law requires that when a veteran is buried in a national cemetery under the control of the National Cemetery Administration, that the VA will provide an outer burial receptacle, known in other terms as a grave liner, or it will provide reimbursement to the family for purchase. However, the current law inexplicably excludes national cemeteries that are under the control of the National Park Service. The Andersonville National Cemetery, located in my district, is one of the two remaining national cemeteries controlled by the National Park Service. Today, we are taking steps for Congress to correct this oversight and to ensure that veterans buried in cemeteries controlled by the National Park Service, and their families, are provided all of the benefits to which they are entitled, not only for my district but for all of our veterans and their families who have selflessly served our country. I applaud Senator ISAKSON ’s successful effort to push this legislation through the Senate under unanimous consent. It is now time for the House to take action, and by voting for this legislation, we can fix this oversight and ensure that all of our veterans and their families are provided appropriate benefits in all of our Federal cemeteries. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 4910, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation of Mr. SCOTT and Mr. B ISHOP , and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4910, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
SERVICEMEMBER FAMILY BURIAL ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4335) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for headstones and markers for, and interment in national cemeteries of, deceased spouses and dependent children of members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4335 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Servicemember Family Burial Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PROVISION OF HEADSTONES AND MARKERS FOR, AND INTERMENT IN NATIONAL CEMETERIES OF, SPOUSES AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES SERVING ON ACTIVE DUTY. 
(a) H EADSTONES AND MARKERS .—Section 2306(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is amended— (1) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ‘‘, or the spouse of a member of the Armed Forces serving on active duty under conditions other than dishonorable, as shown by a statement from a general courtmartial convening authority, at the time of the spouse’s death if such death occurs before October 1, 2024’’ after ‘‘veteran’’; and (2) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ‘‘, or the eligible dependent child of a member of the Armed Forces serving on active duty under conditions other than dishonorable, as shown by a statement from a general court martial convening authority, at the time of the child’s death if such death occurs before October 1, 2024’’ after ‘‘veteran’’. (b) INTERMENT IN NATIONAL CEMETERIES .— Section 2402(a)(5) of such title is amended by inserting ‘‘, and the spouse, minor child, and, in the discretion of the Secretary, unmarried adult child of a member of the Armed Forces serving on active duty under conditions other than dishonorable, as shown by a statement from a general courtmartial convening authority, at the time of the spouse’s or child’s death if such death occurs before October 1, 2024’’ after ‘‘paragraph (7)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4335, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4335, the Servicemember Family Burial Act, which was introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ), a member of our committee. Mr. Speaker, our Nation allows for a veteran’s spouse, minor children, and certain other dependents to be interred in a VA national cemetery, even while the veteran is still alive. This ensures that a family may be laid to rest together if the veteran chooses to use a national cemetery. But there is an unfortunate gap in the law that prevents ActiveDuty servicemembers from burying their loved ones in a VA national cemetery. Mr. CORREA ’s bill would extend VA burial benefits to ActiveDuty servicemembers who lose their family members before they leave the military. To comply with budgeting rules, the manager’s amendment would sunset this bill on September 30, 2024. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1645 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, when the VA provides burial and headstones or markers for eligible family members who predecease ActiveDuty servicemembers, it is always under tragic and difficult circumstances. Of course we want to provide these benefits as seamlessly as possible so our servicemembers can move on with their lives. This bill codifies current practice to ensure VA’s process of handling these issues with dignity, sensitivity, and compassion. I want to thank the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee Chairman MIKEBOST and Ranking Member ELIZABETH ESTY for their part in supporting and helping to bring this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 4335, the Servicemember Family Burial Act, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this commonsense bill, H.R. 4335, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The yeas and nays were ordered.

The bill names the United States Post Office at 3585 South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, California, after Marvin Gaye. Marvin Gaye was born in Washington, D.C., in 1939. After serving in the United States Air Force, he joined Motown Records and went on to compose and record some of the most memorable music in American history.

He is just one of three sailors of Native American heritage to receive the Medal of Honor in the 20th century. Chief Petty Officer Williams is an American hero, and we thank him and owe a great debt of gratitude for his service. I look forward to hearing more about Chief Petty Officer Williams from the sponsor of the bill, Congressman NORMAN , in a few minutes, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI.

One example of his heroic actions occurred during the Vietnam War, when he and his men fought off enemy combatants behind enemy lines for three hours in South Vietnam. Under James’ leadership, the American Naval force, killed roughly one thousand Viet Cong guerrillas, destroyed over 60 vessels, and disrupted a major enemy logistic operation. James retired on April 26, 1967 as the most highly decorated enlisted sailor in the history of the United States Navy. He was the recipient of multiple awards during his service in the Navy, including the Navy Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Korean Service Modal and the United Nations Service Medal and during his last seven months in the Navy, James received every seaservice award for heroism. On May 14, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson, in the name of Congress, presented James Elliot Williams the Medal of Honor.

We thank the veterans of Bloomingdale and all veterans for their service, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my legislation would designate the U.S. Postal Service facility at 108 West Schick Road in Bloomingdale, Illinois, as the Bloomingdale Veterans Memorial Post Office Building in recognition of all the men and women who have served our Nation with distinction and honor. I would like to thank Chairman GOWDY and Ranking Member C UMMINGS  for their help in moving this bill through the committee, as well as Majority Leader MCCARTHY for helping to secure floor time for consideration. This is merely a step, one step, to help citizens in Bloomingdale and every part of my district recognize the sacrifices and celebrate the contributions of our friends, families, and neighbors who chose a life of service to the people of the United States. Veterans in every community deserve our thanks and gratitude. The Bloomingdale Veterans Memorial Post Office will serve as a living reminder of the service of every soldier, sailor, coastguardsman, airman, and marine, whose sacrifices helped keep Americans safe. It is my hope that this small daily reminder will help us all to remember that we can and must do more to support our veterans, from those just returning home to those who fought long ago and still bear the scars of their service. Mr. Speaker, we all agree that our Nation’s veterans continue to face serious challenges. Today, an estimated 39,471 veterans are homeless, and the number of young veterans struggling with homelessness is increasing. In my home State of Illinois alone, 193 veterans took their own life in 1 year, a rate more than twice as high as the nonveteran population of Illinois. Veterans are more likely to struggle with PTSD as well as substance abuse disorders than nonveterans. It is clear that we are failing those who never failed us. We have a solemn obligation to eliminate veteran homelessness, to improve access to essential health services, and ensure veterans are able to transition to the civilian workforce and secure familysustaining jobs. We need to prioritize mental health support and substance use prevention, and we need to exercise strong oversight over the VA to ensure that no veteran is ever denied medical care or support services. For the men and women who have protected my own American Dream, I hope to make theirs easier to achieve. We must all do more to recognize those willing to give what Lincoln called ‘‘the last full measure of devotion’’ to their country. It is my hope that the new Bloomingdale Veterans Memorial Post Office Building will foster both gratitude and understanding in our community, and I urge every Member to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to echo the comments of my colleague from Illinois and also hope that the name of this post office will recognize the millions of veterans throughout our history that have returned home, led productive lives, have entered further public service, and have done so with gratitude, without issues, and have rendered great service to the Nation. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from Illinois also aware that I have no further speakers and am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman RUSSELL for those eloquent words and thank him for his service to our country as a veteran, as well, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge the passage of H.R. 4574, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4574. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

(H.R. 4722) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 111 Market Street in Saugerties, New York, as the ‘‘Maurice D. Hinchey Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4722 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 111 Market Street in Saugerties, New York, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Maurice D. Hinchey Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Maurice D. Hinchey Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to support H.R. 4722, introduced by my friend and colleague Mr. FASO. The bill names the United States Post Office at 111 Market Street in Saugerties, New York, after Maurice D. Hinchey. Maurice Hinchey served in the United States Navy and subsequently entered a life of public service. He started his political career in 1975 as a State assemblyman and served for nine terms until he was elected to the United States Congress. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 10 terms. I thank my colleagues for supporting the effort to name a post office after Maurice Hinchey, who spent his life serving his country and community. I look forward to hearing more about Maurice Hinchey from the sponsor of the bill, Congressman FASO, in a few minutes, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4722, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 111 Market Street as Maurice D. Hinchey Post Office Building. For two decades, Maurice Hinchey served in this Chamber representing New York’s 22nd Congressional District after beginning his political career 4 years earlier as a State assemblyman. Representative Hinchey was a strong advocate for the environment, conducting an investigation into the Love Canal toxic waste site in New York and leading the charge that passed the Nation’s first regulations related to acid rain. Throughout his career, he fought for the preservation of the Hudson River, and worked to better the lives of his constituents through his focus on agriculture, economic development, and veterans’ issues. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize the contributions Maurice Hinchey made to this House and to the lives of those he represented here. I urge the passage of H.R. 4722, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO), my friend and colleague and the sponsor of this bill. Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma, and my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois, as well, for their fine comments in relation to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer support for H.R. 4722, a bill to designate the postal facility at 111 Market Street in Saugerties, New York, as the Maurice D. Hinchey Post Office Building. Congressman Hinchey was a lifelong New Yorker and a true public servant. He passed away in his home in Saugerties, New York, on November 22, 2017. He is survived by his wife, Ilene Marder, and his three adult children. He is fondly remembered as a staunch advocate for what he believed, including care for our military veterans and the environment through his support of the Clean Air Act and the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, among many other accomplishments. The week of his passing, I took to the House floor with the entire New York delegation to mourn the death of our colleague. Today, I stand here with this legislation as a token of remembrance for a father, a husband, a veteran, and a distinguished Member of this House who was dedicated to his constituents and all the people of our Nation. Mr. Hinchey served 3 years in the U.S. Navy, 18 years in the New York State Assembly, and 20 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, during which time he represented a broad swath of New York State from the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains over to the southern tier of our State as well. Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to have served 6 years in the New York State Assembly with Mr. Hinchey, and I am also honored to represent many of the same areas of upstate New York here in Congress as Maurice Hinchey did. I am joined by 27 bipartisan cosponsors, including the entire New York congressional delegation, to offer this bill. Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank Liam Fitzsimmons, who served on the staff of Congressman Hinchey as well as on the staff of the late Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. Congresswoman Slaughter assisted and was a colead on this legislation, and I know she would be pleased by the House passage today of this bill. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge the passage of H.R. 4722, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4722. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 3671 AND H.R. 1742 Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be removed as a cosponsor from H.R. 3671 and H.R. 1742. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. 
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS ALWYN CRENDALL CASHE POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4840) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 567 East Franklin Street in Oviedo, Florida, as the ‘‘Sergeant First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4840 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SERGEANT FIRST CLASS ALWYN CRENDALL CASHE POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 567 East Franklin Street in Oviedo, Florida, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Sergeant First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Sergeant First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. R USSELL ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to support H.R. 4840, introduced by Congresswoman STEPHANIE MURPHY . The bill names the United States Post Office at 567 East Franklin Street, Oviedo, Florida, after Sergeant First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe. Sergeant First Class Cashe served in the United States Army and was stationed in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was killed on November 8, 2005, as a result of injuries sustained while rescuing his fellow soldiers from an improvised explosive device explosion. With severe burns, Sergeant First Class Cashe returned repeatedly to the vehicle, determined to save his fellow soldiers. For his heroic actions, he was awarded the Silver Star. Sergeant First Class Cashe exemplified bravery and sacrifice, and he died putting his comrades before himself. I had the privilege to know and serve with his commander, thenLieutenant Colonel Gary Brito, who is now a serving general officer. I should also point out, Mr. Speaker, that Sergeant First Class Cashe has been considered and recommended for the Medal of Honor, but to date, no actions have been taken. It is my hope that his case will be reviewed and come under further scrutiny. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to name a post office in honor of Sergeant First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1715 Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4840, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 567 East Franklin Street in Oviedo, Florida, as the ‘‘Sergeant First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe Post Office Building’’. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ) so that she may tell us more about Sergeant First Class Alwyn Crendall Cashe. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, President Kennedy once said that a nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers. Consistent with that principle, my bill would designate a U.S. Post Office building in Oviedo, Florida, after Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe. Sergeant First Class Cashe died in 2005 as a result of wounds suffered while serving in Iraq. When I recount the actions this American soldier and son of Oviedo performed and what he endured in the process, it will take your breath away. The word ‘‘hero’’ is ascribed to many people in our society, perhaps a bit too casually, but this was heroism in its purest and most profound sense. Let me start the story at the beginning: Alwyn was born in 1970 in Sanford, Florida, and was raised in Oviedo, attending Oviedo High School. He was the youngest of nine children: five girls and four boys. The family didn’t have much money, but they had plenty of pride. When Alwyn was 6, his father passed away. Alwyn’s mother, Ruby Mae, worked long hours at demanding jobs: working on an assembly line and later as a custodian at Florida Tech, since renamed the University of Central Florida. One of Alwyn’s sisters, Kasinal, described her brother as the baby of the family: rambunctious; a little spoiled by his siblings; and, of course, deeply loved. Alwyn enlisted in the military after high school. Kasinal said it had a transformational effect, turning this somewhat aimless boy into a resolute man, the civilian into a soldier. And not just any soldier but a soldier’s soldier, a toughasnails infantryman, and an oldschool leader in the best sense of the term. As Kasinal put it, Alwyn ‘‘bled Army green’’ right from the start. The Army gave him a second family with even more brothers and sisters, bound together by the American flag on their uniform and the events they experienced and endured together from boot camp to combat. On October 17, 2005, Alwyn, now Sergeant First Class Cashe, was on his second deployment to Iraq. That fateful day, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle carrying him, six other American soldiers, and the squad’s Iraqi interpreter struck an IED. The blast instantly killed the interpreter and ruptured the vehicle’s fuel cell. Flames engulfed the vehicle. Initially only lightly injured but covered in fuel, Sergeant First Class Cashe descended into the hull, extracted the driver, who was on fire, and extinguished the flames. At this point, multiple soldiers remained in the vehicle, one of whom managed to open the rear hatch. With no regard for his own safety, Sergeant First Class Cashe rushed to the back of the vehicle, reached into the hot flames, and started pulling out soldiers. His fuelsoaked uniform caught fire, and the flames spread quickly over his body. Despite what must have been terrible pain, he returned to the vehicle twice more to extract his soldiers, all while he was still on fire and exposed to enemy gunfire. By the time he had extracted all of his soldiers from the vehicle, Sergeant First Class Cashe had the most severe injuries. Second and thirddegree burns covered 72 percent of his body. Nevertheless, he refused to be evacuated until all of his soldiers were medevacked out before him. When he arrived at the U.S. military hospital at Balad Air Base in Iraq, he was still fully conscious. What remained of his uniform had melted to his skin, yet he tried to fight off the nurses, insisting that they treat everyone else first. Despite determined efforts to save his life at various hospitals abroad and in the United States, he eventually succumbed to his wounds on November 8, 2005, surrounded by members of both his biological family and his Army family. Scripture teaches us that there is no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends, and Sergeant First Class Cashe made the ultimate expression of love. After his passing, he received the Silver Star, the third highest combat award that the Army confers. Over the past years, there has been a painstaking effort to have Sergeant First Class Cashe’s Silver Star upgraded to the Medal of Honor, an award no African American has received since 1969. Notably, this effort has been led by the battalion commander who nominated Sergeant First Class Cashe for the Silver Star. This individual, now a 2star general, came to believe that Sergeant First Class Cashe deserves the highest award for valor that our Nation bestows. I strongly agree with this conclusion and have written to the Secretary of the Army to express my view. We cannot bring Sergeant First Class Cashe back or erase the pain felt by his sister Kasinal, his other family members, and the men and women in uniform who served beside him; but we can pay tribute to his life and legacy. We can engrave his name on a plaque and designate a Federal building in his honor so the American public never forgets this remarkable man who laid down his life for his friends in service of our country. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from Illinois aware that I have no further speakers and am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I strongly urge the passage of H.R. 4840, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND FOR COOPERATION IN PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY— MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–115) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to subsections 123b. and 123d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b), (d)) (the ‘‘Act’’), the text of an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (the ‘‘Agreement’’). I am also pleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and determination concerning the Agreement and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the Agreement. In accordance with section 123 of the Act, a classified annex to the NPAS, prepared by the Acting Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, will be submitted to the Congress separately. A joint memorandum submitted to me by the Acting Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy and a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission stating the views of the Commission are also enclosed. An addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis of the export control system of the United Kingdom with respect to nuclearrelated matters, including interactions with other countries of proliferation concern and the actual or suspected nuclear, dualuse, or missile related transfers to such countries, pursuant to section 102A(w) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3024(w)), is being submitted separately by the Director of National Intelligence. Although not required by the Act, I am also transmitting an analysis and a determination and judgment from the Secretary of Energy concerning the advance, longterm approvals contained in the proposed Agreement. The Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act and other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable statutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States. The Agreement contains all of the provisions required by subsection 123a. of the Act. It provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation with the United Kingdom based on a mutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. It would permit the transfer of material, equipment (including reactors), components, sensitive nuclear facilities, major critical components, and information for nuclear research and nuclear power production. It also would allow for the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology if the parties later agree on conditions in writing. The Agreement has a term of 30 years, although it can be terminated by either party on one year’s advance written notice. In the event of termination or expiration of the Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions and controls will continue in effect as long as any material, equipment, component, sensitive nuclear facility, or major critical component subject to the Agreement remains in the territory or under the jurisdiction or control of either party, or until such time as the parties agree in writing that such nuclear material or nonnuclear material is no longer usable for any nuclear activity relevant from the point of view of international safeguards or have been practically irrecoverable, or that such equipment, components, sensitive nuclear facilities, or major critical components is no longer usable for nuclear purposes. As one of the five nuclear weapon states under the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, including one of the Treaty’s three Depositary States, and one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the United Kingdom holds an important leadership role in the global nonproliferation regime and the larger international security architecture. The United Kingdom is a member of the four major multilateral export control regimes: the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Wassenaar Arrangement. In addition, the United Kingdom has provided financial, technical, and leadership support to key nonproliferation mechanisms such as the Global Threat Reduction Program, the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, the Elimination of WeaponsGrade Plutonium Production Program, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Technical Cooperation Program, the IAEA Department of Safeguards, the G7 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons of Mass Destruction, and the Proliferation Security Initiative. A more detailed discussion of the United Kingdom’s civil nuclear activities and its nonproliferation policies and practices is in the NPAS and its classified annex. I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested departments and agencies in reviewing the Agreement and have determined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved the Agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress give it favorable consideration. This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both subsections 123b. and 123d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to begin immediately consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as provided in subsection 123b.

WELCOMING THE HONORABLE DEBBIE LESKO TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, Debbie Lesko has dedicated years of her life to public service, starting back in 2009, when she took the oath as a State legislator from Arizona, and then serving as a member of the Arizona Senate from 2015 to earlier this year. Her commitment and dedication to the people of Arizona will continue as she joins the House of Representatives and upholds her constitutional oath. The oath is a reminder to all of us standing here today that our duty is to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I look forward to working together with our newest colleague to find commonsense solutions to the problems our Nation faces. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO ). Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I have lost my voice from the allergies here in Washington, D.C., but I am truly honored to be here. Before I comment, I just wanted to introduce my family that is up in the gallery: my husband, Joe Lesko—thank you, Joe—my son, Jared Lesko; my daughter, Samantha Lesko; her fiance, Brandon Stealth; and my brother, Roger Lorenz. I am truly honored to be here to join you, and I look forward to working with you. I want to say to my constituents at home: Thank you so much for the privilege of your vote and for sending me here to Congress. I am thankful, and God bless you. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 3395, a bill originally introduced by Representative Meehan of Pennsylvania, for the purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained in a discussion on prison reform, and I missed rollcall vote No. 167, H.R. 4910, the Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act, as amended. If I had been present, I would have voted ‘‘aye.’’ 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, as May is National Foster Care Month, we need to remember that foster care families provide a vital service for the young people whom they take in. And the need is great. In Minnesota alone, more than 7,500 kids entered outofhome placement, usually because of parental drug abuse and neglect. Foster parents are absolutely unsung heroes. They go to tremendous lengths in navigating a very arduous process so that they can provide a nurturing and a caring environment for a young person. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank foster families for their dedication, as well as the professionals and the workers who do go through the work of placing young people in loving families’ homes so that they can make a meaningful difference in their lives. f 
b1915 HONORING THE SALVATION ARMY OF NEWARK (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor The Salvation Army for helping the residents of Newark, New Jersey, get through hard times for the last 138 years. Today, The Salvation Army operates five locations throughout Newark, serving each of the city’s five wards. The organization serves more than 5,000 people in the city of Newark, helping them with their education, food, housing, and life skills. The Salvation Army’s important work is boosted by the Federal Government’s AmeriCorps program. AmeriCorps members, with The Salvation Army in Newark, provide after school programs for young people as well. They work to develop the social and emotional health of Newark’s young people, and they help strengthen children’s education. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the Salvation Army and AmeriCorps for their work and service to the city of Newark and the State of New Jersey and the United States of America. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CYRUS M. JOLLIVETTE (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I was saddened to hear of the passing of Russ Jollivette, an important and revered leader in education, health, and philanthropy, and someone who Dexter and I proudly called our friend. Cyrus, or Russ to those who knew him, sadly passed away on April 30, leaving behind an incredible legacy of good works and major achievements. Russ dedicated 24 years of his life to my alma mater, the University of Miami, including raising significant funds for the UM Sylvester Cancer Center and Hospital for diabetes research and for environmental health sciences. But Russ’ impact went far beyond the University of Miami. He went on to serve as senior vice president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida and served as the director of The Blue Foundation for a Healthy Florida. Truth be told, Mr. Speaker, the list goes on and on, but the role for which Russ will always be known for far and wide is friend. Russ Jollivette cared so selflessly for so many in our south Florida community and our State, and so many cared for him, including his daughter, Lynn Jollivette Johns; his two sisters, Regina Jollivette Frazier and Cleo Jollivette; as well as two grandchildren. Farewell, my friend, Russ Jollivette. f 
RECOGNIZING DOMINICAN WEEK (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Semana Dominicana, Dominican Week, to recognize the American Chamber of Commerce of the Dominican Republic. Since this organization was founded in 1923, its members and partners in the Dominican Republic and the United States have grown in scale, and the diversity of its commerce has led to the economic development and the empowerment of small businesses. During this week, Semana Dominicana, it is my pleasure to welcome and recognize David Fernandez, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce of the Dominican Republic, and Nelson Toca, the Dominican Republic Minister of Industry and Commerce. As the first Dominican elected to U.S. Congress, I am proud to support DominicanU.S. relations and hope we will continue to strengthen the ties between the Dominican Republic and members of the Dominican diaspora here in the United States. 
RECOGNIZING TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize all the teachers around the country who work so tirelessly to educate our children. This is Teacher Appreciation Week, and Tuesday, May 8, is National Teacher Appreciation Day, but we should show them our appreciation each day. 
We trust them with our most prized assets for many hours a day: our children. Most of us who go to work Monday through Friday entrust the teachers with the daily caretaking, development, and, of course, the education of our kids, and sometimes that task can take on a lot more, even parenting, when kids come from broken homes. A teacher’s job is indeed difficult. As parents, it can be easy to lose sight of the significance and influence teachers have on our kids’ lives on a daily basis. I know this firsthand. My wife is a teacher; my sister is as well. I know firsthand, my wife, the many hours spent after school, using her own dollars to help make her classroom a better learning environment for those kids, because it comes from the heart. I want to thank her, my sister, and all those teachers all around the country for giving that extra that it takes when sometimes society falls short in its own ways. Congratulations on Teacher Appreciation Week. 
CELEBRATING 35TH ANNUAL NATIONAL TRAVEL AND TOURISM WEEK (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, as the Democratic chair of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, I rise to celebrate the 35th annual National Travel and Tourism Week, which provides us an opportunity to showcase the importance of travel and tourism in creating economic growth and opportunity and enhancing the quality of life in every district throughout the United States. Our second largest industry export and our seventh largest employer, travel generates $2.4 trillion for the U.S. economy and supports some 15.6 million jobs. In southern Nevada alone, tourism generates nearly $60 billion annually. Last year, 42 million visitors came to Las Vegas, and we hosted almost 20,000 conventions, which brought in 6 million people from around the world. So, as we honor the valuable contributions of the hardworking people in this vital industry, I want to remind my colleagues that we need to support its growth and development by making real investments in the country’s infrastructure so we can increase the efficiency and reliability of travel and encourage greater tourism to Las Vegas and all the United States. It is about putting out a welcome mat and setting a bigger table. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG TAKE BACK DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, National Prescription Drug Take Back Day was last Saturday, the last Saturday in April. Today, President Trump announced that nearly 1 million pounds of prescription drugs were disposed of at sites across the country. The Drug Enforcement Administration, in partnership with Federal, State, local, and Tribal law enforcement, businesses, medical offices, Federal agencies, and first responders hosted events to collect and safely dispose of unneeded medication. National Take Back Day happens twice a year, and each time, thousands of pounds of prescription drugs are returned, helping to prevent incidents of drug abuse and misuse across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, unneeded or expired prescription medications are a public safety issue. Results from the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicate that nearly 19 million Americans 12 years of age or older abused or misused prescription drugs in the past year. According to the CDC, most people who abuse prescription opioids get them for free from a friend or relative. We must continue our fight against the opioid epidemic, and the biannual Take Back Days are an important one step in doing so. f 
URGING THE PRESIDENT NOT TO RENOUNCE THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, having been briefed at every stage of the negotiation of the Iran nuclear deal, I was able to come to this floor just 2 hours after it was published and be the first to speak in opposition to the Iran nuclear deal. Today, I rise to urge the President not to renounce that deal. The question is this: Do we want to liberate the Iranian Government or sanction the Iranian Government? If we renounce the deal, then the Iranian Government is free to remove the inspectors, to begin a program of building an unlimited number of centrifuges, and can request the return of the fissile material, several bombs’ worth of fissile material which, under the deal, they had transferred to Russia and which Putin might choose to return. If we renounce the deal, we do nothing to give ourselves additional rights because, under the deal, we are free to sanction Iran in full proportion to its nonnuclear evil. The Iranian Government is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths in Syria and tens of thousands of deaths in Yemen. That alone justifies every sanction every Member of this body can come up with. We can stay in the deal and sanction Iran. JESSIE PATRICK CELEBRATES 100TH BIRTHDAY (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jessie Patrick, who currently resides in South Carolina but spent most of her very long life in Oneida County, New York, in the 22nd District. On May 12, Jessie will turn 100 years old. Jessie grew up in nearby Yorkville with her sister, Bertha, and her two brothers, Matthew and Edward, both of whom served in World War II. She then moved to Whitesboro, New York, where she worked for General Electric, which was once located in Utica, New York, for nearly 30 years. Jessie became an active leader in the Whitesboro community, joining the Whitesboro Fire Department’s Women Auxiliary, St. Paul’s Church, and even owned a restaurant in nearby Marcy, New York, with her husband. Jessie has one daughter, Judy; two granddaughters; three greatgrandchildren, with whom she loves to spend time. Her family loves to travel and used to spend many weekends traveling to Boston to go deepsea fishing. When Jessie isn’t deepsea fishing, she enjoys cooking, crossstitching, and gardening. Mr. Speaker, please join me in wishing Jessie a wonderful, happy, and healthy 100 years, and many, many more years to come. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JENNIFER PARKS (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Jennifer ‘‘Jenny’’ Parks. Jenny attended the Route 51 festival in Las Vegas on October 1. Jenny was a remarkable kindergarten teacher at Anaverde Hills Elementary School in Lancaster, California. Jenny loved all of her students and their families but ensured to leave a big place in her heart for her husband, Bobby, and their two kids, Bryce and Lea. Jenny was a loving person who always went out of her way to help people. She is remembered by her family and friends as being a beautiful and intelligent woman who had a wonderful sense of humor. I would like to extend my condolences to Jenny Park’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. 
HONORING VIRGINIA TECH PRESIDENT EMERITUS CHARLES WILLIAM STEGER, JR. (Mr. GRIFFITH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Charles William Steger, Jr., along with ROBWITTMAN , who is an alumnus of Virginia Tech. Unfortunately, Virginia Tech President Emeritus Charles William Steger, Jr., passed away last night at the age of 70. He was a Hokie through and through, and he guided the university to great achievements. He earned three degrees himself from Virginia Tech, and before becoming president, he taught and held numerous posts. As president of Virginia Tech from 2000 to 2014, Dr. Steger led the university to new heights. He presided over growth and enrollment. Forty major new buildings were constructed. Research expenditures grew from $192 million to $450 million. He established the school of biomedical engineering and helped bring together the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute. He also had the burden of leading Virginia Tech through the shooting on that horrific April day in 2007. In the aftermath, he led with remarkable dignity. He received many honors during his lifetime, and I, along with many in Virginia and across this Nation, held Dr. Charles William Steger, Jr., in the highest esteem. He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Janet; his son, Christopher Steger, and wife, Elizabeth Schumann; and his son, David Steger, and fiance, Alison Nemeth. Mr. Speaker, if we could all pray a prayer tonight for the family of Charles Steger. 
PROTECTING SOCIAL SAFETY NET The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MAST). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for holding this Special Order hour, the CBC Special Order hour this evening, as we discuss SNAP and other efforts by the President and the GOP to shed the social safety net. b1930 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Chairman RICHMOND , for allowing me to have this opportunity to lead what we call the ‘‘Conscience of the Congress’’ of the Congressional Black Caucus, who is the one who has led this and come up with this idea for us. As we paint a picture of the Black community in 2018, it is clear that we have a lot to lose. Too many of our neighborhoods are, unfortunately, still plagued by rampant poverty, dysfunction, and crime. These are very serious issues that our community has to deal with. But instead of the GOP Congress working with us side by side in a bipartisan manner, we have a group, Mr. Speaker, hellbent on enacting jaded, outdated, economic backwards legislation in the form of SNAP that would throw thousands of recipients off the roles. According to the nonpartisan Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, SNAP is the country’s most effective antihunger program helping one in five Americans afford a basic diet. For over 15 years, State and Federal policymakers have worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen SNAP. The GOP would take a large step backwards, reducing or eliminating benefits for more than 1 million households with more than 2 million people. And let me be clear, it is not just about programs, policies, and laws being enacted by the GOP and President Trump, it is about the overall tone that has been set by this President, who regularly raises insults, instead of engaging in meaningful policy discussions. The President’s review of welfare programs is an immoral attempt to get the programs that provide a basic standard of living for Americans struggling to make ends meet, all to pay for the massive tax cuts for himself and the richest 1 percent. Instead of taking food out of the mouths of poor children or kicking the elderly off of Medicare, President Trump and congressional Republicans should work with Democrats to put more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans. Let me be clear: this executive order is a thinly veiled attempt to restrict access to healthcare, housing, food, and many other basic living programs by adding onerous socalled work requirements. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ), a person who I admire and had the chance of visiting with her in the great State of Alabama. She has a lot of experience firsthand and knows and understands what it means to be close to the people. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ) for leading this Special Order hour. Mr. Speaker, I especially want to acknowledge the Congressional Black Caucus for always being the ‘‘Conscience of the Congress’’ and for taking on the topic of tonight, which is the social safety net and how important it is as a lifeline for so many Americans. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the efforts to dismantle our social safety net and the programs that help working Americans make ends meet. Our Federal health, antihunger, and poverty programs are the lifeline for millions of Americans and their families. Every year, our Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, feeds 9.5 million families. Social Security keeps over 22 million Americans from falling into poverty. And Medicare ensures that 44 million men, women, and children have access to the care they need to stay healthy. These families are hanging by a thread, and with every cut to our health and antihunger programs, that thread becomes thinner and thinner. In Alabama, I have seen the difference that these programs can make firsthand. I have met working parents who rely on SNAP to put food on the table for their children. I have met seniors who, after a lifetime of work, are able to get by only because of their Social Security check. I have met mothers who could not feed their children if it weren’t for the maternity care that they get through Federal health programs. For these working parents, seniors, and children, our social safety net means the difference between a warm home and homelessness. It means a difference between a hot meal and going to bed hungry. Last year in Alabama, I met a farmer named Hank, who was able to afford healthcare for the first time in his life because of the Affordable Care Act. And after Hank signed up for ObamaCare, tragedy struck. His hand was caught in a hay baler, requiring immediate emergency care. But because of the healthcare he received through the Affordable Care Act, Hank was able to pay for his trip to the emergency room and, most importantly, his family did not lose that farm. That is what our social safety net does. It helps people when their time of need is most. It is a promise that no matter the hardship you face, we will never let you fall between the cracks. We, America, the land of plenty. We, Americans, don’t let other Americans fall through the cracks. Whether your family faces a health crisis or layoffs; or you are caring for a new child, we are not going to let you fall into poverty. Giving up on this promise is what I believe the Republican agenda has done. Giving up on this promise is what makes the Republican attacks on our social safety net so disturbing. It is a promise that we, as Americans, make to other Americans, that we will have a social safety net that will capture people in their most vulnerable time of need. The tax bill that Congress and the Trump administration passed in December repealed the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. That move drove healthcare costs for families and will result in 13 million more uninsured Americans. It was unnecessary, but it was a step that this administration took. It was a step that ripped from 13 million Americans their health insurance. 
Just 2 months after the passage of the tax bill, President Trump proposed a budget, the President’s budget, that would cut $500 billion from Medicare, $1.4 trillion from Medicaid, and $72 billion from Social Security disability. If these proposals were signed into law, more children would have gone hungry, more seniors would have fallen into poverty, and more Americans would be unable to afford to get sick. In the Ways and Means Committee this week, Republicans are holding a hearing to discuss limiting access to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF. At the same time, the House is debating reauthorizing a farm bill that would eliminate food assistance for 400,000 families and cut school lunches for 265,000 students. This Congress is not just cutting a hole in our social safety net. Republicans are selling the net in its entirety in order to pay for the tax scam bill that they passed in December. When President Trump and this Congress passed the GOP tax scam bill, they mortgaged the future of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to give massive tax breaks to Wall Street and the richest Americans. They put our health and antihunger programs into jeopardy and on a chopping block in exchange for more trickledown economics. Mr. Speaker, after decades of stagnant wages, my constituents are no longer willing to wait for trickledown economics to trickle down to them, especially when it means massive cuts to the Federal programs working families rely on. Lives are at stake, Mr. Speaker. That is why the Congressional Black Caucus, led ably tonight by my colleague from Pennsylvania, is discussing the social safety net and why we will continue to discuss those programs that are the lifeline of so many Americans. Why am I here? I am here because I represent Alabama’s Seventh Congressional District, a district which is my home district. I proudly hail from the Seventh Congressional District. The Seventh Congressional District is the poorest district in the State of Alabama. The median income for a family of four is $32,000. But, Mr. Speaker, we are not asking for a handout, we are asking for a hand up. We need Federal assistance to make sure that our children don’t go hungry, to make sure that those who work a lifetime have Social Security to live on when they are old. It is important that we remember that these social safety net programs keep Americans afloat and keep working Americans still working, being able to provide food and nutrition to their children, being able to buy drugs that are lifesaving for them to continue to live. It is critically important that we remember that the social safety net is not just for minorities, it is for all Americans when they need it—when they need it. It is a promise that America has made and a promise that the GOP and this administration continues to break. Lives are on the line. That is why I am calling on this Congress and this administration to abandon its attacks on the social safety net. Instead, we should be passing legislation that puts working people first. I am calling on this Congress to help keep our promise to the American people that no one will be left behind. As the richest Nation in the world, keeping that promise is not only within our power, it is our obligation. Mr. Speaker, I again thank my colleague, Congressman EVANS from Pennsylvania, and the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order hour and for continuing to remind people that we are Americans and we, as Americans, don’t break our promise. Let’s not break our promise when it comes to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security; let’s not break our promise when it comes to the nutrition of our students; and let’s not break our promise when it comes to working people who have worked all their lives for Social Security and need only to live off of it now. Mr. Speaker, I again thank the Congressional Black Caucus for its courage to continue to speak power to truth. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ) one quick question. She raised a very good point about promise. Does she have any last thought about the element of promise; could she just take a minute or so, just really from her own experience and her own constituents, what the meaning of that promise means today? Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I absolutely will. As my colleague just said, I think what I want people to remember is that we, as Americans, do make promises to other Americans. We do it all of the time. The promise that I am talking about with social safety net is a promise that we won’t leave other Americans behind. We can’t be the land of plenty and have people struggling each and every day. In my district, there are parts of my district that have water and sewer issues, sanitary issues, in 2018. No one in America should not have a flushing toilet. In my district, there are people who live like that. I believe that the promise of America is a promise that we will do all we can to make sure that no American falls through the cracks. We have to remember that all of us go through trying times. These programs are transitional programs. They are there to catch people when they are falling, to give people the opportunity and the training that they need to get back on their feet, to give them the opportunity to be working Americans again, and to give them a dignity to continue to be able to afford to take care of themselves. I think that we need to remember that the American Dream comes with it an obligation, and I believe that that obligation is an American promise to all Americans that we won’t rip social safety net programs away from them, but, instead, we will thoughtfully provide opportunities for training. The skills gap is real, and I think it is really important that we, if we are to address the future of work in America, acknowledge that we are leaving lots of Americans behind, and we, as a Federal Government, should take that as a challenge and meet that challenge to close the skills gap. In many ways, the skills gap is an opportunity gap as well. In order to provide people who need opportunities the most, we have to be willing to step up and provide the resources for them to be able to retrain and retool. b1945 It is critically important. The dignity of work is something that is critically important to most Americans, all Americans. My district has the largest unemployment. When I took office in 2011, the average unemployment in my 14 counties was near 15 percent. It was 14.7 percent. And while Tuscaloosa is doing great and Birmingham is doing great, cities like Selma, that I grew up in, had 21 percent unemployment. What people needed was an opportunity to get back on their feet. I dare to think about all the Americans who were helped by having the Affordable Care Act, by having Medicare and Medicaid, by having the assistance of the Federal Government to get back on their feet. I am happy to report that the average unemployment in my 14 counties is not where we want to be, but we are at 6.3 percent. So it is not at the 3.9 or so that the national average is, but we are a far cry better than we were at the 15 percent. So these people are working. So social service programs were meant to help people get back on their feet. I just think that people think about the fraud and abuse. None of us want fraud and abuse when it comes to our programs, but I can tell you that 70 percent of the folks who receive SNAP in my district have children under the age of 17. So when I fight for SNAP, when I fight against the massive cuts that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to have, I am fighting for those children to have food to eat. I am fighting for the millions of seniors who are on food stamps who depend upon it to provide nutritional assistance. So I think that that promise is something that we all should not only honor, but take as a badge of honor here in the Nation’s Capital and fight every day to provide opportunities for all Americans. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Seventh District of Alabama. I really appreciate her comments. Mr. Speaker, throughout this next 45 minutes, I am going to be introducing 
some of my colleagues, but I want to read a letter that was sent to me on April 27, 2018. As the gentlewoman from Alabama said, I am from Pennsylvania; and being from Pennsylvania, our Governor wrote a letter, and this is what he said: ‘‘I write today to express my concerns regarding the text of the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, or the farm bill released last week. The importance of the farm bill to Pennsylvanians cannot be overstated. As you know, Pennsylvania farmers are facing the same challenges impacting the agricultural industry throughout the country. With trending towards lower farm incomes and a recent market loss for 42 Pennsylvania dairy farmers, the farm bill should be an opportunity to support our Commonwealth’s most vulnerable agricultural industry. Unfortunately, the House Agriculture Committee has released a partisan bill that will punish struggling Pennsylvanians—especially seniors, individuals with disabilities, and working families in all your congressional districts. ‘‘The farm bill has always been a bipartisan effort because hunger is not a political issue. For more than 40 years, Pennsylvanians have relied on the SNAP program to help put food on the table during tough times. Nearly 14 percent of our State’s population is experiencing food insecurity. Cuts to SNAP will only increase that number.’’ Mr. Speaker, the exact number in my congressional district, the Second Congressional District, is 215,195 individuals. In the new district, the Third Congressional District, it is 207,441 people who will be affected by these cuts. ‘‘Let’s be clear—SNAP recipients already face work requirements. This bill increases them and institutes lengthy ineligibility periods for individuals who are noncompliant just for 1 month. In this bill, by 2021, all nondisabled individuals ages 50 to 59 would face work requirements and by 2026, the required number of work hours per week will increase from 20 to 25. Yet this legislation does not include adequate funding for States to provide job training or allow individuals a period of time to engage in educational activities to help residents meet these new threshold requirements. In Pennsylvania, that would translate to an additional 199,000 individuals who will be affected. Let me repeat that. In Pennsylvania, that will translate to 199,000 individuals between 50 and 59 who would face cuts to SNAP. It is more difficult for older individuals to find work when unemployed, and many people want to work more than 25 hours but cannot due to lack of available hours, children, or age.’’ Time limits on SNAP, Mr. Speaker, believe me, would have a devastating affect in Pennsylvania. ‘‘SNAP is a critical social net for our seniors and families’’ and veterans. ‘‘SNAP recipients receive on average of $126 per month, which translates to around $1.40 per meal,’’ Mr. Speaker. ‘‘According to Feeding America, the average meal in Pennsylvania costs $2.93. These cuts are an attack on our most vulnerable citizens. If the goal of the House leadership’’—that is, the Republican leadership—‘‘is to decrease the amount of money the Federal Government spends on SNAP, I suggest’’— this is Governor Wolf—‘‘you raise the Federal minimum wage to $12 per hour’’ so that people can have a real chance. Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear from the Governor of Pennsylvania that there is an attack on poor people, and the Governor of the great State of Pennsylvania has gone on record in saying that we are moving in the wrong direction. Someone whom I have a lot of respect for, and she has served in the great State of Wisconsin in the State legislature, and I have known her before I had this opportunity to come to Congress, is a person who is not shy about the things that she expresses. She speaks truth to power. That is the great woman from the Fourth District of Wisconsin, Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman GWENMOORE . Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ). Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. EVANS for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate having time here on this Congressional Black Caucus hour to discuss socalled welfare reform and efforts on the part of the majority to shred the safety net. Mr. Speaker, I think you just have to sort of sympathize with the majority, given the conundrum that they have put themselves into. What they did, in an effort to have some sort of win and to take advantage of having the majority in the House of Representatives, in the United States Senate, to be holding power in the White House with the new President, even seizing the Supreme Court, this was a very opportune time to do what the majority thought, and I give them credit for thinking that they wanted to implement and execute their greatest policy imperative, and that was to provide tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and to corporations. They wanted to take this one opportunity to do that because, in their opinion, that is what would move our economy forward. In December, they were able to accomplish it over the protests of economists, over the protests of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that said if, in fact, these $1.9 trillion in tax cuts are given to the wealthiest Americans and corporations, that we would see deficits for the next decade at about $1.5 trillion, and that would add to the deficit we are already experiencing. Of course, that is the conundrum for the majority party, which out of one side of their mouth they have always been concerned about deficits, and now they were implementing a policy that would add to the deficit. Well, the explanation for that was that somehow this $1.9 trillion would materialize in a brandnew concept called trickle down; that somehow by cutting these taxes for the wealthiest Americans, that somehow this would create jobs, that wages would be raised, that there would be new capital expenditures; and although trickle down had not worked for 30, 40 years, that somehow this was going to happen. Well, the supposition is that these tax cuts would just sort of magically pay for themselves and that we should just give it a little bit of time. So when these tax cuts were put into place, we saw companies immediately lining up to provide bonuses, onetimeonly bonuses—not raising the wages of workers, not building new factories. Now we see one of our favorite companies, one of my favorite companies— we all own a nice Apple phone—they just paid $100 billion buying back shares. Of course, shareholders are not Americans who live on Main Street. They are the wealthiest people not only in America, but all over the world. You don’t know who the shareholders are. They are probably not your nextdoor neighbors. Well, you have to empathize with the majority party, because they now have to figure out how to pay for these tax cuts. They have got to pay for them. We don’t have to guess how they are going to pay for them. The Speaker has told us how he plans to pay for them. The President has told us how they plan to pay for these tax cuts. I was so happy that the gentlewoman from Alabama was here earlier, and I just want to remind you of what she shared with us. She reminded us that the President, in his budget, his proposed budget, proposed cutting $1.4 trillion—that is ‘‘trillion’’ with a T; that is like 12 zeros after that 1—out of Medicaid. I know from sitting on the Budget Committee with the Speaker for so many years that this is a dream come true for our Speaker, who has always wanted to block grant—as in put on the chopping block—Medicaid, a program that provides security mostly for our seniors for them to have a dignified endoflife experience instead of living like a dog in the back room somewhere living out their last days. We know from what they have put on paper—you can’t make this stuff up— they want to cut $500 billion—that is ‘‘billion’’ with a B—out of Medicare, the program that has reduced and almost eliminated poverty, between that and Social Security, for our elders. You have heard it said time and again that a nation is judged by how it treats its young and its elderly. We know now that the White House and our President is fuming because this $1.9 trillion problem that they have created has now got to be solved. Well, that is just not enough money. That is only $2 trillion between Medicare and Medicaid. So they said, ‘‘Wait a minute. We can cut some out of Social Security,’’ this socalled sacred 
cow. They say, ‘‘We can cut, from Social Security Disability, $72 billion,’’ but that is not enough. We have in front of us a farm bill, and proposals in that bill would cut $23.8 billion out of it, pushing 9.5 million people deeper into poverty, food insecurity, and hunger. b2000 That is the framework for paying for the wealthiest people, for these poor corporations that we have got to provide a safety net for, for these poor 1 percent of our population rich, the wealthiest 1 percent who need relief from the government. We are going to pay for it by cutting Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food stamps. Well, it doesn’t sound like that is enough for the majority. The President has said we are going to just review any program that targets, aids, and supports lowincome or hardworking people. How about housing vouchers? So many Americans—there was a book written about my community by Mr. Matthew Desmond, titled, ‘‘Evicted,’’ and it pointed out how so many Americans work hard, but 50 percent, 60 percent of their income has to go toward housing because, in fact, we haven’t seen a raise in the minimum wage for over a decade. People are working two, three jobs. I have known people who have gone to work and go home at night to the homeless shelter. People cannot afford to pay 50 percent of their income, so there are hardworking Americans who have benefited from housing vouchers, Section 8, subsidized Community Development Block Grant funds. But, of course, we have heard from our Secretary of HUD that we want to reform that program and require disabled folks, elderly folks, perhaps some of our veterans who live in subsidized housing, to pay 35 percent of their income versus 30 percent of their income. This doesn’t increase the pool of people who are eligible for housing. It does two things: It reduces the number of people who are eligible for subsidized housing, and then it raises the costs for those who are squeaking by every single day. So I just am inflamed about this, and I guess I want to ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania some questions because I might have the wrong perspective on this. I am a person who has benefited from these programs. I have fed my family with SNAP, food stamps. I have used Medicaid to take my children to the doctor and to give birth. I have paid my rent using welfare benefits. I am wondering if the gentleman doesn’t think that vilifying poor people is an insidious and nefarious effort to create the atmosphere where Americans would be much more willing to take these programs away from them. I mean, there is this notion, somehow, that there are just lazy people who refuse to go work who need SNAP; that there are just lazy people who are ne’erdowells, and they are fraudulent, they have 80 Social Security numbers, and they are welfare queens. I was just wondering if the gentleman could just get it straight for me, share some things with me: How many families receive Temporary Assistance to Needy Families? Are people eating lobsters on SNAP? Are these homes filled with ablebodied people who refuse to work and they just want to get SNAP? Can the gentleman just give me a profile of the kind of people who we are trying to help. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MARSHALL ). The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 24 minutes remaining. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ). I will give her something that is firsthand from a mayor who is on the forefront. I have a letter here from the mayor of the city of Philadelphia, which Philadelphia has about 1.5 million people. It is one of the biggest poor cities in America, so I am going to give you somebody specifically who can state that he wrote a letter, and I want to read what he has said. He said: ‘‘In Philadelphia’’—remember, where America started, the Liberty Bell, the Constitution Center, Ben Franklin. You remember that, right? That is where it all started, right? This is what he said: ‘‘In Philadelphia, approximately 480,000 individuals receive SNAP to help buy food they need to survive and feed their families.’’ There are more SNAP recipients who can work and do not work and would prefer to work, more than if they could. ‘‘SNAP is critical to helping low wage and parttime workers who can’t find steady employment, veterans’’— those who fought for our country, those who have been out on the forefront—‘‘people who are homeless. . . . ’’ The number that came from HUD in the city of Philadelphia was in the ballpark of 6,000 to 15,000 people homeless. Now remember, that is where the Liberty Bell is, Independence Hall is, Betsy Ross’ house. You remember all of that, right? So it is clear that SNAP is critical. ‘‘It also helps families with children, seniors, and people with disabilities put food on their table.’’ And think of this: ‘‘It doesn’t cost much—the benefits average about $1.34 per person per meal—but it helps Philadelphians fulfill basic needs. And it also has been found to have longterm positive impacts on health, as well as on children’s educational attainment. SNAP also contributes to the Philadelphia economy. Every dollar spent on SNAP generates $1.70 in economic activity in Philadelphia’s grocery stores,’’ grocers who depend a great deal on the importance of this initiative. Remember, where America started, in Philadelphia, this is occurring. So here there is a letter from the mayor stating very clearly that cutting off SNAP will not help Philadelphians get their jobs but will just make it harder for them to pay for their food they need. So, in other words, those work requirements and the things the gentlewoman described, we have an evidence based letter of a mayor who is on the front line, who has to deal with these things every single day. And the fact of the matter is you can document the statistics. In the congressional district that I represent, which is a part of the city of Philadelphia, there is 26 percent poverty, 195,000 people. There is a food bank in one of our major universities in the city of Philadelphia. In the suburban district, which I have a letter from Montgomery County, which is supposed to be one of the richest counties outside of Philadelphia, I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that you ask the right questions and you raise the right issues all on the basis, as you described, on that framework and what you described, paying for that giveaway or taxes. It is not an accident that that tax issue was H. Res. 1 and the farm bill is H. Res. 2. So you think about the order of that, you think about H. Res. 1, H. Res. 2, you see for yourself. So the gentlewoman’s whole theory is definitely not incorrect, and what she has laid out is very clear that this is an attempt to beat up on poor people, beat up on people in these communities. Mr. Speaker, I say to you that we, as the Congressional Black Caucus, are not just going to sit silent. We are going to make sure people hear us. We are going to make sure people know that we are just not going to accept this. So I say to the gentlewoman, I heard her message and I have described it to her. I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that. I just want to tell him how outraged I am by the propaganda against poor people. I am outraged by it. If you look at a family that uses SNAP, formerly called food stamps, this program works perfectly well in a capitalist society, in a countercyclical economy. When we almost had a depression in 2008, the food stamp rolls went up, and now they are coming back down because people are more connected with work. Twothirds of these families that receive SNAP have at least one working person in it. And guess what. They have veterans in them and elders, children and disabled people. Eighty percent of the people who receive SNAP, someone has worked the year before or the year after, so it is not an issue of people not wanting to work. 
And think about it: we now have given $1.9 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest people. We hear the White House bragging about how we have increased those jobs, we have increased jobs by 164,000 people. Let me tell you, I happen to know in my own community people got two or three of those jobs because that is what they need to hold it down. Before I finish, I will just say that we ought not fall for the okeydoke, because poor people are not those other people. They are you; they are your cousins; they are people who go to your church; they are your kids’ classmates; they are people who worked every day and lost their jobs due to technology or downsizing. And when you are 50 years old, it is not because you don’t want to work. You can’t work. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the great State of Wisconsin for her comments. I want to introduce someone else who is also on the Budget Committee, who I have watched a long time in the short period of time that I have been here. She has been a real fighter, and she speaks to the issues. I have not seen anyone intimidate her, and she is from the great 18th District of Texas. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished manager for yielding to me and for the eloquent statements of our colleagues, including Congresswoman SEWELL and Congresswoman MOORE . I thank our chairman, Mr. RICHMOND , for his persistence that members of the Congressional Black Caucus come to the floor of the House to be able to address these concerns that are very important. I am going to be very brief, but I want to join my colleagues on what I think is a striking and provocative discourse, and it is a hurting discourse. The reason why I want to make sure that my voice is heard is because I have constituents who are living poor, but their spirit is not poor. Their commitment to success is not poor. Their desire for better opportunities for their children is not poor. Yet we want to condemn or malign this group that may be living in poverty. It strikes me as a difficult proposition to know that the Speaker of the House, for example, is seeking, again, welfare reform which, when I first came to the United States Congress, I enthusiastically voted against. And I was right because so many people were turned off the rolls; so many lives were ruined; so many children did not get the needs that they needed; so many poor mothers could not tend to their newborn babies because resources were lost. b2015 Now we come again to a concept of welfare reform, and we are not concerned, I guess, about the different health conditions of different ethnic and racial populations. The age 60 for some, maybe 80, in terms of a physical condition that they are facing, and so a flat number of 60, cut you off or you can’t have coverage that is necessary, is a sad state on this great country. The other point that I think is important is that the President has offered a review of the programs that help the poor. Now, right now today, Houston is still suffering from the impact of Hurricane Harvey. And as I heard my colleague, good times today and bad times tomorrow. Or making ends meet today or yesterday, and not making them meet today. We are still seeing students and families who were displaced during Hurricane Harvey losing everything and barely getting back on their feet, and this is May, and we are about to enter the hurricane season again. So the idea of a safety net that the $1.7 trillion tax cut cuts right into, that is the point. A safety net is not a handout. This reverse Robin Hood tax bill takes from individuals who are part, again, of the greatness of America. We are always hearing of the stories of the person from the little red schoolhouse or rural America who was great and made it to a success story. They made it through the Helping Hands. They made it through the Pell grants. They made it through Medicare. They made it through Medicaid. In 1965, we saw more seniors living after 1965, when President Johnson and the Democratic Congress passed Medicare and Medicaid. So the idea that we are reviewing programs that are impacting people who suffer from poverty or that we would think it is more important to have this major tax cut that is creating this huge deficit so the people who are victimized are the people who, in fact, are part of America’s greatness and have every right to have an opportunity of success in their lives. Seventy percent of Americans rely on at least one meanstested Federal program. The nutrition program, the SNAP program, the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, was a lifeline for Houstonians and people in Harris County during Hurricane Harvey. I remember getting an extension, and 30,000 people came and stood in the hot Sun for 3 days just to be able to get a voucher that would carry them through the Christmas holiday. That was what you call emergency supplemental nutrition. What we have now, the SNAP program, $1.40 per meal. And then the President was offering: Let’s don’t do that. Let’s send a box. Let’s send a brown box to the house and have some dry milk and whatever other nonperishables could be in there. These people have children. They have preK. They need childcare. Have you heard the fact that HUD may be tripling the rents that lowincome Americans are receiving that housing Federal subsides would have to pay? So they get a Federal subsidy and they have to pay three times the rent? That seems to be a little absurd. If we are concerned about what is a hand up, what is, in fact, the opportunity for individuals to meet their promise and their greatness, we would not have passed such an atrocious tax bill that really eats at the flesh of survival of this country and many Americans. For example, the top 1 percent’s tax cut, if they didn’t get that tax cut—of which many have said: We don’t want it, didn’t need it—childcare would be able to be provided for 19 children, job training for 27 workers, Pell grants for 38 students, and providing substance use disorder treatment for 21 people. The CHIP program would be stronger; and, of course, the ability for individuals suffering from the opioid crisis, we would have far more dollars to be able to assist them to restore their lives. So it is very important that the debate tonight not be, as it has been characterized, about poor people or the impoverished, or that the debate is about handouts. It is the safety net that every single American desires but is really owed to have. It is the very safety net that has the world looking to America as the greatest Nation in the world. I have many friends in many countries around the world, and some of these countries have a billionplus people. The safety net that they have is a nonsafety net. So the level of disaster and devastation in populations is almost unbelievable as compared to here in this country. But the reason why we are this country is because people expect us not to be those countries. They expect us to be the America with resources, and we do have resources. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman very much for yielding to me to explain, one, the devastation of this trillionplus tax cut bill that we fought vigorously in the Budget Committee and offered any number of amendments to correct and protect Medicaid, Medicare, education, and benefits that really give us stair steps of opportunity. But I hope, as we move forward, that we will not go down this very disastrous pathway of changing welfare to make it a punitive legislative initiative so that the people hurt the most are those in the sunset of their life, seniors, those who are suffering from opioid addiction, and our children. I hope we don’t totally implode the valuable safety net that brought us through the depression that FDR developed in the 1940s with the WPA and then on into the 1960s when President Johnson had the great society. Where is the America that cares? Where is the America that understands? Mr. Speaker, It is important for me to be standing here. 
This is the Reverse Robin Hood Tax Bill. Instead of taking from the rich and giving to the poor. This tax law takes from the very poor and gives to the very rich. Last year, the GOP passed its tax cuts for the richest among us. Now no one should be surprised that this happened. It is crystal clear that President Trump, a man who comes from wealth, doesn’t understand the challenges facing the working poor. His constant effort to undermine programs that help these Americans maintain a basic standard of living does nothing more than reinforce deeply racialized myths that poor Americans are lazy and undeserving. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Millions of Americans who are beneficiaries of these programs work two or more jobs just to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads for their families. In addition, the vast majority of fulltime workers live paycheck to paycheck. In fact, 70% of Americans rely on at least one means tested federal program throughout their lives. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) only provides $1.40 per meal. Not to mention that only one in five qualifying families actually receives housing assistance. At the end of the day, our constituents should be able to support their children with one fulltime job. This requires increasing the minimum wage, strengthening job training programs, and creating goodpaying jobs. Ultimately, we need to give families the tools they need to rise out of poverty, not undercut programs that keep them afloat. Instead, the current president has made the least of these pick up the tab. And he’s doing this while his cabinet nominated officials are feeding at the trough. Take for example the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Just last week, HUD indicated that they would triple the rents that lowincome Americans receiving housing federal subsidies would have to pay. This was done while Secretary Carson spent $30,000 in taxpayer money on a dining room table, proposed tripling the rent for low income Americans receiving federal housing subsidies. Last month, the president issued an executive order to restrict access to healthcare, housing, food, and many other programs that help the working poor. President Trump’s plan to cut funding for healthcare, food, and housing programs in order to give tax cuts to billionaires will do nothing more than make a bad situation worse. The fact of the matter is that programs that help the working poor have been under constant attack for the last 30 years and, in many cases, don’t go far enough. Only one in four qualifying families with children actually receives Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) only provides $1.40 per meal. Not to mention that only one in five qualifying families actually receives housing assistance. Federal programs should do more to help the working poor who are forced to spend 70– 80% of their income on rent and utilities. To give you a snapshot of who is harmed by this tax scam, and how it harms those needing a hand up, consider that the average tax cut for someone in the Top 0.1%, that money could mean: Childcare for 19 children. Job training for 27 workers. Pell grants or 38 students. Providing substance use disorder treatment for 21 people. Health coverage through the Children Health Insurance Program (CHIP). So when we consider who this helps and who this hurts, it is clear that this bill hurts those seeking help caring for their families. It hurts those seeking training and a professional gateway to another profession. It seeks those looking for assistance to education. And in this age of the Opioid crisis, where tomorrow we will be having a hearing on this matter, an average tax cut would provide substance use disorder treatment for 21 people. So it is clear that this bill is not for the middle class. By now, the GOP’s playbook is well known: campaign as if you support the middle class and those striving to enter it, but once elected use the levers of government to favor the rich and the powerful. That’s why time on the GOP is coming up. The American People are watching and they know that the Democrats offer a better deal. And Democrats stand ready to offer #ABetterDeal. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from the great State of Texas in the 18th District for her comments adding to this discussion. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from the Governor of Pennsylvania, who indicated 1.8 million people are on SNAP; the city of Philadelphia, where it all started here in terms of America, 400,000 individuals on SNAP, a letter from the mayor of the city of Philadelphia; and a letter from the chair, Chairwoman Arkoosh, who is chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, the third largest county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where 50,000 people are on SNAP. 
COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA , Harrisburg, PA, April 17, 2018. Hon. DWIGHT EVANS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN EVANS : I write today to express my concerns regarding the text of the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 or the Farm Bill released last week. The importance of the Farm Bill to Pennsylvanians cannot be overstated. As you know, Pennsylvania farmers are facing the same challenges impacting the agricultural industry throughout the country. With trending low farm incomes and a recent market loss for 42 Pennsylvania dairy farmers, the Farm Bill should be an opportunity to support our commonwealth’s valuable agricultural industry. Unfortunately, the House Agriculture committee has released a partisan bill that will punish struggling Pennsylvanians especially seniors, individuals with disabilities, and working families in your congressional district. The Farm Bill has always been a bipartisan effort because hunger is not a political issue. For more than 40 years, Pennsylvanians have relied on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to help put food on the table during tough times. Nearly 14 percent of our state’s population is experiencing food insecurity. Cuts to SNAP will only increase that number. In February of this year, over 1.8 million Pennsylvanians were enrolled in SNAP, including 215,195 individuals in the 2nd Congressional District and 207,411 in the new 3rd Congressional District. Over 80% of SNAP dollars are distributed to households with children, seniors, or an individual with a disability according to the US Department of Agriculture. Let’s be clear—SNAP recipients already face work requirements. This bill increases them and institutes lengthy ineligibility periods for individuals who are noncompliant for just one month. In this bill, by 2021 all nondisabled individuals ages 50 to 59 would face work requirements and by 2026 the required number of work hours per week will increase from 20 to 25. Yet this legislation does not include adequate funding for states to provide job training or allow individuals a period of time to engage in educational activities to help residents meet these new threshold requirements. In Pennsylvania that would translate to an additional 199,000 individuals between 50–59 who would face cuts to SNAP. It is more difficult for older individuals to find work when unemployed and many people want to work more than 25 hours but cannot due to lack of available hours, children, or age. Time limits on SNAP would now apply to parents of children older than 6. Over 20% of Pennsylvania’s SNAP recipients have children in the household. These parents already face significant barriers to meet the current work requirements. Increasing them makes it more likely their children will face hunger which creates barriers to academic success and results in poorer health outcomes and a higher risk of chronic conditions. Combined, each of these things contributes to a cycle of poverty that can be almost impossible to break. Cuts to SNAP do not just affect those who receive SNAP benefits. In the 2017 fiscal year, SNAP recipients in Pennsylvania spent more than $2.7 billion in benefits. These dollars do not only benefit the recipient but flow to local business that provide jobs and economic stability to the commonwealth. SNAP spending currently accounts for more than 10 percent of all spending on food purchased to be eaten at home. It is estimated that each SNAP dollar spent provides nearly double the impact in local communities. Cuts to SNAP are cuts to cuts farms, food processors, and grocery stores as well. SNAP is a critical safety net for our seniors and families. SNAP recipients receive on average of $126 per month, which translates to around $1.40 per meal. According to Feeding America, the average meal in Pennsylvania costs $2.93. These cuts are an attack on our most vulnerable citizens. If the goal of House leadership is to decrease the amount of money the federal government spends on SNAP, I suggest you raise the federal minimum wage to $12.00 per hour and lift millions of Americans out of poverty that way instead of taking food off the table for Pennsylvanians. I urge you to reject this partisan legislation and instead work together on a bill that can pass both chambers with bipartisan support. My administration is ready and eager to engage in conversations on legislation to benefit all Pennsylvanians. Thank you for the opportunity to weigh in on this issue. Sincerely, TOMWOLF, Governor. 
CITY OF PHILADELPHIA , Philadelphia, PA. DEARREPRESENTATIVE EVANS : I am writing to provide you with information about the 
impacts of changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that are proposed in the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 under consideration in the House, which include cuts to SNAP benefits and expansion of time limits and work requirement. My administration has made work and workforce a priority—in fact we recently announced the City’s workforce strategy: Fueling the Philadelphia’s Talent Engine. We believe that work is key to success for families and for our communities. But adding bureaucratic requirements and harsh penalties to a program that helps people stave off hunger is not the way to increase employment. In Philadelphia approximately 480,000 individuals receive SNAP to help buy the food they need to survive and feed their families. Most SNAP recipients who can work do work, and would prefer to work more hours if they could. This bill expands SNAP time limits and work requirements and adds harsh penalties—12 and 36 months ineligibility for food assistance—for those who are not in compliance, even if they are trying to find work. The bill proposes reducing the spending on direct food assistance to needy families in order to pay for implementation of these bureaucratic new requirements. Research indicates aggressive new work requirements are likely to cause families in need to lose food assistance, while doing little to increase employment. SNAP is critical to helping lowwage and parttime workers who can’t find steady employment, veterans, people who are homeless, and people struggling with addictions. It also helps families with children, seniors, and people with disabilities put food on the table. It doesn’t cost much—the benefits average about $1.34 per person per meal—but it helps Philadelphians fulfil basic needs. And it also has been found to have longterm positive impacts on health, as well as on children’s educational attainment. SNAP also contributes to the Philadelphia economy. Every dollar spent in SNAP generates $1.70 in economic activity in Philadelphia’s grocery stores and farmer’s markets. We believe that one group of Philadelphians who would be disproportionately impacted by the penalties related to work requirements is people with criminal records. Having an arrest any time in one’s life continues to decrease a job seeker’s prospects more than any other factor. Returning residents want work, but if their criminal record prevents them from finding employment they would be unable to fulfil the work requirement and would lose SNAP benefits as a penalty. Cutting off SNAP will not help Philadelphians get jobs but will just make it harder for them to pay for the food they need while they struggle to find work. I urge you and your colleagues in Congress to focus on policies that help create jobs and boost wages rather than punishing people who are already facing economic hardship. Sincerely, JAMES F. K ENNEY , Mayor. 
OFCOMMISSIONERS , Norristown, PA, April 17, 2018. Hon. DWIGHT EVANS : Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN EVANS : I am writing today to oppose the changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that are outlined in the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. The proposed strict eligibility requirements would eliminate as many as one million recipients that rely on SNAP to feed themselves and their families. In Montgomery County, more than 50,000 residents receive SNAP benefits, and more than 21,000 of those recipients are children. Another 8,000 are senior citizens, and more than 7,500 are disabled adults. For these residents, the SNAP program makes the difference as to whether or not these vulnerable individuals have a meal each day. With an average monthly benefit of $123.51 for SNAP recipients, it is already difficult for recipients to receive proper nutrition. Not only that, but Montgomery County has a large population that is food insecure, but earn just enough to disqualify them for SNAP benefits. An estimated 58 percent of those who experience hunger in our county are ineligible for assistance. We need to extend SNAP benefits, not shrink them, for our most vulnerable county residents. In Pennsylvania, one in 12 workers use SNAP to supplement their nutritional needs. Many of the workers on SNAP earn low wages, have unstable schedules and cannot rely on enough hours to feed their families each week, or are in between jobs. SNAP assists workers in the service industry, sales and retail workers, teaching assistants, construction and other seasonal workers, and agricultural workers among many others. These individuals are a critical component of our local economy and yet still struggle to put food on the table for their families. As a doctor, I know that access to healthy, affordable food and safe housing are key factors in the health of children and adults. SNAP has an impact on the health of its recipients—they have lower healthcare costs than people who are eligible for SNAP, but do not use it. Food insecurity also has a particularly negative impact on children, who account for nearly half of SNAP recipients in Montgomery County, and pregnant women, as it is linked to infant mortality. Any cuts to SNAP benefits, or restrictions that attempt to broaden the circle of who legislators believe deserve to go hungry, are bad for our residents. No one deserves to go hungry—not the children in our county, and not their parents who may sacrifice their own meals so there is more food for their little ones. SNAP is helping many families keep their heads above water, and we should be finding more ways to expand the program to assist those families, instead of trying to cut the rope. Please contact my office if you have any questions. Sincerely, VALERIE A. A RKOOSH , MD, MPH, Chair, Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to read a little bit from Ms. Arkoosh’s letter. ‘‘In Montgomery County, more than 50,000 residents receive SNAP benefits, and more than 21,000 of those recipients are children. Another 8,000 are senior citizens, and more than 7,500 are disabled adults. For these residents, the SNAP program makes the difference as to whether or not these vulnerable individuals have a meal each day. ‘‘With an average monthly benefit of $123.51 for SNAP recipients, it is already difficult for recipients to receive proper nutrition. Not only that, but Montgomery County has a large population that is food insecure, but earn just enough to disqualify them for SNAP benefits. An estimated 58 percent of those who experience hunger in our county are ineligible for assistance. We need to extend SNAP benefits, not shrink them, for our most vulnerable county residents. ‘‘In Pennsylvania, 1 in 12 workers use SNAP to supplement their nutritional needs. Many of the workers on SNAP earn low wages, have unstable schedules, and cannot rely on enough hours to feed their families each week. . . . ’’ This is a major county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I give this as further evidence that clearly we are going in the wrong direction. So let’s be clear. With the President’s executive order, which is a thinly veiled attempt to restrict access to healthcare, housing, food, and many other basic living programs, by adding on onerous work requirements, it is not surprising that this President is ordering a mass review of the social safety net programs that help the poorest of the poor the same week that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected a massive deficit as a result of the Republican’s tax scam. Let’s be clear, Mr. Speaker. Democrats sounded the alarm months ago when the Republicans passed a massive $1.9 trillion tax cut. That is because Republicans employed this terrible threestep process before. First, cut the tax rate for top income earners and corporations. Claim that it will magically pay enough through economic growth. We have heard that before. Second, balloon the deficit when economic growth does not pay for the tax cut and pretend to be shocked. Third, insist on massive cuts in critical programs that provide a basic standard of living for all Americans, like eliminating Meals on Wheels for seniors and benefits for Americans with disabilities. Mr. Speaker, we have seen this plan before, and it is very unfortunate. We all need to understand, as Dr. King talked about, a beloved community. We are our brothers’ and sisters’ keeper. What is worse, Mr. Speaker, the President’s budget and executive action to make it harder for struggling Americans to get the help they need is officially step three. The President and the conservatives who control this agenda paint a racist and inadequate portrait of poor people as lazy welfare queens who would rather depend on the government than pull themselves up by the boot straps. But nothing could be further from the truth. It is a reality that a million Americans face. Everybody would like to work, Mr. Speaker. So let’s be very clear. Everybody, if they have a good, decent job and a decent income, no one—no one, Mr. Speaker—wants to be on the SNAP program. However, Mr. Speaker, understanding the cyclical nature of our economy, there is a need. Food banks cannot do it alone. We all know, the reality is there is a direct connection between what is happening in our economy. So let’s be clear. Our Nation’s societal safety net already has failed to help the families they need. Already, in 
the State of Pennsylvania, nearly 14 percent of our population, many of them in Philadelphia, are hungry. And, unfortunately, they will be joined by more Pennsylvanians if this farm bill is to pass. Mr. Speaker, this is not something to be taken lightly. This is not something that we should smile and joke about because this is no joke. There are an awful lot of people out here, Mr. Speaker. And the Congressional Black Caucus stands today to work with anyone who is trying to move us forward and not backwards. So it is clear, Mr. Speaker, in terms of the effects that we are having, this is something that we shouldn’t take lightly. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a little announcement about the person who does all the staff work, because it is important to recognize staff. She has been the guiding force behind these Special Orders, and I want to thank her personally and go on the record that Caren Street has been a fantastic person. She is just leaving the Congressional Black Caucus, but she will still be around and be available. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Caren for all she has done for the people of this country and particularly for the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
b2030 BENEFITS OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, this evening, we will hear from myself and a colleague from Tennessee, and he is joining me today to talk about how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has benefited our States. In my congressional district, Kentucky’s Second, I have heard from constituents who have seen more money in their paychecks and from businesses that have been able to grow and pass along the benefits of tax reform directly to their employees. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the standard deduction for both individuals and couples. For the 75 percent of residents in Kentucky’s Second District who take the standard deduction, this is an automatic tax cut. Additionally, individuals in every tax bracket are paying lower rates. When I visited Owensboro in February, I met Cheri and Ray Middletown, who own On Time Fab, a small business that provides fabrication services for agricultural, industrial, and commercial productions. Cheri and Ray shared with me that, during the first week of the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, each of the 20 employees of On Time Fab took home more pay as a result of tax reform. One employee took home as much as $56 a week and more than $200 a month. A single dad working for On Time Fab is bringing home an extra $40 each week. Some thought there was a mistake in their paychecks because they are able to keep so much of their hard earned money, and $40 a week is over $160 a month. By cutting the corporate tax rate to make the U.S. competitive globally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has given businesses the opportunity to pass along savings to their customers. For example, residents of 48 States, plus the District of Columbia, are seeing their utility bills go down because of tax reform. In Kentucky, the Public Service Commission has ordered investor owned utilities to track their tax savings and to reduce rates for hundreds of thousands of Kentucky customers. In fact, the Public Service Commission has already announced that Kentucky Utilities’ and Louisville Gas & Electric’s residential electric customers will see their average monthly bills decreased by 6 percent. Atmos Energy, which serves western Kentucky, announced in March that it will be cutting the average residential bill by just over 3 percent. Other savings from tax reform will fund infrastructure upgrades across the Commonwealth. Companies in Kentucky have been able to expand their operation because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Owl’s Head Alloys in my hometown of Bowling Green recently announced a $3 million expansion which would create 17 new jobs, bringing their total employment in the Second District to nearly 100 goodpaying jobs. When I visited their facility in March, Owl’s Head owner and president, David Bradford, told me that the economic outlook resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act helped lead to their decision to expand. This is exactly why we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: to give American businesses the confidence to grow and expand right in our communities, and to help individual taxpayers keep more of their money. Some might say that an extra $200 a month is just crumbs. For hardworking Kentucky taxpayers, the extra money can go toward a car payment or a mortgage. It can help pay for a child’s braces or even for regular expenses like groceries. The bottom line is that, with more expendable income in their pockets, Americans across the country have more freedom to choose how they spend their hardearned money. A typical family of four earning $75,000 can expect to pay $2,000 less in taxes this year compared to last year. I was proud to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I am proud to report that tax reform is making a real difference in the lives of Kentuckians. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have a neighbor to the south of me here today to talk about how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is having a big effect on the lives of not just Kentuckians but all Americans—particularly Kentucky and Tennessee—so I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ), my good friend from suburban Memphis, which is one of the great cities in our area, to talk about the effects of the tax cuts in Tennessee. Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky for organizing this evening and talking about how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is helping the hardworking people of Tennessee. I think we all know that, in December, with President Trump’s strong support, this Congress passed the first major reform of our Tax Code in 31 years. We all knew that bringing these historic changes to the Tax Code would improve the quality of life for Tennesseans and millions of Americans. Quite frankly, the Tax Code is simpler and fairer to everyone. Jobs are being created, and paychecks are bigger. We are all enjoying a robust economy that is the best it has been in a long time. Just last week, in my district in west Tennessee, in the Eighth Congressional District of Tennessee, two major announcements were made in my district. In Lake County, Excel Boat Company announced they will be opening a manufacturing plant that will bring 200 goodpaying jobs and a total economic development investment of $9 million. Additionally, in my district, a South Korean manufacturer announced a $13 million investment in Martin, Tennessee, and 220 job opportunities at the company’s first United Statesbased location. Prior to that, just 1 month after the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, FedEx announced an investment of more than $200 million to raise wages for their employees. Then 2 months later, FedEx continued their posttax reform action and committed over $1 billion to expand their express hub in Memphis. Another company in the Eighth Congressional District, Dot Foods, which has a location in Dyersburg, Tennessee, announced $500 in bonuses for each of their 4,800 fulltime employees nationwide. I am also proud of First Horizon Corporation, also known as First Tennessee Bank, which is based in Tennessee, with branches all across the 
Volunteer State. They invested tax reform savings in their workforce. Not only did the bank give eligible employees a bonus, they also increased their minimum wage to $15 an hour. This was because of tax reform. Now, a way to raise the minimum wage is to increase economic opportunities, economic possibilities, just, frankly, making the economic environment better. Then there was the announcement by Tyson Foods, who gave a bonus to their frontline workers, or, as they call them, the backbone of their business. I have got a chart here of Tennessee, and you can see that, in Tennessee, the typical family of four is going to see a tax cut of over $2,000. That is real money. I think about an employer that I visited with in my district who said—he may have 8 or 10 employees—he said he noticed when he was doing his employees’ payroll—and they get paid each and every week—he noticed they were getting an additional $15 to $20 per week. So, if somebody is getting an additional $20 per week per pay period, that is $1,000 a year. The typical family of four in Tennessee is getting a tax cut of $2,023. Think of it this way: across the Nation, across our country, more than 4 million workers and counting have received a bonus, a pay raise, or increased retirement benefits. Mr. Speaker, it is becoming increasingly clear that tax reform is working and the America economic engine is off and running again. The most recent Federal jobs report shows the fastest wage growth since the 2008 recession, and the unemployment rate has dropped to a 17year low. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Speaker RYAN. I want to thank Chairman BRADY and especially President Donald Trump on their leadership in passing this landmark legislation. And, again, I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky for all of his help in organizing tonight to remind the people of this country the hard work that the President has done, the hard work that this Congress has done—the House of Representatives, and the Senate—so that we can improve our economy and we can return hardearned money to the people, because they best know how to spend their money, not the bureaucrats in Washington. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Tennessee for yielding back. As he said, Tennessee has seen the benefits from tax reform. Kentucky is seeing the benefits of tax reform and the opportunity for people to move into prosperity as they expand opportunity. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in April, unemployment was at 3.9 percent across the country. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also reported that 164,000 jobs were added across the country in April, raising the total since our tax reform bill was signed into law to nearly 800,000 people. Businesses are confident in our economy because of tax reform. Most businesses are telling me that they are looking for workers, looking for people to have the opportunity to move forward. One of the great reasons that we are trying to do some of the policies that were talked about during the last hour is that we want to see people have the opportunity to work, to go from poverty to prosperity, from dependence to independence. We want people to have the opportunity to move forward, and a growing economy will allow them to do so because these people are needed in the workforce. They are wanted. They are needed, and I will guarantee you, when we have people in the workforce, they are going to be better off than if they are not. So we are looking forward to moving forward with some of the issues that were talked about earlier. But tonight we have heard stories about Kentuckians; we have heard stories about Tennesseans who have benefited from tax reform. Hardworking taxpayers are seeing more money in their paychecks. Companies are expanding and creating jobs. Businesses are passing along the benefits of tax cuts to their customers and to their employees, handing out bonuses and raises. We are seeing these stories in our own States and across the country. This is exactly what we expected when we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I am glad to see many of our communities benefiting from this bill. I want to thank my friend from Tennessee for sharing his stories from Tennessee, as I was sharing my stories from Kentucky, and I thank him for joining me tonight to discuss the importance of tax reform. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
