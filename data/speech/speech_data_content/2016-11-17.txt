Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Private First Class Tyler Iubelt. Tyler was a Tamaroa, Illinois native, a 2015 graduate of Pinckneyville High School. He enjoyed the outdoors, grilling, playing practical jokes on his friends and teachers. He was known as a smart and goodnatured kid, and had a great future. He was a son, a husband and, just recently, a father. Last Saturday, he died a hero. Upon graduation, Tyler entered the U.S. Army, stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. He was transferred to Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. According to the Pentagon, a Taliban terrorist managed to ignite an IED at the base, killing Tyler, Sergeant John Perry, and two American contractors. Seventeen more were injured. An investigation is ongoing. But our prayers are needed now for Tyler’s wife, Shelby, for baby Violet, for his parents, his extended family, and his many friends in southern Illinois. Tyler paid the ultimate sacrifice for this Nation, and, for that, we will always be grateful. RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF BARBARA WONG (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Barbara Wong, an incredible advocate for the arts, who has been executive director of Providence CityArts for Youth for 16 years. Throughout her career, Barbara has helped thousands of youth realize the importance of art in their own lives, as well as its extraordinary power to create social change. Thanks to her, the arts community in Providence is more vibrant, more diverse, and more accessible for children from all backgrounds than ever before. In 2014, her dedication to ensuring that all children have the same opportunities to learn about and pursue the arts helped Providence CityArts for Youth earn a trip to the White House to receive the prestigious National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award. It is my honor to thank Barbara for her years of service to the children and young people of Providence, and I wish her all the best in the coming years. 
IN MEMORY OF RALPH J. CICERONE (Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Ralph Cicerone, who passed away on November 5, at the age of 73. Ralph served as the University of CaliforniaIrvine’s chancellor from 1998 to 2005. During that time, UCI experienced tremendous success under his leadership, including raising the school’s national rankings and breaking ground on its teaching hospital. Beyond his contributions to the Irvine community, Ralph was worldrenowned for his innovative, scientific 
research that has helped shape environmental policy. Our thoughts are with Ralph’s wife, Carol, his daughter, Sarah, and his two grandchildren. He will be truly missed but will be long remembered for his contributions to the Orange County UCI and science communities. 
DISTRIBUTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, this is another in a series of 1minutes on cool science endeavors by American scientists. Today I discuss a system that provides data about the distribution of greenhouse gases around the Earth. The National Science Foundation funded the Airborne Platform for Poleto Pole Observations, called HIPPO, that maps the composition and interactions of greenhouse gases as they move around the Earth. This information is used to identify the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide. The field efforts were highly successful, and these unique experiments are providing valuable insight into the role of the global carbon cycle in the climate system. This data has been made publicly available and will be a source of information for years to come. The project was a coordinated effort by the NSF and the NOAA to acquire a clearer picture of the impact of carbon dioxide on rainforests and other ecosystems. I urge Congress to continue its support for scientific endeavors, such as HIPPO, so that we can gain a better understanding of our Earth’s climate system. 
LET’S GET THE 21ST CENTURY CURES ACT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shine a light on the millions of Americans impacted by deadly diseases that currently have no cure. We know that better treatments and cures for diseases like cancer, ALS, Alzheimer’s, and the 7,000 rare diseases are within our reach. We need to break down the government barriers to innovation and discovery. The 21st Century Cures Act will do just that. I stand with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee when I say: let’s get this done. We have the chance now to help make a profound impact on people’s lives. With Cures, and my provision in the OPEN Act, we are opening the doors for medical breakthroughs to happen. For the sake of millions of patients and their families, let’s get 21st Century Cures across the finish line. THE FINAL 1MINUTE SPEECH (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, over the last 51⁄2years, I have spoken here on the House floor more times than I can count, but this will be my last. I am retiring from Congress and joining the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, a position my father held for 40 years, where he did so much good for so many people. Few people have the privilege to serve their community and their country in the United States Congress. I am honored by the trust my constituents invested in me to represent them. I have been humbled by the experience and continue to be in awe of the time I have spent as both a witness and participant to history. Washington can be a difficult place, but I have managed to make incredible friends here with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, from my good friend, Congressman TEDPOE, my co chair on the PORTS Caucus; to DAVID CICILLINE , my best friend, my inspiration for the issues that he addresses each and every day; and to LOUIE GOHMERT , my cochair for the National Prayer Breakfast. I want to thank Leader PELOSI for her example and for the strength she instills in all of us in the Democratic Caucus. I am eager to get back to work in Los Angeles, but I will be sorry to say goodbye to all of you. I have appreciated your support, your friendship, your dedication to your constituents, and to this great country, and I will forever be grateful to have known you. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL PARK SERVICE DIRECTOR JONATHAN JARVIS (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Director Jonathan Jarvis on his impressive career preserving some of our Nation’s most treasured places as Director of the National Park Service. Director Jarvis serves as the 18th director in the NPS history and developed his love for national parks at a young age, with his family’s farm tucked in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley backing up to the Washington National Forest. A Virginia native, Director Jarvis graduated from the College of William and Mary with a degree in biology and began his career as a seasonal interpretive ranger on the National Mall in 1976. As Director, he oversees an agency responsible for over 400 national parks, attracting some 280 million visitors each year. Recently, while on the grounds of Teddy Roosevelt’s beloved home, Sagamore Hill, I was pleased to hear his vision for the essential role of parks in our national life. At the end of this year, the centennial year of the National Park Service, Director Jarvis will retire after 40 years of service. I extend my warmest regards and best wishes to Director Jarvis in this next chapter of his life. Happy trails. f 
TOOLS TO PREVENT VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this week this House passed two important measures dealing with the problems we have in the Middle East. One measure on extending the Iran sanctions, the ability for the President to authorize those that would have expired at the end of this year, was passed by this House in order to give this administration and the next one tools needed for the bad behavior of Iran that it continues to exhibit. We cannot trust that they will continue to adhere to the bad agreement that was made. Also an important measure was that for Syria to cause sanctions against their proclivity to bring violence upon their citizens. We need both of these measures for this President and this administration currently and, very importantly, going into the next one to be able to enforce against these bad activities that are happening in the Middle East. I urge the Senate to take up these measures. I urge this President to pass these measures, so we have these important tools to prevent this kind of violence in the Middle East using our sanction ability. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5982. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HILL). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 921 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5982. The Chair appoints the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b0914 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 5982) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide for en bloc consideration in resolutions of disapproval for ‘‘midnight rules’’, and for other purposes, with Mr. DENHAM in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. b0915 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As the Obama administration comes to a close, Americans’ freedom and prosperity is once again threatened by one of the most abusive features of modern bureaucracy: midnight regulation. Midnight regulation is one of the most vexing problems in Washington’s overreaching regulatory system. Administration after administration, there is a spike in rulemaking activity during the last year of a President’s term—particularly between election day and Inauguration Day, but even in the months before then. These successive waves of midnight regulation present deeply troubling issues. First and foremost, because outgoing administrations are no longer accountable to the voters, they are much more prone to issue midnight regulations that fly in the face of the electoral mandate the voters just gave the new, incoming administration. Waves of midnight rules can also be very hard for Congress or a new administration to check adequately. As a new Congress and President begin their terms, both, understandably, must be focused on implementing the new priorities within the mandates the voters have given them. That doesn’t always leave time to focus on cleaning up all of the last acts of the departing administration. In addition, the Congressional Review Act currently allows Congress to disapprove of regulations—including midnight regulations—only one at a time. A wave of midnight regulations can easily overwhelm Congress’ ability to use oneruleatatime resolutions as an effective check. Finally, it is welldocumented that the rush by outgoing administrations to impose midnight rules before the clock strikes 12 leads to more poorly analyzed rules with lower quality and lower benefits. The Obama administration has imposed more runaway regulation than any other in memory, and its midnight rulemaking period is no exception. This administration has issued or plans to issue at least 180 midnight rules within the scope of this bill, including multiple billiondollar rules and more than 20 major rules imposing $100 million or more in costs per year. It has been estimated that as many as $113 billion in new regulatory costs can be attributed to the final months of the Obama administration’s rulemaking activity. But this is not a partisan issue. Administrations of both parties have issued midnight rules in the past. The Judiciary Committee has been searching for that solution for some time, and I applaud our colleague, Mr. I SSA, for introducing the Midnight Rules Relief Act to respond to the need. This bill offers, at last, a simple and powerful means to stop the problem of abusive midnight rules—allowing Congress to disapprove of any and all midnight regulations in one fell swoop by one en bloc disapproval resolution under the Congressional Review Act. Any outgoing administration, understanding that it has this sword of Damocles hanging over its head for the next Congress’ use, will surely hesitate much more before abusing midnight rules. Further, once enabled to dispose of all improper midnight rules with one simple resolution, Congress and succeeding administrations would be free to focus more of their energies on the voters’ new priorities rather than the mess left by midnight rules. The relief offered by the bill, moreover, is highly flexible. No set number of regulations would have to be covered by a resolution. No categories of regulation would have to be included in or excluded from a resolution. On the contrary, any midnight rule disapproval resolution could be sweeping or narrow, depending on how many rules merited inclusion. Finally, the Midnight Rules Relief Act offers a solution that is not intrusive upon legitimate executive branch authority. An outgoing administration remains free to conduct necessary rulemaking activity up to the stroke of midnight on Inauguration Day. It then falls to Congress to respond swiftly and surgically to the results, to accept the good and excise the bad. This is truly a better way to govern. That is why the reform embodied in this bill is featured in Speaker RYAN’s Better Way agenda. I thank Mr. ISSAfor his work on this important legislation, and I urge all my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act. This sweeping measure would empower Congress to undo virtually every regulation submitted to Congress since May through to the end of this year. I repeat: this measure would empower Congress to undo virtually every regulation submitted to Congress since May through to the end of this year. The bill accomplishes this end by authorizing Congress to disapprove these rules through a single joint resolution, thereby depriving Members to consider the merits of each individual regulation. H.R. 5982 presents numerous concerns. To begin with, this bill would provide special interests with yet another opportunity to block critical, lifesaving regulations. Prior to submitting results to Congress, agencies typically take several years to ensure that rules are carefully vetted. As administrative law expert Washington University School of Law Professor Ron Levin has previously testified, much of modern rulemaking involves a ‘‘very detailed analysis of legal, factual, and policy issues, many of them highly technical. This work is better suited to the subject matter specialists in the respective agencies.’’ Faced with this complexity, H.R. 5982 would result in Congress predictably relying on industry input when presented with an upordown vote on a long list of complicated and often highly technical rules. David Goldston of the Natural Resources Defense Council has previously cautioned that similar measures would result in special interests descending on the Congress with even greater fervor than is currently the case. I am also concerned that H.R. 5982 is based on the fundamentally flawed premise that rules finalized during the final year of a President’s term are somehow rushed or improperly vetted. In fact, the nonpartisan Administrative Conference of the United States found in 2012 that ‘‘a dispassionate look at midnight rules issued by past administrations of both political parties reveals that most were under active consideration long before the November election.’’ The conference also reported that many of these rules involved purely routine matters initiated before the Presidential transition period or as the result of deadlines outside the agency’s control, such as yearend statutory or courtordered guidelines. Indeed, the socalled midnight rules may actually take longer to adopt than other rules. For example, Public Citizen reports that rules adopted during a Presidential transition period were typically proposed 3.6 years prior to their adoption, while other rules adopted in nontransition periods took only 2.8 years to complete. The Center for Progressive Reform has likewise observed that concerns surrounding midnight rulemaking are overstated, stating that ‘‘there simply is no reason to believe that a rule released at the end of an administration is worse than those that are released at any other point.’’ Perhaps this is because Congress already has the tools to vacate an unreasonable rule under current law known as the Congressional Review Act. Lastly, as with the many other antiregulatory bills we have considered 
in this Congress, this legislation completely ignores the benefits of regulation and is premised on the unsubstantiated belief that regulations undermine employment or economic growth. This is why H.R. 5982 is opposed by a broad coalition of organizations, including the AFL–CIO, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. As the administration correctly observes in connection with its veto threat to this bill—and there is one— H.R. 5982 would create tremendous regulatory uncertainty, potentially impose additional costs on businesses, and represent a step backwards for applying sound regulatory principles to protect public health, safety, the environment, and other critical aspects of society. Accordingly, I oppose—and hope that you will too—this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2016 is yet another unfounded and reckless attempt to prevent the implementation of critical laws by the Republican majority. H.R. 5982 would amend the Congressional Review Act to enable Congress to bundle numerous rules finalized during the final year of a President’s term into a single vote on a joint resolution of disapproval. Alarmingly, once these rules have been invalidated through this process, the agency may not adopt a subsequent similar rule absent express authorization by Congress. According to my Republican colleagues, the Obama administration’s regulatory agenda has eroded job growth and economic prosperity—far from it, however. Under President Obama’s leadership, we have seen the longest consecutive streak of private job creation, the fastest growth of middle class income ever, and more high quality and affordable health care for working Americans. Recently, the Census Bureau released new data indicating that in 2015 the median household income grew at the fastest rate on record, while the poverty rate fell at a faster rate than at any point since 1968. New data from the American Community Survey indicates that the number of uninsured Americans is declining in nearly every State. These metrics reflect a strong record of progress as Federal agencies implement laws like the DoddFrank Act and the Affordable Care Act. If anything, Mr. Chairman, we need new rules and better enforcement of existing law to ensure corporate accountability. In fact, it has only been months since the shocking revelations of Wells Fargo’s years of illegal banking practices have come to light. This sweeping display of corporate deception and hubris smacks of the very culture and lack of internal controls that gave rise to the mortgage crisis, collapsing the economy and employment. Indeed, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has cautioned, this scandal ought to be a moment where people stop and note, remember how dangerous the system is when you don’t have the proper protections in place. While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued its largest civil penalty ever—$100 million—in response to this scandal, this was a drop in the bucket compared to the bank’s $20 billion in profits last year or its chief executive’s $200 million stock compensation deal. What is more, not only did the bank deceive its own customers, Wells Fargo buried the scandal through forced arbitration clauses that shielded itself from liability and public accountability. This is simply unacceptable and drives home the point that there is still much work to be done to ensure fairness and accountability in the financial system, regardless of how many days may be left in the President’s term. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. b0930 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), the chairman of the Small Business Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. GOODLATTE has done an excellent job there, and we appreciate the work on this bill and many other things as well. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act, introduced by my friend and colleague from California (Mr. ISSA). Over the last 8 years, the Obama administration has gone, let’s face it, on a regulatory rampage. Each year, the administration’s major rules have cost over $100 billion—$100 billion. A disproportionate share of those enormous costs have fallen on America’s 28 million small businesses. As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I have heard firsthand from the owners and employees of these small businesses in our hearing room, and also back home in my district in Cincinnati, Ohio, how these new regulations have harmed them personally. And I want to emphasize that it doesn’t just hurt the owner of the small business, but all those folks who work for him. Sometimes that is two people, three people, five people, ten people. It affects them and their families, and generally it is very adversely. I think it is critical we realize that about 70 percent of the new jobs created in the American economy nowadays are created by these small businesses that, basically, have had these regulations that this administration has imposed on them. It is like a wet blanket over them and over this economy. So this particular legislation is absolutely critical. It is critical that we pass it. The last thing that these small businesses need right now is a flood of new regulations from the President’s army of bureaucrats as they beat a hasty retreat out of Washington. Outgoing Presidents oftentimes push through new regulations in the final days of their administrations to lock in as much of their agenda as possible. Let’s face it, on election day, that agenda was, for the most part, rejected. And to allow an administration to impose even more bureaucracy and more regulations on the small business community and on the American people is just something that we should not allow to happen. That is why this legislation has been introduced. These socalled midnight rules are thrown together hastily with little analysis or regard for the costs and burdens that they will impose on America’s entrepreneurs. Sadly, the administration has given every indication that they will be ramping up, not slowing down, the red tape dispenser over the next 9 weeks. This commonsense, bipartisan legislation will give Congress, the elected representatives of the American people after all, the power to stop all midnight rules with one vote. Next weekend, we will celebrate Small Business Saturday, an opportunity to celebrate small businesses, and recognize that they are a key to making our economy succeed. Midnight regulations are an imminent threat to their success. So let’s not spoil Small Business Saturday by having a whole bunch of new regulations, new red tape, new things that they have to deal with other than actually doing things which will make their business successful so that they can actually make a profit and hire more people. Let’s not allow the bureaucrats here in Washington to spoil that. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and send a clear message to our small businesses all across America that we have their back and regulatory relief is on the way. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5982, the socalled Midnight Rules Relief Act, which amends the Congressional Review Act. This bill would allow Congress to consider a joint resolution to simultaneously disapprove multiple regulations en bloc, all at once, when such rules are issued within the last 60 legislative days of a session of Congress in the final year of a President’s term. Now, that is legislative days. In this case, 60 legislative days 
would reach back until May of this year, almost 8 months before the end of the President’s term. To call the rules issued last spring a midnight rule is a curious use of the word. This bill puts in place an indiscriminate process to eliminate rules, many of which have been under consideration for years, even decades, to protect consumers, working people, and students. This bill denies Congress the opportunity for a careful casebycase review that the congressional review process now provides, and that process would be appropriate for reasoned decisionmaking by a legislative body. This bill would jettison rules without even considering the costs and benefits of whether the rule followed the least burdensome approach to achieve a goal under the law. Once a rule is rejected, the rule can never be taken up again in substantially similar form. So after a thoughtful review, we might decide that the unpleasant regulation was actually the better way to address a problem than any alternative, but by then it is too late. Mr. Chairman, under the Congressional Review Act, the Senate could pass its en bloc resolution of disapproval without even holding a hearing, and send it to the House for a vote on the floor without any form of consideration by the committee of jurisdiction. So we would end up just voting on a slogan or a sound bite without any opportunity for deliberative consideration. That is not a responsible way to legislate. There has always been criticism of a tendency of a significant number of rules and regulations to be issued following a Presidential election before the President leaves office, regardless of the party in control. However, the nonpartisan congressionally mandated Administrative Conference of the United States found that ‘‘a dispassionate look at midnight rules issued by past administrations of both political parties reveals that most were under active consideration long before the November election.’’ They go on to say that many of the rules involved routine matters or were required by law. For example, a final OSHA rule to prevent injuries caused by inadequate fall protection has been under development for over 26 years. The Administrative Conference called for Congress to put in place a 60 day waiting period for rules that are issued after a Presidential election so that the new incoming administration can review the rules. Now, that legislation is what we really ought to be considering, not the bill before us today. I think it is important to look at some of the rules that could be impacted under this bill: The Department of Labor issued a rule requiring Federal contractors to provide up to 7 days of paid sick leave annually for people working on Federal contracts. A forthcoming OSHA regulation, which has been under development for over 18 years, would protect workers from overexposure of beryllium. That is a substance that causes incurable lung disease often resulting in death by suffocation. That rule has been under consideration for 18 years and we are finally getting to the actual rule. The rule to implement the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order, which ensures that taxpayer dollars support those Federal contractors who comply with labor, civil rights, and workplace safety laws, not those who routinely and seriously violate such laws. The EEOC’s pay data rule, which helps eliminate pay disparities due to race, ethnicity, and gender. The Department of Education’s borrower’s defense rule, which helps protect student borrowers who were defrauded by their universities. The Department of Education’s forthcoming K–12 accountability rule, which provides clarity and ensures faithful implementation of the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act in order to graduate all students ready for success in college and career. The Department of Education’s forthcoming supplement not supplant rule, which ensures that Federal dollars actually supplement State and local education funds that target at risk youth. And, finally, another Health and Human Services’ Head Start rule, which improves quality and access for our Nation’s most vulnerable early learners. Each of these rules involves complex issues that cannot be discussed or properly addressed through the en bloc process where you have a bunch of regulations all in one bill. Now, if a rule needs to be challenged, the present law provides for a deliberative process to challenge the rule. Regrettably, H.R. 5982 is poised to allow the wholesale undermining of critical protections for students, workers, taxpayers, and consumers. I, therefore, urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the bill. Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD a Statement of Administration Policy in opposition to the rule. 
HR. 5982 MIDNIGHT RULES RELIEF ACT OF 2016 — 
REP. ISSA, R–CA, AND EIGHT COSPONSORS  The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in the most costeffective and efficient manner, and that they minimize uncertainty. When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and wellunderstood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act, in a manner that ensures that the rulemaking process is transparent and considers the input of stakeholders. In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties. These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations, consistent with their statutes, upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility. The Administration continues to be guided by the same rigorous practices and principles used to develop and review regulations that have been upheld throughout the entirety of this Administration and previous Administrations. On December 17, 2015, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reiterated that the Administration would maintain its normal review standards, and instructed agencies to plan and prioritize its regulations in order to ensure an orderly review process during the final year of the Administration. For these reasons, H.R. 5982 is intended to solve a problem that does not exist. Lastly, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) already allows for the Congress to disapprove of rules on a casebycase basis. Thus, providing for an arbitrary packaging of rules for an upordown vote, as this bill does, is unnecessary. In addition, the bill would expand the scope of rules subject to the CRA such that by the time a vote on a resolution occurs, some of the rules may have been in effect for over a year. By doing so, H.R. 5982 would create tremendous regulatory uncertainty, potentially impose additional costs on businesses, and represent a step backwards for applying sound regulatory principles to protect public health, safety, the environment, and other critical aspects of society. If the President were presented with H.R. 5982 his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ISSA), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Presidents from both parties have made a habit of midnight rules. And although here today we hear about 18 years of a deliberative process on beryllium, 18 years of consideration and it has to be passed in the last few days of a departing administration? What was the administration doing for 8 years? How deliberative can one be? The fact is these are not accidents. Midnight rules are, in fact, deliberately held to the end of an administration. That is the reason they are called midnight rules. Now, having said that, the bill today, H.R. 5982, is not, in fact, about midnight rules. We already have legislation to take care of that. What we don’t have is an effective way to do it when we are dealing with, perhaps, 100, 120, 150, and, if not checked, perhaps more, in times to come, midnight rules from an outgoing administration. We are talking today about the balance of power, about whether Congress should be efficient and effective in its ability to consider legislation. In this case, legislation done by the other branch, a branch not constitutionally allowed to do legislation. Let’s remember, regulations are, in fact, a loan to the executive branch to clarify legislation done by this body. If we believe that they do not fairly and appropriately interpret our legislation in their rulemaking, if we believe 
they exceeded the authority or the meaning of the legislation, whether passed just a few days ago, a few years ago, or, in fact, a century ago, we have an obligation to bring up, consider, and respond. In fact, rulemaking, as we know it, is, in fact, something that if the gentleman, my colleague on the other side of the aisle, wanted to, he could bring up the regulation as a law and consider it in this body at any time. I believe it is pretty clear that the objection in this case is an anticipated objection to the efficiency of being able to deal with one or two regulations at the end of a Presidency. We have an obligation to deal with all of them in a fair way. Now, one thing that was missed in this is nothing in this legislation requires that we take them all up at the same time. In the next Congress, it certainly would be appropriate for Members who wanted to have longer debate to ask for longer debate on the overall vote, or, in fact, to break it into pieces and ask for that. That is true in this body and it is true in the other body. As a matter of fact, the other body hasn’t even created rules yet and certainly could create rules that would define further debate on midnight rules. So I think today what we are really talking about is: Will Congress live up to its responsibility to the American people to, in fact, be the bastion of law creation, whether laws are created by this body directly or in the review of regulations created by an administration on behalf of this body? Ultimately, we own responsibility for laws and regulations, whether they work or don’t work. Lastly, this body has not done nearly enough to review regulations and their effect. During my tenure on another committee, over and over again I saw regulations by both administrations I have served under to create regulations that they said would cost little or nothing. By the time they come to pass, we discover they almost inevitably have a greater impact to our economy, adverse impact in many cases, than forecasted. That review is another area that we should do. But for today, this simple piece of legislation is only asking that Congress live up to its responsibility and do so in a way that would not tie up weeks or months of either body simply to decide that a regulation needs to be sent back for further review and, perhaps, reissued in a fashion more consistent with the laws created by this body and signed by previous Presidents. b0945 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I have no other requests for speakers, and I am prepared to close if the gentleman is likewise. Mr. GOODLATTE. Yes, I am prepared to close as well. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I have closing remarks that I would like to present at this time, and I yield myself the balance of my time. With just a few weeks remaining in this Congress, it is a disservice to the American people that we are now wasting our limited time and resources on this legislation. As many of my colleagues will recall, less than 4 months ago, the House passed comprehensive antiregulatory legislation that imposes a moratorium on socalled midnight rulemaking. So, clearly, the House has already acted to address the nonexistent problem of midnight rulemaking. In closing, I urge my colleagues to seriously join me in opposing H.R. 5982, a bill that is utterly unnecessary, anointed, and ill conceived. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. On election day, the American people delivered a resounding message to Washington: do not continue the Obama administration’s policies; stop the regulatory Big Government onslaught that has been killing our jobs, strangling recovery, and suffocating our futures. Passage of this bill is the way to say immediately: We have heard you loud and clear. The American people have said ‘‘no’’ to the continuance of the Obama administration’s policies. This bill guarantees that Congress can prevent any and all lastminute defiance of the people’s will by midnight regulations that stubbornly seek to entrench the last pieces of the administration’s partisan agenda. Those regulations come from a host of agencies. They include everything from overtime rules to greenhouse gas emission standards for heavyduty engines and vehicles and scores of other regulations in between, and they threaten to impose on our economy over $100 billion in new annual costs. It is not Obama administration bureaucrats who should tell the people what they must do in these areas, rushing costly political preferences out the door before the stroke of midnight. It is the incoming administration, working with Congress, that should determine the rules to govern the future and the regulatory rollbacks that will let freedom ring and Americans prosper. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which allows Congress to disapprove en bloc regulations from the Administrations submitted for review within 60 days of the end of a presidential term. Under current law, Congress can only use its authority under the Congressional Review Act to disapprove one regulation at a time. Presidential Administrations of both parties have issued bulk regulations as their term comes to an end. These midnight regulations are usually rushed and not properly vetted by federal agencies, often imposing high costs on taxpayers, threatening small businesses with new burdens, and frustrating American voters. Currently, Congress lacks the ability to check this type of regulatory overreach. H.R. 5982 ensures that rules are not rushed in order to achieve an outgoing partisan agenda without having the people’s representatives carefully review them. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. DOLD). All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5982 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2016’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed in part B of House Report 114–818. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . CONYERS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 114–818. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from H.R. 5982 the rules issued in response to an imminent threat to health, safety, or other emergencies. My amendment addresses one of the most problematic aspects of H.R. 5982 which would permit Congress to invalidate rules en bloc without proper consideration of any individual rule’s benefits and no matter how important or timesensitive such rule may be. Agencies often promulgate emergency rules in response to immediate threats to public health and safety. As the Congressional Review Act itself recognizes, such critical rules can go into effect immediately if the President so directs by executive order. H.R. 5982 would, however, empower a subsequent Congress and administration to override such determination and disapprove these rules. As a result of such disapproval, these regulations would be null and void, as if they had never taken effect. It is no secret that industry and special interests have strenuously opposed many lifesaving requirements that the Federal Government has imposed over the years, such as air quality standards, the mandatory installation of automobile airbags, and emergency exit lighting for passenger airplanes. Nevertheless, H.R. 5982 provides an open invitation for industry to have yet another bite of the apple by seeking to undo regulations in a new Congress and administration. For example, let us consider the Flint water crisis in my State, which was a preventable public health disaster. While much blame for the Flint water crisis lies with unelected officials who prioritized saving money over saving lives, the presence of lead in drinking water is not unique to Flint. In fact, the drinking water of potentially millions of Americans may be contaminated by lead. It is a continuing problem. Long before this crisis surfaced, the Environmental Protection Agency had been in the process of updating its Lead and Copper Rule, which was originally promulgated in 1991 after years of analysis. In fact, that agency is still in the process of finalizing this regulation. Yet, had this rule been submitted to Congress last month and gone into effect immediately pursuant to executive order, H.R. 5982 could be used by the incoming Congress and administration to invalidate this critical regulation. So, accordingly, I strongly urge my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, the Midnight Rules Relief Act leaves to each Congress, making use of its maximum flexibility, to fashion a midnight rule disapproval resolution. No one category of regulation is in; no one category of regulation is out. The question, instead, is: Which are the midnight rules, from whatever category, that fly in the face of the voters’ mandate or are otherwise abusive or infirm? No carveouts of any kind are needed, including for health, safety, and other emergency rules, because nothing is categorically carved in. Indeed, by carving out emergency rules, the amendment would only impede the ability of Congress to both respond swiftly and efficiently to abusive midnight rules and clear the path for the incoming administration to issue appropriate new rules to meet emergencies. I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I have no other requests, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . JOHNSON OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report 114–818. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple. It would exempt rules issued by an agency more than 3 years prior to their submission to Congress. This amendment is designed to confront the fundamentally flawed premise of H.R. 5982, namely, that rules submitted to Congress during the final 60 legislative days of a session are somehow less valid than rules submitted prior to that period. To set the record straight, this bill does not apply to rules submitted during the lameduck period following an election. Notwithstanding the bill’s colorful title, H.R. 5982 applies to every rule submitted to Congress within the final 60 legislative days of a session. As the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has clarified, this would include rules submitted as early as May 2016. Eight months should be adequate time for Congress to consider the merits of economically significant rules, which often take years to finalize. Indeed, according to the nonpartisan, congressionally established Administrative Conference of the United States, the ACUS, many of these rules adopted between an election and the inauguration of a new President involve ‘‘relatively routine matters not implicating new policy initiatives by incumbent administrations.’’ Public Citizen similarly found in a report issued earlier this year that rules adopted during the final months of an administration take 3.6 years on average to finalize. And that is just rules that are submitted to Congress during the final 3 months of a President’s term. Again, this bill applies to rules adopted during much of the final year of the President’s term, dramatically undercutting the bill’s stated purpose. So, despite the majority’s claims that the bill applies to midnight rules, this legislation would allow Congress to bundle numerous rules finalized during the final year of a President’s term into a single vote on a joint resolution of disapproval. In other words, Mr. Chairman, this bill is a solution to a nonexistent and undocumented problem. Alarmingly, once these rules have been invalidated through this process, the agency may not adopt a subsequent similar rule absent express authorization by Congress. I am also struck by the irony of the majority’s stated concerns with a lack of transparency and public scrutiny in the policymaking process. This bill has not been subject to a single hearing. In fact, it was introduced less than a week prior to its markup in committee. This legislation is symptomatic of a Republican majority more interested in focusing on coming up with the next great bill title or acronym than actually solving issues or helping the American people. 
b1000 Perhaps the majority should follow its own advice and proceed with regular order on new and controversial legislation. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, which is critical to ensuring that the rules that have already taken years to finalize to improve lives and protect people actually see the light of day. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This amendment encourages two of the worst features of Washington bureaucracy. First, it gives heeldragging, inefficient agencies a powerful incentive to take even longer to finalize rules proposed long ago to the public. This will only extend the regulatory uncertainty that hovers over job creators whenever new rules are proposed. Regulatory uncertainty freezes investment and job creation, and that is exactly what we do not need Washington to do. Second, the amendment gives agencies the incentive to cram even more rules into the abusive midnight rule period. We should be discouraging the use of midnight rules not encouraging it. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I would submit that we, on this side, are always interested in making the rulemaking process more efficient, and this is an important bipartisan concern. The trouble is when you get bills that are halfbaked and they are sprung on the minority and not even subjected to a full committee and the regular order that we would proceed through with legislation as important as this—it is sprung on us, and it ends up on the House floor as halfbaked as it was when it was introduced—this is no way to go about reform. I would just ask that this amendment be accepted. There is no doubt that this legislation is not going to go anywhere during this session of Congress, in terms of being signed into law. My pledge is that we would work together in the future to draft legislation that improves the rulemaking process, and not shut it down or gum it up. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. ISSA). Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I was rather surprised at my colleague from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). Since I am the author of the bill, I would say that for the 16 years I have been in Congress, I have been deliberating this piece of legislation, so it certainly is not new. In much more seriousness, to call this not regular order is simply inaccurate. This has been discussed in multiple hearings, and it went through regular order with a full committee markup. So I would hope that the gentleman would reevaluate his words and recognize that halfbaked would be inappropriate. This was fully vetted, and he had time for all the amendments we are hearing today at the time it was in committee. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 114–818. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me take a moment to acknowledge my ranking member and my chairman for I believe that this past session has generated an enormous amount of bipartisanship and cooperation. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for his leadership. I also thank Ranking Member CONYERS for the important leadership he has given to issues that we have warned about for a long time, and that is criminal justice reform. I say that in the backdrop of being enormously concerned about H.R. 5982, which is redundant since we have already passed midnight regulation legislation. The House did that earlier this year to establish a moratorium on midnight rules, rather than addressing critical issues, such as creating new opportunities for job growth and advancement, or fixing our Nation’s broken immigration system, providing relief from crushing student loan debt, and, yes, moving forward on criminal justice reform. We have legislation that now seems directed at President Obama before the election of last week and now, again, continuing to wish to do something that impacts, I think, personally and directly on the President of the United States, who happens to be President Barack Obama. Because otherwise there is no real basis for this legislation. I have amendment No. 3 that speaks to it and clearly specifically states why this is a problem. It provides a limited exception from the provisions of H.R. 5982 of any administrative regulation or rule promulgated to prevent or respond to matters of critical national security. Mr. Chairman, if enacted in its current form, this bill will severely hamper our Nation’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies or to address many other critical public policy matters related to public safety or national security. The American people should know this is an en bloc destruction of regulations that may save lives. It is to say: in your eye, Mr. President—and yes, whoever it may be—because it feigns itself to be bipartisan because it says ‘‘a President.’’ Well, obviously we know what President we are talking about right now. Probably next year, this will be completely eliminated. First of all, if it goes through now, it should be vetoed; and I am sure any other President would veto it. They have to have the opportunity and the responsibility, as their constitutional duties, to stand in the gap for the American people. This would severely hamper our Nation’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies or to address many other critical public policy matters. It would amend the congressional review to allow joint resolutions disapproving en bloc resolutions submitted to Congress for CRA review within 60 days of the end of the Presidential term. I don’t attribute to any President any malice just because their term is about to end. I hold up for you the west Texas fertilizer plant blast that killed 15. The blast was preventable, the safety board says. And our President, rightly so, in mourning the loss of these individuals—the bomb explosion, if you will, was around schools. Thank God it was at night and these children were not nearby because the schools were leveled—so the President issued executive orders dealing with this issue. I ask my colleagues to vote down this particular underlying bill and support my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. It carves out rules pertaining to critical matters of national security. As we know, with President Obama, Presidentelect Trump, and any other President, they have huge powers of executive authority when it comes to national security. 
So to exclude something under the guise that it would be national security would inherently undermine the intent of the rule. I always find it interesting that people internalize and personalize something. In this case, there is nothing better that this President could do for the American people—and perhaps for regulations that he would oppose in the future—than to sign this legislation. The fact is President Obama likely objects to many of the regulations that would come out of the new Trump administration. There is no better time than now to reassert or allow to be reasserted the power of a Congress, a Congress that might very well reject Presidentelect Trump’s legislation or regulations in the future. So the reality is, although the gentlewoman from Texas would have you believe that this was a personal attack on our President, it is not an attack on our President. It is not an attack on our next President. It is, in fact, a law that would allow Congress to reassert, in an efficient way, the authority which is constitutionally, inherently, and always ours. For decades, perhaps two centuries plus, we have yielded the power, the right, and the responsibility of this body in appropriations, in regulations, and even in spending of a number of areas in taxation to the executive branch. We can yield to the executive branch, but we cannot run away from our responsibility. A regulation—ten regulations, a hundred regulations, or a thousand regulations that are disapproved by the American people and, from them through us, needs to be dealt with in an efficient fashion. So do I disagree with this? Yes. Sadly, I disagree with the gentlewoman from Texas’ characterization of the nature of this legislation. This legislation does not expire a few weeks or months from now, and it is intended to go on. Lastly, to say we have already passed legislation in this Congress would imply that it was run through the Senate and signed by the President and, as a result, the reform is in place. No such thing is the case. I would offer the gentlewoman from Texas in the next Congress to work with her on such legislation as would be signed by the next President. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains, please. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 1 minute remaining, and the gentleman from California has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me indicate that the gentleman from California is a good friend. We have served on the Judiciary Committee for a period of time. I could not disagree with him more. Yes, a very poison pill bill passed out of the House, and it did not go any further, which I hope this one will not go any further as well. This bill is dangerous. It is a sweeping measure that would jeopardize the ability of the Federal Government to protect our Nation in times of urgent and imminent danger. Post9/11, in the world we now live in, the role of the government in protecting its people has never been more important. Specifically, my amendment ensures that the Federal Government is not further prohibited from responding to emergencies, such as the 2013 west Texas chemical explosion that killed 15 people and created a fireball that leveled nearly the entire town. This legislation wants to en bloc— not separate, analyze, or work with the administration—en bloc. Mr. Chair, what that means is to take the whole ball of wax—take the bag and wipe out regulations that may be helping to save lives and protect the American people. I have to disagree with, again, the gentleman from California. On Homeland Security, we deal with this all the time. On the Judiciary Committee, we deal with this all the time. I have to stand in the gap. We have to stand in the gap for the security of the American people. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment to protect the national security of this Nation. Thank you for this opportunity to briefly explain the Jackson Lee Amendment. Specifically, the Jackson Lee Amendment provides a limited exception from the provisions of H.R. 5982, the ‘‘Midnight Rules Relief Act,’’ of any administrative regulation or rule promulgated to prevent or respond to matters of critical national security. Mr. Chairman, if enacted in its current form, H.R. 5982, would severely hamper our nation’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies or to address many other critical public policy matters relating to public safety or national security. H.R. 5982 would amend the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to allow joint resolutions disapproving en bloc regulations submitted to Congress for CRA review within 60 days of the end of the presidential term. In particular, H.R. 5982 purports to address concerns associated with new regulations and rules that are issued as the clock of an outgoing presidential administration runs out— otherwise known as ‘‘midnight rules.’’ This is a sweeping and dangerous measure that would jeopardize the ability of the federal government to protect our nation in times of urgent and imminent need. In the postSeptember 11th world we now live in, the role of the government in protecting its people has never been more important.’’ It is important that the Administration at all times retains the authority to act in times of imminent need to protect citizens from national security emergencies. The Jackson Lee Amendment does just that. Specifically, my amendment ensures that the federal government is not further prohibited from responding to emergencies, such as the 2013 West, Texas chemical explosion that killed 15 people and created a fireball that leveled nearly the entire town. In response to this mass explosion, the President issued an Executive Order to necessary to improve the safety and security at chemical facility in West, Texas and across the nation. Recognizing the importance of responding to public health and safety emergencies, the Congressional Review Act specifically permits agencies to issue rules where the agency has good cause, such as responding to an emergency. However, as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has clarified, this exception is only available where an agency has not already undertaken regulatory action. An exception substantively similar to the Jackson Lee Amendment appears in H.R. 4361, another bill that would establish a moratorium on ‘‘midnight rules’’ that has already passed the House this Congress. We should include a similar exemption here to ensure that agencies retain the ability to effectively respond to urgent and pressing national security measures. Now is not the time to undermine or slow the ability of our regulatory agencies ability to address growing threats and active cases of public health crises. The Jackson Lee Amendment would ensure that any rule promulgated to prevent or respond to matters of national security would not be obstructed. Accordingly, I urge adoption of the Jackson Lee Amendment. 
[From CNN, Tue., April 22, 2014] WEST, TEXAS , FERTILIZER PLANT BLAST THAT KILLED 15 ‘‘P REVENTABLE ,’’ S AFETY BOARD  SAYS (By Eliott C. McLaughlin) The 2013 fertilizer plant blast that killed 15 people and wounded another 226 in West, Texas, ‘‘should never have occurred,’’ the chairman of the U.S. Chemical Safety Board said Tuesday. Though the board’s report says that at least 14 people were killed, the death toll was updated to 15 people in the days after the blast. The board’s investigation was released a few days after the first anniversary of the explosion, 
I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I have served in this body for almost exactly 16 years; and I have observed the extremely rare times that a resolution of disapproval comes to this body. So I think if we can set a tone for the remainder of the debate, the tone should be set in recognition that these resolutions are rare. And they never—I repeat, never in my 16 years—and the gentlewoman and I have served a similar time—never have I seen one that is as wellfounded as dealing with the safety of potentially explosives. Those kinds of regulations are routinely run through fairly quickly with congressional oversight and encouragement. So I think we have to set the tone and ask how many times—Ranking Member CONYERS has served longer than anyone in this room—how many times have we brought these up. The fact is, even under this en bloc, it will be a small portion of those regulations created in the last days of an outgoing administration. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. ISSA. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, my emotion, of course, deals with, as I think you know, many of the tragedies we have faced in the Nation. Here is my point: Your interpretation, I need to analyze all of that, and I have not to date. But I would say to you, there is always a first time. There is always the possibility. What we are trying to do is to make an exception if that happens to occur, and it might not. But we give that privilege so that the people can be protected. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas, and let us continue that tone. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed. b1015 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . CONNOLLY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 114–818. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I would ask that my colleague consider his two amendments en bloc if he would. I would be happy to yield to make sure time is sufficient. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has been recognized for 5 minutes. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. CONNOLLY. I have no objection to the request of the gentleman from California. Is it, from a parliamentary point of view, a possibility? The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would entertain a unanimous consent request from the proponent. PERMISSION TO CONSIDER AMENDMENT NOS . 4 
AND 5 OFFERED BY MR . CONNOLLY OF VIRGINIA  
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the two amendments pending, 4 and 5, be amalgamated into one for the purpose of debate on the floor instead of separate consideration. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia to consider amendment Nos. 4 and 5 en bloc? There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, I offer amendment Nos. 4 and 5 printed in part B of House Report 114–818. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendments. The text of the amendments is as follows: 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . CONNOLLY  
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . CONNOLLY  
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, it seems this Congress will close out the 114th session much the same as it opened. Then we considered H.R. 185, a repeat of the antipublic health, anti environment, antipublic safety legislation that was defeated in the 112th and 113th Congresses and which would come to characterize, unfortunately, this Congress. So I guess we shouldn’t be surprised that just before we adjourn, the House majority will offer one last retread of this social Darwinian philosophy. This latest iteration, the seductively titled Midnight Rules Relief Act, is nothing more than a retread, a backdoor attempt to roll back important steps to protect our constituents and our communities. My amendment would, at the very least, ensure we continue to take steps to mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate change already poses a real and growing threat to our children, our families, our national security, and our economy. Denying it exists doesn’t make it so. I can tell you in my native State of Virginia, we are seeing the effects of climate change in lowlying areas, including in and around our all important naval base in Norfolk. I know there are some who believe that the Clean Power Plan and similar rules which seek to curb climate change will crush the economy, but I will point out we have to listen to rhetoric all the time about jobkilling regulations in the environment. The fact of the matter is Clean Air Act amendments and related amendments to protect our air and our water have, in fact, created jobs and, with respect to power rates, have, in fact, lowered power rates in large parts of the country, including my own in Virginia. Turning my attention, Mr. Chairman, to the second amendment amalgamated, this bill once again amends the Congressional Review Act to allow a joint resolution disapproving en bloc regulations. The title of the bill leads one to believe that the period of coverage spans the waning hours of a Presidency when, in fact, according to the nonpartisan CRS, 60 legislative days takes us back to May of 2016, before we even confirmed our final Presidential candidates. The Congressional Review Act already permits Congress to disapprove of regulations. This bill is nothing more than a partisan attempt to prevent the implementation of critical laws by our Federal Government to delegitimize President Obama’s final months in office. I think it is unwise. I think it is imprudent. I think just like leaving a vacancy on the Supreme Court for an entire year on the dubious theory that a President in his last year of office ought to be somehow a lameduck in every respect as if he had not legitimately been elected by the people of this country is certainly, I think, false logic, false constitutional logic, and dangerous to the functioning of a republic. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, on this en bloc pair of amendments, I have two very different reasons for objecting. In the case of the portion that is the Director of Office of Management and Budget, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) and I spent an amazing 
amount of time over the years looking at times in which OMB makes an estimate and then the reality is dramatically different. So to carve out based on the Office of Management and Budget, which is a Cabinetlevel, partisan appointment of the President, would have one believe that it is perfect. The reality is not only is it not perfect, but its track record tends to be very selfserving. Just the amount of times in which CBO scores very differently would cause all of us to know that this is not a good enough reason for a carveout. Having said that, I look forward to working with the gentleman from Virginia on both CBO and OMB scoring reform in the next Congress because I think we have a long way to go to get numbers right. If we get numbers right on both regulations and proposed laws, we can all do a better job. In the case of the second portion of these two, I have to say that climate change has been unfairly made a political issue. The world is getting warmer; we know that. How much of it is caused by various things, we need to know, and I would hope that regulations would not be a source of that. But this President has, by many of his own statements, taken great credit for his use of a pen and a phone to make decisions related to his view of a single cause of climate change, that being carbon. The fact is I look forward to working with any President on sensible regulations, but those regulations have to be consistent with the laws passed and the regulatory options given to the other branch. It is for that reason that we have the ability to disapprove. So again, I would hope we all not look at specific regulations that may or may not be contested by the next Congress and, instead, look more appropriately at should we have the efficiency to consider maybe 20, maybe 10, maybe only 4 en bloc, all as one, or maybe in two separate. The reality is efficiency of the process of disapproval does not for a moment change the responsibility and authority of this body. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time remains on my side. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I take my friend from California’s point about data. Let’s look at OMB’s latest report to Congress on Federal regulation which found that the monetized benefits of Federal regulations over the past decade are significantly higher, by a 10 to 1 margin, than their cost. That is their report. It is an inconvenient fact, but there it is. I will finally end, Mr. Chairman, because I want to be respectful of my friend’s intent here in trying to amalgamate these two amendments. I am sorry, this is another bill in the long process of trying to delegitimize President Obama’s Presidency, and it, to me, is a shameful episode where some of my friends on the other side of the aisle—not necessarily Mr. ISSA— have attempted to basically nullify his ability to function as President, and therefore he has had to rely on executive powers in the absence of legislative action and thwarting. I think the most egregious one besides this bill is, of course, leaving a vacancy open on the Supreme Court under the very dubious logic that somehow he is not entitled in the last year. That logic leads every single Member of Congress basically to not do anything in the second year here in the House because the same logic would pertain to them. They are lameducks until they are reelected or until the will of the people is heard in the next election cycle. That is, to me, foolish logic, dangerous logic, and I think it will put a cloud over the next President’s tenure. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. ISSA. I won’t use it all. I thank the chairman, and I thank my colleague from Virginia. Let me take a moment to reflect, perhaps, on something that my colleague and friend said. During my tenure with Mr. CONNOLLY , our committee sent 23 pieces of legislation to the President that he signed; we sent 74 to the other body. So if there is an enemy, perhaps it is the great bipartisan legislation that left the House and never got to the President. The President signed all 23 pieces of legislation, though, that got through the Senate, including legislation that Mr. CONNOLLY and I worked on together. Since my leaving that committee, additional legislation has come through that committee on a bipartisan basis, including a huge expansion of the Freedom of Information Act. I would hope that in these last days, we would reflect on the successes of this Congress and the successes of our outgoing President because, in fact, for all that we all do in the performance of our oversight role, we also have had fine and notable successes and good legislation under this President; and I would like to take this moment to take note that, in fact, the President has signed the vast majority of legislation that left here on a bipartisan basis, including a piece of legislation that Mr. CONNOLLY was critical on. I yield to the gentleman if he has any further comment. Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank my friend for yielding. I am struck by a humorous observation when he talks about what happened in the other body to a lot of legislation. I believe it may have been Sam Rayburn who said, as a Democratic Speaker, the Republicans are in the opposition but the Senate is the enemy. Mr. Chairman, I, of course, meant no disrespect. I was simply quoting a former Speaker of this body. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Virginia will be postponed. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. VALADAO ) having assumed the chair, Mr. DOLD, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5982) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide for en bloc consideration in resolutions of disapproval for ‘‘midnight rules’’, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
b1050 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa) at 10 o’clock and 50 minutes a.m.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 3 p.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. 
REMEMBERING THE HONORABLE MEL LAIRD (Mr. DUFFY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart and offer condolences for the passing of former Secretary of Defense Mel Laird who served under Richard Nixon. Secretary Laird was well known, among many things, 
for the drawdown of troops in Vietnam and, to the delight of many, he suspended the military draft. But for us in Wisconsin, Mel Laird was our Congressman, a young man who was elected at 30 years old and served from 1953 to 1969 until he went to the Secretary of Defense position. When I was running for Congress in the late spring, my phone rang, and on the other end this guy says: Hello, Mel Laird here. Could I speak with SEAN DUFFY ? Well, Mel Laird is larger than life in Wisconsin, a guy from Marshfield. I nearly dropped the phone to think that the great Mel Laird would give me a call. He knew everyone and every issue in Wisconsin at the ripe old age of 90. He passed away yesterday. With a heavy heart, we mourn his passing. I would just like to say, he was a man that President Ford said was the can do conservative from Wisconsin. He was a patriot more than a partisan, so much so that he was the mentor of Colin Powell. And to the friends he had on both sides of the aisle, they would be tickled to know that Hillary Clinton once interned for him. In true Wisconsin fashion, when I won the seat that he had formerly held, he sent me a Wisconsin block of cheddar cheese. So, today, with a heavy heart, I want to extend my condolences to the family of Mel Laird, thank him and his family for his service, and may his soul rest in peace. 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF TOM WEISNER (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Tom Weisner, the mayor of Aurora, Illinois. He served as the mayor for a decade, and for many years before that as a dedicated public servant and a friend to our district and our community. Before he entered public service, Tom and his wife, Marilyn, served as Peace Corps volunteers. Since then, Tom has served the city with passion, commitment, competence, and dedication. Public service is more than just a job to him; it is a calling. He cares for others in his community like an extended family, and Aurora is a better place because of it. Whether it is the safety of rail cars passing through the city or concerns about gun violence, Tom speaks from the heart about issues that matter to our community and to our country. He does this because, to him, our community is his family. Unfortunately, in the face of his longstanding battle with cancer, Mayor Tom Weisner stepped down at the end of last month. We will all miss his leadership and dedication to our community and wish him well. CONGRATULATIONS TO NORTHWEST ADVANCED RENEWABLES ALLIANCE (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance for their efforts to use the world’s first renewable jet fuel made from timber harvest residuals on a commercial flight from Seattle to Washington, D.C., this last Monday, November 14. NARA is a diverse coalition consisting of Washington State University, University of Washington, Alaska Airlines, Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, the U.S. Forest Service, and many other partners. Their goal was to create a sustainable aviation biofuel, increase bioenergy literacy, and advance rural economic development. This achievement of fueling a cross country flight entirely on wood products is a great testament to the cooperation, innovation, and hard work of the NARA members. Moreover, it demonstrates the forwardthinking commitment to an alloftheabove energy strategy that the Pacific Northwest is renowned for. Again, congratulations to NARA and their members on this amazing achievement. f 
AMERICAN FOOD FOR AMERICAN SCHOOLS (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, is there anybody among us here who does not believe our children ought to have nutritious, safe food in the schools, in the school nutrition program? I think we all do. However, you may not know that back home in your school districts that your school is using your taxpayer money to buy food grown in China or someplace else in the world. Is it safe? Maybe yes. Maybe no. You don’t know. We are going to introduce a bill here, and I would seek the support of all the Members here. We call it American Food for American Schools. Why not? Why not American food in the school nutrition programs, the lunch programs? In our own area in Sacramento, California, the school district there decided they ought to buy Chinese peaches, yet the biggest peachgrowing place in all the United States is the Sacramento region. Let’s do that. Let’s make sure that our students have nutritious, safe, Americangrown food. So American Food for American Schools. Seek your attention to this; seek your support on this. I am quite sure the American public and parents and students would say: yeah, right on. 
NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate hospitals in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District for being recognized by the National Organization of State Offices of Rural Health. This year, 32 hospitals in Pennsylvania reached top quartile performance status in quality, outcomes, patient satisfaction, and financial strength compared to all acute care hospitals in the nation. Now, I am proud to represent seven of these outstanding health facilities, including Kane Community Hospital, Lock Haven Hospital, Corry Memorial Hospital, Penn Highlands DuBois, Warren General Hospital, and UPMC Northwest. In light of these and the many other tremendous accomplishments that have been achieved in rural health care this year, I am honored to join with key stakeholders across the United States to celebrate National Rural Health Day. It is no secret that healthcare providers in underserved areas play a vital role in maintaining and safeguarding the health of millions of Americans. Due to my previous experience as a healthcare provider, I have nothing but the deepest respect and admiration for those who work to enhance the quality of healthcare services in rural communities. Congratulations again to the rural healthcare providers in Pennsylvania for their tremendous work. Thank you for your service. f 
I STAND WITH THE STANDING ROCK SIOUX (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to stand with the Standing Rock Sioux in peace and prayer to halt the desecration of their sacred sites and clean water source. This month, an independent review concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ original assessment of the pipeline underestimated the risk of a spill exposing tribal lands to grave risk. Just this week, the Corps announced they will delay an easement for construction of the pipeline on Corps land under and around Lake Oahe until they conduct further environmental reviews with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Further study and a possible reroute of the pipeline is a welcomed idea. But construction continues, and there has been no final decision that could conclusively halt the pipeline and protect tribal sacred sites. This could be devastating. The government must take action to uphold our Federal trust responsibility to protect tribal treaties, land, and resources. They must meaningfully consult with the Standing Rock Sioux and all tribes before developing on or near 
tribal land. They must rescind their permit that was issued without full understanding of potential risk and must stop construction. 
NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, Saturday is National Adoption Day. It is an annual celebration of the thousands of new adoptions that take place every year. It is also an opportunity to raise awareness of the thousands of children who are still in foster care in need of permanent homes. Since National Adoption Day was started 16 years ago, several children advocacy groups, including the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, have worked with foster care agencies and courts in all 50 States to finalize more than 40,000 adoptions to take place on that day. This is amazing work that helps bring wonderful additions to selfless, committed families. It is great to see so many children finding new beginnings through adoption, but it is also important to remember those who are still in need of permanent homes. There are more than 100,000 children who are waiting for an adoptive family in foster care, and, on average, they wait nearly 3 years to be adopted. Every child deserves to grow up in a loving family and a safe and open hearted home. Mr. Speaker, adoption is a joyous occasion for thousands of children and families, and National Adoption Day is a reminder of how to create more of these powerful lifechanging experiences. 
b1215 TIME TO LOOK AHEAD The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CURBELO of Florida). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a pleasure to be in this somewhat hallowed Hall. The election is behind us. It is time to look ahead. But as everyone who studies history knows, those who fail to learn from history are destined to repeat it. And so we go. We continue too often to repeat the mistakes of the past, but it looks like the American people wanted a change— quite a change—and I know there are calls that we get rid of the electoral college, but when one looks at the map of the United States districtbydistrict within the States that voted for the different parties, candidates, one sees very clearly that you have the big cities that were voting Democrat and the 90 percent or so of the rest of the country voted Republican. It really is amazing to see just how distinctive that has become. South Texas is not highly populated, but is blue. Otherwise, most of the country that voted Democrat is just large cities, many of which are failing, many of which have become sanctuary cities, many of which have high crime rates. So I was a bit encouraged to continue to hear statements made by Presidentelect Trump. There is an article today—with regard to the government, that is—from The Washington Examiner by Paul Bedard: ‘‘$42 billion in Obama regulations are on Trump’s chopping block. Nearly 50 massive and costly regulations that cost Americans and businesses 53 million more hours filing paperwork and that have already put a $42 billion hit on the U.S. economy are being teed up for Presidentelect Trump to cut in his first weeks in office.’’ And you go through and you look and top on the list are Head Start performance standards. Really, education was doing pretty well in my home State. Back before President Carter created the Department of Education, between 70 and 75 percent of all employees in the education system in Texas were teachers; but when you create this big bureaucracy called the Department of Education, it means for every cubicle we put here in Washington, D.C., just down the street here at the Department of Education, every State has to hire additional people to work in cubicles. But some States are more generous than others. Some have very nice offices. But then, for every bureaucrat you put in a State capital office that is going to respond to the bureaucrats in the Department of Education here, you have to have additional clerical help, administrative help in each individual school district. That is people that could be helping our children. That is people that could be making students brighter than any other students. But what are they doing? They are filling out mountains of paperwork to send to the State capital so they can fill out mountains of paperwork and send it to the Department of Education. To see that just one item within the Department of Education could cut $42 billion in Obama regulations is incredible. At a time when we have skyrocketed over the last 7plus years from $11 billion in debt to $20 billion in debt, it is just incredible. Incredible. Yet, there is so much we are costing America. I am excited about the coming year because the kind of things that are listed here is just government overregulation; government bureaucrats from here overregulating. I know most people are proud when they set new all time records, which this administration did in new regulations for the years with regard to pages of regulations. I think it seems like the Bush administration may have hit 74,000 pages or so one year, but that didn’t create a problem for the Obama administration. They have blown right past 74,000 pages of regulations. How is anyone in business in the United States supposed to stay in business if they have to go through 74,000 pages of new regulations in addition to the old regulations that may still be in effect? It is incredible. Like the Heritage Foundation has pointed out, more persons are committing three or four Federal crimes every day because we don’t know what all the regulations are. I am very encouraged as we go into the new year that one of the things we want to accomplish—and Chairman GOODLATTE in the Judiciary Committee has it on his list of things to get done— is really address the overcriminalization that has occurred over all these years. You slap a prison sentence on some vague crime or on some vague statute that says it is a crime if you violate any of the laws or regulations, and then bureaucrats sit around and dream up things that annoy them, and all of a sudden somebody can be going to prison for things none of us knew were crimes. One guy did know that a substance he was sending through the mail, since he was a scientist, required ground only. So he checked the box ‘‘ground only.’’ He didn’t know that some bureaucrat had passed or created a regulation that said not only do you check the box, you have to put a little ticker with an airplane with a red line through it. And if you don’t do that, you get arrested, drug to Alaska, where he was sending it—he didn’t even live there, didn’t have friends—and held up there for 18 months or so, I think. It is incredible. We have got to do right by the American people. I have been blessed to be able to travel all over the country in the past year or so. And everywhere I go, it just seems like the economy is ready to take off. If we can just get this massive, oppressive bureaucracy in Washington off of the neck of the economy, people will start having jobs again. I know some people are worried about the wall or fence, but as you see people out of work—some of them being paid, apparently, to riot or picket, the things they do. I remember one picketer out here on The Mall back during the shutdown said he was getting $15 an hour from Democratic sources to picket out there at the World War II Monument. Some of them get paid. Maybe that is all the work they can find. Well, how great would it be to take that picket sign out of their hand and say: My friend, we have productive work for you. You can help your country, you can help yourself by cutting down on potential terrorism coming across other southern border, by cutting down on people coming into the country illegally and getting welfare, food stamps, all these benefits that 
other Americans will have to pay for those who are here illegally. You can take this trowel, take this mortar, and go over to that brick pile by our border and just start helping us build the wall. We will pay you to do that. I don’t know, if they get $15 an hour to come picket in Washington, they may want $16 or $17 to help build the wall or the fence down on our border, but we have certainly got plenty of people that can work, because you see them in the streets all over the country. They have come out of their safe spaces where their feelings were hurt because things didn’t go like they wanted and nobody has told them, as my late mother, brilliant as she was, used to say: Well, nothing is fair, and the quicker you get used to it, the better off you will be. I would contend—and she would roll her eyes—yeah, but we can take care of our own little part to make it more fair. And that is what we are supposed to do. If things are not fair, then you get involved in government and you try to fix it. That is why I came to Washington. I saw that things weren’t fair up here, that the Federal Government was luring people away from their Godgiven potential. I kept having young women come before me as a felony judge in Texas for welfare fraud. And the cases were nearly identical. They pour out their hearts, lay out their situation. They were bored with high school and somebody said: Well, the Federal Government will send you a check if you just drop out and have a baby. Then they find out after they have the child: I can’t really live on this little bit. This is not enough to live on. So they have another child and another child. These are just the ones that came to my court, but I would imagine that there are other situations just like this all over the country. When I was teaching a joint sociology class at a predominantly African American school back in Tyler, Texas—a great school that has done so much good for so many—Texas College—but there were women there probably in their late twenties, and when we started talking about this, I was blown away with the intellectual level of these women and their commitment that we have to fix our Federal system that is destroying people and their potential. One lady in her older twenties, God bless her, she came back. She decided: I have had kids. I have been in debt. I am going to improve myself. I mean, that is the American Dream. That is what we hope for. She said, You have got to put that work requirement in and you have got to make it more forceful. Another lady said: You have got to put drug tests on there. Man, I was spending my money I was getting from the government not so much for my kid, but for my drugs. You need to have a drug test. Don’t just give people money like that. You are ruining them. I am hearing people across the country that have figured out this massive welfare state that was created with the best of intentions in the midsixties has done more to pull people away from their Godgiven potential and put them into ruts or ditches from which they couldn’t get out of. Yet, that is not supposed to ever be the role of government, whether you look to Biblical scripture, like I do. In Romans 13, the government is supposed to be an encourager of good conduct, help people, encourage them, direct them to reach their potential. Don’t lure them away from their potential and make them beholden to this big master government. Encourage them. We need a safety net here and there, but encourage them. The sky is the limit and get out of the way. Like Edison said, I didn’t fail however many hundreds of thousands of times. I tried to find the filament that would make a light bulb work. He didn’t fail all those times. He just found that many ways that would not work in a light bulb, then he found the one that would. You encourage people to try. Failure shouldn’t necessarily be a trophy, but it ought to get a slap on the back, Come on, you can keep going. You can do it. b1230 The government should not lure people away from trying. It was never intended to be anything but a safety net so you could rebound and get back on your feet. Instead, we take people off their feet and lead them away from being productive in the country for themselves. I have mentioned this before, but I, as a freshman here in Congress, 12 years ago, went to a conference at Harvard. One of the speakers, the dean there—I was surprised, dean at Harvard Business School—had these charts, and he showed single mothers’ income in the United States, when adjusted for inflation, from the creation of welfare until welfare reform, from the midsixties to midnineties when Newt Gingrich and Republicans took the Congress in January 1995, did welfare reform. I know President Clinton now takes credit for it, but he vetoed it. It wasn’t until they had enough votes, basically, to override his veto that they finally got him on board, and now he likes to take credit for it. It was the Republicans that drove them there. He likes to take credit for the balanced budget. He vetoed numerous things that would have made it balance, and once they had the votes that would override his veto, he would sign them, and we got to a balanced budget back in the late nineties. But that is what we are going to have to do come January, and we can’t give away the farm when we come back. I am encouraged today to hear our Speaker and leader talking about what we are going to be doing. And wow, isn’t it wonderful that now that Donald Trump is the Presidentelect, Republican leadership is now saying: You know what we are going to do is we need to take care of the military so we don’t suffer there any more than we already have for 8 years. But maybe get that done for the rest of the year and then, basically, have a continuing resolution that gets us out maybe to March so that we can come in with the Congress the people of the United States have said they now want making the decisions. That makes sense. They have spoken: Let’s let that Congress make the big calls then with the new President when he comes in in January. What is so great about that is some of us were talking about that back in September, and then we were told no, no; we have got to do it for the whole year, and we are going to have to add this and that. We can’t just go to March because that will destroy the military. We have got to do everything for the whole year. A new President is elected named Trump, and all of a sudden, hey, let’s just go to March. Sounds great to me. That sounds like a good idea. I would have been willing to do that in September as we were talking about then. It wasn’t acceptable then. I am glad it is acceptable now for a new Congress. And when we talk about problems in the United States, our military has been deflated back to a preWorld War II position. We were not a superpower after World War I. We weren’t the main defender of truth, justice, freedom. But as you travel around the world, like I have mentioned, in Africa, where Africans were saying, you know: We were so excited when you elected your first Black President, but since he has been in office, we have seen America get weaker and weaker. And you have got to go back to Washington and tell those people there to stop getting weaker. This was a group of African Christians. They said, you know: We all know where we are going when we die, but our only chance for peace in this life is if America is strong. Now, the world, so many countries like to deride us and take verbal shots. Some take other kinds of shots. But some like to fly planes closely, mocking our ships, and I am looking forward to that happening under President Trump. I suspect if it happens, it probably won’t happen more than once, and they will learn not to mess with us. So it will be nice to have a reputation: You are not going to continue to bully the world. While this administration likes to talk about bullies in elementary school and send—they like to see little kids who were bullies in elementary school arrested, threatened. Well, I was a little bitty kid, and one of my best friends from elementary school was here yesterday. We were talking about old times. He and I were the same little bitty runt size, so we got picked on a lot. But we didn’t want anybody to come get arrested, and we figured out ways that we made sure the biggest bully never bothered us again. 
But to give an elementary school kid an arrest, drag them in for being a bully? I mean, kids have to grow up, and that is why we are called adults. We are supposed to have learned and supposed to understand kids will be kids. Foolishness can be found in the heart of a child. But some say maybe Proverbs is encouraging a crime when it says: but the rod can drive it far from them. Nobody wants a child to be abused, but I know most of my friends in school, we got paddled at one time or another. I had friends I played football with, whether it was freshman year, junior varsity, or varsity, that if they had not been paddled, I had no doubt they were headed for prison. But they had coaches that cared about them. They didn’t just want to win as coaches. They wanted these kids to be good adults, so they used discipline. We had some troubled folks after high school, but the coaches saved a lot of kids by caring. I mentioned before that I had some coaches that I loved, and they are more like friends, even though they were adults. My favorite year, my favorite coach was Willie Williams. It was interesting, you know. Conservatives are called bigots all the time. First time I mentioned that here in Washington, that my favorite high school coach was—happened to be Black, and I never noticed any racial problems on that team because he was rough on all of us. He was a very smart man, too, good coach. I love Coach Williams, and it was my great honor to be invited back to my hometown a couple of weeks ago when Mount Pleasant was playing Greenville. Greenville is a lot bigger city. Mount Pleasant had won two games. Coach Williams is now retired, but I was told Coach Williams was up in the press box, that he did some of the calling color for the games. There were so many thrills there, getting to know the kids and being with the team on the sideline and rejoicing at good plays. But they won. Apparently, it was the best game they played. Those kids have a lot of potential they didn’t realize, but they gave me the game ball. Just so many things that thrilled me there, my hometown where I grew up, Mount Pleasant, but nothing more than when I got to hug Coach Williams up there at the press box. That was special. Although he is substantially older now and gray—and, fortunately, his memory has not waned at all—Coach Williams remarked: You had a great team, but it wasn’t because you had good talent—that’s how I know his memory had not failed him—but you guys played so well together. You gave it everything. You played well together, and that is how you were a winning team. I really had hopes that that is what would happen. I didn’t support Barack Obama for President, but I really had hopes that we would be brought together as never before, just the way Coach Williams brought us together on that football team. I thought it was rather ironic, one of the liberal press immediately did a story on my favorite basketball coach in high school. Apparently, they figured, since they are liberal, well, he is Black, so I guess Blacks are only good at basketball, so he must have been his basketball coach. He was my football coach, JV football coach before I went to varsity the next year. But, ironic, who is the more bigoted, I wonder. But, nonetheless, it wasn’t like our team under Coach Williams. We have become a very divided country. In this article from FOX News, Dakota Wood, just this week, points out our military is no longer large enough, strong enough, or modern enough to keep America safe, and that is why China is making moves in the South Sea. It is why Russia is rattling sabers and looking around them if they should possibly move before a more authoritative President, a more decisive President like Presidentelect Trump, comes into office. So I think the world is scared for the next couple of months. Are these countries like Iran, Russia, China, are they going to try to make a move in the next 2 months because they know this President may send some rockets or something, may send a SEAL team, but they are not going to really be finaltype activities to really send a message. So we will see. Hopefully, the threat of President Trump coming in January will be sufficient to keep Iran from trying to make a move on Mecca, Russia from trying to make a move on Georgia, Ukraine, Crimea— Crimea being part of Ukraine, of course, should be—but remains to be seen. And then after all of the trauma that has been created by—I just can’t call it the Affordable Care Act because it is so costly. But the President was proud that it was called ObamaCare initially, and so that is a better term. People know what it means immediately, know what we are talking about. But this article from the Washington Free Beacon, Ali Meyer, says onethird of adults went without health care due to expensive costs. We were doing so much better. Most of the people I hear from in my district, over 700,000 people, were doing a lot better under—before ObamaCare kicked in. They are not going to be able to afford health care next year. That was one of the reasons that 90 percent of the geographical U.S. voted to change parties as President because they have seen the suffering they have had because their health care has suffered. This article says onethird of adults in the U.S. went without recommended health care due to expensive costs, according to a Commonwealth Fund survey. The survey actually was conducted in 11 countries—the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom—and this was all within this year, from March to June of this year, and that is what we find. A third of Americans, now that we have been under ObamaCare for 6 years, have really felt the pinch, and some have felt it to their demise or detriment. Another article from Elizabeth Harrington, ObamaCare premiums are to increase 27 percent. It points out that a new study obtained by the Washington Free Beacon shows premium increases under ObamaCare will actually be higher than the Federal Government’s projections, and it points out they will increase by 27 percent, according to the American Action Forum. b1245 It points out that the Department of Health and Human Services announced last month that premiums would increase an average of 22 percent in 2017. But premiums will actually increase as much as 145 percent in some States. ‘‘The American Action Forum found that the average increase is likely to be higher than predicted because the agency did not factor in that nearly half of ObamaCare plans no longer exist, forcing enrollees to switch to costlier plans,’’ if they have them at all. Then we have this from Lana Shadwick: ‘‘DHS Sued for Ignoring Environmental Effects of Mass Immigration.’’ There is so much damage that has come from our border not being secured. I heard one of my friends across the aisle say just this week in the press that our southern border is secure and that Mr. Trump should come down and see it. Mr. Trump has come down and seen it, and I have been down there many times. To be on the border as I was just in the last month, recent months, out there on the Rio Grande, it is pretty wide, and yet that is still where so many thousands and thousands and thousands cross. At 2, 3 in the morning, we were on a Texas Department of Public Safety boat because Texas, though they are not authorized by the Supreme Court to defend our borders, they are authorized under the Texas Constitution and required to protect our State. They spent millions of dollars. They have these fantastic boats. We had night vision on the boat. They have thermotechnology. They could see where people were hiding and what they were hiding behind. They have other technology. When they would see people, they would radio it to the Border Patrol. There were agents on the U.S. side along the riverbank, and we reported some in. We went down, turned off the engine and sat there for an hour or so. Finally, the U.S. Border Patrol asked if we would go back to the dock because those people that we had been watching, they were watching with their technology, and they weren’t going to move. They knew our boats were there somewhere in the area, and so our boat went back. 
I thought that meant they were saying they know you are in the area so they are not going to make a move. We can’t catch them redhanded until you make a move. I thought that meant they would interdict and protect the homeland. No. Homeland security doesn’t protect the homeland. No. What they were saying is: We want you to get out of the way because there are people—oh, and then there were some we could see were clearly carrying stuff that was probably drugs. There were only two or three in those groups of people who were carrying drugs. There were 17 or 18 groups like that would be wanting to come across, and it didn’t look like they were carrying anything, maybe they had a raft. So it turned out we leave, and we get radio transmission from Border Patrol: Okay, all of those folks who you had spotted, they have now all come across when you left the area, and we have got all of those in the big groups. But we didn’t get those who were probably bringing in drugs, but we put somebody out at an intersection. They are going to watch for them. These people are not stupid. They knew the intersection they put them in. They weren’t going through that intersection. If I had had any idea that our boat leaving that area of the river, the Rio Grande, was going to cause President Obama’s Border Patrol to not protect our homeland but to keep welcoming drug dealers, massive drugs, and lots of folks we don’t know what diseases they have—we don’t know if there were any terrorists in there. We don’t really know who they are. They don’t carry proper identification. I have seen that time and time and time again on our border in the middle of the night. They are not carrying. I watched two guys. They looked at their own little xeroxed piece of paper they use for identification, and if they didn’t like it, they switched. What kind of identification is that? It is a little piece of paper, it had some English on it, and they switched. They didn’t like the identity they were bringing in. We don’t know who these people were. So it will be nice come next year to know that our Border Patrol—and they are frustrated, I know. Most of them really have wanted to do their jobs. I hear from them. They are so tired of watching their homeland be assaulted. It just goes on and on, a wave every night, and we are not protecting our homeland. We are supposed to protect this place against all enemies foreign and domestic. Some of those folks aren’t enemies. They want to come in for jobs. Some want to come in for welfare. Some want to come in for food stamps. Some want to come in, but they have made commitments through the drug cartels that pay the coyotes to bring them across. I have been out there at night when they have said: Well, no, I didn’t have $7,000, but they are going to let me work it off in the city I am going to. How do they work it off in those cities for the drug cartels? They help them spread poison to American young people. They are bringing poison into our country. They come in with good motivation—wanting jobs, wanting a better life. Yet we have allowed such a massive insurgence into this country. We need to take some kind of pause and kind of figure out who in the world is in this country. We know from FBI Director Comey—such as his testimony is worth—that there are terrorist cells in every State, and that they are investigating every State. So we need to figure out who all have we let in here. In the last 8 years—and, yes, it was going on during the Bush administration, but nothing like it has just amassed in the last 8 years. We have to figure out who is here. Even this administration had no idea who they have let in. Then when you see the article that indicates that the number of those wrongly given citizenship is much higher than initially reported—and this is from Jake Tapper with CNN— that the number of individuals who were supposed to have been deported but instead were granted citizenship is far higher than was initially reported by the media covering homeland security. This is from September: ‘‘On Monday, the Inspector General reported that 858 individuals from ‘special interest countries’—meaning countries that are considered to be ‘of concern to the national security of the United States’—were supposed to have been deported but were instead granted U.S. citizenship. ‘‘But the truth is the report is even worse than reported, with more than 1,800 individuals naturalized who should have been deported from the country. ‘‘A reason for the underplaying of the number may have been the report’s focus, which was whether the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was using digital fingerprints effectively.’’ So it goes on to say that there might be 1,000 more—953 more—that they didn’t realize they were supposed to deport because they are probably going to kill people and create havoc here. With all the rhetoric we have heard over and over, we don’t need a fence, we don’t need a wall, this campaign you don’t need any fence or wall down on our border. WikiLeaks—and who knows where this stuff is coming from, but I never did hear outright denials to: Well, we are not sure where that is coming from. Yeah, but they are saying this was your email. Did you send this email? I just didn’t hear people denying the facts that were in what was released. Anyway, they leaked an internal memo from Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, and it made very clear that thenSenator Obama believed that fencing at the U.S.Mexico border could help cut down on illegal immigration. Of course, once he is in office, we hear his surrogate, Janet Napolitano, saying that if you build a 10foot wall, then they will build a 12foot ladder. So what do they do? They build a 10foot fence around the White House. After she made fun of a 10foot fence, they built a 10foot fence to make it higher around the White House. I ask: Does that fence work? Because if it works, then we need to have something like that down on our border. If it doesn’t work, then let’s remove the fence from around the White House. But the Obama administration, though they clamored that fences would do no good, made their fence even stronger, bigger, taller, and more secure around the White House. So I know they said that fences didn’t work, but their actions said pretty clearly: Yes, we know they work. That is why we are fixing ours up around the White House. In my own home county, November was a very, very sad time. A 10year old little girl, Kayla, was finally found as friends around the country were texting, emailing, and praying for Kayla. They finally found 10yearold Kayla. Our Smith County sheriff, Larry Smith, reported that Kayla’s body was found in a well next to a home rented by her relative 4 days after her disappearance. The Sheriff said: ‘‘We assure you there will be no stone unturned as we enter the next phase of this investigation.’’ That is what they did. They arrested Gustavo ZavalaGarcia. He was in the country illegally. He had been deported for a violent crime in 2014, but because this Federal Government refused to protect the United States of America from all enemies foreign, this guy comes back in and killed Kayla. That is the charge. We have seen this across the country. I know Presidentelect Trump has said he is going to do something about it, and, God help us, he needs to. In government we have a job. As an individual Christian, I am supposed to turn the other cheek; but when I am acting in the role of the government, my job is to make sure those who have religious beliefs can practice and keep their religious beliefs without worrying about some guy who has been deported five times coming in and shooting them. If we find here in Congress that the executive branch is not doing what they should, then we cut off the money. That is what is supposed to happen. Cut off the money to those who aren’t doing the job and send it over to people that are doing the job. If nobody is doing the job, then create another department and eliminate that department, and get somebody until you do protect the country. There are so many across this country that are suffering and mourning the loss because the Federal Government did not protect them from some 
immigrant who was a criminal who was deported. We don’t protect our borders. They came back, they killed, raped, and pillaged yet again. Then there are those who say: Well, let’s just go ahead and do a complete amnesty. This report is from Robert Rector, a brilliant guy from the National Academy of Sciences. He says: ‘‘The findings in the report indicate that if amnesty for illegal immigrants were enacted, the government would have to raise taxes immediately by $1.29 trillion and put that sum into a highyield bank account to cover future fiscal losses generated by the amnesty recipients and their children. ‘‘To cover the future cost, each U.S. household currently paying federal income tax would have to pay, on average, an immediate lump sum of over $15,000.’’ Wouldn’t it be better to just enforce our borders? Nobody lets in legally as many as we do in the United States. I don’t know a single person in this Congress that is a xenophobe, whatever kind of phobe, but we want to do our job. There is an obligation to make sure that the over 1 million visas—more than any country in the world—that are handed out by your United States Government go to people that are not going to be a threat but are to be a blessing to this country. The U.N. General Secretary—the new one that just came in—said over a year ago that the reason there is such a tiny fraction of a fraction of Christians who are being brought out of the Middle East as refugees is because they are so historically important right where they are. We have already recognized there is a genocide of Christians going on right now in the Middle East. So what do we do with the Christians? The government said: Well, we want to leave most of them there. We like what the U.N. says. Let’s leave them over there to be wiped out in a genocide of Christians. b1300 I am saying, Mr. Speaker, there will be a price to pay someday by this country for our callousness to Christians and Jews in the Middle East that have cried out for help. Instead of helping them, we have welcomed those who have tortured and created a living hell for them. And one from September 10: ‘‘Suspect in Brutal Maryland Murder Deported Twice.’’ ‘‘Austin Sex Assault Suspect Previously Deported Five Times.’’ Then this administration has sent billions of dollars, a lot of it cash—load up those pallets, put them on a plane, and send them to our enemy Iran. And we find out there was an IAEA report indicating that Iran had continued to violate the Iran executive agreement. It is really a treaty, but the Senate never confirmed it, never ratified it, so it can be wiped out as soon as Trump goes in. I know I saw a headline he doesn’t think he will do that. I suggest he needs to do that. It was a rotten deal. There will be a lot of people in the Middle East and around the world, including America, who will die because this administration sent billions of dollars to Iran, a big hunk of it just pure cash. This article says: ‘‘Iran Pressuring Palestinian Jihadists to Resume Terrorism Against Israel.’’ But they didn’t just do terrorism against Israel. They love to kill and do harm to Americans. It is time we stood up to our oath and protected this place, protected our Constitution, our way of life, against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That is basically the oath I took when I went on Active Duty in the Army. We didn’t know if we were going to be sent. We weren’t sent anywhere. We were put on alert in 1979 when an act of war occurred in Iran, but President Carter wouldn’t defend our people. He tried way too late and way too weakly to rescue. But even a successful rescue would have told the world we don’t have a leader in America that will protect the American people because, if you harm us, then we will come back and get out of your country, but we will leave you alone. I mean, this was President Carter that called Ayatollah Khomeini— the biggest radical Islamist terrorist in modern history—a man of peace when he was welcoming him to the power of an entire country and its military. Radical Islamic caliphate had been out of business for many years, and Carter opened the box. Once Pandora’s box was open, many thousands and thousands of our American military would die in the days to come because of it, not just military. But when a Taliban—radical Islamist terrorists—in Afghanistan get control of the country, there is going to be terrorism spread around the world. That is what happened. When a radical Islamic terrorist becomes the head of Iran, there is going to be terrorism spread around the world, and that happened. Now, this: ‘‘Leaked FBI Data Reveal 7,700 Terrorist Encounters in USA in One Year; Border States Most Targeted.’’ But Andrew McCarthy, a dear friend, wrote a great article: ‘‘Deadliest Lie: Without ‘Lone Wolf’ Lie, U.S. Could Have Stopped Nearly Every Attack.’’ As my friend Patrick Poole has said, there are no lone wolves, there are known wolves. Each time we find out these people were on the radar of the FBI, of law enforcement, and they didn’t know how to recognize a radical Islamist. So I hope and pray that, as a new administration comes in, we will finally put the Muslim Brotherhood, CAIR and any of the groups with which it works, on a terrorist watch list. Stop them from giving advice to the State Department, the White House, the Justice Department, Homeland Security. Stop allowing them to come in and review material and tell us what we have to remove from our training material so that next time Russia says there is a Tsarnaev brother that has been radicalized and he is going to kill people, the FBI agents who want to stop terrorism will actually recognize it because they have been properly trained to do so instead of being treated with some politically correct garbage that keeps them from recognizing what a real radical Islamist is. You have got to know what they are reading. You have got to know what their beliefs are. When I talked to the FBI agent whose material was completely eliminated for a time because, apparently, CAIR, named as a coconspirator in the Holy Land Foundation terrorism financing trial, was bothered by some of that stuff, when I asked the FBI Director at that time, Mueller, ‘‘You didn’t even go to the mosques where the Tsarnaevs went and ask questions— What are they reading? What are they learning? What are they saying? How are they acting?—to determine if they had been radicalized?’’ they didn’t know what to look for. Mueller said they did go out there, but it was in their outreach program. Yeah, go out there and have a meal. Let’s get together and be buddies, but not even investigate when the Russians tell you this guy is a radical, he is going to kill Americans. They sent somebody out. They talked to him and talked to his mom. He said, ‘‘No, I am not a terrorist’’; and Mom said, ‘‘He is a good boy, not a terrorist.’’ And then he goes and kills people in Boston at the marathon because they didn’t know what they were looking for. It is time to get back to fulfilling our oath to the United States of America to protect this country, to get government out of the way, to create a level playing field across the country and then let people compete. Don’t reward the losers. Encourage them to pick up and keep going when they fail because, like Edison, it is not a failure. You just found a way not to succeed on that, but you will find a way next time. We keep trying. It is time to wake up, protect the people within the United States so that we can continue to be the biggest, brightest beacon of light in the world where people will want to come instead of a place that was once great, was once free, was once safe, but now countries around the world have travel alerts out on our cities because we are not safe anymore. It is time to protect America and put America first, which is our oath and obligation. When we do that, we can do more good for the world than we have done since World War II. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
STATEHOOD FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to say that my colleague from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ), who spoke just before me, mentioned a divided country and used a metaphor—I hope it will become a metaphor—for the coming Congress of the African American coach who coached a White team and seemed to be able to reconcile people. If this Congress doesn’t learn the art of compromise, even though my Republican colleagues have captured the reins of government, they will still have trouble, without thoughtful compromise, getting matters through the House and the Senate. So I endorse the metaphor—that is what Mr. GOHMERT  meant—of Coach Williams as the kind of Congress we should be beginning in January if we want to override the last several Congresses which got very little done. It will take more than bringing all the reins of government under one party to get that done. I come to the floor this afternoon particularly to offer some background to new Members of Congress—but, I must say, to current Members of Congress as well—because there seems to me to be great mystery concerning what role Members of Congress should play when matters affecting a jurisdiction, not their own, come before them in this House. They know for sure that their own constituents didn’t send them here to legislate for somebody else’s district, so how come and what does it mean and how can we get on with the business of the Nation? On November 8, the residents of the District of Columbia in an overthetop 85 percent majority—with support, by the way, from our Republican Party in the District—passed a statehood referendum to petition the Congress for statehood for the District of Columbia. I don’t think they did so because they thought that either a Democratic President or a Republican President, a Democratic Congress, would move quickly on a statehood bill, but it does express frustration that I believe my colleagues would identify with at not being treated as the fullfledged American citizens they are. On November 8, not only was I running for Congress and many of my colleagues—or most of my colleagues—the District of Columbia was, in effect, running for statehood. Now, there are three ways to become a State: you can amend the Constitution; you can have Congress pass a bill, and we have a bill pending here now; or a State can formally petition the Congress to become a State, instead of waiting for Congress to pass a bill in the ordinary course of business. The way to petition the Congress was patterned by the State of Tennessee, which was then a territory. In 1795, Tennessee drafted a constitution, passed a referendum, indicated what its boundaries would be, and petitioned, succeeding in becoming the 16th State of the Union. At the same time that 85 percent of the residents of the District of Columbia passed the statehood referendum to do the same thing—I don’t want to be misunderstood. Our residents have not given up on seeking any and all elements of statehood. Even before statehood is granted, statehood consists of many different elements. Indeed, almost simultaneously, indeed, before the statehood referendum, they had voted for a budget autonomy referendum. You can imagine the insult to the residents of the District of Columbia to raise $7 billion and then have to call on somebody else for permission to spend their own money. b1315 Budget autonomy has long been the priority of the District of Columbia, and every Member of this body knows that what you prize most is the control that your own jurisdiction has over its own local budget and that, no matter what we do on the Federal budget, they can’t touch your budget. Yes, they add to your budget, but your budget is your budget, and our budget is our budget. Members of Congress don’t look at our budget. They know they don’t know how to run a big city of, going on, 700,000 people, but the budget becomes a vehicle for interfering with the business of a local jurisdiction—the District of Columbia. Now, Congress, in the congressional resolution that is pending, has appropriated next year’s budget—that is to say, the 2017 budget. At the same time, I want to alert Congress that the budget autonomy referendum I just spoke of is in effect. That has not been overturned. It has been tested in court. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated an opinion of the district court that indicated that the budget autonomy referendum, whereby the District was giving itself autonomy over its own budget, was unconstitutional. It vacated that, so that does not stand. Instead, it sent it to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, and the superior court considered it and upheld the Budget Autonomy Act. No appeal was filed; so the Budget Autonomy Act is still law. It is interesting that the Federal court sent the matter to the local court. I think the Federal court was telling us something: that, when it comes to discerning what are the local powers, we ought to look first to the local courts. No appeal was filed. The Federal courts have, in effect, deferred to the local court; so the budget autonomy referendum stands as law, notwithstanding the fact that the congressional resolution does, in fact, appropriate D.C.’s budget. So you can see how there is some attempt to come to grips with this issue in Congress and to come to some kind of, at least, compromise, and I appreciate that. It is very hard to understand congressional opposition to autonomy, such as it is, that the District wishes over its own budget. What the District has done in designing its own budget autonomy referendum is certainly not to give itself statehood. The referendum is a very moderate notion because the local budget would still come to the House of Representatives and to the Senate for a review period, just as all local legislation—even though almost none of it is overturned during this period—has to come here before it becomes law. Congress would continue, under the current budget autonomy referendum, to have the existing jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, and it is going to have that jurisdiction until the District of Columbia becomes the 51st State. Budget autonomy does not interfere, as it is mapped out in the budget autonomy referendum, with the powers of the Congress. So why not say to the District: you can have control over your own budget. If we want to interfere, we can still interfere; but you don’t have to bring it up here. We can interfere without your bringing it up here. Until this Congress, actually, the District had bipartisan support for budget autonomy. The last two Republican chairmen of the committee of jurisdiction over the District, which is the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, understood—maybe precisely because they were Republicans— why budget autonomy was the very first thing a local jurisdiction ought to demand. Former Representative Thomas Davis and DARRELL ISSAfought for budget autonomy. Mr. ISSAis still in this body, as I understand it. Representative Davis said recently: ‘‘The benefits of budget autonomy for the District are numerous, real, and much needed. There is no drawback.’’ Budget autonomy means lower borrowing costs, more accurate financial projections, improved operations, and the District government will not shut down during a Federal Government shutdown. Imagine that. That is what has happened several times here because this budget has to come here even when the District of Columbia, as always, is not implicated in disagreements with the Federal Government. If it shuts down then I have to take action to make sure the District doesn’t shut down with it because, in the past, it has, indeed, been shut down for no reason except the Federal Government, itself, was shut down because it couldn’t agree on Federal matters. The District has tried all conceivable ways to get some equality with other citizens. For example, the House in 2007 and the Senate in 2009 passed the House Voting Rights Act. That would have given the District a vote in the House but not in the Senate. But at least in the people’s House, you would not have 
the outrage of, for example, this Member who cannot vote on any matter on this floor but whose matters do come before the House of Representatives. It had good bipartisan support. Speaker RYAN, at the time, supported it. Our current Vice President, at the time, supported it. Our Vice Presidentelect supported it. There was some understanding that, even if you are not ready for statehood, you are not ready for the status quo for the almost 700,000 people who live in the District of Columbia. There are other elements of statehood: legislative autonomy. If the District passes a bill, it can’t become law until it lies over. That means it just stops until we see whether somebody from the House or the Senate wants to overturn a law. It is almost never used. I can’t remember the last time it was used, yet that is an authority that lies in this Congress. Why would Congress want to keep an authority when it never uses it? There are other ways, if it wants to interfere, rather than forcing the District through long waits to have its bills become law. These are enigmas of the last century. They have no place in a modern House and Senate. I have been able—and I am grateful— that, each year, for the last several years, I have been able, in advance, to get language that has meant that, even if the House or the Senate had to close down, the District would not close down. It is not as if there aren’t some in the House who see why I come before you today. We believe that, ultimately, as Congress sees that the components of statehood work—not shutting down the government, maybe budget autonomy or legislative autonomy—they will see that a new State of American citizens should have the same rights in every respect as other American citizens. In 2014, we were very pleased to get the first official hearing ever in the Senate on D.C. statehood. There was a huge overflow crowd. They had to open up other rooms beyond where the hearing was held. The case for statehood was made by a number of witnesses at that hearing. The District was able to show that it has one of the strongest economies in the Nation. How many of my colleagues are from States that have a $12.5 billion budget, much less their districts? Because that is larger than the budget of 12 States. How many of my colleagues can boast for their States, much less their Districts, $2 billion in surplus, which has become the envy of the States? How many of my colleagues have per capita personal income as high as ours? None, because the per capita income— per person income—in the District of Columbia is higher than that of any State. Our total personal income per capita is higher than that of seven States. Our per capita personal consumption expenditure is higher than that of any State. Look at the growth in population with people coming in large numbers to live in the Nation’s Capital—one of the highest growth rates in population in the United States. In a city that was about 600,000, it has increased more than 50,000 since the last census, giving the District a larger population than two of our States that have two Senators and one Representative—Wyoming and Vermont. Of course, there are many reasons statehood is very personal to me. If the bell rings for votes on bills, I cannot cast a vote for the more than 650,000 people I represent, though my constituents pay more taxes per capita than those who do come to cast that vote. I feel it also very particularly when we have votes on any matter affecting war, like ISIL, because I have gone to the floor to debate matters of war a number of times since coming to Congress 25 years ago. I remember, for example, District residents who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I was not able to vote ‘‘aye’’ or ‘‘no’’ as they went off and got the vote for those in their jurisdictions. I remember the purple fingers that showed that people had voted, while these District of Columbia residents, in having gotten the vote for others, came home and still did not have the vote. Mr. Speaker, this is an embarrassing anachronism that comes out of the 18th century. When the Framers, who were otherwise—I must say in virtually every other way—perfect, couldn’t figure out what to do when the Capital was in Philadelphia and the Revolutionary War veterans marched on that Capital, they thought: well, we want to make sure the Capital is not a part of a State. What will we do with the District of Columbia? They were not sure, but they said: we will retain some jurisdiction over the Capital in case we need to. You don’t need to—or let us say you do. There are 20 different Federal police forces that help protect the local District of Columbia every single day. This is a figment of another era if we are talking about protecting the Capital. In any case, it is impossible to lay to the Framers, who invented the slogan ‘‘no taxation without representation,’’ that they meant the people who fought in that war, that Revolutionary War, were to come home and have no representation. b1330 Mr. Speaker, statehood has been very difficult for every State to achieve. The last two States were Alaska and Hawaii, and it took them each more than 50 years. It would have taken us much longer. So what the District did in voting 85 percent for statehood was to understand it has to fertilize on a continuing basis our effort to become equal citizens or it just won’t happen. This is a political matter and a moral matter, but the two mix. So we know we have to convince our colleagues, and we know everything depends on us. So that energy that comes out of that vote you will see manifest all next year. It has already raised the national profile for statehood for our country. Now, many, many Americans know that when they see me speak on the House floor does not mean I have the same rights as everyone else. My greatest frustration is that most Americans think that the Americans who live in the Nation’s Capital have the same rights they do. The statehood vote and the drive leading up to it, the statehood referendum has helped many more Americans to understand that is not the case. There has never been a poll that showed anything but the desire of the American people that the people of the District of Columbia be treated equally with themselves. Mr. Speaker, Congress has two choices: It can continue to exercise authority over the American people who reside here in the Nation’s Capital, treating them—if I may quote the words of the great Frederick Douglass—as ‘‘aliens, noncitizens,’’ but subjects or it can take another course. This Congress can live up to the national promise, the ideals that we all profess, and help the people of the District of Columbia move toward equal citizenship, toward autonomy over their own budget, toward legislative autonomy, and finally toward statehood as the 51st State of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
