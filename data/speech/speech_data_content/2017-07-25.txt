Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we begin an unusual week here on Capitol Hill, although unusual is sort of the new usual in Washington, D.C. The Senate begins deliberations on an 8year Republican mission to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they don’t fully know what it is exactly they are voting on. There is uncertainty in the House over both the budget and appropriations, but, you know, there is an opportunity for Congress to take a step back, to do something that will make a huge difference for everybody from coast to coast, something that can bring together a wide coalition of support and meet unmet needs. b1015 I am talking about addressing the unmet infrastructure needs for a country that is falling apart as we fall behind. We haven’t raised the gas tax in 24 years. And in the course of that 24 years, we have watched the value of the Federal gas tax actually erode 40 percent, due to inflation and increased fuel efficiency, while our needs continue to go up each and every year. Congress has put together a series of stopgap measures—gimmicks here and there—which have not adequately met those needs, and they have actually increased the budget deficit. I think back to Ronald Reagan making his Thanksgiving Day speech in November of 1982, when he called on Congress to come back from their recess and more than double the gas tax because, he pointed out, it would put people to work and improve road conditions that were actually damaging people’s cars more than what modest increase they would pay. Well, Congress did it, and we were better off as a result. I think each of us would do well to look back at that speech that Ronald Reagan gave, calling on Congress to step up and do its part. The States are not sitting back. Since over the last 5 years, more than half of the individual States have gone ahead and raised their transportation funding. So far in 2017 alone, California, Indiana, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, West Virginia, and South Carolina raised the gas tax. In fact, South Carolina raised the gas tax by overriding a Republican Governor’s veto. There are opportunities here for us to be able to step forward and build on this vast coalition. It really isn’t a profile in courage to support legislation that is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFL–CIO, contractors, a variety of labor unions, road builders, engineers, trucking companies, and AAA. The widest coalition of people supporting any major issue before us deals with increasing the fuel tax. And it is interesting, for those who are worried that maybe there is some political downturn, despite the fact that the States have been able to summon the courage. The American Road and Transportation Builders Association did an extensive survey about who were those intrepid legislators that voted to raise the gas tax since 2012. What they found is that those legislators who had the courage and the vision to do what was right for their States were reelected by an over 90 percent rate. But this shouldn’t be about elections. It should be about what is right for the American people. Stepping up, meeting our obligations, so that the Federal Government is a full partner, working with State and local governments, working with the private sector, to be able to meet the over $1.1 trillion of critical transportation needs between now and 2025 ought to be the order of business. I would hope that my friends in Republican leadership would allow us to have just 1 week of hearings on this issue so that we can hear from the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the president of the AFL–CIO, the truckers, AAA, Republican legislators of principle, people across the country who talk about the need to rebuild and renew America, make our communities more livable, our families safer, healthier, and more economically secure. 
STUDENT DEBT CRISIS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, we continue to hear about the challenges for college students who borrow more and more to pay higher tuition rates and then are saddled with huge debt loads that they will have great difficulty paying back. The average debt for a 4year college student today is nearly $37,000. We need to explore new ways to ensure that every student has the opportunity to go to school, to develop their skills, and then pursue their dreams without feeling deterred by the price tag. I think we need to look at a new approach, an approach that would help students pay for college. It is a concept known as an incomeshare agreement. It is a concept that would provide students the funding that they agree to pay back as small, affordable portions of their income over the years following graduation. Incomeshare agreements are interest free, and students only will make those payments if they are employed and if they receive an income that meets a certain threshold. This method of financing puts less pressure on students to keep up with fixed highinterest payments while they are faced with job uncertainty. Rather than accruing debt under the traditional student loan structure, this makes the investment in these students’ future more equitybased. Their payments are guaranteed to be affordable, rather than fixed, and a certain price. This is a much more manageable plan for students, Mr. Speaker, who are eager to get a career underway after graduation and want to make sure that they are putting their degrees into practice in a field that they have studied and have a passion for, rather than feel constrained by the impending weight of paying back loans right away. That is why I am coauthoring the Investing in Student Success Act. It is modeled after a program at Purdue University. At Purdue, an average student received a little over $13,000 in funding for tuition, paired with a student promise to pay back that money in 6 to 10 years after graduation in small percentages of their income. The bill provides a legal framework for private organizations to invest in individual students through implementing similar incomeshare agreements. Doing so creates more options for payment and increases accessibility for higher education. Today, the cost of tuition at a public 4year university is nearly quadruple what it was back in 1974. Due to rising tuition costs and the increased need for a college degree in the workforce, it is more important now, more than ever before, to address the student loan debt crisis and provide students with the resources they need to graduate with minimal loans. Incomeshare agreements also provide the flexibility that students need when faced with an uncertain job market and provide an alternative to the traditional student loan repayment structure. Mr. Speaker, as we look for ways to make higher education more affordable and more accessible, we should be advancing new innovative solutions to help students go to college without that burden of high debt after graduation, and incomeshare agreements are another way of accomplishing this. 
SNAP CUTS IN HOUSE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, just weeks after President Trump released his devastating budget which guts SNAP, our Nation’s first line of defense against hunger, House Republicans 
have joined in that effort, proposing drastic cuts to our antihunger safety net in the budget that they marked up last week. In their budget, House Republicans have laid out their dangerous agenda: dramatic increases in defense spending and tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and corporations—all paid for by cuts to programs that help working families and those struggling to make ends meet. Among the proposed cuts, House Republicans are seeking $160 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, over 10 years. $150 billion of these cuts come from structural changes to SNAP and harsher work requirements and time limits, and an additional $10 billion would be fasttracked through the reconciliation process. Mr. Speaker, SNAP is not an ATM. It is not money to be used for tax breaks for the wealthy, additional weapons systems, or any corporate handouts. It is intended to help our most vulnerable neighbors purchase groceries and put food on the table when times are tough. Simply put, SNAP helps people eat. For a meager $1.40 per person, per meal, SNAP helps alleviate poverty, reduce hunger, and improve nutrition. It is one of the most efficient and effective Federal programs. But it is only $1.40 per person, per meal. And my friends are proposing more cuts in this program? Mr. Speaker, I serve as the ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee, Subcommittee on Nutrition. Since 2015, the committee has held 23 hearings on SNAP. In our hearings, we have heard from over 80 witnesses—Republican and Democrat— about ways to make SNAP even better. But none of these witnesses—not one— ever suggested changes like the ones proposed by President Trump and House Republicans. These Republican proposals are meanspirited, and they are just as heartless as they are reckless. They do not reflect the realities of the program or seek to understand the challenges faced by those living in poverty. They don’t help struggling Americans find work, and they certainly don’t help address the ‘‘benefit cliff,’’ as some of my Republican colleagues have proposed doing. If Republicans were genuinely interested in helping struggling families rise out of poverty, they would join Democrats in advocating for higher wages, more jobs, and better work supports like childcare and transportation. They would address affordable housing shortages and help to improve access to healthcare. They would increase investments in job training and career and technical education. They would finally work with us to make college more affordable. But instead of working on these priorities, House Republicans are hell bent on pursuing an agenda that belittles the struggles of the working poor and tears apart our safety net. Their awful budget is no exception. Under the guise of ‘‘State flexibility,’’ their budget proposes a block grantlike approach to administering SNAP. Make no mistake, blockgranting SNAP would make hunger worse in this country, plain and simple. It would undermine the successful structure of SNAP—its ability to expand as the economy struggles and contract in times of economic prosperity. The proposed structural changes would likely result in drastic funding cuts and reduced eligibility for the program. If State flexibility is the true goal, then my Republican friends are in luck. SNAP already has a number of options that States can adopt. What is ironic is some of these State exceptions are exactly the provisions House Republicans are seeking to do away with. The Republican budget also calls for additional work requirements of SNAP, relying on dangerous rhetoric that suggests that hardworking families who rely on modest food benefits don’t want to work or are somehow lazy. That couldn’t be farther from the truth. I would like to point out that the majority of people on SNAP who can work, do work. Most people on SNAP are not expected to work or cannot work—they are kids, senior citizens, and people who are disabled. But that is exactly who Republicans will hurt if these dangerous proposals advance. If we are talking about how we can help transition people who can work into the workforce, you don’t do that by cutting the program by billions of dollars or by cutting people off from food aid. That does nothing to help people find jobs. It only makes people hungry. Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to join me in rejecting these damaging cuts, and to support investments in our antihunger safety net that will help end hunger now. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TROY BOWLING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of an American patriot and hero, Mr. Troy Bowling of Lexington, Kentucky, who completed his life’s service on June 17, 2017, at the age of 90 years old. His military service during World War II and his commitment to supporting our veterans and the men and women in uniform throughout his life is an inspiration to us all. At the age of 19, Mr. Bowling began his service as a United States marine and was a proud member of the Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Division. During the United States campaign to end the war against Japan, Mr. Bowling’s unit was among the first to arrive on the beachheads of Iwo Jima. While attempting to secure Mount Suribachi, his unit came under intense and concentrated fire, completely overwhelming his unit. Two projectiles struck Mr. Bowling in the chest and leg, leaving him critically wounded on the battlefield. At that moment, Mr. Bowling said he looked to the heavens and committed to serving mankind for the rest of his life if he survived. Miraculously, a combat photographer and medical team then carried Mr. Bowling to the safety of a landing craft, where he witnessed the planting of the American flag atop Mount Suribachi, an iconic image that persists as one of the most legendary and triumphant moments of the war. The U.S. Marines eventually took control of the island. However, this victory came at a heavy cost, as over 6,800 U.S. servicemembers gave their lives during the battle of Iwo Jima. In keeping faith with his commitment to God made during that battle, Mr. Bowling devoted over 78,000 hours of volunteer service to others at the Lexington VA Medical Center. For over 66 years, Mr. Bowling rose through the ranks within the Disabled American Veterans organization, holding nearly every position possible, including State commander. b1030 The Bible teaches in Proverbs 21:21 that ‘‘He who pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity, and honor.’’ Mr. Bowling has brought great honor upon himself through his dedication, determination, and love for serving the people of our community. Without a doubt, he has remained true to the commitment he made on the rocky terrain of Iwo Jima. Mr. Bowling embodies the best of American ideals, values, and commitment to serving others, never abandoning the Marine motto of semper fidelis, ‘‘always faithful.’’ On behalf of a grateful nation, I would like to thank Mr. Bowling, a model member of the greatest generation, for his many years of service to our country and our community. He is truly an outstanding American and an inspiration to us all. Troy Bowling, may you rest in peace. 
CONCERNS OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a somber day today, and it is a very important day in the history of the United States of America. I have joined with Senator FRANKEN , who indicated that, today, Senators of the United States Senate will make one of the most significant votes, if not the most significant vote of their career, and it will be a vote that they will long remember because, rather than the serious and difficult decisions 
of war and peace that, over the historical times of this body, many Members have had to make that decision and be in the midst of the throngs of patriotism, the vote that will be taken today will be a vote that those Senators will have brought on themselves; and it is a vote that does not have to be taken, nor a movement that has to be moved; and that is, to cause the American people to face a crumbling healthcare system, to dismantle and diminish the rights and obligations and opportunities for Americans, some 32 million, to have health insurance. For me, it is both baffling and tragic that Senators would make this a campaign competition game, and that it only represents a notch in their belt. This does not have anything to do with providing healthcare for Americans. It doesn’t have anything to do with what doctors say, what hospitals say, what rural hospitals need, what individuals with chronic illnesses need, or those who have been diagnosed with devastating cancer. It has nothing to do with children who are in desperate need of healthcare. It has nothing to do with two young people who I met; one who was experiencing autism, who sought to live independently and could not do so without Medicaid, or one who had a chronic illness of which, between 2015 and 2016, he spent or had to spend $700,000 to live, and, in the last 6 months, he had to spend $73,000, none of which would have been possible without the Affordable Care Act. So what is happening in the Senate this afternoon? What vote of courage is being taken? What vote of improving the lives of Americans when the Senate bill, TrumpCare, will cause 49 million people to not have their insurance by 2026? It will cause rural hospitals to simply crumble. I am from Texas. We have a huge system of rural hospitals helping my constituents, and those hospitals will face disaster. Or the Texas Medical Center, like major hospital configurations across the Nation, where major research is being done, undermined by the vote that will be taken. It saddens me because I think the American people believe that we come to this place, we take this oath of office, to do what is right for America. This is not political chips. This is not dominos. This is not a game. And to the Commander in Chief, for you to be in front of the Boy Scouts— my husband and my son were Boy Scouts, and I sit on the Boy Scout board. I am offended by your words. I am offended because I know how hard my son worked. I know how my husband cherishes his status as an Eagle Scout, and I know what the jamboree means because my child went to it, and I know how excited those young patriots are. Yet the Commander in Chief would come and speak about former President Obama in a dastardly way, talk about crowd sizes, and then have the nerve to talk about the healthcare bill, not as a moment of conscience, not as a serious issue that would, in fact, make higher costs. Under the Senate bill, people will be paying more than they have earned for health insurance—welldocumented. Of course, this is 22 million in the earlier period of the House bill. We now know it may be 32 million, and, as I have said, 49 million by 2026. And then, of course, it cuts the protections for preexisting conditions. Of course, it has a crushing age tax. If you are older, 55, you pay more. And then, of course, it undermines Medicare. It interferes with the Medicare trust bill. Yet the Commander in Chief is speaking before 45,000 or more young men, patriots, Boy Scouts, and talking about the healthcare bill and calling out Senator CAPITO from West Virginia: You better make her vote for it. What kind of leadership and heart is that? What are we dealing with here in this Nation? I don’t have to say anything, Mr. Speaker, about this individual. As I close, let me simply say that I am introducing a resolution to stop any President from firing the special counsel, and any President from abusing the pardon by pardoning anybody who is under investigation for the Russian involvement in our elections. We have to do this, sadly, because we are not focused on governing; we are focusing on insulting. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
VETERANS EDUCATION BENEFITS SHOULD BE TRANSFERABLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. LABRADOR ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LABRADOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of an amazing Idaho family which has taken a horrible personal tragedy and turned it into a cause that will benefit many other families in the years to come. I am referring to the family of Shauna Hill, a 16yearold girl who lived in Eagle, Idaho, in my district, and who tragically lost her life in 2012. At the time of her untimely death, Shauna was a junior at Eagle High School. She was a competitive figure skater and ice dancer and played the violin in her school orchestra. She even performed with the orchestra at New York’s Carnegie Hall. She was also working to qualify for a Congressional Silver Medal for public service, personal development, and physical fitness. She aspired to attend Stanford University and become a doctor. Sadly, she lost her life in a car accident on her way home from orchestra practice. I first met Shauna’s parents, Captain Edward Hill and his wife, Heidi, in 2013, when I helped present them with the Congressional Bronze Medal their daughter had earned. While presenting the award, I learned that Captain Hill, who served 28 years as a Navy pilot and flew to protect America during three combat tours, had retired shortly before Shauna’s death. Following the tragedy, Captain Hill was working with the Navy to try to reassign his benefits to his second child, Haley, who was also planning to attend college. With almost 3 decades of distinguished service, Captain Hill qualified for the full utilization of the education benefit, but the Navy said Haley wasn’t eligible because education benefits under the GI bill cannot be reassigned. The Hills asked for my help, and my staff got to work. Unfortunately, we found out that the Navy’s hands were tied. Current law does not allow the transfer of education benefits after a servicemember has retired. No waivers are permitted, even in such tragic circumstances. I promised the Hills that I would seek a legislative solution. In February of this year, I introduced H.R. 1112, the Shauna Hill Post 9/11 Education Benefits Transferability Act. This bill would permit the reassignment of veterans’ education benefits in cases where the designated beneficiary passes away. Losing a child is the worst thing I can imagine, and surely Congress didn’t intend to exclude the ability to transfer benefits to a surviving child or spouse. The bill I introduced would correct this oversight, and it has received support from many veterans’ groups. These include: the Concerned Veterans for America, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the Student Veterans of America, AMVETS, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Association of the United States Navy, and the National Military Family Association. This month, VA Committee Chairman ROEand Ranking Member W ALZ included my bill in the bipartisan GI Bill, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act of 2017. This bill passed the House last night, and I was proud to join my colleagues in voting for it. I am grateful to Chairman ROEand Ranking Member WALZ for including my bill in their legislation. I am also thankful to Senator CRAPO , who has introduced companion legislation in the Senate. Now that the House has acted, it is my hope that the Senate will act too and, from there, our bill can be signed into law. This legislation will mean a great deal to the Hills. It will be a great comfort to them and all those who have experienced such a terrible loss. As a grateful nation, it is the least that we can do, and America must always be a grateful nation. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act of 2017 keeps our promises to our veterans and their families, especially when they need it the most. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 41 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend Lonnie Mitchell, Sr., Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Spokane, Washington, offered the following prayer: O Lord God, pour out Your presence and Your power upon this opening session of the U.S. House of Representatives. Please empower our leaders to deliberate, collaborate, and, when necessary, compromise for the good of our Nation. As President Lincoln said: With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let this Congress strive on to finish the work they are in, to bind up the Nation’s wounds . . . to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among everybody and with all nations. God, we the people in the land of the free and the home of the brave desperately need You now and forevermore. O that You would bless this session and the leaders in this House and all branches of our government. Respectful of all faiths, in Jesus the Christ I pray. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. BANKS of Indiana led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING REVEREND LONNIE MITCHELL, SR. The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to welcome Pastor Lonnie Mitchell today to the people’s House. He accepted the call to ministry in 1985 under the AME church and came to Spokane, Washington, in 1991. He moved his young family and has been there ever since, leading his congregation under the theme to be ‘‘the cathedral of love, where everybody is somebody and Jesus is the center of attraction.’’ He also started the AHANA Business and Professional Organization, which was formed for persons of color. He started Unity in the Community in Spokane, which is now the largest multicultural celebration in the inland Northwest, 22 years strong. He has his master’s from Gonzaga University, which is our local Jesuit university, but is a proponent of bringing faith and government together to build and sustain healthy communities. It was great to have him here today. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Michael Becker, to celebrate the positive impact that he has had in our community. In 2006, Michael and his wife, Kim, founded the notforprofit Hello Gorgeous!, which brings joy to women fighting cancer by giving them a red carpet experience complete with a makeover and spa. Reaching 15 States with mobile day spas and affiliate salons, Hello Gorgeous! has provided unforgettable experiences to thousands of women all over the country. The organization Michael and Kim built together and the mission they devoted themselves to brings happiness and hope where it is needed most. Their passion, drive, and faith inspire us all, and their selfless generosity is an example we should strive to follow. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to represent such kind and 
giving people. Michael lived a life full of love, laughter, and spirit. My thoughts are with Kim and everyone at Hello Gorgeous! in whose work, I have no doubt, Michael’s memory will live on. 
PASSAGE OF THE GI BILL (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the GI Bill, has since provided tens of millions of returning ActiveDuty veterans with help buying a home, starting a business, and going to college. Also, in addition to doing the right thing, the GI Bill fundamentally transformed the American economy from an industrial based economy to a knowledgebased economy. I was proud to support H.R. 3218 this week that would renew this commitment. The bill provides expanded educational benefits for servicemembers and their families, including the elimination of time restrictions on education credits for veterans who reenter civilian life in 2013 or after. GI benefits should not come with an expiration date. Our veterans deserve our respect unexpired for their service to our country. This bill affirms that obligation. 
CONGRATULATING CAPTAIN PHILLIP DAWSON III ON HIS RETIREMENT (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Captain Phillip Dawson on his retirement from the United States Navy. On Friday, Captain Dawson will complete a nearly 4 year tour as the commanding officer of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida. A 1988 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Captain Dawson first served on the USS Tattnall as the antisubmarine warfare officer and, later, on the USS Harry E. Yarnell as the fire control officer. Captain Dawson assumed command of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in 2013, where he led the center in a wide array of missions, including littoral warfare, coastal defense, and special missions. This base is also home to the U.S. Navy Dive School, where all of the divers from all of our services are trained. Captain Dawson’s selfless sacrifice to this country and dedication to our Navy is truly inspiring. Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking Captain Dawson, his wife, Belinda, and their three children for their years of service and sacrifice, and wish them luck as they enjoy a new chapter in life. HELPING AMERICANS FIGHT BACK (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I met Ted a few weeks ago. He is a bricklayer from Fall River, Massachusetts. It is hard, proud work, the kind that comes with frequent physical injury. Ted is no exception. Then came the opioid prescriptions. Then came a long and painful road to addiction. But Ted fought back. By force of will, faith, he pulled himself up, he got treatment, and he got clean. But his most recent injury cost him his job and his health insurance, and a new diagnosis just came in: liver cancer. Madam Speaker, this is where a system proves what it is made of. When our people are sick, when they are tired, when they are terrified, and when they have given everything that they have got, do we abandon them? No. We pull them up. We bet on their resilience because there is nothing more fundamentally American than the belief that our people survive, they endure, and they rise to fight again. They deserve a government that will jump into the ring by their side. Today is that test of what is good and decent for our people. f 
THANK YOU, CANDACE RICH (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, it is with sincere gratitude and appreciation I have the opportunity to recognize Candace Rich, legislative assistant for South Carolina’s Second Congressional District. I will always appreciate Candace for her years of service on behalf of the people of South Carolina. A native of Virginia, Candace is an esteemed alumna of the University of South Carolina, with degrees in history and political science. She also earned a master’s of arts in instruction and curriculum from Angelo State University. She is truly dedicated to public service, beginning as an intern in the district office starting in 2010 before joining the staff in 2014. Candace’s experience on healthcare, education, and workforce issues, combined with a genuine desire to serve constituents, has made a difference. Candace was crucial in helping Republicans pass and have signed a record number of bills this year. It is with mixed feelings but great happiness that I bid Candace farewell. She is moving on next week to a new role teaching social studies at Central High School in San Angelo, Texas. I know her parents, Tim and Angela, along with her brothers, Aaron and Adam, join me in recognizing her achievements. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. f 
WE MUST DO BETTER (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I have been listening daily to heartbreaking stories from real people about their health challenges and what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean to them. People like Peter Morley, who survived cancer and now lives with lupus— he won’t be able to afford his lifesaving infusions if repeal happens. For Baby Theo, born with two holes and an enlarged kidney, the return of lifetime caps would mean the loss of insurance for him. And Red Raccoon, an Iraq war veteran suffering from PTSD, he relies on Medicaid to supplement the inadequate VA system. Each of them and millions more will suffer if repeal or replace goes forward. I believe we are a greater, more caring nation than this. I believe we can, we shall, we must do better. 
INDIANA’S FISCAL STRENGTH (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, here in Washington, we are currently in the middle of an important debate on the Federal budget. It is clear that dramatic changes need to be made in the way that taxpayer dollars are spent. We need to get our Nation’s fiscal house in order. As we consider important reforms, we would be wise to turn to my home State of Indiana. Last week, Indiana State Auditor Tera Klutz announced that our State currently has a rainy day fund of nearly $1.8 billion. Contrast that with a nearly $20 trillion national debt here in Washington. As Auditor Klutz noted in a press conference last week: ‘‘Hoosiers can rest assured that their government takes the task of managing taxpayers’ money seriously. Just like people across the State live within their means, Indiana has worked hard to spend less than we take in, invest in our priorities, and retain resources in the event of an economic downturn.’’ To get our fiscal house in order, we need more of this Hoosier common sense in Washington. The attitude and approach that has worked well in Indiana should be a model for the Nation. 
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO PAY FOR A WALL (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, the appropriations bills we are talking about today should be about providing critical funds to keep our servicemembers safe, take care of our veterans, and support necessary defense programs. It should not be about helping President Trump keep a campaign promise that has no grounding in reality. House Republicans’ reckless decision to force the American people to pay for a wall that does nothing to increase our security or to solve real problems facing our immigration system is both wasteful and counterproductive. This wall will cost American taxpayers $1.6 billion. That is $1.6 billion that could go toward helping veterans or getting our servicemembers the resources they need to stay safe while they risk their lives defending our country. Rather than come to the table to work on meaningful bipartisan and longterm solutions to fix our broken immigration system, House Republicans would rather give American families’ paychecks to President Trump so he can build this wall. We are here to do the people’s work. Building this wall doesn’t do the people’s work. It soothes the President’s ego at the expense of American families. I urge my colleague to oppose this bill if this dangerous and divisive policy rider is included. 
b1215 WE ARE DOING THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE AND KEEPING OUR PROMISES (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, all too often, the important work we are doing in the people’s House does not get the attention it deserves. So far this year, we have rolled back 14 overly burdensome regulations from the Obama administration, saving taxpayers billions of dollars in the process. We passed landmark reforms that are now law to bring greater accountability and better care to the Veterans Administration. Here in the House, we kept our promise to rescue families from the collapsing ObamaCare law. We have taken action to rebuild our military, give our troops the biggest pay raise in 8 years, and expand the GI Bill to improve educational benefits. We have enhanced border security and public safety by passing Kate’s Law. And we have passed measures to strengthen career and technical education, combat human trafficking, and reform the FDA to encourage medical innovation. Madam Speaker, these policies, and many more that are languishing in the Senate, will make a real difference in people’s lives. And we will keep working hard on the issues that matter, even if it doesn’t always make the headlines. f 
ECONOMY NOT WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, the economy simply is not working the way it should. Millions of hardworking men and women across the heartland feel the American Dream has slipped out of reach. In places like Galesburg, Hanover, and Freeport, Illinois, too many of the families I serve have seen their jobs boxed up and shipped to places like Mexico and China. To make ends meet, many of them have had to take on two or three minimum wage jobs. That is not the American Dream that we believe in. We believe in an America where we never give up on the fight for better jobs, better wages, and a better future for all of our families. This is why I was proud to help present the American public with our ‘‘Better Deal’’ economic agenda. Together, we will help 10 million hardworking Americans find goodpaying, fulltime jobs by making bold investments in our roads and bridges, and doubling our investments in workforce training and apprenticeships to connect workers with the skills that employers need. And while wages will go up, costs will go down by reducing the price of prescription drugs and making childcare more affordable. The American people are tired of excuses from Washington. They want real action, and we have a real plan. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVID COGDILL, SR. (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DENHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the life of a cherished leader and great friend, former California State Senator Dave Cogdill, Sr. The beloved husband, father, and grandfather passed away at the age of 66 on Sunday, surrounded by his family. Born on December 31, 1950, Dave spent most of his adult life in public service. That public service started when he enlisted in 1970 in the Air Force Reserve, serving in the Air National Guard, as well as on Active Duty. In 1975, he was elected as a member of the Board of Directors of the Bridgeport Fire Protection District in Mono County. He moved to Modesto in 1979 and built his real estate appraisal business while serving on various boards and commissions in both the public and private sectors. And he served two terms on the Modesto City Council. Dave went on to represent the 25th District in the California State Assembly for 6 years prior to being elected to the State senate in 2006. He served as the California State Senate Republican leader from 2008 to 2009, in addition to numerous committees, including Public Safety, the Revenue and Taxation, and the Joint Legislative Audit Committees. A real estate appraiser by trade, Dave served as Stanislaus County assessor from 2011 to 2013, after which he joined the California Building Industry Association as CEO and president in October of 2013. For his many years of an exemplary legislative career, Dave was awarded the prestigious Profile in Courage Award from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation in 2010. That was just one of the many recognitions he received throughout his lifetime. Dave and his wife, Stephanie, were married for 47 years. They have a son, David, Jr.; a daughter, Meghan Merrell; and three grandchildren, Connor, Katie, and Cooper. Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring and recognizing California State Senator Dave Cogdill for his unwavering leadership and friendship. He had a long history of service to California and to our community. He will be greatly missed. f 
HONORING SERGEANT JOE MURRAY (Mr. LAWSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, last week, we all learned the tragic news that a military transport plane crashed into the Mississippi Delta. Sixteen marines, who courageously fought to defend our country, died from this unfortunate event. One of those marines was Sergeant Joe Murray of Jacksonville, Florida. I would like to take this moment to express our deepest condolences to Sergeant Murray’s family and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. Sergeant Murray was a husband to Gayle Murray, and a father of four beautiful children—Isaac; Annabelle; and twins, Judah and Micah. He was known for being a family man who cared deeply for those around him. Murray was a member of a special operations team and was promoted three times in the first 3 years he was in the Marine Corps and was deployed to Afghanistan twice. The son of a Navy man, Sergeant Murray will always be remembered as a true American hero. I will continue to pray for him and his family and for every soldier out there protecting our great country. May he rest in peace, and semper fi. 
WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, there are 20,000 open jobs in Kansas and an unemployment rate of 3 percent. This is a 16year low for our State. However, we face only a 63 percent national workforce participation rate. Almost 40 percent of our country’s labor force has given up on finding a job, or has lost motivation to work. In Kansas, a top concern I have heard over our 40 townhalls this year is the need for a stronger workforce. My colleagues and I must start work on a welfare to work program—a set of policies that will empower people to find a job that lifts them out of poverty and lifts their spirit with a sense of purpose. Let’s empower those across the country to get the training they need for a rewarding career and a quality of life that turns the tide of poverty and uncertainty toward personal and societal prosperity. 
BORDER WALL FUNDING (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. TORRES. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my disappointment that Republican leadership has added something as controversial as funding for the border wall to a critical bill funding our Nation’s defense. There is a reason those who live on the border and know the region best don’t want this wall. They know this wall won’t keep us safe, and they know it won’t stop illegal immigration. Instead of wasting $1.6 billion in taxpayer dollars on a piece of security theater, DHS should focus its limited resources on its declared mission, which is ‘‘to safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values.’’ This wall does none of that. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stop playing politics with our security and bring a clean bill to the floor. 
CELEBRATING CRARY ART GALLERY’S 40TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th anniversary of one of the treasures of the Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District, the Crary Art Gallery. The Crary Art Gallery was established in 1977 in Warren, Pennsylvania, by painter Gene Crary, and featured works by her late husband, the photographer, Clare J. Crary. In 1988, the gallery expanded to include the Oriental Room and the Fountain Room. Its reopening in 2000 brought the addition of the Sculpture Court, featuring works by Marion Sanford. Today, the Crary Art Gallery is dedicated to enriching the region’s cultural offerings through noteworthy temporary exhibitions and the display of historical works. Beginning August 18, the gallery will celebrate its 40th anniversary with the Ruby Exhibition, which will fill the entire museum with the finest works from its Permanent Collection, much of which has not been seen in many years. I wish the Crary Art Gallery the best as it celebrates 40 incredible years of enriching the lives of those in the community with its invaluable cultural impact. f 
CELEBRATING ESTES PARK’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of Estes Park, Colorado—the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and one of the many treasured mountain towns in our beautiful Second Congressional District of Colorado. Over 150 years ago, pioneers of the mountain west settled in Estes Park. Homesteaders came from all walks of life. In April of 1917, the formal incorporation of the town of Estes Park took place, ensuring our community could continue to serve the growing needs of those living in and visiting the beautiful valley. Since its incorporation, Estes Park has been a vital community partner in growing the outdoor recreation economy, playing host to 4.5 million visitors to Rocky Mountain National Park, making it the single most popular tourist attraction in our entire State. The iconic Stanley Hotel and the Historic Park Theatre are just a few of the iconic landmarks in Estes Park. Estes Park’s ZIP Code is 80517, and on August 5, 2017—8/5/17—Estes Park will have its official centennial celebration—80517. I am incredibly proud to represent the community of Estes Park and its citizens in Congress, and I am thrilled to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Estes Park. 
RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF JOHN AND KAREN SHIMKUS (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, as my colleague from Colorado recognized the 100th anniversary of Estes Park, I take to the floor to thank my wife for putting up with me for 30 years—30 years ago today. Madam Speaker, as we all know, behind every good man is a great woman. I wanted to come to the floor to thank her for helping raise our three boys, helping make sure that we attend church faithfully, and putting up with the hectic life that a lot of our constituents don’t understand living in two places at one time, trying to manage a family in another State, while we are gone almost half of the year. So I come to the floor just to pause and thank my beautiful wife, Karen, for sticking with me for 30 years. f 
b1230 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 111, PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION RELATING TO ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 468 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 468 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 111) providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection relating to ‘‘Arbitration Agreements’’. All points of order against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. WALORSKI ). The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying resolution. Congressional Review Act resolutions must follow a prescribed form according to law. This rule provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 111 in keeping with that form. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today to prevent Federal overreach by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, also known as the CFPB. According to the D.C. Circuit Court, this unaccountable government agency has more unilateral authority than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the United States Government. On July 10, 2017, the CFPB exercised that vast authority by issuing a 776 page final rule that restricts the ability of consumers to enter into arbitration agreements. The CFPB’s misguided rule effectively eliminates arbitration clauses, instead forcing consumers into significantly more burdensome court proceedings. Eliminating this overbearing rule is a big win for consumers. Arbitration is an alternative to the judicial system, and it often results in a better outcome for consumers. According to the CFPB’s own study, arbitration can be up to 12 times faster than litigation. This study also found that a class action lawsuit’s average payout was just $32 per person, not even close to the $5,389 awarded on average from arbitration. Moreover, it costs less for consumers to file an arbitration complaint than it does to file a new complaint in Federal court, making the arbitration system more accessible to all Americans. Arbitration allows parties to use an independent mediator, instead of hiring expensive lawyers, to settle a dispute. While the rule promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a bad deal for consumers, it is a huge win for trial lawyers, who make an average of $1 million per case. The legislation being considered today would eliminate the CFPB’s prohibition on an individual’s right to enter into contracts that include arbitration agreements. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to eliminate a rule from the executive branch, and prevents a substantially similar rule from being proposed in its place. Checks and balances between the three branches of government are the cornerstone of our Constitution. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to exercise our Article I authority and stop executive overreach that was never intended by the original legislation. The Congressional Review Act is a powerful tool because it only requires 51 votes to pass in the Senate. To date, Congress has passed 14 CRAs that have been signed by the President. One by one, we have eliminated Obama administration rules that harm Americans and small businesses across this country. Despite the work we have ahead, these CRAs are important to bringing regulatory relief to millions of Americans. President Trump campaigned on a promise to end government overregulation that hurts Americans and small businesses. He turned those words into action by signing an executive order that requires two regulations be eliminated for every new regulation that is proposed. President Trump has exceeded those expectations in his first 6 months. For every new proposed rule, he has eliminated 16 regulations. Unfortunately, he has limited tools to rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, because it was designed to be unaccountable under DoddFrank. This is an agency that continues to be run by an unchecked Director. The structure of the bureau has even been ruled unconstitutional by the judicial branch. A few weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed legislation to restructure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, restoring congressional oversight duties and moving the agency back under the regular legislative appropriations process. I hope the Senate will consider this bill and bring accountability to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and the underlying bill, and eliminate the bad antiarbitration rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying legislation, H.J. Res. 111, disapproval of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s arbitration rule. Before turning to the underlying legislation, I want to raise concerns about the bulk of the work this week, which is the socalled minibus appropriations bill, in which this body will seek to spend over $700 billion of deficit expenditures. That funding bill combines four major appropriations bills and represents more than half of discretionary spending. It includes our spending for the legislative branch, veterans, energy and water, and the Department of Defense. Unfortunately, there is additional deficit spending that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided to put in the bill, providing $1.6 billion to build a border wall, directly contrary to the promises President Trump made on the campaign trail that another country would pay for the wall. Republicans are seeking to pass the bill to you, Madam Speaker, and our fellow taxpayers to pay for this wall, in direct violation of President Trump’s promise. They also stripped out a bipartisan amendment by Representative LEE that would end the 2001 AUMF and require Congress to come up with a new Authorization for Use of Military Force within 8 months that was placed into this bill in committee. Representative LEE’s amendment was stripped out by the Rules Committee despite it being in the committee mark and despite bipartisan support to require an Authorization for Use of Military Force. We really need to start making some decisions about the direction of our military. Representative LEE’s amendment would have forced Congress to have that discussion. Congress, unfortunately, seems to only work—or works best—when we are on the clock, the day or two before the expiration of funding, the day or two before an arbitrary time limit. This would apply a similar test to force Congress to have a discussion around the Authorization for Use of Military Force. I have full confidence that, had that time not been met, Democrats and Republicans could have provided additional shortterm extensions for the Authorization for Use of Military Force until such time Congress could come together to pass a new one, agree with the Senate, and send it to the President’s desk. Now on to the matters at hand. This underlying resolution of disapproval weakens consumer protections while protecting big banks rather than consumers. This rule was crafted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help restore consumer rights and give consumers the ability to join together when they are taken advantage of by big banks. Instead of debating ways to improve consumer protections or increase access to financial services, my colleagues instead have brought a Congressional Review Act resolution that would stop our own financial safety mechanisms from taking any future action on arbitration clauses in consumer financial products. Now, we have all seen these arbitration clauses. You might need a magnifying glass because the font is small, the contract is large. Even sophisticated consumers often don’t know that by unilaterally signing those rights away, they are removing their ability to address their grievances in court. In many cases, removing the ability to have any justice because when you have a large class, each of whom suffers a small amount of damage, even the cost of administering an arbitration claim can be prohibitive if the claim per affected individual is $50, $75, or $100. Absent these kinds of protections, you give broad license for big banks to rip off large numbers of consumers and take a small amount of money from each of them. That is what this rule is intended to prevent. The House Financial Services Committee did not hold any hearings on this rule. It didn’t go through committee. It appeared just a few days ago when it was introduced. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau didn’t have the opportunity to testify about their studies or their findings, or the process they went through to finalize the rule, including input from the general public. Congress has authorized the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to examine the use of arbitration agreements by financial institutions and 
consumer contracts; and, if necessary, to take appropriate steps to limit the use of them, to prevent arbitration agreements from being forced on consumers. In any particular case, both sides can certainly agree to arbitration. Given the choice, many consumers will choose arbitration. This is about forcing consumers and giving them no alternative but to give away their rights to sue in a court of law in favor of an arbitration process. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that 90 percent of arbitration agreements built into the fine point of financial consumer products actually do prohibit class action lawsuits. In cases involving credit card issuers, companies being sued used the arbitration clauses buried in the fine print contract to block class action lawsuits 65 percent of the time. Again, even with the lower costs of administering an arbitration case, it is prohibitive if the claim per person is relatively small. So we are talking about situations where people are illegally ripped off of $20, of $100, of their annual credit card processing fee illegally charged. Their redress, absent a class action, is essentially nonexistent because even though the cost of pursuing an arbitration case is significantly less than the courts, they still can either take up an enormous amount of time or, if you hire outside counsel, thousands of dollars. Thank goodness, not the hundreds of thousands of dollars that a full court case can entail, but certainly thousands of dollars. And if you were deprived of $30 or $50, are you just supposed to accept it? Or can hundreds or thousands of people who were ripped off band together and seek justice, as this rule would allow for? Long before the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took any action, the Department of Defense already recognized that forced arbitration clauses in consumer loans to servicemembers stripped away the rights of servicemembers and ultimately banned forced arbitration clauses in consumer loan products made to servicemembers. We don’t want people taking advantage of members of our military. So, too, we don’t want anybody taking advantage of members of the American public. But we know that big banks don’t want consumers to have more power when it comes to financial products. They prefer the deck remained stacked against consumers, even when a bank or a credit card company breaks the law. When it comes to financial service products, most consumers are entirely at the mercy of our financial institutions. These arbitration clauses are buried in pages and pages of small print and disclosures that are very technical for people with a college degree, no less a high school degree, no less not even graduating from high school. The consumer doesn’t have the ability to modify the contract before they sign it—take it or leave it—or negotiate on any type of footing equally with the bank. They are left with a takeitorleaveit choice. According to the Bureau study, more than 75 percent of consumers surveyed did not know whether they were subject to an arbitration clause in their agreements, and less than 7 percent knew that those clauses limit their ability to bring a claim to court. That means 93 percent of the people who sign these agreements don’t even realize they are signing their right to sue away, and that is because they are buried in fine print, are unclear, and run contrary to the fundamental American principle of the ability to seek justice when you are wronged. This final rule restores consumer rights to band together when there is a systemic and widespread form of misconduct by a bank. This resolution of disapproval would stop consumers from even knowing if others were harmed in a similar manner by the same bank or lender so they could potentially band together. I am glad that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau final rule actually gave some power back to consumers. And now here we have the Republicans trying to take that power right away and give it back to the big banks. Madam Speaker, I would like to include in the RECORD a letter signed by 310 organizations that include civil rights, faithbased, and consumer advocacy groups that support the arbitration rule. 
JULY12, 2017. Re Final Rule on Arbitration Agreements. MONICA JACKSON , Office of the Executive Secretary, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Washington DC. The 310 undersigned consumer, civil rights, labor, community, and nonprofit organizations write to state our strong support for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)’s final rule to limit predispute binding mandatory (or forced) arbitration clauses in consumer finance contracts. The rule, which will restore consumers’ ability to band together in court to pursue claims, is a significant step forward in the ongoing fight to curb predatory practices in consumer financial products and services and to make these markets fairer and safer. Lenders and other financial services companies use forced arbitration to push consumers out of court and into a private arbitration system that is tilted against them. Forced arbitration eliminates the right to a civil jury trial, limits discovery, restricts or prohibits public disclosure of proceedings and outcomes, and makes meaningful appeals virtually impossible. It also often prohibits consumers from banding together in a class action to hold the company responsible. Recent scandals again demonstrate the very real harm forced arbitration causes consumers. Reports show that customers had been trying to sue financial services institutions over fraudulent accounts going back a number of years. However, some banks forced those customers into secret, binding arbitration by invoking fine print in consumers’ legitimate account agreements to block them from suing over reasons as outrageous as fake accounts, also helping to keep the scandal out of the public eye. Even in cases where widespread fraud has been exposed, banks continue to invoke these fine print clauses to kill lawsuits stemming from their illegal acts and block consumer recovery. The CFPB’s thorough arbitration study further documents how forced arbitration blocks consumer access to courts, shielding banks and lenders from meaningful accountability for their unlawful behavior. Finalizing the proposed rule will restore crucial class action rights that deter systemic abuses and bring muchneeded transparency to consumer financial arbitration. THE CFPB STUDY DATA SHOWS THAT FORCED AR BITRATION ELIMINATES CONSUMER CLAIMS  
AND SHIELDS COMPANIES FROM ACCOUNT ABILITY  The CFPB’s study verified the prevalence of forced arbitration clauses—including class action bans—in consumer financial contracts and found that this practice impacts tens of millions of consumers. Yet it also revealed that consumers typically have no idea they are signing away their right to sue in court when they participate in the financial marketplace. The most obvious impact of forced arbitration clauses is that they block most consumer claims from going forward at all. Class action bans prevent consumers from bringing complaints of fraud or other abusive or deceptive practices in financial services because the individual value of these claims is often too small for a single consumer to afford to bring alone. Without the option to join together in a class action, just 25 consumers with claims of under $1,000 pursued arbitration each year. In a county of over 320 million, these numbers leave no doubt that class action bans effectively wipe out consumer claims and thus shield corporate wrongdoers from liability. In the few claims that went to arbitration, the study also confirmed that forced arbitration overwhelmingly favors industry over consumers. 
CONSUMERS CHEATED BY SYSTEMIC WRONG DOING AND DETER RISKY OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT  The data makes clear that class actions provide a practical way for groups of consumers who have suffered the same kind of abuse from the same corporate wrongdoer to join together to attempt to hold the financial institution accountable. The CFPB study found that 34 million consumers received a total of $2.2 billion in cash payments, debt forbearance, and other inkind relief from 2008–2012—not including any attorneys’ fees or court costs. These findings were echoed in an empirical study by disinterested academics, which found consumer class actions against illegal overdraft fees ‘‘deliver[ed] fair compensation to a significant portion of class members.’’ Several major banks settled class actions that claimed the banks had purposely reordered consumer transactions to maximize the amount of overdraft fees charged to the consumer. This study found that plaintiffs in these cases recovered up to ‘‘65% of damages, with the variation based largely on the strength of the class’s claims and the likelihood of winning certification of the class.’’ Yet unknown thousands of other consumers subject to similarly unlawful overdraft fee practices likely got little or no relief when class actions against their banks were dismissed due to arbitration clauses. Even assuming that their claims would be fairly resolved in arbitration, leaving 34 million consumers to find their own attorney, establish the individual facts of their case, and take time off work to attend an arbitration will never be more efficient than pooling time and resources between millions of 
consumers harmed in the same way by the same bank or lender to challenge abusive practices. Indeed, additional empirical scholarship demonstrates that most consumers are unaware when they have been harmed, unaware that the harm violates a law, or have decided that filing individual claims is not worth their time and expense. Collective action is critically important, not only for enabling those already victimized to obtain justice, but also for deterring bad behavior and preventing harm to other victims. While each individual consumer may only lose $25 or $50 to a fraudulent charge or illegal fee, for example, unlawful practices implemented at a systemic level can add up to millions or more in illgotten gains for banks and lenders who violate the law. Government enforcers have limited resources, and the prospect of class actions helps ensure that banks and lenders obey legal requirements that protect consumers. 
CRUCIAL TRANSPARENCY TO ARBITRATION  Our organizations strongly support the proposed provision to begin shining a light on individual arbitrations through reporting requirements. Unlike our legal system, which is built upon hundreds of years of precedent, common law principles, and statutory standards of fairness and ethics, arbitration firms have few constraints on their practices and scant record of their proceedings. The substantially shorter history of consumer arbitration has nonetheless produced both anecdotal claims of unethical behavior and documented systemic abuses by unregulated arbitration films. The rule’s reporting requirements will lend crucial transparency and accountability to a previously opaque system. Increased transparency can help consumers make informed decisions when choosing how to pursue their claim, in line with wellestablished principles of the free market. Data collected by the CFPB will also help other government entities, as well as the general public, ensure that arbitrators operate within the law and treat all parties fairly. 
THE RULE IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND FOR  
THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS  Because forced arbitration undermines compliance with laws and creates an uneven playing field between corporations that use forced arbitration and those that allow for greater consumer choice in dispute resolution, it is in the public interest and in the interest of consumer protection to prohibit or strictly curtail the use of forced arbitration clauses in consumer financial contracts. We commend the CFPB for finalizing its rule to restore consumers’ right to choose how to resolve disputes with financial institutions and address the public harm caused by forced arbitration, as thoroughly documented in its threeyear, comprehensive study. Thank you for the opportunity to share our views.

Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, this letter, which I think my colleagues will find convincing, has 310 groups that have signed on in support of this rule, including groups from across the ideological spectrum, across the States, many faithbased groups, and many others, including from my friend from Colorado’s and my home State, the Interfaith Alliance of Colorado; the National Council of Jewish Women, Colorado Section; the NAACP State Conference of Colorado; the Colorado Fiscal Institute; the Colorado Council of Churches; the Colorado Alliance of Retired Americans, and many others. b1245 So I am glad that this will appear in the RECORD for all of Congress to see. I will encourage my colleagues to read this letter and see who signed it before casting your vote on the repeal of this rule, the Congressional disapproval resolution. So this will appear in the RECORD , and I know that my colleagues will study that RECORD before making their decision. Prior to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal consumer protection laws were enforced by a number of different regulators and different agencies. This was uneven and, after the 2008 financial crisis, I was personally glad that we were able to pull together the efforts to protect consumers in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But despite their success, Republicans have been going after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ever since. Despite record profits by banks and Wall Street, here we are trying to go back to a time when there was nobody to keep them in check. Despite the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau returning nearly $12 billion to harmed consumers, the Republicans continue to attack the agency. This is entirely the purpose that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created, this type of rule. Congress specifically authorized the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to study forced arbitration agreements, and determine what steps were necessary. The Bureau undertook an extensive rulemaking process that had public comments. I hope my colleagues across the aisle who support this repeal were active in that public comment process because that was an important time to be heard. The banks participated in that, consumer groups, and so many other stakeholders before the final rule was issued. My colleagues across the aisle have not offered any evidence in support of this resolution of disapproval. Why are you seeking to strip rights away from consumers in this fashion? The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that just 400 consumers per year pursue claims in arbitration, with only 16 receiving any cash relief. Again, when you are ripped off of a relatively small amount of money, you don’t have redress in the courts as a sole plaintiff. You don’t have redress— I shouldn’t say you don’t; you technically do—you don’t have an economic form of redress in the courts, and you don’t have an economically viable form of redress through arbitration. So the only true mechanism, if you have a million people, each of whom are deprived of $20 or $50, the only realistic legal mechanism is a class action lawsuit, which this rule would protect. There is also no evidence to show, no studies—I would challenge my colleagues to cite them if there are—to show that removing this type of clause can somehow increase costs to consumers. Frankly, this resolution of disapproval is just a giveaway to big banks at the expense of you, me, everybody who has a credit card, everybody who has a loan—the wrong direction for the country. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. R OTHFUS ), the author of this resolution. Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on all of my colleagues to support this resolution and the underlying legislation, H.J. Res. 111. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s antiarbitration rule will cause a great deal of harm to consumers, including consumers who wish to settle a dispute with a firm in a timely and effective fashion, as well as other consumers who will see their options and choices diminished and their costs increased by this rule. The CFPB’s rule will hurt the very people the CFPB claims it is supposed to help by depriving individuals of the efficient and effective process of arbitration. The CFPB itself acknowledged that arbitration is 12 times faster, on average, than class actions. In today’s fastpaced economy, hardworking Americans may want to pursue a quicker option than becoming a party to costly and timeconsuming litigation that can take years. Not only are class actions burdensome in terms of time, but they often produce negligible benefits for the plaintiffs in question. In fact, class actions reviewed in the CFPB study resulted in an average recovery of only 
$32 per class member. This is so minuscule that the firms being sued are forced to charge their customers additional fees, which fees may be larger than the initial recovery to cover the costs of the firm’s legal fees. This often leaves customers worse off financially than if they had never chosen to settle their dispute. Contrast this negligible or nonexistent relief and headache it causes consumers with the average $5,300 of relief that consumers obtained through arbitration in the cases that the CFPB reviewed in its own study. Contrast the $32 average individual recovery as well with the average $1 million that plaintiff lawyers make per settled case. Madam Speaker, consider also the fact that 87 percent of class actions generate no benefits for consumers whatsoever because they are dismissed by the Court or settled with the named plaintiff only. In addition to the direct harm the CFPB’s antiarbitration rule will cause to consumers, it will also have negative effects on a variety of companies and firms that will have to prepare themselves for falling victim to costly litigation. In light of that, they will be unlikely to direct any financial resources toward providing their customers even the option for arbitration. In addition, many firms are unavailable to survive such costly litigation, meaning they will either go out of business or be forced to stop offering certain products and services. How will this benefit consumers? It won’t. It will make their purchases costlier and the products and services they need more difficult to find. If you want to help ensure consumer recoveries and justice—and we all do— depriving them of the most efficient and most remunerative option is not the answer. Sadly, that is precisely what will result from the CFPB’s misguided, anticonsumer rule. The CFPB’s antiarbitration rule will close the door to recovery for consumers, but open the door for million dollar trial attorney’s fees. The underlying legislation considered today will reopen the door to consumer recovery. Mr. POLIS. It is wonderful to have so many Coloradans here, isn’t it, Madam Speaker? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Absolutely. Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), another great State that borders the State of Colorado. Mr. DOGGETT. It once included the State of Colorado, or part of it. Madam Speaker, I think Republicans are just scared. They are afraid to leave town this week without doing another favor for Wall Street, and this proposal to undermine consumer rights is the next gift that they want to bestow on the big banks. Republicans can never seem to find their voice, no matter how outrageous the latest Trump tweet might be. They cannot pass meaningful legislation on other subjects, but they feel compelled to answer when Wall Street comes ‘‘a calling,’’ as it has on this bill. Only last month, Republicans approved a bill to give Trump the power to fire the chief cop on the beat; that would be the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who Trump could now dump for actually trying to do his job of protecting consumers from abusive financial practices. Of course, we see daily that Trump thinks the White House is just a new venue for the latest sequel of ‘‘The Apprentice,’’ with him declaring ‘‘you’re fired’’ to one person after another, no matter how much damage he does to our national security or to the economic security of families that are struggling to make a go of it all over America. Well, today’s Republican gift to Wall Street is about denying any effective remedy to those who are abused by big banks. A bank can rightfully go to court if a consumer abuses it, and that happens every day in courts across America, with good reason, because it is not a oneway street. But in the nonnegotiable, deceitful fine print at the back of the contract, the bank can deny the consumer the very same opportunity to go to court if that consumer is abused. It is called arbitration, but what it really means is that if a consumer has been treated wrong, neither a judge nor a jury can ever evaluate the facts and conclude for the consumer. Since usually the arbitrator depends upon the same bank or group of banks to get repeat business, the arbitrator has an incentive to rule against the consumer and for the bank. Often arbitration is little better than going to the bank’s own attorney and asking: Do you think your client did anything wrong? And if so, should they do any more than say ‘‘I’m sorry’’? Arbitration is the very scheme that Wells Fargo relied upon to obstruct any opportunity for ordinary consumers who tried to hold their bank accountable for creating accounts to which they never gave any consent and charging them for it. Wells Fargo used those arbitration clauses to kick the consumers out of court and to continue its fraud against consumers across America for another 2 years. That is the kind of practice that we will have more of if this legislation is approved. You know, in the Military Lending Act of 2007, Congress showed the good sense to try to protect our servicemembers who are defending our country all over the world in certain of their loan agreements from having a lender impose a mandatory arbitration agreement. And what, today, we should be doing is supporting similar protections for other Americans who can be exposed to the same type of abuse. Today’s bill to undermine consumer protection is opposed by The Military Coalition and 29 other servicemember and veterans groups representing millions of people. This sorry bill is also opposed by a number—I think literally hundreds of consumer, civil rights, labor, and community groups. All we are saying in rejecting this bill is to give consumers their day in court, give them the same rights the banks want. In fact, treat consumers as if they were banks because they should be treated with the same dignity and the same rights; and we do that by rejecting this bill and rejecting it soundly. Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER ), the chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) for his help in quickly bringing this resolution to the floor. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying resolution, which would block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from denying the American people the use of arbitration as a means to resolve consumer complaints. Since the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, consumer costs have gone up and access to financial products has been severely restricted. In some cases, access has evaporated altogether. The Bureau’s arbitration rule is proof of what we have said for years: the CFPB does not operate in the best interest of American consumers. It does not protect the American people, their access to financial products, or their ability to achieve financial independence. Take as evidence the CFPB’s own study on arbitration. It shows that just 13 percent of class action suits actually provided a benefit to consumers, with an average payout of $32. Let me say that again: an average payout of $32. Arbitration, on the other hand, provides an average of more than $5,000— let me say that again: over $5,000—to the aggrieved parties. Again, these figures come from the Bureau’s own analysis, their own study. The fact that they cannot somehow justify this rule in the name of consumer protection should offend every single person on this floor today, Madam Speaker. Simply put, this rule is anticonsumer. It hurts the very people the CFPB purports to protect. It is yet another example of the Washington knowsbest attitude that makes the American people so mad. This is also why Congress has the oversight tools granted under the Congressional Review Act. In this instance, it is time for Congress to intervene on behalf of the people we represent. We have argued about the CFPB in the past, but the reality is that this rule, in particular, will have devastating consequences for American consumers. It should serve as a dramatic wakeup call for the need to restrain what is the most powerful and 
unaccountable government agency in the history of our Nation. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ) and Chairman HENSARLING for their steadfast leadership on this very important issue. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues for their support on the rule and the underlying measure. b1300 Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ). Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. POLIS, for yielding me the time. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the rule and underlying bill by my Republican colleagues. The Republican bill favors big Wall Street megabanks and financial interests over the American people. I would ask my Republican friends: Don’t you remember the financial crash of 2008 and who created it? Their bill repeals a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule which cuts down on those companies’ abilities to use socalled forced arbitration clauses which prevent cheated or defrauded consumers from going to court. In other words, they prevent the victims from going to court. They want to handcuff the customers, not the megabanks that took them to the cleaners. This takes us back to the days of when the fine print in the credit card or other financial agreement prevented consumers from banding together in class action lawsuits to challenge illegal behavior by the most powerful financial giants in the world. Try to deal with one of them as an individual. They don’t even return phone calls, for heaven’s sake. You get in that robo system for hours and hours, and then the phone call cuts off. Republicans want to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, even after the agency’s work for consumers resulted in $12 billion in relief to 27 million Americans who were harmed, and that is just the beginning. Why is this Republicanled Congress so keen on protecting companies like Wells Fargo that used arbitration clauses and class action bans to create fraudulent accounts, overcharge customers with debit fees and mortgages, and even avoid responsibility for their misconduct? Criminal misconduct. You can laugh. Come and meet the millions of people who have lost their homes across this country or are underwater on their mortgages. There is no justice for them. The idea that banks can rip off consumers by abusing obscure clauses buried deep in their contracts is totally outrageous. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. KAPTUR. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule banning the use of these clauses is simply a commonsense step to ensure that all consumers have equal access to justice. This is the people’s House. We should protect consumers from the wolves. Our job is to keep them at bay, not make it easier for them to prey on the American people. This is not what President Trump ran on. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ and stand with America’s consumers over special interests, particularly the financial predators that brought this country to ruin. Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, for months now we have been debating bills that hurt hardworking Americans—bills that kick millions, tens of millions, of people off health insurance; bills that gut safety and environmental protections that would keep our air clean; bills that prioritize the interests of Wall Street over Main Street. This is not what my constituents want. It is also not what the constituents of many of us want. Madam Speaker, for this reason, Democrats have unveiled an agenda to increase wages, reduce costs for everyday expenses, and give workers the training they need to compete in 21st century jobs. Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative POCAN ’s Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills Act, H.R. 2933, which would promote effective apprenticeships that would give students and workers more opportunities to find goodpaying jobs. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote of the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, we have less than 4 days left before the scheduled August recess. I hope in that time we can focus on strengthening the economy and empowering consumers rather than taking away consumers’ rights, like this bill does. We should focus on fixing our broken immigration system to create more economic growth and reduce our deficit, and we should create jobs and make sure that more people are covered by healthcare, not less. Instead, here we are, spending time on the floor of the House stripping away consumer protections and spending American taxpayer money on an unwanted border wall, in direct violation of President Trump’s promise. Madam Speaker, I oppose this rule, and I oppose the underlying legislation. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on both, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been a continuous example of Federal overreach. Once again, bureaucrats in Washington have created a rule that will hurt consumers and make their lives more difficult. The last 8 years of overregulation have crippled our economy. Today, we have a chance to end this antiarbitration rule and empower consumers with an alternative to spending years in a courtroom. We can’t let concerns about the trial lawyer lobby impact the way we treat consumers. Trial lawyers love this rule enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because they will be the biggest beneficiaries. They will walk home with the big winnings, while the individuals who have been harmed walk away with little. Arbitration allows harmed individuals to receive payouts on the merits of their case without enriching the pockets of trial lawyers at the same time. This legislation is for consumers. It is for the average American who relies on our financial system every day. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman SESSIONS and Chairman H ENSARLING  for bringing this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues now to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the resolution, and then to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 468 O FFERED BY  MR. POLIS At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2933) to promote effective registered apprenticeships, for skills, credentials, and employment, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 2933. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not 
merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question.

b1337 So the resolution was agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act of 2017. I am pleased that Chairman BRADY , along with Health Subcommittee Chairman TIBERI , Ranking Member LEVIN, and I worked in a bipartisan manner to draft this legislation. It brings together a number of important measures to improve Medicare part B. I encourage all of our colleagues to support it. As I said during the bipartisan Ways and Means Committee markup of H.R. 3178, I hope the committee will be able to hold more meetings like this. This is what the American people want and expect from their Members: to get things done in a bipartisan manner. The bill before us today is pretty straightforward. It makes important changes to Medicare part B in a number of ways. It includes a commonsense transitional policy for home infusion services, cosponsored by Mr. TIBERI and Mr. PASCRELL . Our colleagues Mr. BISHOP and Mr. MIKETHOMPSON are cosponsors of language to streamline Medicare rules to improve access to medically necessary prosthetics and orthotics. Mr. JOHN LEWIS cosponsored language to help dialysis facilities improve backlogs so they can more efficiently treat endstage renal disease. Ms. DELBENE and Mr. M IKETHOMP SONare cosponsors of a bill that allows telehealth so patients can receive dialysis in the comfort of their own home. Finally, the measure includes clarification language to Stark laws that Mr. KINDled to provide more certainty for Medicare providers. Our colleagues on both sides of the aisle worked hard on these bills, and I am pleased we can move them forward in a bipartisan manner. Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3178, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TIBERI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I stand in this Chamber today in strong support of H.R. 3178, a package of bipartisan policies centered on improving care for Medicare beneficiaries across several areas. In particular, H.R. 3178 includes a bill that I introduced with my friend and colleague from New Jersey, Mr. BILL PASCRELL , that provides a temporary transitional payment for home infusion providers. The 21st Century Cures Act created a new reimbursement benefit for home infusion therapies beginning in 2021. This new temporary transitional payment will bridge the potential gap in care for beneficiaries, and home infusion providers will continue to administer these therapies without going bankrupt. This legislation includes other good public policies that further encourage giving seniors the choice to receive more care in the comfort of their own homes, as well as expanding access to providers, particularly in rural and in needy areas. I would like to thank my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for their support. I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their commitment to working on this issue, especially MICHAEL BURGESS , as well as Chairman Emeritus FRED UPTON , who helped pave the way for these policies with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act. Madam Speaker, I would like to conclude with a commitment that this is not an end for policies encouraging care—especially drug infusion—in the home for patients who choose to do so. We look forward to working with the administration and clarifying current rules to ensure we successfully implement both this legislation and future policies to ensure inclusion of payment for all drugs needed by the home infusion patient community. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I want to thank all my colleagues who worked in a bipartisan manner to make it happen. Patients and providers in my district and across the country will benefit from these important improvements, and I am proud to support them. Two provisions come from bipartisan bills that I have worked on for a number of years. The first helps patients get the devices they need while keeping fraudulent providers out of Medicare. The change we are debating today 
will ensure that any documentation created by device experts will be included in a patient’s medical record to support the physician’s directions. The second provision that I authored comes from the comprehensive telehealth packages that I have been working on with Representative BLACK and our colleagues from the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. WELCH and Mr. HARPER . This change will allow for virtual visits and remote patient monitoring for kidney failure patients living at home. Letting these patients utilize telehealth ensures that they can access the services they need from the setting that they prefer: their homes. This bill is another step forward in the expansion of telehealth, but we can do a lot more. Our telehealth bills offer a menu of options for moving forward. Policies like paying for telestroke services or adding telehealth to the Medicare Advantage program have bipartisan support among both Houses, as well as a broad coalition of support from stakeholders. We know they save money. I have worked on telehealth for decades. When I was in the California State Senate, I wrote the State’s first telehealth legislation to bring critical services to folks enrolled in the State Medicaid program. That was in 1996. Now it is 2017, and we still haven’t passed, in Congress, comprehensive telehealth legislation that would expand access for Medicare beneficiaries. It is long past time for Congress to come to the conclusion that California reached long ago: telehealth saves money, and it saves lives. I am optimistic that the passage of this bill is just a small sample of what is to come in regard to telehealth in the future. Mr. TIBERI. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), chairman of the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a leader on healthcare issues. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act of 2017. This bill represents a series of bipartisan reforms from the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means that will provide targeted reforms to improve access to care for Medicare beneficiaries. Home infusion patients are oftentimes our Nation’s sickest and most vulnerable, and maintaining access to these services in home settings has proved invaluable in ensuring that patients can continue to effectively receive the care that they need. Under last year’s 21st Century Cures Act, we took the necessary steps to ensure that taxpayers and beneficiaries were no longer overcharged on the acquisition and dispensing costs associated with home infusion. Additionally, we took complementary steps to recognize the unique education needs associated with receiving infusion in the home. However, as my subcommittee learned in a hearing on this issue just last week, there is still more that must be done to integrate these two policies without jeopardizing access to patient care. Therefore, today’s bill creates a bridge to connect these critical policies and to resolve the issue. Additionally, H.R. 3178 takes an additional needed step to protect home health services by expanding opportunities for individuals to receive home dialysis. Access to services like home infusion and home dialysis has had a significant impact in my home State of Texas, and I am encouraged by today’s bill, as it will build upon these additional successes for Texans and all Americans. I would like to thank Chairman BRADY , Chairman T IBERI , and Chairman WALDEN for their leadership on the bill. They rose to the challenge to address these tough policy decisions. This bill is a product of their hard work, as well as the hard work of all the staff involved at the subcommittee and full committee level, and I thank them as well. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ). Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act. I am pleased that the bill before us today includes legislation that I introduced with my good friend PATTIBERI  from Ohio, the Medicare Part B Home Infusion Services Temporary Transitional Payment Act. Listening to Mr. TIBERI and Mr. NEAL, I believe what they say should resonate across the Hill. This can’t be one and done. Bipartisanship is something that should be contagious, particularly as we are talking about a healthcare event which is important and may mean life or death to many of our citizens. Home infusion is an essential treatment option for individuals suffering from many, many debilitating diseases like cancer, congestive heart failure, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The 21st Century Cures Act, which became law last year, correctly adjusted payments for home infusion drugs and would establish a new home infusion nursing benefit within Medicare beginning in 2021. However, we have heard concerns that the payment adjustment going into effect before the nursing benefit is implemented could jeopardize access to home infusion in the interim. The bill that Congressman TIBERI from Ohio and I introduced would address that concern by creating a temporary nursing benefit until the new permanent benefit can be implemented. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3178. Mr. TIBERI. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. JENKINS ), a valuable member of our Health Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee. Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act of 2017, which includes my legislation, the Dialysis Certification Act. Kansas currently ranks among the top three longest wait times for dialysis center surveys. The lack of manpower at the State administrative agency that contracts with CMS for these surveys has left some clinics waiting 2 years for a certification. This bill gives dialysis providers the opportunity to receive surveys and certifications from a CMSapproved third party accreditor, much like hospitals are able to do now. b1400 Those thirdparty organizations must demonstrate their standards are as good as or better than the standards used by CMS, and the Secretary must approve them. I toured several clinics in my district last year, and I was frustrated to learn that a stateoftheart clinic, necessary to fill a need in Topeka for ESRD patients, has been waiting 2 years for an initial survey, and a clinic in Pittsburg, Kansas, has been waiting for 250 days. Without these clinics, patients are forced to find clinics much further away, which, depending on the access to transportation, can be a barrier to treatment. That is unacceptable, and this problem will be easily solved by this provision. I want to thank my cosponsor, Congressman JOHNLEWIS, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee chairmen for quickly moving this bill to the House floor for action. This provision will allow dialysis clinics across America to more easily obtain a survey so they may serve patients that depend on their care. Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DELBENE), who is a coauthor of this legislation. Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the chair and the ranking member for working with me to include a proposal in this bill that I developed with Congresswoman BLACK , Congressman THOMPSON , and Congressman MEEHAN modernizing Medicare and harnessing the promise of telehealth to improve care for patients nationwide. Allowing patients with endstage renal disease to receive dialysis at home can dramatically improve their health outcomes and quality of life. This is something I have heard consistently from providers in my home State of Washington, like the Northwest Kidney Centers, who do incredible work to help patients receive dialysis at home when it is medically appropriate. Advances in telehealth hold great potential to extend this treatment option to more Americans, particularly in rural communities, but there are still too many barriers to the use of cuttingedge technologies in Medicare. 
There is a great need to update our laws to reflect these innovations and reimburse telehealth appropriately; otherwise, we won’t just be denying access to healthcare today, we could be preventing the next frontier of innovations from even getting off the ground. Without the longterm visibility of Medicare coverage, startups and entrepreneurs might never get the funding they need to develop new technologies and bring them to market. It is essential that we unlock the full potential of telehealth. By doing so, we can improve patient care, promote health, defeat heartbreaking diseases, and save lives. That is why I am so glad we are taking this step today. Thank you again to the committee for working with me on this important bill, and I hope it is the first of many victories as we work together to expand telehealth. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACK ), a valuable member of the Health Subcommittee of the Committee on Ways and Means and who, as you have already heard from previous speakers, has an important provision in this bill and who, more importantly, brings her valuable training as a nurse who practiced before she came to Congress. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me time on this very important issue. I also want to thank my colleagues for working with me on this—Mr. MEEHAN, Mr. T HOMPSON , and Ms. DELBENE—for working on a really important piece of legislation that is included in this package, which will improve the quality of life for seniors on Medicare across the country. As has previously been said, I am a nurse. I have worked in the field for over 45 years, and I am proud to sponsor a bill that enhances patient care for those patients who are suffering from endstage renal disease. You know, we have made tremendous advances in technology over the last decade, and now it would be almost something we couldn’t have thought of 45 years ago. Physicians can remotely monitor patients in their dialysis treatments through telehealth to reduce the number of medical visits that are necessary, to ensure that the treatment is efficient and effective, and to also catch signs of complications early, which would cause not only a decrease in quality of care for the patient, but also a cost. Telehealth provides patients an important component in the comfort of their own homes—think about being sick and having to get in the car to travel—while physicians now have a new tool to treat their patients’ whole health. Our seniors deserve access to this innovative care, and it can save money. It can help to ensure that Medicare can be there for seniors who most need the care. So I urge my colleagues to take a vote for your constituents and for Medicare beneficiaries across the country and support this bill. I also look forward to continuing this work. This is certainly not the end of what we can do for our patients who are homebound and need care in the home. I will continue this work with Members on both sides of the aisle, which is being done now, for our Nation’s seniors to have access to these kinds of innovative telehealth technologies that will improve care and also, more importantly, help to lower the cost of treatment. I urge passage of this amendment. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MATSUI ), whose husband served with great distinction as a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act, and, specifically, a provision to extend the IVIG demonstration project that Chairman BRADY and I worked on together. I have long been a champion of those impacted by primary immunodeficiency diseases, which include more than 300 rare genetic diseases, all of which keep the immune system from functioning properly. A mild infection can cause serious problems and even death for these patients. Thanks to the IVIG demo, Medicare beneficiaries with immunodeficiency diseases are now able to receive in home IVIG therapy, meaning they can avoid community settings of care, which can be very important to people with compromised immune systems. I am pleased that this provision was included in the Medicare Part B Improvement Act. I urge support of this important bill. Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, as so often happens here, this bill bears a somewhat grander title than its contents. Medicare part B certainly does need improvement. While I support putting into statute what is already administrative practice, extending a demonstration project that appears to be working and the other provisions that my colleagues have worked on in this bill, I think much more should have happened. It is especially ironic that, at the very moment we are considering this bill, the United States Senate across the hall is proposing to eliminate healthcare coverage for millions of Americans. Certainly, this Republican repeal effort does far more harm to far more people than we can collectively undo here in the House with this rather modest piece of legislation. And there is one glaring omission from today’s Medicare Improvement Act, one subject that the Republican leadership of the House Ways and Means Committee fears. It fears not only doing something about this problem, it fears about even understanding the extent of the problem, and it certainly fears having any public hearings to explore this subject. That is the menace that is affecting millions of people across this country: pharmaceutical price gouging. This bill fails to address any aspect of soaring pharmaceutical costs of part B medications. For almost a year, a number of us, House Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, have called on the chairman to at least schedule a hearing about all aspects, all categories of soaring pharmaceutical prices that not only mean financial ruin for too many families, but also burden Medicare and most any type of taxpayerfinanced healthcare initiative. Governmentapproved monopolies for drug manufacturers are being exploited by charging the sick and dying whatever they might pay for a little more life, for a little more comfort at monopoly prices. Under longstanding existing law—it has been there before this Congress ever got together—pharmaceutical companies are at least required to provide average sales price data on part B Medicare drugs. Three years ago, the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services found that at least onethird of the more than 200 manufacturers of part B drugs had not submitted any of this average sales price data for some of their products, and an additional 45 manufacturers had not been required to report any data. The Inspector General found that inaccuracies in these average sales price filings may affect taxpayerfinanced Medicare payments. Last month, the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission came before the House Ways and Means Committee and gave its report on Medicare. It noted that this problem on average sales price data continues, and that it has not been addressed by Congress, as the Inspector General had recommended. The Republican majority has refused to do anything about this problem. It has blocked an amendment that I offered in committee that simply implemented the recommendation of the Inspector General and of MedPAC to get that average sales price data and to ensure that all part B manufacturers report that data or are penalized at a reasonable level. It would simply have ensured compliance with existing law to protect program integrity and to protect the taxpayer interest. And you can be sure that if the Republicans didn’t want to know what the prices were, they certainly didn’t want to do anything about the soaring prices and the impact on American families. So I support the bill, but this is a missed opportunity that we should have employed to address a critical problem. 
Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. As the previous speaker said, he supports the bill, which I am pleased to hear that, but as the chairman has said, as the ranking member has said, this is just the beginning. This is just the beginning, and we can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good in this piece of legislation because there is very important bipartisan legislation that is meaningful to people in a home today somewhere in Ohio or Massachusetts where home infusion is really important or dialysis is really important. I am pleased that the ranking member from Massachusetts has been so helpful on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the staff for their hard work on this bill, including Amy Hall, Sarah Levin, Melanie Egorin from the Democratic staff; Emily Murry and Nick Uehlecke from the Republican staff; Jessica Shapiro from the House Legislative Counsel’s office; Ira Burney, Jennifer Druckman, and Lisa Yen from CMS; and the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, Tom Bradley, Rebecca Yip, and Lara Robillard. I want to thank them all for their very, very hard work. We have this rare opportunity, this rare moment where we have broad agreement on this legislation, and I hope all Members of the House can find their way to be supportive of this legislation, and I hope the path of bipartisanship that we have chosen here can serve as a reminder of what we can get done. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just say ‘‘ditto’’ to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), whom I have a great relationship with, for all the words about the staff. In particular, I also want to thank Abby Finn from my staff, and Emily Murray and her team; but it has been a pleasure working with the gentleman from Massachusetts’ team as well, and Mr. LEVIN, the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee. Mr. Speaker, this is a good step in the right direction and the first step in expanding access to highquality care and improving efficiency and delivery of care so seniors can better receive the care they need where they need it, which is so incredibly important. I really appreciate the comments of the ranking member. And again, I want to remind everybody what the chairman said, that this is just the beginning, and hopefully this will be a template to much more bipartisan support for the remainder of this year. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3178, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1415 PLUM ISLAND PRESERVATION ACT Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2182) to require the Comptroller General of the United States to submit a report to Congress on the alternatives for the final disposition of Plum Island, including preservation of the island for conservation, education, and research, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2182 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Plum Island Preservation Act’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) The Federal Government has owned Plum Island, New York, since 1899. (2) Since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center has conducted unrivaled scientific research on a variety of infectious animalborne diseases, including footand mouth disease, resulting, most recently, in the development of a new cell line that rapidly and reliably detects this highly debilitating disease of livestock. (3) Over 62 years, the Center has had a strong, proven record of safety. (4) $23,200,000 in Federal dollars have been spent on upgrades to, and the maintenance of, the Center since January 2012. (5) In addition to the Center, Plum Island contains cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of regional and national significance. (6) Plum Island is situated where the Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay meet, both of which are estuaries that are part of the National Estuary Program and are environmentally and economically significant to the region. (7) The Federal Government has invested hundreds of millions of Federal dollars over the last two decades to make longterm improvements with respect to the conservation and management needs of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. (8) In a report submitted to Congress on April 11, 2016, entitled ‘‘National Bio and AgroDefense Facility Construction Plan Update’’ the Department of Homeland Security noted that the new National Bio and Agro Defense Facility under construction on such date in Manhattan, Kansas, is, as of such date, fully paid for through a combination of Federal appropriations and funding from the State of Kansas. 
SEC. 3. REPORT REQUIRED ON FINAL DISPOSITION OF PLUM ISLAND. 
Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report containing the following: (1) The alternatives for the final disposition of Plum Island, including the transfer of ownership to another Federal agency, a State or local government, a nonprofit organization, or a combination thereof for the purpose of education, research, or conservation. (2) With respect to each such alternative final disposition, an analysis of— (A) the effect such disposition would have on the island’s resources; (B) the remediation responsibilities under such disposition; (C) any future legislation necessary to implement such disposition; (D) the possible implications and issues, if any, of implementing such disposition; (E) the costs of such disposition, including any potential costs related to the transition, hazard mitigation, and cleanup of property that would be incurred by a recipient of the property under such disposition; and (F) the potential revenue from such disposition. SEC. 4. SUSPENSION OF ACTION. 
No action, including any presale marketing activity, may be taken to carry out section 538 of title V of division D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112–74; 125 Stat. 976) until at least 180 days after the report required by section 3 has been submitted to Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2182, the Plum Island Preservation Act, sponsored by my colleague from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ). This bill requires the Government Accountability Office to review the alternatives for the final disposition of the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate’s Plum Island Animal Disease Center, commonly known as Plum Island. Since 1954, Plum Island, located in Suffolk County, New York, has served the Nation in defending against accidental or intentional introduction of foreign animal diseases, including foot andmouth disease. However, Plum Island’s facilities are aging and nearing the end of their life cycle. That is why in 2005, DHS announced that the work being conducted on Plum Island would be moved to a new Federal facility in Kansas. Plum Island will continue to operate until the National Bio and AgroDefense Facility is fully operational and a complete transition has been made in 2022 or 2023. This raises the question of what will happen to Plum Island once its activities are fully transferred over to the 
new facility. The Department looked at this issue and, in June of 2016, released a report that reviewed several options for the final disposition of Plum Island. This bill simply requires GAO to review and analyze these alternatives to ensure all necessary information was taken into account before the Department decides how to move forward with the final disposition of Plum Island. Specifically, GAO is to analyze the effects, possible implications and issues, and potential costs and revenue for each disposition. Finally, H.R. 2182 suspends the sale of Plum Island until GAO completes this thorough review and analysis of alternatives. My friend, Representative ZELDIN , introduced H.R. 2182 with strong bipartisan support. H.R. 2182 is very similar to a bill that passed the House by voice vote last May. In conclusion, this bill ensures that there is adequate consideration of all the options for the disposition of the island. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2182, the Plum Island Preservation Act. Mr. Speaker, since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York’s Long Island has served as the Nation’s principal laboratory responsible for research on foreign animal diseases of livestock, such as footand mouth disease and other animal diseases. At Plum Island, the Department of Homeland Security works with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research and develop new vaccines and diagnostic tests for animal disease outbreaks and to defend against international or accidental introduction of animal diseases into the United States. On September 11, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to develop the National Bio and AgroDefense Facility, or NBAF, as a stateoftheart biocontainment laboratory for the study of diseases that threaten both America’s animal agricultural industry and public health. As envisioned by DHS, the 580,000 squarefoot facility would replace the Plum Island laboratory. Following an extensive selection process, DHS selected a site in Manhattan, Kansas, for the new lab, and the site is slated to be fully operational by December of 2022. What H.R. 2182 aims to answer is what will happen to Plum Island when DHS vacates the facility. DHS is currently studying the range of options for disposition of the property, including transferring it to another Federal agency, a State or local government, or a nonprofit organization for the purposes of education, research, or conservation. In doing so, DHS is expected to assess the full implications of each option, including cost, cleanup, and hazard mitigation. H.R. 2182 requires the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to assess whether the forthcoming study is satisfactory to support a decision. In the event that the study is lacking in a key area, GAO would be required to conduct its own study. Importantly, H.R. 2182 ensures that Plum Island cannot be sold by the Federal Government to the highest bidder. Under this bill, the sale of Plum Island is prohibited until at least 180 days after the required reports in the bill have been submitted to Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ), the sponsor of the bill. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. DONOVAN for his support. I rise today in support of H.R. 2182, to prevent the sale of Plum Island by the Federal Government to the highest bidder. Situated at the gateway of the Long Island Sound, I personally had the pleasure of visiting this treasured island. In addition to being a critical resource for research, approximately 90 percent of the land on Plum Island has been sheltered from development, offering Long Island a diverse wildlife and ecosystem and critical habitat for migratory birds, marine mammals, and rare plants. Plum Island is also an essential cultural and historical resource as well, with recorded history dating back to the 1700s. The island held the U.S. military’s Fort Terry, a coastal defense fortification, which was used through the end of World War II. Since then, Plum Island has been utilized as a research laboratory and has since grown to become what is known today as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security, which currently has jurisdiction over the island, announced that the Animal Disease Center research would be moved to a new Federal facility, the National Bio and AgroDefense Facility, NBAF, in Kansas. To offset the cost of this relocation, a law was enacted that called for the private sale of Plum Island by the Federal Government to the highest bidder. However, because of the costs associated with the cleanup and closure of Plum Island, and because of local zoning restrictions, the Federal Government would receive little compensation for the sale of Plum Island. Also, in the 12 years since the move to Kansas was approved, the new facility in Kansas is already fully paid for by a combination of Federal appropriations and State and private funds. Allowing for continued research, public access, and permanent preservation of the island, H.R. 2182 will suspend the laws passed in 2008 and 2011 that mandated the public sale of Plum Island. This bill will commission the Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, which currently owns the island, to formulate a comprehensive plan for the future of the island. It requires the plan focus on conservation, education, and research and include alternative uses for the island, including a transfer of ownership to another Federal agency, the State or 
local government, a nonprofit, or a combination thereof. In the 114th Congress, this bill passed the House unanimously with bipartisan support as H.R. 1887. My amendment to the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2017, H.R. 5485, which would have prohibited any of the funding within the appropriations bill to market or sell Plum Island, also passed the House as well. I would like to thank the other Members of Congress who have cosponsored this legislation and lent their support to this cause, especially my colleagues from Connecticut, Congressman JOE COURTNEY and Congresswoman R OSA DELAURO . I would also like to thank House Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY for bringing this bill to the floor, House Homeland Security Chairman MICHAEL  MCCAUL, and all of the local elected officials, groups, and concerned residents on Long Island who have taken an issue on this important issue. This bill is endorsed by the Preserve Plum Island Coalition, an alliance of over 65 community and environmental groups in New York and Connecticut, focused on the conservation of this island. I am proud to work alongside all of these great individuals and groups as we strive to save Plum Island. Since taking office in 2015, one of my highest local priorities has been to protect Plum Island. Preserving this island’s natural beauty, while maintaining a research mission, will continue to provide important economic and environmental benefits for Long Island. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in support of this critical bill, as well as for the Senate to pass this legislation, so it may be signed into law this year. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. PAYNE for his leadership on the Homeland Security Committee and also for his hard work on this legislation, which, again, has been closely watched back home in Connecticut and on the other side of Long Island Sound, as Mr. ZELDIN indicated as well, in the State of New York. Again, I rise in strong support, with my colleague, for passage of H.R. 2182, the Plum Island Preservation Act. This has been an effort that has been ongoing since Congress, unfortunately, took, I think, a wrong turn when they enacted legislation in 2009, with the goal of trying to create funding for the National Bio and AgroDefense Facility in Kansas; but in the process of doing that, it set up a truncated sale of this property, which really deviated from the normal GSA process of trying to exhaust other beneficial uses before putting it up for sale to the highest bidder. Again, that has been the struggle for people on both sides of the Long Island Sound, who have been frustrated by the fact that, because Congress mandated a sale without any other options, the incredible, pristine environmental quality of this precious piece of property was basically pushed down the food chain in terms of, again, the way the Federal Government was operating. Again, I think it is important to recognize—and my colleagues from New York, Mr. DONOVAN and Mr. Z ELDIN , understand this—this still is the most densely populated area of America. The boat traffic, the maritime traffic that flows through Long Island Sound, again, is the busiest in the country. And to have a piece of property that is this precious and this pure—which Mr. ZELDIN visited, and I think he can attest to that personally, and I have sailed past it—is really an opportunity that really we just cannot possibly allow to go to a developer that would make that quality forever lost. So this legislation, which stops the 2009 process in its tracks, has GAO step in and do a full complete analysis across the board in evaluating all options. In particular, the options of preserving this unique environmental asset is the right move for our country, and, again, it will be to the benefit of generations to come. Again, I want to congratulate Mr. ZELDIN for his persistence. Again, we did get it through the last Congress, the 114th. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PAYNE. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. COURTNEY. I think getting this done early in the 115th Congress will hopefully allow us the opportunity to get some bandwidth in the Senate’s floor schedule to finally get this to the President’s desk, and, again, forever protect an asset for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge strong support for this measure. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ). Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. It is very simple. It directs the Comptroller General of the United States to submit a report to the Congress on alternative uses for Plum Island. b1430 The report underscores its ecological significance, that is what it would do; the need to be protected; and it would be an important step toward identifying conservation alternatives to selling Plum Island. I believe that Plum Island should be a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System, ensuring that we would safeguard the island’s sensitive wildlife and ecological value. Plum Island is the largest area in southern New England, where seals can rest on dry land. Its 843 acres are home to two threatened bird species: the piping plovers and the roseate terns. We need to proceed very carefully when considering the future of Plum Island. This is a refuge for wildlife and native plants, and once it is developed, it cannot be restored, which is why the legislation is so important. By evaluating the alternative uses for Plum Island fully rather than selling it to the highest bidder, we can ensure that this ecological, historical, and cultural treasure can be protected for generations to come. I am proud to join with my colleagues, Congressman ZELDIN and Congressman COURTNEY , on a bipartisan basis to ensure that the environment is respected in our region and across the country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) for yielding me the time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2182 has broad support on both sides of the aisle, as we can see. Plum Island has a history dating back to the 1700s and has been owned by the Federal Government since 1899. This bill takes steps to ensure that this culturally and historically important site is not sold until all relevant questions are answered regarding the final disposition of Plum Island and that a satisfactory comprehensive plan has been developed. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2182. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2182. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

TITLE II—SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND COMBATING TERRORISM AND ILLICIT FINANCING 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017’’. Subtitle A—Sanctions and Other Measures With Respect to the Russian Federation 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) On March 6, 2014, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13660 (79 Fed. Reg. 13493; relating to blocking property of certain persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine), which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on those determined to be undermining democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine or threatening the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine. President Obama subsequently issued Executive Order 13661 (79 Fed. Reg. 15535; relating to blocking property of additional persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine) and Executive Order 13662 (79 Fed. Reg. 16169; relating to blocking property of additional persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine) to expand sanctions on certain persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine. (2) On December 18, 2014, the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 was enacted (Public Law 113–272; 22 U.S.C. 8921 et seq.), which includes provisions directing the President to impose sanctions on foreign persons that the President determines to be entities owned or controlled by the Government of the Russian Federation or nationals of the Russian Federation that manufacture, sell, transfer, or otherwise provide certain defense articles into Syria. (3) On April 1, 2015, President Obama issued Executive Order 13694 (80 Fed. Reg. 18077; relating to blocking the property of certain persons engaging in significant malicious cyberenabled activities), which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on persons determined to be engaged in malicious cyberhacking. (4) On July 26, 2016, President Obama approved a Presidential Policy Directive on United States Cyber Incident Coordination, which states, ‘‘certain cyber incidents that have significant impacts on an entity, our national security, or the broader economy require a unique approach to response efforts’’. (5) On December 29, 2016, President Obama issued an annex to Executive Order 13694, which authorized sanctions on the following entities and individuals: (A) The Main Intelligence Directorate (also known as Glavnoe Razvedyvatel’noe Upravlenie or the GRU) in Moscow, Russian Federation. (B) The Federal Security Service (also known as Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti or the FSB) in Moscow, Russian Federation. (C) The Special Technology Center (also known as STLC, Ltd. Special Technology Center St. Petersburg) in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation. (D) Zorsecurity (also known as Esage Lab) in Moscow, Russian Federation. (E) The autonomous noncommercial organization known as the Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems (also known as ANO PO KSI) in Moscow, Russian Federation. (F) Igor Valentinovich Korobov. (G) Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov. (H) Igor Olegovich Kostyukov. (I) Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev. (6) On January 6, 2017, an assessment of the United States intelligence community entitled, ‘‘Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections’’ stated, ‘‘Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential election.’’ The assessment warns that ‘‘Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putinordered campaign aimed at the U.S. Presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against U.S. allies and their election processes’’. 
It is the sense of Congress that the President— (1) should continue to uphold and seek unity with European and other key partners on sanctions implemented against the Russian Federation, which have been effective and instrumental in countering Russian aggression in Ukraine; (2) should engage to the fullest extent possible with partner governments with regard to closing loopholes, including the allowance of extended prepayment for the delivery of goods and commodities and other loopholes, in multilateral and unilateral restrictive measures against the Russian Federation, with the aim of maximizing alignment of those measures; and (3) should increase efforts to vigorously enforce compliance with sanctions in place as of the date of the enactment of this Act with respect to the Russian Federation in response to the crisis in eastern Ukraine, cyber intrusions and attacks, and human rights violators in the Russian Federation.

Subtitle B—Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Government of the Russian Federation has sought to exert influence throughout Europe and Eurasia, including in the former states of the Soviet Union, by providing resources to political parties, think tanks, and civil society groups that sow distrust in democratic institutions and actors, promote xenophobic and illiberal views, and otherwise undermine European unity. The Government of the Russian Federation has also engaged in welldocumented corruption practices as a means toward undermining and buying influence in European and Eurasian countries. (2) The Government of the Russian Federation has largely eliminated a oncevibrant Russianlanguage independent media sector and severely curtails free and independent media within the borders of the Russian Federation. Russianlanguage media organizations that are funded and controlled by the Government of the Russian Federation and disseminate information within and outside of the Russian Federation routinely traffic in antiWestern disinformation, while few independent, factbased media sources provide objective reporting for Russianspeaking audiences inside or outside of the Russian Federation. (3) The Government of the Russian Federation continues to violate its commitments under the Memorandum on Security Assurances in connection with Ukraine’s Accession to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Budapest December 5, 1994, and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe Final Act, concluded at Helsinki August 1, 1975 (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Helsinki Final Act’’), which laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which the Russian Federation is a member, by its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, its illegal occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia in 2008, and its ongoing destabilizing activities in eastern Ukraine. (4) The Government of the Russian Federation continues to ignore the terms of the August 2008 ceasefire agreement relating to Georgia, which requires the withdrawal of Russian Federation troops, free access by humanitarian groups to the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and monitoring of the conflict areas by the European Union Monitoring Mission. (5) The Government of the Russian Federation is failing to comply with the terms of the Minsk Agreement to address the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, signed in Minsk, Belarus, on February 11, 2015, by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany, as well as the Minsk Protocol, which was agreed to on September 5, 2014. (6) The Government of the Russian Federation is— (A) in violation of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of their IntermediateRange and ShorterRange Missiles, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988 (commonly known as the ‘‘INF Treaty’’); and (B) failing to meet its obligations under the Treaty on Open Skies, done at Helsinki March 24, 1992, and entered into force January 1, 2002 (commonly known as the ‘‘Open Skies Treaty’’). SEC. 252. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the Government of the Russian Federation bears responsibility for the continuing violence in Eastern Ukraine, including the death on April 24, 2017, of Joseph Stone, a citizen of the United States working as a monitor for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; (2) the President should call on the Government of the Russian Federation— (A) to withdraw all of its forces from the territories of Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova; (B) to return control of the borders of those territories to their respective governments; and (C) to cease all efforts to undermine the popularly elected governments of those countries; (3) the Government of the Russian Federation has applied, and continues to apply, to the countries and peoples of Georgia and Ukraine, traditional uses of force, intelligence operations, and influence campaigns, which represent clear and present threats to the countries of Europe and Eurasia; (4) in response, the countries of Europe and Eurasia should redouble efforts to build resilience within their institutions, political systems, and civil societies; (5) the United States supports the institutions that the Government of the Russian Federation seeks to undermine, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union; (6) a strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization is critical to maintaining peace and security in Europe and Eurasia; (7) the United States should continue to work with the European Union as a partner against aggression by the Government of the Russian Federation, coordinating aid programs, development assistance, and other counterRussian efforts; (8) the United States should encourage the establishment of a commission for media freedom within the Council of Europe, modeled on the Venice Commission regarding rule of law issues, that would be chartered to provide governments with expert recommendations on maintaining legal and regulatory regimes supportive of free and independent media and an informed citizenry able to distinguish between factbased reporting, opinion, and disinformation; (9) in addition to working to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, the United States should work with the individual countries of Europe and Eurasia— (A) to identify vulnerabilities to aggression, disinformation, corruption, and so called hybrid warfare by the Government of the Russian Federation; (B) to establish strategic and technical plans for addressing those vulnerabilities; (C) to ensure that the financial systems of those countries are not being used to shield illicit financial activity by officials of the Government of the Russian Federation or individuals in President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle who have been enriched through corruption; (D) to investigate and prosecute cases of corruption by Russian actors; and (E) to work toward full compliance with the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (commonly referred to as the ‘‘AntiBribery Convention’’) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and (10) the President of the United States should use the authority of the President to impose sanctions under— (A) the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of Public Law 112–208; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note); and (B) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note). 
The United States, consistent with the principle of ex injuria jus non oritur, supports the policy known as the ‘‘Stimson Doctrine’’ and thus does not recognize territorial changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions and occupations of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Eastern Ukraine, and Transnistria.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill represents a very broad, bipartisan HouseSenate agreement that the United States must enforce tougher sanctions against North Korea, against Russia, against Iran. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for his determined and excellent work on this legislation. This is a very important bill. These three regimes in different parts of the world are threatening vital U.S. interests and they are destabilizing their neighbors. It is well past time that we forcefully respond. Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has invaded its neighbor, Ukraine, seizing its territory and destabilizing its government. It poses a threat to our NATO allies in Europe, as Moscow works to undermine democratic values with determination and sophistication, as U.S. intelligence agencies have made clear. This former KGB colonel attempted to interfere with our own election. Left unchecked, Russia is sure to continue its aggression. Putin’s forces continue to prop up the murderous Assad regime in Syria, prolonging a deadly conflict that has driven tens of millions of people from their homes, while enabling the use of chemical weapons and other systematic human rights abuses against the people of Syria. The Russia sanctions in this bill are substantially similar to those that overwhelmingly passed the other body. They give the administration important economic leverage, they give it diplomatic leverage by targeting the things that matter to Vladimir Putin and that matter to his allies the most, and that is their corrupt efforts to profit from the country’s oil wealth and their ability to sell weapons overseas. To focus their impact, we clarified several provisions that could have inadvertently handed Russian companies control of global energy projects and impacted pipelines that our European allies rely on in an effort to end their dependence on Russian gas. So this strengthens the bill. To ensure these economic sanctions remain in place as long as Putin’s aggression continues, this bill empowers Congress to review and to disapprove any sanctions relief. This strong oversight is necessary, it is appropriate. After all, it is Congress that the Constitution empowers to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Mr. Speaker, Russia has found a willing partner in Iran. The regime’s Iranian Revolutionary Guard are fighting alongside Russian forces in Syria. At the same time, Tehran continues to threaten Israel by providing funding and advanced rockets and missiles to Hezbollah. Hezbollah is its leading terrorist proxy. It continues to hold Americans hostage, while developing intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. To strengthen the U.S. response to the threat from Iran, this bill includes provisions originally introduced by my counterpart, Senator CORKER , which increase sanctions on those involved in the regime’s human rights abuses and its support for terrorism, as well as its efforts on the ballistic missile program, which the Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces control. Finally, I am proud that this bill includes the text of H.R. 1644, the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act, which we passed in May. We passed it here out of the House by a vote of 419–1. These provisions, which were strengthened in consultation with the other body, expand 
sanctions targeting North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but they also go after those around the world who employ North Korean slave labor. This is a human rights abuse. It is one that operates by having a situation where the indentured workers are fed, but the check, instead of going to the workers, goes to the regime, and that money then goes into the nuclear weapons program. It is estimated that this earns hundreds of millions of dollars for the regime in hard currency. So with every test, Kim Jongun’s regime comes closer to being able to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile that is capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. We simply cannot pass up an opportunity to increase pressure in response to this threat. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I want to, first of all, thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for all the hard work that has gone into this legislation so far. I want to especially thank our chairman, ED ROYCE , who has been my partner on this committee for nearly 5 years. We have passed excellent legislation. The legislation today just adds to it, and it shows what you can do when you work in a bipartisan way, so I want to thank the chairman for all his hard work and all his courtesies. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I certainly plan to vote for it, but it seems we may be on the floor before we have ironed out all the differences with the other body. I hope that is not the case. In particular, there have been issues with the North Korea sanctions. It was another RoyceEngel bill, which already passed in the House and, frankly, should have been taken up by the other body on a separate track; instead, it is now put into this bill. I hope we don’t face further delays when this bill gets back to the other House. Our job isn’t done, obviously, until we get this thing across the finish line; and we need to do that because this bill is critical to our national security. It does far more than just send a message to leaders in Russia, Iran, and North Korea. It exacts a heavy price for their aggressive and destabilizing behavior. Just like the bill we already passed, this legislation would update and expand our sanctions on North Korea, closing loopholes that have allowed money to flow to the Kim regime, funding its illegal weapons program. It would crack down on the trading partners, banks, and shipping vessels that enable the regime, and go after the regime’s most lucrative enterprises, whether exported goods or the pilfered wages of North Korean laborers sent abroad to work. With respect to Iran, this bill would go after so many of the things Iran’s leaders do to drive violence and instability, from Tehran’s ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism to the regime’s abhorrent human rights record and efforts to build up its military. I have said this again and again, that we need to hold the regime’s feet to the fire on all these issues. This bill does exactly that. Finally, on Russia, this bill is a strong, direct response to Vladimir Putin’s efforts to undermine American democracy. It imposes new sanctions on those who want to do business with Putin’s cronies or with Russia’s military or intelligence. It strengthens existing sanctions for Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and armed intervention in eastern Ukraine. It pushes back against Russia’s cybercrimes, including the hacking of our election to help Donald Trump—a story which Congress and the special counsel are still trying to get to the bottom of—as well as Putin’s support for the murderous Assad regime in Syria. And it gives Congress a strong oversight role in making sure that these Russian sanctions are not lifted prematurely. This administration has shown over and over that they are willing to cozy up to Putin, but here is the truth: Russia is not our ally. Putin wants to harm the United States, splinter our alliances, and undermine Western democracy. This Congress will not allow him to succeed, so I am glad to support this bipartisan bill. I thank the chairman once again. We need to keep working to make sure this bill gets to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1445 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), and I just want to thank him for his good work to strengthen the bill, as he will discuss, and for his focus on pipelines that primarily carry oil and gas through Russia that compete with Russian gas and drives down the price of gas. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of increased sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea. I thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL for their leadership on this issue. I cannot overstate the importance of sending a strong message to our adversaries that there will be consequences for their bad behavior. Back in October of last year, at the height of the Presidential campaign, I was briefed by our intelligence community. They told me that Russia engaged in a blatant effort to meddle in our domestic affairs and, specifically, our democratic process. I was an outspoken supporter of the need for a strong response then, and I remain so now. However, in the process of making Russia pay an economic cost for their bad behavior, we must ensure we are not harming U.S. interests at home and abroad. I want to thank Chairman ROYCE for clarifying that Section 232 of this bill only applies to Russian energy export pipelines. We should not be in the business of sanctioning pipelines that help provide energy independence from Russia. Putin uses this as a tool to provide political leverage over his neighbors. So, again, I want to thank Chairman ROYCE for his leadership in working with me on this, I think, clarification to the Senate companion and for his leadership in the House on this important issue. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ), my colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3364, the Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act. I thank my colleagues, Chairman ROYCE  and Ranking Member ENGEL , for all of their work, together with the Senate, to reach this important agreement. This legislation will ensure that Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and those who seek to help them, will suffer consequences for their bad behavior. Passage of this legislation is important to hold Iran accountable for its support for terrorism, human rights violations, and continued defiance of international treaties, including on ballistic missiles. Today we are taking an important step toward holding the Iranian Government, including the IRGC, and anyone who seeks to support them, accountable for their bad actions. Anyone who contributes to Iran’s ballistic missile program, supplies it with weapons, or assists the Iranian Government in their vast human rights abuses will be subject to sanction. It is important to note that these sanctions do not violate the JCPOA and, in my view, strengthen the nuclear deal by showing our allies and Iran that the United States is serious about continuing to enforce violations of international law. I am also pleased to see additional sanctions imposed upon Russia and North Korea in this legislation. The human suffering that North Korea has brought upon its own people is unimaginable. Such a depraved leader as Kim Jongun getting his hands on nuclear weapons that can be used against American allies is an outcome that we simply cannot tolerate. Finally, Russia engaged in an unprecedented attack against our democracy when it interfered in our 2016 election. This is the fundamental foundation of our democracy, our election, and we simply cannot allow any foreign power to interfere in our electoral process. Given our President’s complete unwillingness to hold Russia accountable for their attack—and let’s not mistake it for anything else; it was an attack on America—it has become necessary for Congress to assert its role in this area and ensure that Russia will be held accountable. So, again, I thank Chairman ROYCE , Ranking Member ENGEL , Leader PELOSI , Whip H OYER , and members of 
the Senate who worked together to get this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him and ELIOT ENGEL  for sponsoring this important bill. This bill brings together a critical arsenal of stiff and timely sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea. The administration was absolutely right in early February to put Iran on notice regarding its continued testing of ballistic missiles. This bill underscores that warning by imposing expanded sanctions against Iran’s missile program, demonstrating that the United States will not sit idly by as Iran augments its ability to militarily blackmail the United States, Israel, and our allies. It also, as the world’s largest sponsor of terrorism, imposes terror sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It very importantly, as well, authorizes the imposition of sanctions on individuals responsible for Iran’s human rights abuses. The State Department suggests there are as many as 800 political prisoners in Iran alone. It also reminds us and draws attention to Iran’s despicable practice of arresting American citizens to use them as bargaining chips. On Russia, Mr. Speaker, the Putin government’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea; indiscriminate bombing in Syria; and threatening behavior toward our NATO allies, above all, in the Baltics makes it—important in respects—the worst actor in the global stage today. Putin’s government has passed from threats to aggressive actions against our friends, allies, and innocent people abroad. Let’s not forget that in 2008—and I was there in Tbilisi as it was happening—the Russians invaded Georgia and annexed South Ossetia and Abkhazia. As to North Korea, a gulag masquerading as a country, we must cut off all economic lifelines to Kim Jongun, and punish Pyongyang’s clients and its enablers. A regime that murdered Otto Warmbier and then, of course, is working on more missiles and the means to deliver them needs to be taken seriously. This legislation does that with very stiff sanctions. I thank, again, Chairman ROYCE , ELIOT ENGEL , Majority Leader M CCARTHY, and S TENY HOYER as the principal sponsors of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3364, the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, introduced by my good friend, Chairman EDROYCE . I’m proud to be a cosponsor. This bill brings together a critical arsenal of stiff and timely sanctions trained at some of the gravest national security threats our country faces today. The Trump Administration was absolutely right in early February to put Iran ‘‘on notice’’ regarding its continued testing of ballistic missiles. This bill underscores that warning by imposing expanded sanctions against Iran’s missile program—demonstrating that the United States will not sit idly by as Iran augments its ability to blackmail Israel and other allies. The stakes could hardly be higher. Iran possesses the largest ballistic missile program in the region and its mediumrange ballistic missiles are already able to strike Israel and our allies and installations in the Gulf from deep within Iranian territory. Iran’s growing space launch program—a thinly veiled testing scheme for intercontinental ballistic missiles— is cause for greater alarm still. Iran is also the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism. By requiring the imposition of terror sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, H.R. 3364 treats the IRGC as what it truly is: Iran’s principal means of exporting terrorism around the world, particularly to Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and Bahrain. The U.S. cannot tolerate this brinksmanship and blackmail. Iran dreams of nothing less than regional hegemony and Israel’s annihilation. There is no room for compromise with such an adversary. Now is the time to act: Iran is entrenching its influence in Syria and Iraq and insuring these gains with the credibility of its missile threat and militant proxies. We must pass this bill to bring maximum pressure to bear against a mounting threat. Importantly, this bill also authorizes the imposition of sanctions on individuals responsible for Iran’s horrifying human rights abuses. In May, the State Department reported to Congress that: ‘‘The Iranian regime’s repression of its own people includes reports of over 800 political prisoners, composed of peaceful civic activists, journalists, women’s rights activists, religious and ethnic minorities, and opposition political figures.’’ This bill would also draw increased attention to Iran’s despicable practice of arresting American citizens to use them as bargaining chips. On Friday, the Trump Administration rightfully called Iran out for using these detentions as ‘‘a tool of state policy’’ and threatened ‘‘new and serious’’ consequences if this practice continues. We must not forget the lives and families of Robert Levinson, Siamak and Baquer Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and others that have been torn apart by Iran’s cynical schemes. Mr. Speaker, regarding Russia, the Putin government’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, indiscriminate bombing in Syria, and threatening behavior toward our NATO allies, above all in the Baltics, makes it among the worst actors on the global stage today. Putin’s government has passed from threats to aggressive action against our friends, allies and innocent civilians abroad. And it did so long ago, when it invaded Georgia in 2008. I was there, in Tbilisi, several weeks after that invasion began, to work to secure the exit of two young children, constituents of mine, trapped behind Russian lines in South Ossetia. I will never forget the quiet courage of the Georgian people in Tbilisi—not entirely surprised by Putin’s invasion—they were too wise for that—uncertain whether the Russian army would proceed to Tbilisi, and determined to soldier on in defense of their country. And then in 2014 the Russian government annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine—each of these incursions was marked by massive human rights violations, violence toward anyone suspected of being unsympathetic to the Russian imperialist cause, and created massive humanitarian crises of displaced persons, which the Russian government did nothing to relieve. These acts of aggression underscore the seriousness with which we must take the Russian government’s testing of our limits and our will, by buzzing our ships and planes, harassing our diplomats, and intimidating our allies—as it does for example with the Zapad exercises set to take place in September near the Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian borders. We know from experience that the best way to maintain the peace and keep our country secure is to respond strongly to Russian expansionism and intimidation attempts—this sanctions bill does just that. The large number of political assassinations that have scarred Russian public life since Putin arrived on the scene—the most notorious but not the only attack on the rights of Russian citizens for which the Putin government is responsible. These brutal crimes only underscore the need to respond strongly to Putin’s attempts to intimidate us and our allies. Congress has responded strongly to Putin’s aggressions and crimes before, for example with the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law and Accountability Act and the Global Magnitsky legislation, of which I was the House chief sponsor, taking the lessons of the earlier act and applied them globally, while in its name further memorializing the heroic sacrifice of Sergei Magnitsky. The Magnitsky legislation was so strongly detested by the Putin government that in early 2013, having cosponsored the original Magnitsky legislation, the Russian government refused to issue me a visa to visit Russia to work on international child adoption issues. A State Department official commented to me at the time that as far he knew, I was the first Congressman denied a visa since the Brezhnev era. So, in addition to enacting this new legislation, I want to join Vladimir KaraMurza’s call that the Magnitsky legislation continue to be implemented energetically and fully. Kara Murza is a Russian democracy activist who twice was nearly killed by sophisticated poisons while visiting Russia—he testified for me at the Helsinki Commission after the first poisoning attempt, in October 2015. Many of the Putin government’s murders are motivated by economic crimes and implementation of the Magnitsky legislation should also include U.S. government advocacy on behalf of U.S. investors defrauded by Russian expropriations—the Yukos oil company is the most notorious case of this. As to North Korea—a gulag masquerading as a country—we must cut off all economic lifelines to Kim Jong un and punish Pyongyang’s clients and its enablers. A regime that murders Otto Warmbier does not deserve respect and should be considered an imminent threat to the US and its allies because of its nuclear proliferation. We cannot negotiate our way out of these strategic problems. Carrots have not worked, we need bigger sticks. We know sanctions are working. Thae Yong Ho (Thay Young Ho)—North Korea’s former 
deputy ambassador to Britain and the highest ranking defector in twenty years—said that international sanctions are beginning to squeeze the regime. He also said that the spread of information from the outside world is having a real impact. So it shouldn’t be a surprise that South Korea has reported that high level defections are surging. This legislation provides crucial tools and I support them wholeheartedly—as I supported them in May of this year. The Trump Administration will find that it can use the tools we offer today to much greater use than did the last White House. With hundreds of thousands of North Korean laborers abroad—sending as much as $2 billion a year back to the regime in hard currency—we should look at targeting this expatriate labor and the governments and corporations that employ them. Loopholes in our sanctions on North Korea’s shipping and financial sectors must be closed. And when we discover that foreign banks have helped Kim Jong un skirt sanctions—as those in China have repeatedly done—we must give those banks and businesses a stark choice: do business with Kim Jong un or the U.S. Cut off Kim Jong un’s economic lifelines, punish those who keep his murderous regime afloat, and signal to China and its client state in North Korea that the era of ‘‘strategic patience’’ is finally over. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly support this critical measure at a perilous moment for our country and the rest of the planet. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO ), our colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee and a member of the Intelligence Committee. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member ENGEL for yielding. I also thank Chairman ROYCE for his leadership on the sanctions package. The American people have been waiting some time for the sanctions package to finally pass. This bill dials up our current sanctions on North Korea, Iran, and Russia to hold their governments accountable for their destabilizing actions. The Russia piece in this package is particularly necessary. Russia has flagrantly violated international law by invading Ukraine and interfering in American and European elections. These sanctions are a clear signal that the United States will hold President Putin and his close associates accountable for their actions. They are also a declaration that Congress can and will act, even when President Trump refuses to do so. In addition to these sanctions, Congress must continue to investigate to determine the scope of Russia’s attack on America’s democracy and establish which Americans, if any, aided in those efforts. Again, I thank Ranking Member ENGEL , Chairman R OYCE , and everyone in this Congress who has supported these sanctions. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ), chairman of the Committee on Financial Services. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and certainly for his leadership on this very important bill. I rise in support of the Russia, Iran, and North Korean Sanctions Act. Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to highlight the provisions that are the product of the hard work of the Financial Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. The inclusion of these provisions will undoubtedly assist our government’s antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing efforts. For instance, this bill includes language directing the President, acting through the Secretary of the Treasury, to develop and maintain a national strategy for combating the financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit financing. The opportunistic nature of terrorist groups, combined with the emergence of financial technology, creates new challenges for our law enforcement community and their efforts to disrupt terror finance. The national strategy should also seek to enhance partnerships with the private sector that prevent and detect illicit financing, and increase efforts to facilitate compliance with our anti money laundering and counterterrorist financing laws. I would like to commend Congressman TEDBUDDfor introducing the National Strategy for Combating Terrorists, Underground, and Other Illicit Financing Act, which is almost entirely incorporated in section 2 of the underlying legislation. I would also like to recognize Congressman PEARCE and Congressman PITTENGER , the chairman and vice chairman of the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee of our committee, whose leadership on these issues has been instrumental to achieve the legislation that is before us today. Mr. Speaker, we know that Thomas Jefferson once famously said: ‘‘The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.’’ And that is indeed true. Thanks, in no small part, to the hard work of the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, the bill before us today ensures that we remain vigilant to address the evolving threats to our financial system. I am proud to support it and I encourage all Members to support it. Again, I thank Chairman ROYCE for his leadership today on this bill and in our committee. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), who was instrumental in putting this bill forward, who has been with us every step of the way and so invaluable to this finished product, the distinguished Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member ENGEL for yielding. And I thank Mr. ROYCE for his hard work on this bill. I have said this before and I will say it again: Mr. ROYCE , as chairman, and Mr. ENGEL , as ranking member, are an example for, frankly, all of us on how to work together productively in a bipartisan fashion to reach a result that is good for our country, for our people, and indeed for international security. I also want to thank Senators CARDIN  and CORKER for their leadership and their involvement. This legislation is the product of very careful and sometimes difficult negotiations on a bipartisan basis. It is a strong, tough, and appropriate response to Russia’s attempts to meddle in our election process, its support for violent separatists in Ukraine, its illegal occupation of Crimea, and, yes, its unhelpful activity in Syria. It also imposes new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile program, which threatens the United States, our Gulf allies, and Israel. Russia’s power comes from its ability to coerce other nations by its energy distribution, in many instances. This bill seeks to make it harder for Russia to use that type of coercion, and empower other nations to join us in standing up against Russian aggression. These sanctions will only be successful, however, if they are truly bipartisan and if Congress continues to play its important and necessary oversight role. Democrats and Republicans are coming together on this bill, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that the President cannot alter sanctions toward Russia without congressional review. This is critical at a moment when our allies are uncertain about where this administration stands with respect to Russian aggression. I remain open to additional sanctions on Russia’s energy sector at a later date if the Russian leader and his associates fail to heed the message of this bill that their business as usual cannot and must not continue. Once this bill passes the Senate, as I believe it will, Russia will know that sanctions levied because of its malevolent acts will be lifted only with the concurrence, either tacitly or expressly, of the Congress of the United States. There will be no side deals or turning a blind eye to its actions. This legislation, Mr. Speaker, will also make it clear that Russia’s interference in Ukraine comes with consequences, and it puts pressure on Iran to end its ballistic missile program. In addition, it deters, hopefully, North Korea from pursuing its dangerous development of nuclear weapons and vehicles to deliver those weapons as close as the western part of this country. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to send it to the Senate as quickly as possible. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to recognize the good work of the Democratic whip, Mr. STENY  
HOYER , and also the Republican leader, KEVIN MCCARTHY , on this legislation and to thank them. Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. ROYCE of California. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Frankly, all four of us— yourself and your leadership, Mr. ENGEL , the majority leader, and I— were privileged to work together in a way that, as I said at the beginning, was constructive and that, I think, has resulted in a very good product. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ), the chairman of the Rules Committee, for the purpose of a colloquy. b1500 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for yielding me this time, and I rise to applaud him for the hard work and the responsible actions that the chairman has taken, not only to ensure this piece of legislation is prepared, but bettered and ready to go back to the Senate. I think we have a forceful sanctions bill that is before the House today, and one that targets not only Iran and Russia, but also the North Korean regime. As you know, the bill that was passed by the Senate risked giving Russian energy firms a competitive advantage across the globe by inadvertently denying American companies access to neutral thirdparty energy markets where there would simply be a small or de minimis Russian presence. The bill before us today prevents Russia from being able to weaponize these sanctions against U.S. energy firms. I want to thank Chairman ROYCE  for his hard work on this issue. I also want to ensure that we have an understanding of the definition of the word ‘‘controlling’’ in section 223(d) of H.R. 3364. For purposes of clarification and legislative intent, the term ‘‘controlling’’ means the power to direct, determine, or resolve fundamental, operational, and financial decisions of an oil project through the ownership of a majority of the voting interests of the oil project. Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman, the young chairman, if he agrees with that definition. Mr. ROYCE of California. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. ROYCE of California. Yes. Yes, that is my understanding. Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman for not only this clarification, but making sure that we are most specific in what we are undertaking. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note that the Shah Deniz Pipeline and the Southern Gas Corridor projects will continue to be able to bring gas from the Caspian Sea, which is a huge find, to our European allies, reducing their dependency on Russian energy. Mr. ROYCE of California. That is my understanding. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, and I would thank him for his time on this colloquy. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ), one of my senior colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the ranking member of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, which is really a combination of three bills. First, as to North Korea, it embodies a bill passed on this floor in May introduced by Chairman ROYCE , Ranking Member E NGEL , Mr. YOHO, and myself from the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee. We will expand our sanctions on North Korea’s precious metals, minerals, jet fuel, coal, and across the board, and especially banking sanctions. But keep in mind, ultimately, we have got to force China to decide whether they are going to support North Korea or whether they are going to have access to American markets. We can’t let them have both. As to Iran, this bill designates the entire Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, as the Quds Force has already been designated, as subject to terrorism sanctions, and provides an arms embargo. Let us remember that the real face of this regime in Tehran is not their dapper foreign minister, but rather it is the hundreds of thousands who have died in Syria as a result of Iranian action. Speaking of countries that have supported Assad, finally and perhaps most importantly, this bill provides sanctions against Russia necessary because of its action in the Ukraine and its interference in our elections. We hit Russia in a very important way by dealing with the technology they would need to explore oil. Unfortunately, even under this very strong bill, it would take a twothirds vote for us to block a sanctions waiver should our resolution be vetoed. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), chairman of the Foreign Affairs’ Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I also thank the ranking member for their work on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken to our military leaders, and they said that the biggest threat to the United States is North Korea. Strategic patience is over. It is time for strategic sanctions. This bill will go a long way to tighten the screws on little Kim and bring the dictator to his knees. We can no longer stand by meekly while North Korea terrorizes the world. This bill includes my bill that has already passed the House that calls on the State Department to reassess if North Korea should be on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Let us not forget that North Korea helped supply Syria with chemical weapons. It has given Iran ballistic missiles and advice on how to develop its own nukes. North Korea and Iran’s evil cooperation is even going on as we speak today. They are now working together to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach American shores. This bill also puts China in the crosshairs. Chinese banks have enabled the Korean regime to avoid sanctions and build its illegal weapons programs. China even provided the vehicle used to launch North Korea’s new ICBM. China also uses slave labor from North Korea to help North Korea avoid sanctions already in place. China needs to understand how its support for Kim will not only endanger the United States and South Korea, but it also endangers its own security. Mr. Speaker, by targeting these rogue nations, we show we will not go away quietly in the darkness of silence. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ), one of our senior members on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the distinguished ranking member, Mr. ENGEL . Mr. Speaker, today, this House comes together on a bipartisan basis to address sanctions and the rules on the girding sanctions for North Korea, Iran, and, most importantly perhaps, Russia. Importantly, because there has been a lot of doubt about whether this Congress would ever again speak eloquently and forcefully about Russian behavior. Today, we answer that question. Overwhelmingly, we say Russia’s behavior is unacceptable in many ways, not least of which is the incursion of sovereign territory of its neighbors, specifically Georgia, Ukraine, including Crimea. I vote easily and enthusiastically for the resolution today, but it must not be construed, because it references the Minsk agreement, that that means that we don’t mean to continue sanctions on the Crimean invasion. We do. Mr. CHABOT and I, and I know the chairman and the ranking member of our committee, will continue to be vigilant on that until that illegal annexation is ended. Mr. Speaker, I commend the leadership for bringing this resolution to the floor, and I am proud today to be a Member of this body and speaking with one voice about Russian behavior and the need for sanctioning it. Mr. Speaker, this Congress does not trust the President of the United States to manage U.S.Russia relations. Case in point—the first major legislative accomplishment of the Republicanled Congress in the Trump era will be a sanctions package 
that limits, in every imaginable way, the president’s ability to appease Putin. President Trump and his administration have given the American public little reason to trust them on all things Russia. The President obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey, the law enforcement officer tasked with investigating illegal collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Attorney General Jeff Sessions potentially perjured himself by failing to disclose secret meetings with the Russian Ambassador. Donald Trump, Jr. obscured a meeting he had with the Trump campaign’s chairman, the president’s soninlaw, and Russian operatives until the New York Times forced his hand and he had to publish emails that confirmed his collusion with individuals associated with Russian intelligence operations. And now the president is attempting to intimidate his own Attorney General into prosecuting political opponents and upending the Russia investigation. Today, we will pass this sanctions package, the strongest ever, and send a clear message to President Putin that there are consequences to invading peaceful neighbors and attacking American democratic institutions. I reserve an important objection to the fact that this bill allows a waiver of Crimearelated sanctions on the condition that the Minsk agreement is being implemented. Minsk does not mention Crimea, and therefore its implementation should have no bearing on the U.S.led effort to combat the illegal and forcible annexation of Crimea sovereign Ukrainian territory. However, I will vote for this bill because it sends a powerful and unified message to Russia, Iran, and North Korea at time when the foreign policy emanating from the White House is unsteady and confused. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ), a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this sanctions bill. The governments of Iran, North Korea, and Russia do not share American values or interests and are active threats to our national security. These regimes will see a united message from the Congress of the United States with an overwhelming vote in favor of strong sanctions. Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. North Korea, the most dangerous and isolated place on Earth, has tested longrange missiles demonstrating a frightening potential to target our West Coast. Russia has intolerably involved itself in our Nation’s democratic electoral process. Its invasion of Crimea and actions in Ukraine are totally unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, let us act decisively today and put these states on notice: violate international law by threatening the United States and thereby face the consequences. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ), the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member ENGEL for his leadership and for yielding me time. I thank Chairman ROYCE  for his leadership and the way that he has worked with our side of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act, legislation that is desperately needed to prevent this administration from rolling back sanctions tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and interference in our election. This bill’s enhanced sanctions on Russia are important in light of the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, not to mention the many ties between the Trump administration and the Kremlin. In a recent development, the Treasury Department confirmed that ExxonMobil violated existing Russian sanctions while under the leadership of Rex Tillerson, who is now Donald Trump’s Secretary of State. Indeed, in 2014, Exxon signed documents related to oil and gas projects in Russia with Igor Sechin, president of Rosneft, a Russian stateowned oil giant. Sechin was one of the individuals subject to sanctions. Exxon was fined a mere $2 million—a slap on the wrist for a company that earned $7.8 billion in profits in 2016. Russia is continuing its aggression in Ukraine. It is supporting the murderous regime of Bashar alAssad in Syria. It interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. That is why we must strengthen the sanctions against Russia, and we must block Rex Tillerson and Donald Trump from waiving or lifting those sanctions without review. Before closing, I would also note that the legislation before us also includes several measures championed by Democrats on the Financial Services Committee. These provisions will focus the government on creating a national strategy to combat the financing of terrorism, enhance Treasury’s tools for combating money laundering vulnerabilities such as the wellknown risk in highend real estate, and help address the derisking trend that is driving fund transfers into the shadows. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD), a member of the Committee on Financial Services. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3364. In particular, I am proud of the bipartisan language in the bill which would create a national strategy for combating terrorism and illicit finance. The financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit finance present a direct threat to our national security and financial system. It is critical for the government to create and maintain a unified strategy to fight financial crime, both to accommodate new and developing threats and to help Congress develop legislative and funding priorities now and in the future. Additionally, a national strategy should seek to enhance intergovernmental cooperation, to identify illicit financing trends, and to encourage Federal agencies to work with the private financial sector to do the same. Mr. Speaker, this bill does these things and will go a long way in making sure we are keeping pace with the everchanging terror finance landscape. I would like to thank Chairman HENSARLING for his extraordinary conservative leadership on the Financial Services Committee and for helping to include this language in the overall bill. Additionally, I want to thank the chairman of the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee, Mr. PEARCE , and for his support, and for my colleague, Ms. SINEMA , for her work on this as well. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ), my friend on the Financial Services Committee. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3364. The authoritarian regimes in Iran, Russia, and North Korea continue to undermine global peace and security and threaten the safety of the United States and our allies. Russia’s coordinated efforts to undermine democracies and free and fair elections around the world is particularly troubling and demand a strong response. I thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their bipartisan legislation that counters these belligerent regimes and ensures strong oversight by Congress and the American people. The safety and security of our communities and our country must come before partisanship. I also thank the chair and ranking member for introducing our bipartisan legislation introduced with Congressman BUDDto establish a wholeofgovernment strategy to combat the financing of terrorism. Current U.S. efforts to counter the financing of terrorism lack sufficient coordination, and the U.S. has no unified national strategy to guide our counterfinancing efforts. Money is the lifeblood of any organization. We must establish a comprehensive and effective strategy to deny money to terrorists. This strategy will enhance detection, deterrence, and prosecution and ultimately strengthen our broader national security goals. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and ranking member for advancing this important bipartisan national security bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1515 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), my friend on the Appropriations Committee. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the 
ranking member for their leadership on this. This clearly is a big issue pressing the country, and I just wanted to rise in support of what is happening here today; of taking a firmer stance on Russia, Iran, and North Korea; trying to stabilize the peninsula; trying to take care of the funding that is coming out of Iran to all of these terrorist groups across the country and across the world. What is happening with these sanctions here in the targeting of Russian gas pipelines—their number one export—I think is entirely appropriate. The Nord Stream 2, which carries gas from Russia through the Baltics to Germany—and I know Germany isn’t happy about it, but this is something that we have to do. The point I want to make is that we have to address this issue in a comprehensive way. We must continue to focus on how we get our gas here in the United States, our natural gas to Europe, to our allies, so they are not so dependent on Russia. We have got to have the sanctions, but we also have got to be shipping liquid natural gas to some of these allies of ours so they are not so dependent on the Russians, which is part and parcel of this entire approach. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ), a respected member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in support of today’s sanction legislation, which I am so happy to find has complied with the Iran nuclear agreement, something I worked very hard on, as did many here. Experts, the international community, and even some of President Trump’s own advisers agree that the Iran nuclear agreement is working. In June, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran is within the limits set by this historic deal. There are serious issues left to be addressed with Iran, especially in regards to human rights violations and ballistic missiles, which this bill covers. The Iran deal took Iran’s nuclear weapons off the table and allowed us to deal with these remaining challenges. Withdrawing or violating the agreement would be an enormous mistake. This bill upholds our agreement with Iran while also holding Russia and North Korea accountable for their actions. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE). Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise to stress two critical aspects of this legislation. First, it would impose tough sanctions on Russia for its serious international violations, the seizure of Crimea, its violent incursion into Ukraine, its cyber interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Perhaps most importantly, in the present context, it would prevent President Trump from removing or softening existing sanctions without congressional approval. Second, the bill addresses Iran’s unacceptable behavior in the nonnuclear realm, such as ballistic missile development, human rights violations, financing of terrorism, without violating the nuclear deal with Iran. The JCPOA celebrated its second anniversary 2 weeks ago. It has given the international community 24/7 access to Iran’s nuclear sites, provided an enforcement mechanism to ensure that Iran’s nuclearrelated activity is solely peaceful, and elongated Iran’s breakout time to over a year. It has made the world a safer place. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the United States continues to monitor the JCPOA and Iran’s behavior, it is important that Congress continue to refrain from actions that would violate the deal, threaten the deal, or impose careless sanctions that—under the guise of being tough on Iran—would make the United States less safe. This legislation meets that test, and I urge its adoption. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. On Vladimir Putin’s orders, Russia attacked American democracy last year. That makes Russia a threat to this country, just like Iran, just like North Korea. When the United States faces a real threat, we have an obligation to respond. So far, a response to Russia has fallen far short. That ends with this legislation. Along with Pyongyang and Tehran, Moscow needs to understand that if you violate international law, you threaten the security of the United States and our allies, there will be consequences. Now, I wish we were going to pass this incentive to the President’s desk today. So after we vote today, leaders in both houses have an obligation to clear away any remaining issues and get this bill signed into law as soon as possible. So long as Russia remains a threat, so long as Iran and North Korea defy global norms with their destructive agendas, none of us are off the hook. I want to also thank the Democratic leader, Ms. PELOSI , for her advice and counsel on this bill. Let’s pass this bill and keep pressing this bill forward. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to again thank my colleagues; the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. ENGEL ; our counterparts, Senators CORKER and C ARDIN ; the majority leader, Mr. MCCARTHY ; the minority whip, Mr. HOYER ; as well as the leadership on both sides of the aisle in the other body. They deserve credit for their efforts. Let me also say it is critically important that we stand shoulder to shoulder with our European allies encountering Russian aggression. That is why, in the bipartisan HouseSenate negotiations, we secured important changes to improve transatlantic cooperation. So I am confident that, under the text of this House bill that we will pass today, these concerns have been addressed. Let me also say that every time North Korea tests a ballistic missile or a nuclear device, it gets closer to having the ability to strike the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon. For years, the policies of successive administrations have failed to get North Korea to change. Why? Because diplomatic pressure has been applied only in spurts. It has been lifted prematurely for North Korean promises that have never materialized. So we need leverage, and leverage comes from real sustained pressure. That is why I have authored tough new sanctions to crack down on the regime, to shut off the regime’s access to the hard currency it needs to fund its nuclear program, and we have included that in this bill. These sanctions passed in this House in May by a vote of 419–1, and it is time for the other body to pick them up. By including these North Korean sanctions in the legislation, we ensure that our colleagues do so. We cannot afford any more delay, and that is why I worked with the other body to make small changes to the North Korean sanctions in this bill, to ensure swift passage in both Houses. I am confident this bill, including the North Korean sanctions bill, will soon become law. Let me say that congressional engagement in foreign affairs is strongest when we all speak with one voice. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill and join us in sending a clear message to Vladimir Putin, to Kim Jongun, and to the radical regime in Tehran that efforts to threaten the United States and to destabilize our allies will be met with a united American response. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3364 or the bill entitled ‘‘Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act.’’ As a senior member of the Committee on Homeland Security and its Subcommittees on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, and Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security 
Technologies, I am reminded daily that there are actors and nationstates that threaten the security of our nation. Within the past year, the United States has experienced a series of aggressions that threaten not only our nation’s security, but also the very democratic principles that are the foundation upon which our country was built. These hostile acts have been orchestrated and perpetrated by our longtime adversaries—Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Within that short time span, their actions have been so egregious that it is inexcusable that this administration has failed to respond to these acts of aggression with strength and resolve. Mr. Speaker, U.S. intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russian hackers launched cyberattacks during one of the most sacred processes in our republic—the U.S. presidential election. Specifically, we know that Russia was behind the cyber theft of DNC documents and that Russian hackers intentionally targeted 21 U.S. state election systems during the 2016 presidential campaign. This administration refused to acknowledge Russia’s tampering in last year’s election until it became impossible to deny what everyone knows to be true. Further, Iran’s support of groups who actively operate against U.S. interests is disturbing even in the face of the implementation of the JCPOA in January 2016. North Korea is growing increasingly belligerent, launching 17 missiles since the beginning of this year as it attempts to improve its missile capabilities with each launch. Although North Korea has launched missiles in the past, never have they occurred in such a rapid, unpredictable succession. In a show of bipartisanship, our counterparts in the Senate led the charge in adopting legislation that would stop Russia, Iran, and North Korea from operating with such impunity. On June 15, 2017, the Senate passed an amended version of S. 722, the ‘‘Countering Iran’s Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017’’ that not only penalizes Iran but also punishes Russia for its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The fact that that legislation was passed 98–2 demonstrated congressional willingness to set clear boundaries for what is and is not acceptable behavior especially for our adversaries. The House must act just as decisively by passing H.R. 3364. H.R. 3364 will work to avert and penalize any threat posed by adversaries in several ways. One of the most important provisions of this act is that it will prevent the Trump Administration from repealing existing Obamaera Russian sanctions tied to Ukraine and election interference. H.R. 3364 will also impose new sanctions on Russia while strengthening other sanctions. Furthermore, it will require congressional oversight for altering sanctions related to Russia. With respect to Iran, H.R. 3364 will mandate new sanctions on those who support the development of Iran’s ballistic missile program. H.R. 3364 requires the imposition of sanctions on Iran for human rights violations as well as sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Finally, H.R. 3364 clamps down on North Korea by updating and expanding sanctions in direct response to its repeated aggression. In addition, H.R. 3364 also makes it more difficult for North Korea to secure the funding for its illegal weapon program. Mr. Speaker, it is time that this body acts to show that the United States will not tolerate and will respond to threats to our homeland, our national security. That is why I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 3364. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I voted for H.R. 3364, the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Roll no. 413). This legislation is an important step forward in punishing Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and for the country’s alleged interference in the 2016 United States presidential election. The bill also updates and expands sanctions on North Korea at a time when the country continues to pursue dangerous weapons programs. Further, I commend leadership and committee members in the House and Senate for ensuring that the Iran sanctions portion of this legislation does not violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached between Iran, the United States, and five major world powers, including Russia and China. While the Iranian ballistic missile program is deeply concerning and must be addressed, undermining the nuclear agreement, which has forced Iran to remove thousands of centrifuges from service and halt all uranium enrichment, would be a mistake of tragic proportions. The bipartisan support for the bill should be a signal to the administration to refrain from taking action that would encourage Iran to change course. To be sure, Iran has some unsavory hardline people in key positions of leadership, but these hardliners just suffered a major defeat in the Iranian elections. President Hassan Rouhani has been a voice of and a force for moderation—and people voted for him. We must proceed with the utmost caution and develop a thoughtful approach to ensure we continue to keep Iran away from the nuclear threshold, while also countering the regime’s nefarious activities. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3364—but with reservations. I strongly support the section of this bill that provides a role for the Congress before any president may waive sanctions or provide relief from sanctions against Russia. Russia sought to undermine America’s 2016 election. It attempted to subvert our democracy. It did so deliberately, methodically, and ruthlessly, spreading lies and misinformation and exploiting weaknesses in computer systems and records to steal private information and release it in sensationalistic fashion. These attacks against our democracy were and are totally unacceptable and must be condemned. I remain bewildered that the current president of the United States still fails to acknowledge that these actions happened and that the Russian government, at the very highest level, is responsible—even though there is a consensus among all U.S. domestic and international intelligence and law enforcement agencies that this is the case. Sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration in response to this multifaceted operation were lifted by President Trump. This legislation rectifies that situation by reimposing those sanctions and ensuring that they cannot be removed without congressional consultation and consent. In addition, Russia continues to threaten its neighbors, especially Ukraine, for which economic and military sanctions are now in place. But I am somewhat reluctant in my support for this legislation because of the provisions included on Iran. Like all my colleagues, I am worried about Iran’s continued testing and development of ballistic missile technology. It is threatening and provocative to Iran’s neighbors and the region. I also oppose Iran’s support for regional militant and terrorist organizations, and for choosing to side with the brutal regime of Bashir alAssad in the Syrian conflict, as did Russia. I do support, however, Iran’s continuing compliance with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—or the Iran nuclear deal. I worry that the sanctions against Iran included in this bill will be used and manipulated to undermine the JCPOA. I am worried that we now have a president and an Administration actively seeking to abrogate this international nuclear agreement. And I strongly oppose any action that would violate, let alone abandon, the JCPOA. The Trump Administration—and the White House in particular—seem hellbent on putting us on a path that leads to yet another costly war in the Middle East and to a nucleararmed Iran. This would be a calamity of the greatest order, one that would place our friends and allies in the region in even greater danger than what they now face. We must not go there. While I will vote in favor of H.R. 3364, I do so with grave misgivings about how President Trump will seek to exploit the sanctions against Iran provided in this bill to violate U.S. obligations under the JCPOA, which will, in turn, give permission to Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, and bring us all to the brink of war in the Middle East. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3364. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION RELATING TO ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 468, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 111) providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection relating to ‘‘Arbitration Agreements’’, and ask for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 468, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
H.J. R ES. 111 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection relating to ‘‘Arbitration Agreements’’ (82 Fed. Reg. 33210 (July 19, 2017)), and such rule shall have no force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans want something different in their Nation’s Capital. They want to change the toxic culture in Washington, D.C., that for far too long has allowed unaccountable bureaucrats to overreach and overregulate. The best way we can change Washington is to begin to drain the bureaucratic swamp, but it is not easy because we have seen in the last 6 months the swamp fights back. The most recent example of this is a rule issued by one of the swampiest of Washington bureaucracies, the Orwelliannamed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We all know that this is a rogue agency with a checkered past, chock full of rampant allegations of abuse, racial and gender discrimination, and Big Government nannyism, which constantly makes credit more expensive and less available to hardworking Americans. Mr. Speaker, so radical is this agency and so extreme in lacking accountability that a threejudge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals declared the Bureau’s governing structure unconstitutional. Now, this unaccountable bureaucracy has joined forces in an unholy alliance with one of the Democratic Party’s favorite special interest groups; namely, the trial lawyers lobby. And this unholy alliance will specifically deprive consumers of a lowcost, easy way to resolve legal disputes that can be accomplished without hiring trial attorneys. What the Bureau and the wealthy trial lawyers want is to take away arbitration for consumers and, instead, force them into class action lawsuits, which just so happens to require consumers to hire the very trial lawyers who will benefit most from this rule. Americans were promised a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but, instead, they obviously got a trial lawyer enrichment bureau. Oh, by the way, the director of this swampy bureaucracy rushed this regulation onto the books because it is widely reported he is on the way out the door to run for political office in Ohio. Let’s be clear, Mr. Speaker, one accountable bureaucrat has decided that he knows better than the American people, and he has acted unilaterally to dictate the terms of contracts in a way that will actually increase consumer costs and reduce consumer choice. In a free and Democratic society, no one unelected individual should possess this much power. Mr. Speaker, making consumers pay more for less is the exact opposite of consumer protection, but it is exactly what this regulation means for every American. This regulation will perpetuate a justice gap that takes away a quicker, less expensive legal option for lowincome and middleincome Americans. Even the CFPB’s own study says this: the Bureau’s own study found that 87 percent of the class actions it examined resulted in no consumer benefit whatsoever. In the mere 13 percent that actually provided some benefit, Mr. Speaker, the average payout per consumer was $32. How much did the trial attorneys make? 31,000 times that amount. So, again, Mr. Speaker, we have an average payout of $32 for the consumers and millions for the trial attorneys. So no wonder the powerful trial attorneys lobby is so eager to see this rule go into effect. The Bureau’s own study also concludes that arbitration is less expensive for consumers and up to 12 times faster than litigation. b1530 Consumers who obtain relief in arbitration recovered in a CFPB study an average of $5,389. Again, Mr. Speaker, compare that to $32 the average consumer received under the CFPB study. Now, we are about to hear from some Members on the other side of the aisle that somehow consumers will lose their day in court and that somehow big banks will be helped. The CFPB’s own study shows that not a single class action it examined, not a single one, resulted in trial by a judge or a jury. So no consumer got his or her day in court under the Bureau’s preferred class actions. Instead, we know consumers are far more likely to obtain decisions on the merits in arbitration. With this rule, we once again see our colleagues in the other party hurting small community banks and credit unions. I have a statement that has been published already from the Independent Community Bankers of America. They are not Wall Street. This is small town community banks, and their statement says they strongly oppose the CFPB rule. Also, I have a statement from the Credit Union National Association— again, Mr. Speaker, not Wall Street, but credit unions, our neighborhood credit unions. They say that the CFPB’s rule will limit options for resolving disputes and could increase the number of frivolous lawsuits and that credit union members ‘‘could suffer when costs rise and resources are depleted as a result of this rule.’’ Indeed, the CFPB, itself, estimates its final rule will increase costs for American businesses over $1 billion per year. That is money that our community banks and credit unions won’t be able to lend to our small businesses, to our families, and to American workers. The CFPB’s rule is bad for consumers, it is bad for community banks, it is bad for credit unions, and it is bad for our economy. Washington should be focused on creating more jobs, not more class action lawsuits. So, Mr. Speaker, it is time to fight the bureaucratic swamp. It is time to pass the resolution offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). I appreciate his leadership in helping protect consumers instead of enriching trial lawyers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.J. Res. 111 is an affront to hardworking Americans across the country. Using the Congressional Review Act, this joint resolution repeals the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s final rule to curb forced arbitration clauses in contracts for consumer financial products. Today, many banks require consumers wanting to open a bank account, get a credit card, or take out a private student loan to enter into forced arbitration agreements that take away their rights to collectively sue the bank for any harm. Instead, consumers must go through bank friendly arbiters to resolve their grievances. These contracts are literally buried deep into the fine print, enshrouded in legalese. Consumers don’t know what they are giving up—but the banks do. Arbitration proceedings, which happen behind closed doors, have no judge and no jury. Their proceedings and their outcomes heavily favor big businesses and Wall Street. Studies have shown that forced arbitration favors big business and results in less compensation for American consumers who have been abused or defrauded, if they receive any at all. Simply put, forced arbitration is an instrument that benefits large corporations and Wall Street banks, and it 
hurts consumers. For example, everybody remembers Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo continues to use forced arbitration to prevent consumers from working together to sue the bank for opening up millions of fraudulent accounts using their personal information. Just weeks ago, the Consumer Bureau used a critical rule to finally clamp down on forced arbitration clauses. The Consumer Bureau should be applauded for taking this step to help consumers by fully restoring their legal rights. Once again, the Consumer Bureau has acted to make our financial marketplaces fairer and transparent. As is their practice, the Consumer Bureau issued this rule after careful deliberation and exhaustive review. As part of this deliberative process, they issued a 728page report on the issue, considered views from all stakeholders, and consulted carefully with the other Federal financial regulators. The Consumer Bureau’s final rule has widespread support, including from over 310 consumer, civil rights, faith based, and senior groups, 256 law professors and scholars, and the Military Coalition, an organization that represents 5.5 million current and former servicemembers and their families. Now, this rule was just finalized, but congressional Republicans are already shamefully forging ahead to cut it off at the knees. This resolution wouldn’t just nullify the rule, it would also prevent the Consumer Bureau from ever issuing a rule that is ‘‘substantially similar.’’ That means, if Republicans pass this resolution into law, then, for the foreseeable future, consumers will be robbed of important legal rights and generally left at the mercy of industry friendly auditors. Let’s be clear. There is absolutely no valid public policy rationale for repealing this rule. It is a part of a pattern from congressional Republicans of irrational hostility toward the Consumer Bureau and its work and a callous disregard for the issues facing America’s consumers. But just as they have with the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act, Republicans are pushing an anticonsumer agenda that puts profits over people. Enough is enough. We must hold true to a fundamental principle of our democracy that each of us has a right to trial if we so choose. The rule fully restores this right to American consumers by giving them a choice between arbitration or the free exercise of their Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury through whatever means they choose. So I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this senseless and harmful resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), who is the sponsor of the legislation and vice chairman of our Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership on getting this legislation to the floor. Mr. Speaker, the CFPB’s anticonsumer, antiarbitration, pro trial lawyer rule is just the latest example of the harm that can be done by an outofcontrol, Washingtonknows best bureaucracy. This is a teaching moment for the country about how, when elites in Washington pander to special interests, they end up hurting the very people they claim to be protecting. We all want fairer outcomes for consumers, but the CFPB’s unfair, deceptive, and abusive rule will deprive millions of Americans of a convenient, fast, and effective way to resolve their disputes. According to the CFPB’s own study, only 13 percent of class actions provided a benefit to consumers, and the average payout was—get this—$32. How is that proconsumer? The same study, on the other hand, showed that consumers who obtain relief through arbitration recover over $5,300, on average. Again, that is $5,300 in arbitration against $32 through a class action. Meanwhile, trial lawyers in class actions earn about $1 million, on average. Consider that—$1 million for the plaintiffs’ lawyers, a $32 coupon, $32 cash, for a consumer. In other words, trial lawyers stand to earn 31,000 times more than a consumer in a class action. In arbitration, however, consumers get meaningful relief. Yet the CFPB has finalized a rule that would effectively get rid of arbitration and promote class actions as the preferred dispute resolution process. This hardly seems fair. The CFPB’s antiarbitration rule is an invitation to trial lawyers to take all they can get. Banks, credit unions, and other businesses that American consumers interact with on a daily basis will be forced to hold greater reserves because of the risk of future costly litigation. This will increase costs for consumers, and it will lead to less access or more expensive financial services for millions of Americans. It could also harm the safety and soundness of the financial system, according to the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the main Federal banking regulators. The DoddFrank Act requires that any move by the CFPB to regulate arbitration agreements needs to be in the public interest and for the protection of consumers. I fail to see how forcing consumers to accept a coupon for their troubles and handing millions of dollars in payouts to trial lawyers meets either of those goals. Only at the CFPB could endangering local banks and credit unions and restricting consumer access to financial services be cast as a win for the American people. But, again, this is what you get from the least accountable agency in history, an agency with, according to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, massive and unchecked power that is headed by a Director who possesses more unilateral authority than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the U.S. Government. It has long been understood that expeditious, fair resolution of disputes is in the public interest and part of the public policy of this country. The CFPB rule we are reviewing today challenges that premise, as did the DoddFrank section that spawned this rule. But it is the people, acting through their elected Representatives, who have the final say in this matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Pennsylvania an additional 30 seconds. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.J. Res. 111 so that Congress can, through the Congressional Review Act, strike down this unfair, deceptive, and abusive rule and push back against an outofcontrol agency. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and stand for consumers, fairness, and the American economy. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE MEYER ) be allowed to control the remainder of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. M ALONEY ), who is a senior member of the Financial Services Committee and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding to me and for her leadership on this committee and in so many other ways. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this resolution. My friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about what this bill does, but let me tell you what it does not do. I want to be absolutely clear that this rule does not say that arbitration is bad for consumers, and it does not say that consumers can’t use arbitration. The only thing that the CFPB’s rule says is that financial institutions cannot force consumers to waive their right to participate in class action lawsuits and only use arbitration. This protects an individual customer’s rights. This is critically important because the evidence shows that consumers receive a great deal more relief from class action litigation against institutions than they do in arbitration. So my friends on the other side of the aisle always say that they believe in consumer choice and customer choice and that customers should be able to choose what is best for them and not be dictated to by this Congress, but mandatory arbitration clauses restrict choice for consumers. They prohibit 
consumers from choosing class action lawsuits over arbitration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 10 seconds. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. The CFPB’s rule would restore this consumer choice, further empowering people, customers, empowering them to make their own decisions for themselves. This should be welcomed by any American. This should be welcomed. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this resolution. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution which would block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from denying the American people use of arbitration as a means to resolve consumer complaints. I went to the CFPB website last night, and the first thing I saw read: ‘‘We are the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. Government agency that makes sure banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat you fairly.’’ If we handed out grades to government agencies based on their ability to meet a mission statement, the CFPB would most decidedly receive an F. That is because the Bureau’s arbitration rule does absolutely nothing to ensure that consumers are treated fairly. In fact, this rule is proof of what House Republicans have said for years: the CFPB does not operate in the best interests of the American consumers. The Bureau’s own study, which we have cited several times already and will continue to cite, shows that arbitration helps consumers and that the alternatives are far less successful. b1545 Mr. Speaker, the truth of the matter is that this rule is anticonsumer. It hurts the very people the CFPB is supposed to protect, and it is yet another example of Washington bureaucrats looking out for their friends instead of the American people. Today, this body will cast a vote to ensure U.S. consumers are treated fairly and that they have the tools necessary to get the best possible settlement in their case. Mr. Speaker, if the CFPB can’t adhere to a simple mission statement and provide actual consumer protections, Congress will do it for them. I want to again thank Chairman HENSARLING and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ) for their leadership on this issue and so many more issues that impact consumers. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans are siding with Big Business again, against our consumers. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the distinguished leader and a strong supporter of consumers and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I commend my distinguished ranking member of the Financial Services Committee for her brilliant leadership, for her bipartisanship, and for always trying to find a way to help America’s consumers and protect America’s taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I am very sad today because of what is happening on both sides of the Capitol. The cruelty, carelessness, and contempt Republicans are showing for working families boggles the mind. Now, Senate Republicans are careening toward shattering the healthcare of millions of Americans, with no regard or appreciation for the consequence. Every chance they get, they stack the deck against America’s working families. Here, on this side of the Capitol, Republicans are stacking the deck even further against America’s working families by seeking to deny those families their fundamental right to obtain justice in court. Eight years ago, unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited a financial meltdown that devastated families across the country. Democrats proudly took bold action and passed Dodd Frank, the strongest set of consumer financial protections in history. But today, House Republicans are once again trying to destroy those protections for America’s consumers. Last month, Republicans passed what we called the ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act, the DoddFrank repeal, which was a giveaway to the financial industry at the expense of hardworking families. Republicans are waging a war on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a bureau that has returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million wronged Americans, many of them seniors, veterans, and members of the Armed Forces. Forcing consumers into arbitration— indeed, forced arbitration—gives financial services providers a free pass to get away with abuse. It denies, again, veterans, servicemembers, and seniors justice against the predatory financial marketplace practices. Sadly, it reflects a Republican Party that works relentlessly to empower Wall Street and to rig the system against consumers. It denies them consumer class action. More than 800 years ago, the Magna Carta first laid out a basic right to justice as the foundation of a fair society. Even under a king, the Magna Carta declared, this much was owed the people: ‘‘. . . to no one will we deny or delay right or justice.’’ Every day, Americans take a similar solemn pledge: ‘‘liberty and justice for all.’’ Republicans’ attack on consumers insult those pledges and deny Americans their justice. All the American people deserve a better deal than what they are getting from the Republicans in Congress. Democrats are going to fight back. We will fight to protect hardworking American consumers. We will fight to put leverage back into the hands of the American people. Who has the leverage? If I am a financial institution and I know that you have no leverage, that you cannot act in a class action way, you can just imagine what I have in store for you. But if I think you have leverage and you can act in a different way and not be forced into arbitration, I might have more respect for our financial relationship with each other. We will put the leverage back in the hands of the American people. We will fight this resolution. I call upon my Republican colleagues to join Democrats in voting ‘‘no’’ because this bill is an unfair and unjust bill. Who is it unfair to? America’s working families, America’s consumers, and America’s taxpayers. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ), chairman of the Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, let’s talk about a stacked deck: trial attorneys putting cash over conscience. That is not the answer that we are in search of, but it is the answer that others who are opposed to this certainly are. The CFPB, the socalled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has a study itself that shows that consumers who actually use arbitration reach more favorable outcomes than those who are roped into lawsuits with cash starved trial lawyers. It is astounding that only 13 percent of these lawsuits provide any benefit to actual consumers, but the Bureau is still pushing this illadvised rule. Arbitration decisions also come much more quickly for consumers. Again, the Bureau’s own study concludes that arbitration decisions come 12 times faster than lawsuits. So let’s review quickly: a faster, more favorable outcome for consumers versus helping trial lawyers line their pockets. This should not be hard. In fact, Mr. Speaker, according to the D.C. Circuit Court, unelected Bureau Director Cordray has more unilateral authority than any other single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the entire U.S. Government. Congress must begin to use its authority to hold this agency accountable for its anticonsumer policies and actually provide the checks and balances that our Founders would have intended. That is the stacked deck that we have right now, folks. The Bureau’s flawed arbitration rule does absolutely nothing to protect the consumers it is charged with protecting. Instead, it is nothing more than a windfall for trial lawyers and wellconnected Washington elites. The 
rule’s only accomplishment will be to create more class action lawsuits, lining trial lawyers’ pockets with more cash while providing no real protection to consumers. This anticonsumer rule will have the effect of making consumers wait longer for worse decisions as they seek resolutions for their disputes. In no way, shape, or form does this rule actually do what the Bureau was created to do: protect consumers. This CRA is an important step in allowing Congress to rein in this rogue agency. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee and ranking member of the Small Business Committee. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the right to seek redress in the courts is one of the most fundamental rights we have as Americans. Unfortunately, companies routinely try to undermine this right by including mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts we use every day, including credit cards, student loans, auto loans, and cell phones. These clauses often state that a consumer must resolve a dispute they are having with a third party often chosen by the company at a location that is chosen by the company. Companies also use these clauses to block class action lawsuits brought by consumers. Now, once again, thanks to the CFPB, contracts that have these clauses will no longer be permitted to prohibit consumers from banding together or joining a class action. This rule helps hold companies accountable and protects consumers. That is why more than 280 consumer, civil rights, labor, community, and nonprofit organizations support this rule. That is also why unscrupulous firms are lobbying so aggressively to block this rule. Stand up for consumers. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this joint resolution. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), chairman of the Financial Services Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: the antiarbitration rule recently finalized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is not consumer protection. It is a giveaway to special interest trial lawyers that will expose financial firms to ruinous liability; limit consumer access to affordable, highquality financial services and products; and undermine consumers’ ability to resolve disputes more quickly and more costeffectively than class action lawsuits. The Bureau’s own study found that, while trial lawyers earn millions of dollars in fees, in 90 percent of class action lawsuits, consumers were awarded absolutely nothing—nothing. Of the remaining 10 percent, the average payout to consumers was a mere $32. That same CFPB study found that the average arbitration payout was almost $5,400, or over 150 times more than the average class action recovery. Even more troubling, the Bureau’s unilateral decision to ban alternative dispute resolution will result in increased litigation costs for financial services firms, undermining their safety and soundness, forcing consumers to pay higher prices and making it more difficult to obtain credit cards and other financial services and products. That is not proconsumer. For these reasons, I am a proud cosponsor of Congressman ROTHFUS ’ bill that would disapprove this misguided resolution to the Congressional Review Act. Congress should be making the laws of the land, not unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats at the CFPB circumventing the democratic process. That is why, in addition to invalidating this bad anticonsumer, protrial lawyer, antiarbitration rule, Congress must act swiftly to rein in the Bureau and subject this agency to the congressional appropriations process, reclaiming Congress’ constitutional power of the purse over this outofcontrol agency. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution of disapproval to block this illadvised, anticonsumer rule and reclaim its authority under Article I of the Constitution. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON), a leading member on this consumer issue. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, if you listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle, they are going to tell you that having access to a lawyer in a court is a bad thing, but it is the foundation of American justice. The foundation of American justice is that, if somebody rips you off, you can sue them in court. These arbitration clauses are the fine print, Mr. Speaker, that you find in these contracts that say, if you have a dispute with this particular company, you can only go to arbitration. And these arbitrators are almost always picked by the company themselves. The fact is this is not justice. It is a railroad court. It is not a real court, and consumers are less well off. That is why over 100,000 individual consumers across the country wrote in to support the rule during the public comment period. If my friends on the other side of the aisle are right, how come they don’t have 100,000 people saying that their position is correct? The people have spoken. They have engaged in the comment period and said: We want to be able to go to court to hold these people accountable. Wells Fargo ripped off literally hundreds of thousands of Americans. In 2 million transactions, they opened up accounts people never asked for. If you sue them, you might just be limited to an arbitration clause, which limits your award, and they pick the judge. Why not be able to join with other Americans and sue in court the good, oldfashioned way: get some discovery, get some money back, get some justice? This is what it is all about. We believe that the American people deserve to take them to court if they take your money and rip you off. That is what we are standing up for today. This is nothing but a U.S. Chamber, Big Business giveaway that they are talking about. We stand on the side of American consumers. American consumers want to take them to court. b1600 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ), vice chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, this resolution of disapproval will repeal the CFPB’s Arbitration Agreements rule, a rule that consumers are going to be able to be protected by, according to the CFPB. That is their stated mission: to protect the consumers. Let us look at the data that has been provided by the CFPB. Just 13 percent of the class action suits actually provided a benefit to the consumers. And what was that whopping benefit? Thirtytwo dollars. Thirtytwo dollars that they are willing to celebrate over as compensation for people who have been harmed. Let us look at the other side of the ledger. What are trial lawyers receiving? On average, $1 million. So while our friends may want to stand up for the trial lawyers, for their milliondollar paychecks, we are going to choose to stand with the American consumer to make sure that they are going to be able to receive the justice that they deserve, and one way to be able to do that is going to be through arbitration. When we look at the CFPB’s own statistics, the average arbitration payout is not your $32. It is almost $5,400, which has been received in terms of compensation that is going to be paid. This latest rule, Mr. Speaker, joins a growing list of CFPB actions that have hurt consumers. Since the Bureau’s inception, they have rolled out rules and regulations 3
1⁄2times faster than other Federal agencies, and according to the research from the American Action Forum, just 26 of these regulations have added an additional $2.8 billion in regulatory costs. The practical effect of the Bureau’s actions are measurable, especially in rural districts like mine: no mortgage credit for young families trying to purchase their first home, community banks that spend more time on compliance than serving their community, and small businesses that cannot get the capital that they need to grow. The Arbitration Agreements rule is nothing more than the latest sleight 
ofhand by the Bureau taking money out of pockets of consumers and gifting it to trial lawyers. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. VALADAO ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, the CFPB would lead you to believe that a multiyear class action lawsuit—and that is according to the CFPB’s own estimates, average attorneys’ fees of $388 million, and that is a win for consumers. The judgment is not on the side of consumers. They may want to stand for the trial lawyers. We are going to stand for the consumers. Let’s repeal this and institute the CRA for the arbitration rule. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO ), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee and a strong progressive member. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Let us be honest. There are no legitimate consumer groups who support repealing this rule. The consumer groups are actually with the consumers, and they want this rule. So let us be clear. This rule is being repealed for the biggest financial institutions in the country. Let us be clear. I do not oppose arbitration as an option. I do oppose it as the only alternative allowed. Very simply, you go to a bank, they open up a bank account in your name, they steal your money, they move it over. If you catch them, you go to the bank, you file arbitration, they give you your $100 back and maybe a dollar’s worth of interest, and it is over. They don’t tell you there is 2 million, 3 million, 5 million other people with the same situation who don’t know about it. Because it is arbitration, no one talks about it. It is done in private. I am not opposed to arbitration as a way to avoid court when possible. I am vehemently opposed to taking options away from consumers that say you cannot individually stand for your rights. That is what this bill does. That is all it does. If you care about consumers, you would work with us to try to find a simpler way. You don’t want to do it. You want to help the big boys. Good luck. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ), the vice chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau implemented their most recent arbitration rule. While this rule claims consumer protection, it does the very opposite. It will cost Americans more of their hardearned money and time. The CFPB is arguably the most powerful and yet unaccountable government agency in the history of this country. By intentional design, the CFPB is not accountable to Congress or the taxpayer. According to the D.C. Circuit, the unelected CFPB Director, Richard Cordray, ‘‘possesses more unilateral authority than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the U.S. Government.’’ What does this mean exactly? Well, it means that no one is checking the Director’s actions. The CFPB is able to evade all limits and restraints proposed by the government. Because of this, Director Cordray is only looking out for one person—that is himself. The CFPB chose to ignore their own study because the results did not fit the narrative they were trying to impose on Americans. This study showed that the average consumer receives $5,400—we have heard this already—in cash relief when using arbitration, as opposed to an inadequate $32 through class action suits. In addition, the study concluded that the use of arbitration produced a higher recovery rate and shorter timeline for the consumer, and that is good. Regardless of this study, Director Cordray has refused to acknowledge that taxpayers will feel the immediate damage that comes from limiting their options by being forced to pay more for less. Bottom line, this is just another example of overregulation by the CFPB taking away the option of arbitration that will hurt all Americans. As a small business owner, I have gone both ways. Arbitration wins every single time for those involved. It is called fairness. Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative KEITH ROTHFUS for leading the way on this muchneeded CRA. I encourage all my colleagues to join us in repealing this harmful rule and ensuring the Bureau is not able to issue any similar rule relating to arbitration. In God We Trust. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, which is more fraudulent? On the one hand, we have Wells Fargo, 3 million phony accounts, and then they use their forced arbitration provision to tell people that if you signed up for a legitimate account and there was some language in there that created arbitration, that it even applies to the phony accounts. Well, what is even more fraudulent? The supporters of this bill who say that the rule deprives people of the option of arbitration. It hardly does that. It simply prohibits forced arbitration. But more important are the numbers. Arbitration is typically used by someone with a $50,000 claim. Class action lawsuits, it is 50,000 people with a $32 claim. So then they say: Well, arbitration provides more. Of course it provides more. Because the average person in the pool has got a $50,000 claim, and class action only produces $32 because it is designed for a situation where you have a million plaintiffs or a half a million plaintiffs each with a $32 claim. You cannot compare the two except to say that arbitration is unavailable to anyone with a claim of less than $1,000. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 111. Mr. Speaker, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule forbidding financial service firms from including a mandatory arbitration clause in contracts with consumers. The rule is not only bad for consumers, it highlights the need for accountability in Washington. Unelected bureaucrats wield too much power with too little oversight, and this rule would force consumer class actions and eliminate arbitration options. As an attorney, I know that many class action lawsuits are all too often more about cash for plaintiffs’ trial lawyers than protection for consumers. In fact, the CFPB’s own study even admitted that arbitration is faster, less expensive, and pays out consumers much higher compared to the class action lawsuit. Of course, many trial lawyers oppose arbitration because it denies them of exorbitant class action lawsuit fees. It is an inexpensive alternative to courtroom litigation. If consumers are lucky enough to be part of the successful class action, the average individual payment is, as my colleague just pointed out, only about $32. Remarkably, the trial lawyers raked in $425 million in class action fees between 2010 and 2013, according to a study by Forbes. Of the arbitrations reviewed by the CFPB in which consumers were victorious, the average individual payout was $5,389. Why would the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau want to take a fair and elective alternative for resolving disputes away from consumers when they benefit from them? The consumers have the option to do as they please, but I believe the CFPB’s antiarbitration rule would do nothing but harm consumers, line the pocket of trial lawyers, and literally take money out of the hands of consumers. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.J. Res. 111 to block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s arbitration rule. 
The CFPB is charged with protecting consumers from unfair and abusive behaviors by banks and financial firms. To that end, the CFPB’s rules would prohibit provisions requiring that a bank customer surrender the right to participate in class actions. This practice undermines a consumer’s right to be compensated for damages, particularly when they get nickeled and dimed by the fine print in financial contracts. Class actions often represent the only realistic option for consumers who are ripped off to the tune of a few dozen or a few hundred dollars, and they reduce the burden on the courts by consolidating claims, thereby saving money for both plaintiffs and defendants. Opponents of the CFPB’s rule hope that, by prohibiting the consolidation of claims, they can make potential damages so small that the individual claims are not viable. Meritorious claims from aggrieved plaintiffs who have suffered actual damages would go uncompensated, and equally importantly, wrongdoers would go unpunished. I urge my colleagues to stand up for consumers and ensure that they can be fairly compensated by actual damages and wrongdoers punished. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. TROTT ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 111, which will block the CFPB’s harmful arbitration rule. I want to start with a little story. Last year, I opened up the mail, and I got a wonderful surprise. I got a check for $3.92. Apparently, I was part of some class action lawsuit, didn’t know it, dug into the facts, didn’t feel I had been harmed, didn’t know who the attorneys were, but I got $3.92, almost enough to buy a latte. I did a little digging around and turns out the lawyers representing the plaintiff class made millions of dollars. Now, we have heard a lot of conflicting stories here today about this bill being harmful to consumers. Here are the facts. In a class action lawsuit, a typical consumer gets $32; in arbitration, a typical consumer gets $5,400; in a class action lawsuit, it takes 12 times longer for the consumer to get the money. But how can this be? Well, in my prior life, I represented a lot of clients who were involved in class action lawsuits. Here is your typical class action lawsuit. It involves a highly technical violation, not the Wells Fargo example, where there is little or no harm to the consumer, goes on for years, costs millions of dollars in legal fees, and at the end of the day, there is a settlement for $3.92. I will make a deal with my friends on the other side of the aisle. I will buy anyone a latte who comes clean with the American people and tells them why they are opposing this bill. The reason why they are opposing this bill is the Trial Lawyers Association makes millions of dollars, and that money lines the pockets of their campaign coffers. It is not about consumers. It is about lawyers protecting lawyers, and it is about protecting the bureaucrats in the swamp. I ask all my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle talking about this $32. Republicans keep discussing that consumers get $32 in class action, but they ignore how few consumers win in arbitration. Big banks win 93.1 percent of the time in arbitration. The deck is stacked against consumers, not Wall Street. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON), a leading member on this consumer arbitration issue. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman, and I rise in strong support for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on the important topic of forced arbitration. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.J. Res. 111. Forced arbitration is a modern twist to an old trick, tricking people out of their day in court. Forced arbitration tricks people out of their constitutional right to a jury trial on their claim against corporate special interests. Forced arbitration prohibits consumers from taking their case to court for a jury trial and forces the consumer into the back room with a secret arbitrator selected by the corporation who then decides the case for the corporation. It doesn’t take a genius to know what happens when you get behind those closed doors. The outcome will be against the consumer. It is not fair; it is not right; and it is not justice. b1615 Corporate special interests trick consumers into giving up their rights to a jury trial by hiding forced arbitration clauses in the fine print of consumer agreements that they require consumers to accept when there is no other choice. Consider the latest example from Wells Fargo, which was caught red handed engaging in unscrupulous banking practices to the detriment of their customers. They were ruining the credit of their customers by opening millions of fake accounts in the names of their unsuspecting customers. When Wells Fargo got caught, their customers were barred from going to court because they had unknowingly agreed to the forced arbitration. If this is not adding insult to injury, I don’t know what is. Congress authorized CFPB to consider banning or limiting forced arbitration in cases of consumer financial products or services. The CFPB found that forced arbitration clauses denied consumers the ability to obtain justice. That is why Congress should vote in approval of the rule for the CFPB and reject H.J. Res. 111. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Missouri has 6 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 133⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, Ronald Reagan had a unique gift of communicating in a way that reflected the ideas and the thoughts of the American people. He also understood that outofcontrol government bureaucracy had a welldeserved reputation of working in its own best interest, not in the best interest of the American people. President Reagan best defined this mistrust of government when he stated: ‘‘The most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’’ The skepticism Americans have of their toobigtobeuseful government has only increased since Reagan spoke those words. And it is rules and regulations, such as the one we are discussing here today, that fosters the distrust Americans have of their government. The CFPB’s decision to ban arbitration with preference to class action lawsuits will cause harm to both consumers and businesses. Arbitration has proven to be an effective tool that benefits both parties in a dispute, and has shown to be more favorable to consumers than traditional litigation in the courts. The average compensation, as you have heard, to consumers when using arbitration is $5,400. In contrast, the average settlement for consumers in a class action lawsuit is $32. Not only is arbitration more financially beneficial to consumers, it is less costly and less timeconsuming than fighting through the courts. Disputes which use arbitration are usually settled in 2 to 7 months; however, lawsuits can take an average of 2 years to settle. Even the CFPB has recognized that arbitration is more efficient, less costly, and more beneficial to consumers; so it boggles the mind trying to figure out why they are pursuing a course that would harm Americans. It is the responsibility of Congress to rein in government when it is outside the constitutional boundaries of its office or pursues a course of action that is harmful to the citizens. In this case, the CFPB is in violation of both of these principles. I support this legislation that would roll back the CFPB’s ban on arbitration. 
Again, I thank the chairman for the time, and I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ) for sponsoring this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle hate Mr. Cordray so much because he has been so effective, returning $12 billion to consumers, that they would harm the American public rather than admit that they are wrong. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of H.J. Res. 111, which will overturn the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule, prohibiting forced arbitration for many consumer contracts, including student loan contracts. Banks and large corporations often take advantage of ordinary Americans by burying forced arbitration clauses and boiler plate fine print in standard contracts. When corporations force consumers to secretly arbitrate with handpicked firms, which rely on those same corporations for repeat business, the system is rigged. Take, for example, Matthew, who enrolled in a forprofit aviation school that closed before Matthew could finish his degree. At the recommendation of the school, he had taken out $56,000 in private student loans. With debt and no credential because the school had closed, Matthew joined a class action with thousands of other students. But due to a class action ban in the loan contract, the court ruled that thousands of individual students must individually settle their disputes with the bank in arbitration. That means each individual student had to hire their own lawyer, take time off to present their case, and everything else you have to do to present a case. That is why most victims of this kind of fraud will never collect what they are owed. If each victim only loses a little bit, virtually nobody will bring a claim. With the class action, at least you can achieve an injunction so the corporation will stop. Each plaintiff might receive a little bit, but without the class action, the corporation is free to continue the fraud. Without this rule, the banks will continue to use forced arbitration clauses to advance their special interests at the expense of innocent victims who will be ripped off. Mr. Speaker, that is why we need to stand with consumers. I urge my colleagues to do that: stand with consumers, reject this repeal of the important rule, and vote ‘‘no’’ on H.J. Res. 111. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 111, which would repeal protections for our men and women in uniform and other everyday consumers against the use of forced arbitration by megabanks and other financial service providers. Earlier this month, the CFPB finalized strong rules to protect the rights of hardworking Americans to band together in our justice system to hold corporate wrongdoers accountable. This protection is particularly critical for our Nation’s men and women in uniform and their loved ones. For over a decade, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, the Defense Department has warned Congress about the effects of forced arbitration in servicemembers’ contracts. Often buried in the fine print of financial contracts, these clauses waive the rights of veterans and servicemembers to a day in court before a dispute even arises. If these arbitration provisions were so beneficial to consumers and to servicemen and women, why do you have to sneak these mandatory provisions into the contract? There is overwhelming support for this rule among military service organizations who agree that forced arbitration clauses block access to the justice system and funnel the claims of servicemembers into private, costly arbitration systems. Since the Second World War, Congress has continuously expanded and strengthened the rights and protections for servicemembers and veterans out of a sense of obligation that we must honor and protect our men and women in uniform. But this resolution would end vital financial protections for those who have sacrificed so much in service to our country and the fundamental idea that we are a nation of laws and institutions that guarantee the rights and prosperity of every American. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution, to preserve this rule, to stand up for the men and women in uniform, to stand up for the American consumer, and to stop being errand boys for the megabanks. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ), the leader of the Democracy Reform Task Force. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, here we are again: the special interests are running the show in Washington. Pointblank, this resolution will make it harder for Americans to get justice. Specifically, this will unwind critical new rules that allow financial consumers to take collective action. You heard that right. This is an effort to take away your ability to sue big banks when they run you over. Instead, the majority wants to force you into unfair, bureaucratic arbitration processes that severely disadvantage you in favor of the Wall Street firms. I always ask the same question when the Republicans bring these measures up here to gut consumer protections: Who back home is asking for this? Who is coming to the townhalls and begging to repeal this rule? Who is asking you to make it harder to seek damages when someone is being harmed by a big bank? Nobody is asking for this. In fact, as KEITH ELLISON said a few minutes ago, there are 100,000 people who are beseeching us to support this rule to protect them out there. Nobody is asking to repeal this rule or shut this rule down. I know who wants it here in Washington. It is the big money special interests, the socalled swamp. We can’t let this happen. The American people should be furious. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this reckless, shameful effort. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ). Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 111, which uses the Congressional Review Act to disapprove and nullify the rule issued by the CFPB on July 10, 2017. Time and time again, we have seen the CFPB abuse their power and authority to unilaterally issue rules without seeking any input from Congress. Since its establishment, the CFPB has displayed complete disregard for due process, as it has issued enforcement actions against companies that are unjustly accused of wrongdoing. Frankly, the CFPB’s recent antiarbitration rule is no different. This rule would change the ability for consumers to resolve disputes with financial services companies through arbitration, which has consistently provided consumers with expedient, efficient, and less costly resolutions. In short, making consumers pay more for less is the exact opposite of consumer protection, and is the reason we need to reject this harmful rule. I applaud the work of Chairman HENSARLING and the other members of this committee on this work to hold the CFPB accountable. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS), the ranking member of the Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, as representatives of the people, our job is to protect working families. So let’s be clear, we should be protecting 
consumers, including members of our military who sacrifice so much for us. When a predatory lender forces arbitration, it puts consumers into a system where their grievances don’t get the fair treatment of a court. Instead, a law firm handpicked by the corporation will decide the outcome, putting the consumer at an extreme disadvantage from the start. The CFPB issued a long, overdue role to prohibit this unfair practice that benefits wealthy special interests at the expense of the American people. So why would we take a step back? Even worse, these predatory lenders often prey on our military, so we should be protecting our military to have transparent and just legal options. Forced arbitration is just the opposite. Mr. Speaker, we need a process that works for consumers. This resolution will only bring us back to a broken system. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in striking down this resolution. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Missouri has 3 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 7
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), the vice ranking member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose this CRA opposition, which rolls back critical protections for American consumers. Passing this resolution would set a nearly irreversible policy that allows Wall Street companies to commit pervasive fraud while avoiding the accountability that comes with a class action lawsuit. Access to our courts and the transparency and fairness they provide is a fundamental right enshrined in our Constitution. It is a sad irony that many of those that would be denied their constitutional rights through this resolution are the servicemembers and veterans who have risked their lives to protect those rights. When the American consumer takes on a Wall Street corporation, it is already a David versus Goliath situation. Now Republicans want to steal David’s slingshot. Mr. Speaker, don’t let them steal David’s slingshot. Don’t let them steal America’s slingshot. Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to reject this resolution. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ), a senior member on the Committee on Education and the Workforce. b1630 Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 111, a resolution that will undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and allow financial institutions to continue taking advantage of consumers. The CFPB’s arbitration rule protects consumers, including students, servicemembers, and seniors, by allowing them access to justice in court and to participate in class action lawsuits against unscrupulous financial institutions. I am a former consumer protection lawyer. I have no problem with arbitration clauses when they are agreed to by parties with equal bargaining power, but we have seen what happens when institutions include nonnegotiable forced arbitration clauses in the fine print of consumer contracts. Private student loan providers, payday lenders, credit card companies, and banks have consumers sign away their rights to access the court system when they are cheated. The CFPB rule will address that inequity and provide consumers with a remedy. We must reject this effort to roll back consumer protections and allow the CFPB to continue to do their important work. Please vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ), a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this resolution, which would stack the deck against hardworking families, small businesses, and nearly any group or individual who needs financial services. Mr. Speaker, universal access to fair and impartial courts is a principle that is enshrined in both the Sixth and Seventh Amendments of our Constitution. It is the cornerstone of our justice system. Without that access, we cannot hold bad actors accountable; families and small businesses suffer; justice is denied. Forced arbitration clauses protect the powerful by denying Americans their day in court. Big corporations have enormous leverage. They offer essential services and have few competitors. For many consumers, having a cell phone or a checking account means accepting arbitration. Often there are no other options. The CFPB has sought to correct that injustice. The Bureau’s arbitration rule ensures that those who are wronged by a financial institution have meaningful recourse. At Wells Fargo and elsewhere, recent events have shown why that recourse is essential. When our courts are out of the picture, accountability can slip; cutting corners becomes less risky and more attractive. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ), a member of the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, there is one thing about us Americans that separates us from the rest of the world: we have a Bill of Rights in this country, and it includes the Seventh Amendment, and my colleague, Mr. MCEACHIN , just mentioned it, the Seventh Amendment: the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. It is what makes us Americans. And watch out. When you hear them attacking legal fees and lawyers making money, that means they are attacking your rights. They are trying to take them away. For too long, big banks have gotten away with taking advantage of their customers, from fake accounts to subprime mortgages. American consumers have suffered a great deal of harm at the hands of Wall Street, and now we have a rule that will help consumers fight back. It is a rule from the Consumer Bureau that fixes a flaw in the judicial system that keeps victims from accessing justice by banding together with class actions. Don’t let them take your rights away. Let’s fight this resolution. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO ), a Member who is outraged by the attack on consumers by the opposite side of the aisle. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be outraged on this one. About a month ago, the majority party took away the ability of people using the internet to keep their information private. You allowed every person on the internet, every company, to access everything about anybody who uses the internet. The country hated it. During that entire debate, you told America: We are out to protect you; we are protecting you. No one believed it, and here we are again today. You are out to protect the consumers, with no consumer groups who agree with you. You are basically telling people: Trust us more than you trust yourselves; therefore, in order to do that, we will take away your right to protect yourself in a court of law. No one buys it. No one buys it. Leave us alone. Let me defend myself. I don’t need you to defend me. America wants to be left alone. Leave them alone. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, that is what arbitration is all about, to allow the individual to defend himself. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am now prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, today we have heard Democrats speak about the importance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule to stop forced arbitration clauses in contracts for consumer financial products and the harm that would result from this joint resolution to repeal the rule. Forced arbitration clauses severely limit consumers’ legal rights and prevent groups of consumers from holding financial institutions accountable for wrongdoing. The Consumer Bureau’s rule helps to ensure that financial institutions are held accountable and fully protects the legal rights of consumers, including servicemembers and veterans. The majority has shamefully moved to nullify the Consumer Bureau’s good work in a move that ultimately enables financial institutions to get off the hook when they commit wrongdoing, with less redress for consumers. Studies have shown that forced arbitration favors big business and results in less compensation for American consumers who have been abused or defrauded, if they receive any at all. This resolution steamrolls over the Consumer Bureau’s sensible rule without regard for the harm that will result for American consumers and families. This is also despite the broad support for the rule from consumer advocacy, civil rights, and faithbased groups, legal scholars, and advocates for servicemembers. Congress must not curtail the legal rights of consumers, must not repeal the Consumer Bureau’s forced arbitration rule. Vote to protect consumer rights. Vote to fully restore the American principle of right to trial by jury. Vote ‘‘no’’ on H.J. Res. 111. Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to say that I keep hearing my colleagues talk about how fast consumers are taken care of under the arbitration rule. Yes, because they are getting railroaded. As I mentioned, they are in the back room without representation. These are people who have been forced to sign these arbitration agreements, not even knowing that they signed them. Most people who go out now to get a credit card or to get a loan of some kind, they are forced into these agreements and they don’t even know it. They are shocked and surprised when they cannot join with others who have been ripped off in class action lawsuits. So don’t pay attention to all of the information that you have received from the opposite side. Remember that the banks and big businesses win 93.1 percent of the time, not consumers. Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of consumers or are you protecting big business? Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ), the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, and I think we are going to have some answers to those important questions that the ranking member just asked. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER ) for yielding, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue, as I do the gentleman from Pennsylvania as well. Mr. Speaker, since 1925, this institution, the United States Congress, has recognized the right of consumers to engage in arbitration, which we know for so many consumers is their avenue for redress of grievance. We know that this has been upheld on multiple occasions by the Supreme Court. We have almost 100 years of precedence. And now this rogue agency, the Orwellian named CFPB, decides to promulgate a rule, and it is not even an agency. Mr. Speaker, it is one unelected, unaccountable individual who has decided that Americans no longer have the right to contract, they no longer have the right to decide that they would prefer to arbitrate instead of go through a class action lawsuit. Mr. Speaker, let’s let people know what this is truly about. What this is about is the trial attorneys relief act. Theirs are the voices that we are hearing on the other side of the aisle, and we are hearing them loud and clear, because what we know is that, in class action lawsuits, consumers end up with almost nothing and the trial lawyers make out like bandits. Even in the CFPB’s own study, they figured out that those who go through class action are doing well to get $32.35, yet the trial lawyers make out with millions. We also know in the CFPB’s own study that those who went through arbitration ended up with settlements of $5,389. Mr. Speaker, here are just a couple of different class action lawsuits that have happened recently. A Dell Computers class action lawsuit: $500,000 for class members, $7 million for the lawyers; Subway sandwiches: $50,000 for the class members, $500,000 for the trial attorneys. Oh, here is a good one, Mr. Speaker, CocaCola class action: $0 for class members, $1.2 million for the lawyers; L.A. Fitness International: $7,000 for class members, $200,000 for lawyers. Mr. Speaker, the American people are not foolish. It is time to drain the swamp and to start off with the bureaucracy that is taking away their rights to have dispute resolution through arbitration. They are tired of seeing others go and kowtow to the trial lawyers lobby in this town to give them what they want. It is time to make sure that Americans’ consumer rights can be protected, and so it is time that we pass this Congressional Review Act for all Americans. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have worked long and hard to preserve the availability of fair, affordable arbitration to consumers. Hearings before the Judiciary Committee have demonstrated repeatedly that arbitration allows consumers to resolve disputes quickly, fairly and at lower costs than litigation. It also helps consumers to preserve relationships with companies with whom they contract, by avoiding the acrimony of litigation. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Arbitration Rule threatens to undo all of that, not to benefit consumers, but to benefit one special interest—the plaintiffs classaction trial bar. By prohibiting consumers and companies from contracting to arbitrate individual matters, rather than litigate disputes through class actions, it ensures a steady stream of classaction litigation—and handsome classaction attorneys’ fees—for the trial bar. But for consumers, it burdens their freedom of contract, subjects them to long, drawnout classaction litigation, and sets up scenarios in which large portions of any recoveries they obtain will go, not to them, but to classaction lawyers with whom they are forced to deal. For companies, meanwhile, the Rule threatens to force them into choosing whether to continue to fund their arbitration programs or, instead, to shutter those programs to preserve funds for highdollar classaction defense. I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution and against the CFPB’s specialinterest, anticonsumer rule. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 111, which would repeal the Arbitration Rule recently created by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Arbitration Rule is an important victory for consumer protection, because it prevents banks and other financial institutions from stripping consumers of their constitutionally guaranteed right to a day in court. The ‘‘forced arbitration’’ clauses that this rule addresses prevents a consumer from filing a lawsuit against a company, and always forces the consumer into a private and confidential arbitration process that operates outside of the legal system. Additionally, these clauses, which are often buried in the fineprint of agreements and do not allow the consumer any authority to change them, frequently prohibit classaction claims. This means that even if there are thousands of consumers who have been hurt by a bank or financial institution in a similar way, they would not be able to join their complaints into one case. By forcing each and every consumer to endure arbitration on his or her own, outcomes for cases with the exact same complaints will vary unjustly, because arbitration does not set legal precedent. Mr. Speaker, these forced arbitration clauses essentially amount to a ripoff clause. It is clear that this ripoff clause is stacked against the consumer and is meant to shield predatory banks, payday lenders, credit card companies and other financial institutions from accountability when they cheat or plunder consumers. In April of this year, it was revealed that Wells Fargo opened as many as 149,857 fraudulent bank accounts in my home state of Texas, including many in Houston. 
But the ripoff clause prevented consumers from getting justice. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Arbitration Rule rightfully aims to protect consumers from being forced to sign away their legal rights when doing something as simple as opening a bank account, obtaining a credit card, financing a home, or obtaining a private student loan. The CFPB’s Arbitration Rule makes it easier for consumers to file a lawsuit if they are harmed by a bank or financial institution, and increases transparency in the arbitration process. The Arbitration Rule strongly serves the public interest. H.J. Res. 111 is only the latest in a long series of attacks that Republicans have leveled against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau since its very creation in 2011. The Bureau is a tremendous ally in the fight for consumer protection, and it is imperative that its work be allowed to continue. It is unconscionable that Republicans are working so hard to repeal a rule that only serves to protect consumers from harmful and predatory practices by the financial services industry. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in rejecting this harmful resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 468, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 391, a bill originally introduced by Representative Chaffetz of Utah, for the purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FERGUSON ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. 
APPOINTMENT OF INDIVIDUAL TO HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair announces the Speaker’s appointment, pursuant to section 4003(e) of the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114–255), and the order of the House of January 3, 2017, of the following individual on the part of the House to the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee: Ms. Cynthia A. Fisher, Newton, Massachusetts 
THANKING ELLEN MURPHY AND KATIE ORREL FOR THEIR SERVICE AT STAR FOUNDATION (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Ellen Murphy and Ms. Katie Orrel, who will retire at the end of the year after more than 40 combined years of volunteer service at the Southern Technology Advocacy Research Foundation, known as STAR, in Brunswick, Georgia. Ms. Murphy and Ms. Orrel created the STAR Foundation in 1997 to help area citizens gain meaningful and rewarding employment opportunities through career training classes. The training classes at STAR include how to balance a checkbook, to use a computer, and how to write a resume. Ms. Orrel teaches personal financial management and interviewing skills, and pushes her students to do their very best every day. At the same time, Ms. Murphy has been the executive director at STAR since its inception over 
20 years ago, and has done a great job to grow the organization and reach more students. I would like to thank Ms. Murphy and Ms. Orrel once more for helping south Georgians to advance their careers. 
SANCTIONS ON THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge all of my colleagues who voted ‘‘yes’’ on continuous and strengthened sanctions on the Russian Federation. That was the correct vote, and I commend the leadership of Ohio’s Senator SHERROD BROWN , the leading Democrat in the other body on the Banking Committee who fought for this package. The bill also holds Iran, North Korea, as well as Russia accountable. Specifically, Russia for interference in our Democratic Republic, but also for its ongoing human rights violations, its illegal invasion and occupation of Crimea, and continued military violence in eastern Ukraine with over 10,000 dead due to Russian aggression. This bill will impose sanctions on people involved in human rights abuses, those who launch cyber attacks and those who supplied weapons to the Assad government in Syria. President Trump and his staff regularly question the intelligence that shows Russia interfered in our election. Given the President’s priorities lately, it is imperative that Congress send a clear message and make it more difficult to undercut sanctions without congressional approval. This package tells the world: Congress won’t stand by idly. But what a sad day we have reached when there is doubt whether sanctions against Putin’s Russia, liberty’s proven adversary, will be even signed by this President of the United States. 
STOP FUNDING PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last Friday night, an Israeli family sat down for Shabbat dinner to celebrate the birth of a new grandchild, but a 19 yearold Palestinian terrorist put an end to this joyous occasion. The terrorist brutally attacked the Salomon family with a large knife. Pictures of the family’s home show a white floor stained red with the blood of the innocents. A father and two of his children were murdered that night. Upon learning of the tragic event, Palestinians in Gaza took to the streets to sing, dance, and celebrate. No Palestinian leader has even condemned this grizzly attack. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this is our U.S. tax dollars at work. The millions the United States sends to the Palestinians are funneled to terrorists and their families through the so called martyrs fund. The leaders we prop up glorify terrorists and incite violence. The American people refuse to continue this insanity. We refuse to continue enabling terror against the Israeli people. And that is just the way it is. f 
INVEST BORDER WALL FUNDS IN OTHER PROVEN METHODS TO KEEP US SAFE (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, on Friday we are voting on a crucial funding program for armed services. Yet somehow it also includes $1.6 billion to begin funding the construction of an unnecessary border wall. Without discussion, the funding for the border wall was added. This wall won’t make us safer, and it won’t stop drug smugglers, and it will not keep out the bad hombres. If we are serious about protecting our borders, then let’s invest the $1.6 billion in programs that have a proven record of success. Let’s invest in drug detection canine teams. Let’s rebuild our Coast Guard. And let’s strengthen our partnership with Canadian and Mexican law enforcement. These are the proven methods that will keep America safe. 
PUERTO RICO’S TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, Puerto Rico’s territorial constitution is 65 years old today. An act of Congress authorized the island’s people to pass a charter of the local government. It did not, however, eliminate Federal authority to govern Puerto Rico in local matters. The island’s constitution names the territorial government a ‘‘freely associated State’’ in Spanish, but we are not a freely associated State because we are not a sovereign nation. Under the U.S. Constitution, Puerto Rico remains subject to a territorial clause until it becomes a State. Proof of that power is PROMESA, which installed Federal appointees to make final decisions on Puerto Rico’s fiscal matters. The Americans I represent want to exercise selfgovernment in local matters once again; but, more importantly, want to fully possess that power as the States do. 
SECURE FIREARM STORAGE (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, communities throughout our country are suffering from an epidemic of gun violence. In far too many cases, stolen guns represent a growing source of the weapons used in these crimes. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, last year alone, nearly 18,000 firearms were reported stolen or lost just from Federal firearm licensees, or FFLs. That is Federally licensed dealers, manufacturers, and importers. Today I introduced the SECURE Firearms Storage Act to help address the stolengun problem by requiring all FFLs to securely store their inventory when not open for business. Additionally, this bill would require the Attorney General to review and put forth further commonsense security measures to reduce the risk of theft, and require new applicants to detail their security plans before a new license is issued. There are simply too many innocent lives being destroyed by these stolen guns. I invite my colleagues to join me on this bill to make commonsense improvements for gun safety. f 
RURAL AMERICA’S CONTRIBUTIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my friends, my family, my neighbors, and my fellow Americans in rural communities all across this land. I am proud to represent 29 counties in rural west Texas. I am grateful that I grew up in a small town—the town of Plainview, Texas, a little farming community. We are the sum of many things and many contributions and influences, and I am thankful for the influences of that town. I am grateful to my coaches and my teachers. I was inspired by Ms. Becky Taylor, my first government teacher at Plainview High School. I have countless people to thank, and as I walk the Halls here, and as I stand on the floor of the House and cast my vote for the people I represent, I think about all of those people who have made an investment. You see, in rural America, they take responsibility for their community. 
They believe in making investment in all of those young people who are working their way through the school system, who have big dreams to make a difference in the world, and I was one of them. I pray I could be a champion for rural America. I pray I will be an effective legislator and that I will be a strong voice for a people that feel often that they don’t have a voice. Maybe it is because we don’t have the votes, and maybe it is because we don’t have as many people, but what we don’t have in numbers of people, we more than make up for in our contribution to this country in the food, in the fuel, in the fiber that we produce in rural America. The folks who I represent help put food on the table of all Americans. They put clothes on the backs of all Americans. They help fuel this great American economy. They give us energy independence. They allow us to have an affordable, safe, and abundant supply of food. We take it for granted. When you ask folks around the country, especially in urban and suburban areas, ‘‘Where does your food come from,’’ many answer, ‘‘The grocery store or the food truck.’’ b1730 My colleagues and I are standing today to speak about the virtue and the values of rural America and the contribution to this great experiment in democracy and liberty. We know that it is by the blood, sweat, and tears of farmers and ranchers all across this great land. I love everything about rural America, Mr. Speaker. I love the people, I love the values, and I love our way of life. We are not just the energy basin, and we are not just the breadbasket. We are the backbone of this country. If you lose rural America, then you lose something very special. You lose those traditional American values that are at the heart of the greatness of this country. They are counting on us—all of us who represent rural communities—to fight for them. If you think about this Presidential election, more than 70 percent of rural communities and people living in rural areas in the swing States voted for our President. They felt voiceless and powerless. They felt like they were losing their country, and they wanted their country back. They were tired of political correctness. They were tired of donothing institutions and politicians that said they were going to change things and then—status quo. They know, as well as anybody, what is at stake in the next few years and the next several years. This window of time is special. They came out strong in support of our President because they wanted something different. They wanted results. Rural America defines leadership different than we do. They define leadership as working together to solve problems and deliver results. If you don’t deliver results, you are not a leader in rural America. The proof is in the pudding. So I am especially excited about this opportunity in the life of our Nation. I am exceptionally honored to serve in this august body with so much history. I am overjoyed that I wear the rural America jersey when I stand on this floor. I am going to do all I can to fight for the future of this country, which means I am going to fight for rural America’s traditional values, and I’m not going to apologize for it because, again, where we come from is a lot of who we are, and who we are is a whole lot more important than what we do. I am rural America. I am traditional values. I am from the land of farmers, ranchers, and public schoolteachers who believe they can have an impact on a kid and inspire him to believe he can change the world. You are looking at one of them. Mr. Speaker, I thank Miss Becky Taylor, I thank Coach Cunningham, I thank Coach Irlebeck, and I thank youth minister Karl Shackleford. I could go on and on. I stand on the shoulders of a lot of good people in small town, middle America, and I don’t stand alone. I stand in the company of great men whom I have met since I have been here. I know a lot of Americans look at this United States Congress as dysfunctional and donothing, and do you know what? They are right in many ways. But I look at the individuals, and I see some of the most impressive, patriotic people who want to make a difference. I am thankful that in this fight for the heart and soul of this country, in this battle for the identity of our Nation, this constitutional Republic, I have got folks in the foxhole with me. To start my foxhole friends who stand on the side of rural America, I want to introduce a great American, a dear friend, and the president of our freshman class. He comes from a big swath of rural Michigan, Michigan’s First District. He is a general, he is a soldier, he is a businessman, and he is a proud granddad. When I think of JACKBERGMAN , I think of a leader. He is a leader. I am proud to serve with JACK BERGMAN . Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ). Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, how do I even start after getting an introduction like that other than to say that I am so blessed to be part of what I will put up against any Congress as the finest freshman class that has come across this floor to be sworn in. I am just proud to be one of Mr. ARRINGTON ’s colleagues. Mr. Speaker, when you talk about rural America, how do you know it if you have never been part of it? I was born, raised, and grew up in a little Minnesota farming town. My dad came from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan because there was no work there for 18 yearolds. He went to Minneapolis looking for work. Of course, he found it, and then he found my mom. You know how that goes. So she told him that is where he was going to live for a while, and so that is where I was born. I had to walk all of a half a mile to work on a farm to help. It was about a 200head dairy farm that also had some corn and some soybeans, and they had hay. I learned how to bale hay, I learned how to not fall off the wagon, and I learned how to shoot the silage into the silo and not fall into the silo when you are doing it. One of the least favorite jobs was cleaning up the dairy barn because it had those unique aromas. On a hot August day, you learn that they are all unique, but they are all important to the betterment of what we are trying to accomplish here. When you work with your hands—I have seen firsthand how rural America works, the dedication, the hard work, and the life that on a daily basis begins before the sun rises and, in many cases, ends long after the sun sets—that is commitment. It is not only commitment to your family, it is commitment to yourself, and it is commitment to your God that you know that you are blessed with what we have in our land. It is such important work. DANIEL  WEBSTER said: ‘‘Let us not forget that the cultivation of the earth is the most important labor of man.’’ ‘‘The farmers, therefore, are the founders of civilization.’’ It is so easy to believe that when the lights go off at the grocery store at night that the food just magically appears on the shelves. It is amazing how that just happens. Well, we know it doesn’t just happen. It is the last in a series of long steps. Rural America knows better than anyone what it takes to get the food on those shelves. Rural America feeds the world, produces resources that are used in other industries, acts as job creators and the foundation of the economy, provides food security, and contributes to the moral fabric of our society. Farmers face so many challenges already. They are at the mercy of the weather, crop volatility, and ever changing prices. Why is the government so insistent on adding more rocks to the pack of the farmer who is already overburdened in so many ways? They don’t need any more headaches. I have often said that if something works in Michigan’s First District, it will work anywhere. We are largely rural. We have got a lot of big water shoreline, and part of that big water shoreline provides the water to cultivate our fields. We grow a lot of potatoes up there. Anybody who really loves potato chips, chances are they came from a potato that started in Michigan. We grow sugar beets, cherries, and apples, just to name a few. In fact, just this past weekend, back in the district, I had a chance to really taste the cherries that we picked off 
the tree because it is that time of the year. We should be looking forward and looking to rural America as the example for success, not trying to hold it back with bureaucratic regulations and outofcontrol government spending. It is time to cut through the red tape. Rural and urban survival depend on it. Power belongs in the hands of the individual—the farmers, the loggers, the fishermen, the miners, the ranchers, and every other hardworking man and woman in so many districts around the country and especially in our First District of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, speaking of hands, people who work with the land know when you are working with your hands that you don’t just go right to the harvest. You first must till the land. You have to plant. You have to manage the growing season. Only then, after that long process that you cannot shortcut in any way, then comes a successful harvest. It has to happen in order. There is no other way. So anyone who expects good things happen easily has never been a farmer and has never been working with their hands. It is our job not just to honor but to raise rural Americans up as an example that hard work and traditional American values are still something to be admired so deeply. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor just to be talking about this subject tonight. It actually makes me want to somehow figure out a way to get back to the district right away to finish up the cherry harvest. It looks like we are going to have a really good one this year because God has blessed us with good weather. Rural America is who we are, and it is who we fight for. I am proud to be a Member of the 115th Congress. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) for the opportunity to speak on something that is so passionate and dear to my heart. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his wonderful, beautiful, and heartfelt words about where he comes from, how that shaped him, and how deeply he believes in the people in the country, as we say in west Texas. He talked about a lot of things. He talked about the folks who work the land, and he talked about traditional American values. Mr. Speaker, I think you are going to hear some common themes from my colleagues this evening. The gentleman also mentioned the burden of Big Government. I said, coming into this office and after 8 years of the advent and explosion of Big Government, that when our economy in urban and suburban is like a patient who is sick, the rural patients are in the ICU because small businesses, community banks, and family farmers bear a disproportionate burden when it comes to the trillions of dollars and the cumulative effect of all the rules and regulations out of the last year. So rescuing the American economy is about helping a sick patient. Rescuing the rural economy is getting the patient stabilized and off life support so we can live to farm, to fight, and to have the kind of quality of life that we love for another day. Mr. Speaker, I have got a good friend that I have made since I came to the United States Congress. The gentleman is from the 12th District of the great State of Georgia. He is a son of a farmer. I bet he knows something about working the land. I bet he knows something about a work ethic. I bet his daddy taught him something about that. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN ) who is my friend and a businessman. The gentleman received the Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce Small Business of the Year Award, and he will talk about rural America and why it is so important to making America great. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman ARRINGTON , for this Special Order and for this opportunity to talk about what makes America great. Mr. Speaker, I am a product of rural America. I did learn a lot about work ethic and about values. I can’t think of any other way to grow up, to be honest with you. Sure it was difficult, and sure I probably had some times where I thought I would like to be somewhere else. But I will tell you, there was nothing like it, and I take and cherish those memories. I have tried to instill those in my children as well. b1745 It is the greatest honor of my life to represent the people of Georgia’s 12th Congressional District, which is largely rural. We have 18 counties. About 15 of those counties would be considered rural. My district is home to the Masters Tournament and the growing cyber industry in Augusta, but it is our rural farms that are the true heart of my district. Georgia’s 12th District is rural, and I am proud to say it is truly God’s country. You won’t find more steadfast, faithful Americans than in rural Georgia. Agriculture is the number one industry in my home State of Georgia. It is also the number one industry in my district. Our farmers have been forgotten by outoftouch politicians and unelected bureaucrats here in Washington, particularly over the last 8 years. Farm income, for example, is down more than 55 percent, largely due to what our President has talked about, which is our trade policies. However, as of last November, we are approaching a new day. This is President Trump’s day and President Trump’s America. That is why I am proud to have a President that knows that rural Americans deserve more. In April, President Trump created the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity to be led by Secretary of Agriculture and fellow Georgian, Sonny Perdue. This task force was created with one goal in mind: to promote economic growth and innovation in rural America. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I look forward to working with Secretary Perdue on this mission, as well as the next farm bill, which is critical to the lifeblood of our farmers. From looking at cotton to peanuts, to specialty crops and the programs they are using, I have participated in numerous hearings on how to make the next farm bill successful for all of our farmers. I am working hard to make sure the commodities most important to Georgia’s 12th District are protected. We also have a crisis in our community banking system. Community banks are the lifeblood of the creation of small business. We continually lose our community banks. That is why I am so proud of Chairman JEBHENSARLING and his work to pass the CHOICE Act. The CHOICE Act reduces the regulatory burden on our community banks. It allows them to thrive and to provide the capital to grow the small business community in our rural areas. Small business in our rural communities accounts for about 75 percent of all new job growth. We also have to fix healthcare. We are losing a number of our community hospitals. I know in Congressman ARRINGTON ’s district, in small towns, the community hospital is the largest employer in that community, and it is critical that we repurpose those hospitals, that we fix healthcare and we provide healthcare for our rural areas. We also need to look at technology. There is a tremendous need for broadband and expanding our broadband capabilities. I know the President is talking about a major infrastructure package. Broadband needs to be a part of that infrastructure package because the 12th District of Georgia, through technology, could be the new Silicon Valley of the East Coast. We would like to see that trickle down into our rural areas, and it can, but we have to have the capability of the broadband. As far as the future of rural America, we are seeing tremendous strides made as far as technology, as far as farming. Last year, I planted peanuts. I was operating a tractor, which I remember operating as a child and a teenager and having to pay attention to all the moving parts. I tell you, I sat on this tractor and I planted 17 inches over from the year before, and I never touched the steering wheel. The technology is amazing. I was with a group of farmers the other day and we were talking about God is blessing us with a lot of rain and if it continues, we are going to have a bountiful crop, a great yield. They said: Yeah, we are good 8 inches down, but the other 8 inches we are a little concerned about. They have these probes that are measuring how much water we are receiving. 
So we have a got a lot going on in our rural areas. We just, as a body here, need to provide our farmers, our small business people, with the tools they need to get the job done, and they will get the job done. Again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Texas, Congressman ARRINGTON , for shining the spotlight on rural America tonight. It is the lifeblood of this country. I want to see rural America become everything it needs to be. We are seeing improvement in the economy through many pieces of this legislation that we are passing. I hear it from the business community and some of our city centers. It is time for that to trickle down into rural America. Again, I thank the gentleman for shining this spotlight. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his personal experience in agriculture, in a farming family, and a man who loves all that is good about rural America and knows that what is good about rural America is what is helping make this country great. I have got other colleagues that I want to invite to speak. We have got folks from Illinois, Michigan, and some colleagues from Texas. I am looking at a guy from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, another new friend, a dear friend, and a friend of agriculture. He is a guy who not only knows agriculture because he took a loan out right after graduating from Western Kentucky and started a farming operation—he claims it is successful today. I believe him—he was also the ag commissioner of Kentucky. He served in the Kentucky House, and now he is lending his expertise and his love for this country and all things about rural America to the First District of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ). Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative ARRINGTON for shining the spotlight on rural America today. I am proud to be a product of rural America. The great thing about growing up in rural America is you learn values, you learn morals, and you learn a work ethic. Not every individual in America has that opportunity. So those of us that grew up with that upbringing in rural America should appreciate that. That is why, when I took the oath of office as a brandnew Congressman back in November, I said my number one priority is to promote agriculture and restore and revive rural America. I believe we can. I believe in the future of rural America. But we are going to have to work together. Rural America has many challenges right now. The number one challenge is the economy. We need to help create goodpaying jobs in rural America, because in rural America we are faced with a brain drain. That is why our best and brightest young people graduate from the good public schools that we have in rural America, they go off to college or technical school, but they don’t come back. There aren’t the same opportunities, unfortunately, in many of the rural communities as there are in the more urban and suburban areas. I believe that we can change that because rural America has so much to offer. We have work ethic. We have available skilled workers. We have communities where everyone knows everyone. Everyone has a spirit of community. We have good churches, good schools, and good rural hospitals. So I believe that we need to spread that message as Members of Congress. As Members of Congress, we also need to invest in rural America. As was mentioned earlier, one of the President’s main priorities is an infrastructure bill. I believe that we need to invest in infrastructure. I believe in a limited government, I believe in small government, but I do believe it is the government’s responsibility to do certain things. One of those things that is the government’s responsibility is to invest and maintain infrastructure. When we talk about infrastructure, it is not just interstates and airports. It is also things that we need in rural America, like broadband and wireless technology. I believe that we can create an environment with publicprivate partnerships where we can make that investment to help revive rural America and help to create jobs in rural America to keep our best and brightest in rural America. Growing up in Monroe County, which is a rural community in southcentral Kentucky, I had the opportunity to go to Monroe County schools, where I knew every student in my class. I knew the teachers, I knew where they lived, I knew where they go to church. I played every sport I could play and excelled in none, but I enjoyed that opportunity and learned a lot about it. Of course, we went to church on Sundays. Throughout my business career as a farmer, the president of the Monroe County Chamber of Commerce, a State representative, and as a commissioner of agriculture, I always worked hard to try to promote and be positive about rural America. Now as a Member of Congress, I want to join with my fellow colleagues that represent rural areas like the First Congressional District of Kentucky and make sure that we make that investment to where we can take rural America to the next level. So I appreciate Congressman ARRINGTON creating this opportunity tonight to talk about rural America. I pledge to work with him and our colleagues to see that we can make a brighter future for rural America. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his passion and his resolve to be a voice for rural America and for agriculture. It has been great to serve alongside of him on the Agriculture Committee. I have got another dear, new friend and fellow freshman Member of Congress who is a great American. He hales from the great State of Louisiana, my wife’s home State. He represents the Third District. I was about to say I have a couple more racehorses for rural America in the stable. He actually was raised on a horse ranch near Covington, Louisiana. He is a veteran and highly decorated law enforcement officer. He is a man of deep and abiding faith. I say that God probably hears all of our prayers, but when he speaks and prays with that thick Louisiana accent, I think he enjoys his prayers more. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ) and prayerfully ask him to speak about rural America and why it is important to this country. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I recognize my friend, Representative JODEY ARRINGTON , as exactly the type of American that our Founding Fathers envisioned serving within the House of we the people. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to highlight the importance of American agriculture and the spirit of the American farmer. Being raised on a horse ranch, I learned at an early age the value of work and that rural America wasn’t just a place, but a way of life. Now my wife and I live in a 1,000 squarefoot, 65yearold, woodframe home in the middle of farm country in south Louisiana. We have nine pecan trees, two magnolia trees, and two bushes with flowers on them. I am not sure what they are, but I know she knows. She enjoys them. They bloom once a year. Other than that, it is just an honor to represent my district, which is deeply agriculturally centered: farmers, ranchers, fishermen, oil and gas workers, petrochemical workers. They are saltoftheearth folks who know what it is to earn a living. They understand sweat. They understand labor. In representing my district in Louisiana, these are the industries that stand up our rural communities. They are the backbone of our economy. My district is home to the heart of sugarcane for the entire country. Cane farmers in south Louisiana account for about 20 percent of all sugar production in the United States. My district is also home to the rice capital of America. Crowley, Louisiana, right in the heart of Cajun country, is home to more rice mills than anywhere else in our Nation. Those two crops, alone, account for billions of dollars in economic output every year and employ tens of thousands of hardworking Americans. Given a level playing field and opportunities to compete on a global scale, American farmers will always win. b1800 That is why we are working to put American farmers first to open new 
markets, expand American exports, and create jobs in our communities. We are rolling back regulations that slow growth, stifle innovation, and restrict the agricultural industry’s access to the resources and manpower it needs to thrive. We have made great strides this year to help our farmers, and we will continue to do so. Just last week, a groundbreaking rice export agreement with China, the world’s largest rice consumer, was announced. This opens a massive new market to United States rice farmers. These are the type of landmark policy victories that elevate American farmers and bring economic growth to our rural communities. I am committed to an America First agriculture policy where American farmers compete and win. Agriculture is a critical industry that bolsters economic growth and ensures American independence and national security. In my home State, we understand that our economy is run on the sweat of hardworking American patriots. As Congress moves forward, I will continue to work tirelessly with my colleagues on behalf of our farmers and producers to provide Louisiana’s agricultural industry with critically needed support. I am proud to represent a district so strongly rooted in the spirit of rural America, and I am honored to stand with my colleagues today in loud and vocal support for the Americans who we serve in rural America. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the great State of Louisiana for his comments and his heartfelt commitment to his district, to the farmers, and the ranchers like the ranch he grew up on. This is personal for CLAY HIGGINS , and I know when he says he is going to be a champion for rural America, you can take that to the bank, and I want to thank him for his comments. I have other colleagues who are here and want to speak loudly and proudly for the folks from rural America who are counting on us. What we lack in numbers up here, we got to make up for in strength of leadership. I am looking at the bench right now, and I am believing that we can overcome those numbers with effectiveness and with the strength of leadership and courage that it takes to get something done in this town and in this institution. The next gentleman who I want to introduce to the American people who are watching with great anticipation is another freshman wonder from the great State of Georgia, whose district is home to a portion of western Georgia. He went off and got his dental degree and came back to where he grew up, West Point, Georgia, came back home to small town America, and I reckon he did for a lot of reasons, but probably at the top of the list was he wanted to raise his kids in small town America. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia’s Third District (Mr. FERGUSON ), to talk about that and anything else, and there are lots of great things to talk about with respect to rural America. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, the Representative from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ), for highlighting this most important part of our American culture, the rural America. As you mentioned, I came from a small town, like many small towns across this Nation, and we have seen our area fall into decline, but we have seen what happens when you have a tremendous rebirth in your local economy. But there are so many parts of our great Nation in my great State of Georgia that simply don’t have the opportunities that other areas do, and that is not necessarily new. It is something that we have faced in America before, and our country has always stepped up to find the right answers, to give access to success to the people in rural America and, in my case, rural Georgia. And if you think about that, we have done that in multiple ways. We have built infrastructure there that includes highways. We have built electric grids to the rural parts of our communities, telecommunications. It has been absolutely amazing to see what happens and the benefits to this Nation that come when we invest in infrastructure to rural Georgia and to rural Alabama and any other State in this great Nation. One of the things that we have got to recognize is all of the wonderful things that we have going on that have been highlighted by our colleagues here tonight, the agricultural industry that exists, from everything like our colleague from Louisiana talked about, my colleague from Georgia, the farming communities. In our area, we have a tremendous number of cattle farmers, dairy farmers, folks who grow pine trees. All of those things are important, but we have got to talk about enhancing that in a new direction for rural America. As has been talked about here tonight, a big part of that has to be new infrastructure and an information highway known as rural broadband that goes into America. We have companies right now throughout this great Nation that are wanting to invest in many areas. A lot of times all they are asking us to do is to get out of the way and let the private sector take over and do it. If we do that and we build that infrastructure but we fail to educate our children in a 21st century economy, then we have built infrastructure that will never reach its full capacity. So not only is building broadband to the rural community so vitally important, pairing our education system to that is vitally important, too. I believe in our rural communities there is a wealth of talent, people of all backgrounds, ages, demographics that have incredible talents that are yet to be tapped into. I believe that we can tap into those talents, and I believe that those talents can be highlighted, they can be brought out, and they can be enhanced by allowing our education systems to be adaptive, to be able to train these young people, young adults, the future of rural America, to give them the skills that they need so that they can become a competitive part of the 21st century economy. I think that many of our States that have large metropolitan areas like we do in Georgia with Metro Atlanta have a desire to tap into this wealth of talent in this workforce that exists in rural Georgia, and I believe that it gives families a chance to stay together because it creates economic opportunities for families in rural Georgia that simply do not exist right now. So think of a vision for rural America where we are connected with new infrastructure and information technology systems that allow the talent that we have congregated in rural Georgia, every small town across this great Nation, to be able to harness that power, to tie it back into our metropolitan centers, to create vibrant economic opportunities, let us figure out ways to harness that economic opportunity to be able to generate revenue to further enhance our school systems and enhance our communities in rural America. We have incredible talent, and we need to bring that talent to the top. We need to make sure that the talent stays in rural Georgia and all of our communities, and I believe that we can do that. We have got to make the commitment to build infrastructure across this Nation as we have in the past, and I believe the future of rural America is with rural broadband creating business and educational opportunities where we are going to harness tremendous talent and reap tremendous benefits. Rural America is so important to the fabric of our Nation. It is so important to the people, to the leadership, to our economy, to who we are. The greatness and the freedoms that we enjoy are exemplified nowhere better than in rural America. I am proud to be from rural America, I am proud to raise my family there, and I believe that the future is bright. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his comments, and what a strong leader he has been for our freshmen class, and what a great representation of his district in the great State of Georgia. And who knows better about the challenges of sustaining rural communities than a mayor who is fighting the fight at the local level. And so I am just so grateful that he spoke from his heart this evening about our friends and family and our neighbors back home in small town America. I have got another good friend and a guy who knows something about rural 
America. His district takes up almost the entire State of Nebraska. He has had Nebraska as his home and his family’s home for six generations. He served at the local level and at the State level, but his greatest claim to fame is that he married a good friend of mine who served with me in the George W. Bush White House, Andrea. And I didn’t know him before Andrea, but she has done a great job of cleaning him up, and I look forward to his comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the Representative from Nebraska’s Third District (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman ARRINGTON for yielding. It is great to join him and others here this evening to really celebrate rural America. A lot happens in rural America. Oftentimes, it kind of flies under the radar. That is okay. That is generally the way rural Americans like it. It is interesting. As I represent the 75 counties of Nebraska’s Third District, it is part of two different time zones and just a diverse perspective there of many different Nebraskans. I would say that anecdotally, at least, the most common request among my constituents is to be left alone. And it is interesting that when we talk about policies like waters of the U.S. or various—healthcare, interestingly, you know, a lot of promises were made there that haven’t panned out, and so I am grateful that I can represent so many Nebraskans who are focused on solutions, and I seek to really reflect their ideas as solutions here in Washington. Obviously, there is a lot happening now. I would say all too much or all too often there is so much bickering that we can’t get to the solutions that we know will help the American people. I am proud to represent the top producing agriculture district in the country, and of course, with 75 counties, we have a lot of production, whether it is livestock, whether it is row crops. I am happy to have helped start the Modern Agriculture Caucus, and I am grateful for colleagues participating in this effort to focus on new ways of doing things in terms of agriculture. We know that, obviously, agriculture has been around a long time, and things change. Resources can change oftentimes, but I am glad that we can focus on new ways of doing things that we know are good for the environment. We conserve resources, natural resources and others, as we focus on research that has led to increased yields for our crops so that we can help feed the world. We know that many countries around the world look to America as leaders in agriculture, especially production agriculture, and so I am glad to help reflect to those successes, help celebrate those successes. Who would have thought that not so long ago, who would have thought that today, we can have record yields amidst a drought. That not only helps producers, that helps consumers, and that literally helps every person around the world. And America is a big country, we know that, and oftentimes there seems to be somewhat of a disconnect between rural America and urban America. Interestingly, I like to share this story. There was a very wellmeaning civil servant who visited rural Nebraska a while back, and we were touring part of Nebraska. We turned onto a gravel road, and this wellmeaning individual said it had been about 20 years since he traveled on a gravel road. I don’t think there was any intended disrespect at all, but certainly a difference of perspective. And so here we are, literally raising the awareness of all of America in terms of what we can do in rural America as we do focus on helping feed the world, helping feed America, certainly, but applying biotechnology out across the fields and across the prairies of rural America. And when it comes to trade, we know that we are good at producing agriculture products. We want to sell our products around the world, especially when 96 percent of these customers reside outside our country. So that is why I hope that we can focus on trade policies moving forward so that we can bring some prosperity to the home front amidst a struggling ag economy. Let us be honest about that. Crop prices are not what they were, but property taxes are still high, input costs are still high, and we want to do what we can to bring stronger market prices to agriculture. b1815 That is why we want to and we need to focus on the global economy that is so important. I am grateful to have the opportunity to stand here and really celebrate rural America, as we do have so many of the solutions that our country needs right now. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I am honored that the gentleman from Nebraska joined us to lift our voices high, as our flag of rural America flies high in this House. We think about those families, those middle and working class families, every day as we govern on behalf of the people we represent. Mr. Speaker, I have got another gentleman who I am learning a great deal from as I serve with him on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. He is a very passionate man from the great State of Illinois’ 12th District. He is a firefighter, the son and grandson of coal miners, and a proud daddy. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST). Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for hosting this Special Order on rural America. I am a proud resident of a rural district in southern Illinois. If you are from Illinois, you understand that the ‘‘S’’ is capitalized on the word ‘‘southern’’; and that is because it is a unique area in itself. It is nowhere near—and there are great people in the Chicago area, but we are farther—well, actually the district starts just across from St. Louis and goes south to where the Mississippi River and the Ohio River come together. There are a lot of farming communities there. In my opinion, though, we don’t talk enough about our rural communities here on the House floor. So, I am really glad that we are having that opportunity tonight. In so many ways, you have to realize that our rural areas are the backbone of this country. But if you listen to the media and the advertisers and the Hollywood producers, you would think there wasn’t anything between the East Coast and the West Coast. But, let me tell you, I am here today to say that there is. Too many of these small communities are struggling, trying to get through, and, quite often, are weighed down by things that we do here in Washington. They want investment. They care about the growth of their communities and they care about jobs. But when the press talks about jobs, the same industries that come up every time are the tech startups, the consulting firms, the real estate companies, and the new restaurant chains. Those are all good, but one group that doesn’t get talked about enough is our farmers. And let me tell you, that is not something new. It has happened over many years. This Nation’s farmers have planted and kept us fed for all the years this great Nation has been in existence. And I am going to tell you that Benjamin Franklin called farming the only honest way to acquire wealth. Thomas Jefferson said our government would remain virtuous as long as it remained chiefly agricultural. Illinois’ own Abraham Lincoln was born into farming and described agriculture as a great calling. In southern Illinois, beginning farmers tell me their cost of doing business is climbing and their income is shrinking. This is not the first time this has happened. I want to kind of express a story that took place several years ago. Right now, in the Agriculture Committee, we are working on the farm bill. Well, the first farm bill came into existence because thenPresident Ronald Reagan began to hear from the farmers around this Nation of the problems that they were facing and the concerns that they had. And one in particular farmer, a man by the name of Herman Krone, who lives in a little town called Du Quoin, Illinois, about 18 to 20 miles from my home, wrote a letter. Because back then you didn’t send emails and you didn’t send texts. You actually wrote letters. He sent it to the 
President, not thinking that he would get a response, but he just wanted to voice his concern of his son Rick, and was Rick going to stay in the family business. Well, he really couldn’t because of the high risk of doing business in our agricultural communities. Well, one night—as a matter of fact, it was a Sunday night, if I remember correctly, because I heard this story from Herman himself before he passed—the phone rang. Now, I understand it wasn’t a cell phone, like we have now. It was actually hardwired to the wall. The phone rang, he reached over and picked it up, and someone asked: Is this Herman Krone? Mr. Krone? He said: Yes. They said: Can you hold for the President? Herman said: The president of what? The man on the other end said: The President of the United States, Mr. Ronald Reagan. He said: Well, you are kidding me? The man said: No, Mr. Krone. It really is. Sure enough, the President himself called Herman. He said: Herman, I read your letter, and I realize that you understand what the problems are that the rural farmers are facing today. He said: I will tell you what I would like to do. I would like to come to your farm. You bring a group of your agricultural people together and I want to talk with them. And, sure enough, the next month or so, President Ronald Reagan came. The conversation he had, along with other conversations he had around this United States, led to the first farm bill. We are working on that farm bill right now. But farming and ranching operations are getting squeezed, due to low commodity prices, just like they were then. And the need for increased credit, in order to expand the diversity, has to be done. Small familyowned businesses are most affected. We hear about corporate farming, but the fact is, 97 percent of American farms are familyowned farms. That is why one of the bills that I have introduced is known as the BALE Act, which is to modernize the Guaranteed and Direct Loan program at the USDA to better reflect the costs of farming because times have changed. It is our job here in this House to remember that we are dealing with those rural areas and the farmers that are in them. Now, this will help the next generation of producers make their mark on the industry. As Republicans and Democrats, we need to work together on more ideas like this one. We need to keep focused on the heartland because these are the redblooded Americans who love their country and deserve a voice. By addressing the needs of hardworking families who are too often forgotten, we can strengthen these communities for generations to come. It really is all about the next generation. Each one of us in this House hopes and prays that this Nation holds and grows, and the next generation has to come up. We need that generation of farmers to make sure that they stay on the farm. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his heartfelt comments about rural America. I am so proud to be shoulder to shoulder with him in this righteous cause. Mr. Speaker, I now have the greatest privilege of the night for me, because this man has been a mentor and a friend for many years and has probably done as much as anybody to welcome me and coach me up so I can represent west Texas to the best my abilities. He is from the 25th District of Texas, and he is an allAmerican baseball player. Let me tell you, he won back then and he is winning now. I am just so proud that he is on the side of rural America and helping rural America win in the outcomes of public policy so we can keep it strong and vibrant and keep America great. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ). Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that nice introduction, I thank him for what he is doing, and I thank him for bringing rural America together tonight in the people’s House. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to recognize rural America and the impact it has on our Nation. Rural America makes up 72 percent of our country’s land, and roughly 46.2 million Americans simply call it home. Our country has been relying on rural America since the beginning. It is where our roots are, where our values are, and where our heritage began. The 25th District of Texas, which I am honored to represent, has tens of thousands of hardworking men and women who are employed in the agricultural industry. These men and women make up a large driving force that help supply our Nation’s families with products we would be unable to get otherwise. But it is more than that. These folks instill values, such as hard work, ethics, taking days on and not taking days off, doing the right thing, and taking care of your neighbor. This is the fabric of our Nation that is passed on from generation to generation. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight a few specific rural areas in my district that are truly making a difference. Located in Stephenville, Texas, the Tarleton State University’s Southwest Regional Dairy Center is a oneofa kind facility. This establishment is home to hundreds of cows that are used for teaching purposes, research for higher education, and directly contributes to the dairy industry in Texas and all of the Southwest. I am proud to represent this unique institution that not only provides goods to our Nation, but also serves as a learning institute, so we can train the dairy farmers of tomorrow. I would also like to recognize the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant, located in rural Glen Rose, Texas. This power plant has been providing reliable clean power to Texas’ electric grid for almost 27 years. Taking up approximately 10,000 acres of land, this plant can power about 1.15 million homes. Their standard of quality is what has made Comanche Peak one of the best nuclear power plants in the Nation, and I am proud to represent it in our district. It is because of rural places like these and the people that work there that our country is able to run dependably and efficiently. It is why America is the greatest country in the world. And we sometimes think Texas might be the best place in America. I applaud their efforts, and I look forward to continuing to represent them here in the United States Congress. And I remind you that you need to go see the 25th District. You are going to like it. But the people in the 25th District just ask several things. They just ask that we believe in the Constitution. They just ask that we have a conscience. They just ask that we listen to them. And they also just ask that we read the Bible. I am proud to represent the people in the 25th District. In God we trust. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the great State of Texas. I appreciate his friendship, his mentorship, and that acid test that he taught me when I first stepped foot on the floor of the House of Representatives—your conscience, your constituents, the Bible, the Constitution. If you vote that way, you are going to do right by your children and grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I thank ROGER WILLIAMS , a great American. Mr. Speaker, I have another colleague here. He came here because he feels so passionate about rural America. I am so grateful that he is here. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the great State of Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ARRINGTON for his dedication to rural America. That is the heartland. I thank him for knowing that and representing his district so well. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for those remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
HEALTHCARE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I want to follow along on my Republican colleagues, as they were talking about rural America. As a son of rural America, I agree with much of what they said about the role of the Federal Government in providing support in so many different ways to rural America. Many of the programs that they were talking about are really found in the effort of the U.S. Government to rebuild rural America following or during the days of the Great Depression. Mr. Speaker, I want to put up here on my easel one of the key documents. This is actually etched in the marble at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial here in Washington, D.C. I think it is instructive as we talk about rural America and what is going on in rural America today, and really across all of America. During the height of the Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said these words: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ During those days of the Depression, rural America was hurting, it was devastated, and many of the programs that we just heard about from our Republican colleagues were put in place at that time. In 2010, the Congress of the United States, together with President Obama, put in place another program that significantly helped rural America. Today—in fact, just a couple of hours ago—the United States Senate moved to remove from rural America the pillar of healthcare that has provided millions of those 46 million Americans in rural America with healthcare. b1830 Through the expansion of the Medicaid program, the MediCal program in California, many of my constituents in rural America were able to get healthcare for the first time, and they were also able to get insurance because of the cost share reduction program where their insurance premiums on the exchanges were reduced to a level that they could afford. A significant program for rural America is now in jeopardy as a result of the Congress of the United States passing legislation a couple of months ago that would repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with whole cloth, ripping apart the Medicaid Expansion program so that across this Nation some 16 million Americans would lose their Medicaid coverage immediately, and more beyond that. So in the initial year, 2018, 10 million Americans, many of them in rural America, would lose their health coverage. Across this Nation in the out years, by 2025, 24 million Americans would lose their health coverage as a result of the actions of the Republicans here in Congress. Today, just a couple of hours ago, the Senate decided to move forward to make it even worse, to repeal and maybe not even replace, so that 32 million people would lose their coverage if that were to happen. Eighteen million in 2018 and 2019 would lose their health coverage under the program that was proposed by the U.S. Senate last week. Unbelievable that, here on the floor, we heard a discussion about rural America and the needs of rural America. I am here to tell you, as the son of rural America, I grew up on a ranch 2 miles from a community that had 500 people in it, that had a threeroom schoolhouse and just five of us in the eighth grade class. I have raised my children in a community twice as large, a thousand people in rural America, and I know that the people in my community today depend upon the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, for the healthcare coverage that they now have. In California, over 5 million Californians gained coverage. The uninsured rate dropped by 50 percent, from 18 to just over 9 percent. Why? Why on Earth would we neglect this, these statements, this moral imperative set down by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is not what we are going to do for the wealthy. And keep this in mind, that the legislation that passed this House and repeated over in the Senate would be the largest transfer of wealth of any legislation ever—ever—by the Congress of the United States, transferring more than a trillion dollars from the men and women who have been able to gain coverage in their healthcare. This is real money taken out of their pockets as these programs disappear because of the repeal and the replacement: a trillion dollars taken from the working men and women and the poor in America and transferred to the wealthy. That is what the legislation did that passed this House; that is what is being considered in the Senate at this moment: a monumental transfer of wealth, the largest transfer of wealth in any single piece of legislation. How can it be, if this is the test, not what we are doing for the wealthy, not for those who have much, but, rather, for those in rural America and urban America who have so little? America ought to be upset. America ought to be outraged at what is happening today. We need to build America. We need a better America. We need better jobs. We need better wages. We need better healthcare, better education. That is what we need, but where is this Congress going? It is going in exactly the opposite direction. It is taking money out of the pockets of Americans, rural and urban and everybody in between, transferring a trillion dollars from their pockets to the superwealthy. Who are they? Five members, including the President, in the Cabinet of the United States are among the superwealthy, the 400 wealthiest families in America. They are there in the Cabinet, in the President’s office. What do they stand to gain? A $4 million, $5 million, $6 million, $7 million reduction in their taxes. What do the working men and women of America stand to gain? Their healthcare is going to be taken away from them, not just in the reduction of the cost sharing, but also in the fact that, as we know it today, the insurance market itself will be so destabilized, so destabilized by the proposed action of the Senate and the House, that it will really enter a death spiral, because the proposed laws allow the healthy to opt out, and those who need insurance would continue to try to get their insurance in an everincreasing market of people who have high health expenses. That is called a death spiral. I know this. I was the insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and we fought all those 8 years, from 1991 until I left that office in 2006, we fought to try to put in place laws that are now in place as a result of ObamaCare. The insurance companies cannot discriminate on the basis of preexisting conditions. The fact that you are a woman, the fact that you are older, they cannot discriminate. But the bill that is now being debated in the Senate and will be back here in the House allows for a return to those days of discrimination. So if you happen to need healthcare, if you happen to have a preexisting condition, if you happen to have high blood pressure, diabetes, or you happen to be 60 years or 50 years of age, you will be hit with a heavy increase in your premiums, perhaps two to threefold increases. That is what they are promising Americans. We can’t let it happen. And interestingly enough, America is pushing back. They say: No more. No more. What we want is better healthcare. We don’t want to lose our healthcare policy. What we want is better education. We want you in Congress to work on the education systems, on the skills that my children need, your children need to be able to get a decent job. Americans want higher wages. They don’t want their healthcare ripped away as is happening here. They want us to focus on infrastructure. They want us to focus on the wellpaying jobs that occur from infrastructure. Better jobs, better wages, better healthcare, better education—that is where we are going. And by God, we are going to protect the Affordable Care Act and we are going to stand with Americans. We are going to stand with Americans all across this Nation that say: No, we are not going to let it happen. Mr. Trump, I know that you promised a repeal, but you are wrong, Mr. President, you are wrong. Mr. Speaker, I pass that message on to the President. You should not take away from working men and women 
who, for the first time, are able to get their healthcare and are able to afford the private sector market or are able to get on the Medicaid programs. You should not take it away so that you can give, to the superwealthy, a trillion dollars. It is outrageous. I need to take a deep breath. I am a bit riled up. I am a bit riled up when I hear my colleagues come in and talk about rural America, where I know, from my experience in my district, there is an opioid epidemic and methamphetamines, and I know that those people are dependent upon the Medicaid program that they intend to rip away. Okay. Calm down, JOHN. Don’t get too excited. Don’t get too mad. Take a deep breath and turn it over to my colleague from the East Coast. Congressman TONKO , you and I have been on this floor many times talking about making it in America, about jobs, about making it better for education. Give me a chance to take a deep breath. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. Certainly I understand the anger, Representative GARAMENDI , and I know I am not alone. I know all of my colleagues are hearing the outbursts in our given districts about the foolishness and the hardheartedness of taking away a very valuable asset. Healthcare coverage is so important now to the American public, but in a particular way, it is near and dear to those who most recently realized that coverage. I will tell you, being on this floor when the Affordable Care Act was passed, that was a monumental effort. It was difficult to launch that program. It took a lot of hard work, years of messaging, going to hearings, working those amendments that were suggested into the discussion, and making certain that the package met the mission that we embarked upon. So it is important now to make certain that we only go forward and upward from this moment. Like many programs before the Affordable Care Act—Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid—they were difficult to launch; but unlike those programs, Congress and the Presidents in those given eras came forward and said: Okay. What did we learn from that launch? How can we improve upon the package? How can we strengthen some of the dynamics of concern? Here we have people, as you indicated, that are not only unwilling to make those reforms possible, but disguising what they call healthcare reform in the name of a tax package for the wealthy. How vulgar is that, when you can sweep the dollars, the savings from denying people healthcare coverage, and utilize it to relieve taxes for those most comfortable in our society? For those 400 households of which you spoke, the onaverage relief was on the order of $7 million. Imagine that: taking away healthcare from people who live paycheck to paycheck in some cases, and using that to provide for tax relief for those most comfortable. That is not in keeping with the spirit of this legislation. It is not in keeping with the harmony that was necessary to create this legislation. The spirit was to speak to the fundamental needs of healthcare for individuals and families across this country to be able to get past difficult moments and situations like preexisting conditions, preexisting conditions that can be with an individual toddler from the moment of birth, as we have heard in the news. This hardhearted approach, this senseless attitude, this insensitive expression to Americans across this country by these reform efforts, today we know that the United States Senate went forth with a vote to proceed on their efforts. What will it be? Straightforward repeal, as the President recommends, where 30plus million people lose their healthcare coverage, you rip it away from those tens of millions? Or will it be repeal and delay? Or will it be repeal and replace? So far with the iterations, the versions of healthcare reform that have come forth from this House, that were approved in this House and sent over to the Senate, those devised by the Senate have been heartless. This is about expressing compassion, about being just and fair. Just this weekend I was with groups of constituents. The first that comes to mind is a fundraising effort for individuals who live with cystic fibrosis. Before I was even to walk into the room, where hundreds of people gathered to support the efforts for this cause, individual sets of parents came to me and said: Keep up the fight to keep Medicaid in the equation. b1845 Our daughter, our son, can’t do it without Medicaid. And these people were proud of their given children, adult children, in some cases, who had graduated with honors, played athletics and were athletes, star athletes in their high school years who, then, earned full scholarships to college. And his daughter made him most proud; he cited that moment of pride when he witnessed her on her campus wheeling her IV to class. That is what we see out there, motivation, inspiration, respect for people who live with difficult challenges in life. And we were responding as a compassionate society, one that should separate us from the rest of the world because, within our abundance, we want to share that with everybody. And it is so wonderful, Representative GARAMENDI , that you would bring that quote from the memorial, that speaks to the abundance of those who have where we are, evidently, with some of the constructs of legislation here, adding to that abundance, at the expense of those who have precious little. And so we can do better than this. One other gathering that I attended was for developmentally disabled, differentlyabled individuals whose programs focus and strengthen their abilities, focus upon and strengthen their abilities; again, people approaching me saying: Keep up the fight for Medicaid. We cannot, our consumers cannot, do it. Our loved ones cannot do it without Medicaid. And I think the rejection of Medicaid expansion in this House that was offered by this House, by this town, by Washington, to the many States across the country, the rejection by those States, I believe, was sheer politics. And so, we denied people in States who pay Federal taxes the benefits of Medicaid expansion. What sense does that make? What heart does that show? We are better than that. We are better than that. Finally, I will say this, because I know we have colleagues who are looking to share their thoughts and their stories. I looked at some constituents this weekend, in the eyes, and in heartfelt conversation said: Do you think it is fair, do you think it is just to rip away healthcare from people so you can afford a tax cut for the very wealthy? Is it fair to deny preexisting condition coverage for individuals? Is it unfair to take it away? What about the essential health benefits package, those of our neighbors and friends who struggle, who live with mental illness and mental health disorders, those who are dealing with the illness of addiction? Is it fair not to help them? I looked at them, and I said: Okay, I know who you voted for. This is a nation where we have the freedom of choice. But when we vote for whomever, it is also our duty, our responsibility to see if they are acting accordingly. Do you think your candidate of choice is being fair and just? They couldn’t answer me about that situation. They wanted to redirect the conversation. Why? Because I think it is difficult to say that people, leaders in this town, the President and leaders in the House and the leaders in the Senate, are not listening to America; and so it is unfair to utilize the sweeping of services, of healthcare and response to tens of millions of individuals and families, and utilize those dollars for a tax cut for the wealthy. We are going to watch this aggressively, with laser sharp focus. The people of America have spoken. They are continuing to speak. They don’t like the injustices. They don’t like the unfairness. They don’t like the calculated ripping away of healthcare insurance for tens of millions of people. Whether it is 30, 23, 22, 21, whatever the iteration, shame on us for allowing something like that to happen. America deserves to be—as an industrialized nation that did not have access, affordability, and quality of care as givens for many households in this country, they need to express those terms in a much better format. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative GARAMENDI for leading us in a discussion this hour to alert people to the fact that the Democrats in this House are still battling for those families that would have healthcare coverage ripped from them so that we can afford a tax cut for the wealthy. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York. The view from the great State of New York and the State of California, somewhere in between those two States lies the State of New Mexico. I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM ) to share with us the view from the great State of New Mexico. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. GARAMENDI , and certainly thank Mr. TONKO for their incredible statements about what is really at risk and why it is at risk. I think it is very important for viewers, and our constituents, and families, to really understand that this is not a healthcare debate. This is not a healthcare reform measure. Nothing that has occurred and passed in the House or in the Senate has involved serious discussion or debate of any kind of healthcare reform because what this really is, as you stated, is a tax break, not just for the wealthiest of Americans, but for two critical corporations, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies, who, I assure you, do not need additional tax breaks, who are still making record profits. And when we look at the pharmaceutical industry, in particular, it has been one of the most profitable industries in America’s history. So this is an effort to provide more benefits to the three groups who do not need these benefits; and the way in which they pay for it is to remove healthcare benefits from millions of Americans. And as the gentleman pointed out, 32 million Americans are at risk of losing their healthcare, and many more who are in jeopardy of having to pay far more for the benefits that are necessary and lifesaving. I really wanted to weigh in because States like mine, rural, frontier, very poor States, in fact, we have the most to lose of any State in the Nation if this draconian measure, which is one step closer, is passed in the Senate after today’s procedural vote. It means $11.4 billion out of our economy. It is a devastating blow to one of the poorest States in the Nation, who has one of the highest percentages of individuals in Medicaid to the expansion. For the first time in my lifetime, I am seeing New Mexicans in a position to have access to care, the right care at the right time at the right place. If this country is going to get healthcare right, then we have got to make sure that people have access so we are not the sickest population in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The only way that you do that is providing access. We provide access in the Affordable Care Act by giving people subsidies and asking insurance companies to treat their beneficiaries and enrollees fairly, right? Subsidies to afford those premiums, by making sure that they have to cover preexisting conditions, by making sure that they are not making women and other populations pay more for their care. This is a Congress that has an obligation to address the things that both Republicans in Congress and pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies have done to us, not for us. Premiums are still too often too high; copays still too often too high; and deductibles, still too high. But is that the fault of the Democrats or an administration that worked to make sure that insurance companies got payments to deal with the rising costs of folks with serious catastrophic illnesses and chronic disease? No, it is Republicans who refuse to continue to fund those risk corridors and those costsharing mechanisms. Did we do anything in this Congress to require pharmaceutical companies who sell the very same drugs for 10 cents on a dollar to nations around the world, to make sure that you got a fair drug price, after your tax dollars helped those same pharmaceutical companies do the research required? And then we give them patent protections to make the most possible money, including now protections on generic brand drugs? No, we did nothing to hold that industry accountable, which would mean lower costs for consumers. But what I know happens for sure with this bill is, not only do they rip the rug out from under any of those protections by hardworking New Mexicans and hardworking Americans who deserve the protection and the knowledge that their healthcare will be there for them tomorrow, we also close every rural community health center, every rural hospital at risk in the country, which is why no hospitals, no doctors, no insurance companies, no pharmaceutical companies—because who are they going to sell these proceeds to— are supporting this bill. And the Senate is ignoring every Republican Governor whose State took up Medicaid, who is saying this is a disaster. They want something else. Yet this is the path we are under because it would be more important to give tax breaks than to do this—to protect Mr. Templeton in my State, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in December 2016. He began treatments in January 2017. He explained in an email that, without the ACA, he is not able to afford any of his treatments. He said: ‘‘Am I being sentenced to death by Congress? How many more U.S. citizens are out there like me?’’ The answer to Mr. Templeton’s question is there are at least 32 million. As I close with what I think is an outrageous effort by Republicans in the House and the Senate, and by that procedural vote in the Senate, is at the same time they are looking at ripping healthcare away from millions of Americans, they are willing to put $1.6 billion into a wall that they promised that Americans would not pay for. Here is an idea. You have got $1.6 billion to invest; invest that to protect folks with their costs under the ACA. Give more subsidies. Let’s deal with Medicaid fairly. Let’s make sure that we drop prescription drug costs. Let’s lower copays. Let’s invest in rural community health centers more. Let’s have a targeted effort to deal, as you said, with opioid and substance abuse problems that were created by pharmaceutical companies. Let’s do that. If you really care, this is money that would hire more nurses. This is money that would hire thousands more teachers. This is money that would put thousands of New Mexicans and Americans back to work in better, safer, more productive infrastructure for our futures— our very future, Mr. GARAMENDI , Mr. Speaker, at stake by the wrong path and the draconian efforts today in the Senate. I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to highlight how terrible these efforts are and how important it is for us to encourage our supporters to fight for fairness and justice in this country. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, America has been enlightened by the gentlewoman’s very forthright statement. The voice of New Mexico has been heard here on the House floor, Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM . I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that message from New Mexico and what it means with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Thank you so very much for doing that, a very powerful statement, a very powerful voice on behalf of New Mexicans and Americans. Somewhere between New Mexico and New York lies the State of Ohio, and, Ms. KAPTUR , you have represented that State so very well for a few years here. We won’t say exactly how many years. But over those years, you have always been the voice for the working men and women of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ). Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman GARAMENDI and Congressman TONKO for their comments. It is a pleasure to be with them tonight, and also Congresswoman MICHELLE LUJAN  GRISHAM . She really has been such a leader, not just for New Mexico, but for the whole issue of health across our country. I am really pleased to join all of them. And I will just say, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, the American people should know, this past week we tried very hard to pass an amendment that would simply ask the executive branch to report back to us on how much money we were spending as a country in Medicare, Medicaid, at the VA, the Department of Defense, for certain classes of drugs in our country. 
Now, don’t you think it would be right for us to know, since we are spending tax dollars, that if we are spending more money on, let’s say, a diabetic medicine than a heart medicine, whatever medicine it is, it would be good for us to do cost accounting to go back and look at what we are paying? Do you know we were not able to get that simple reportingback amendment on how much pharmaceuticals are costing the people of the United States, because the Republican members of our committee blocked it. b1900 Ms. KAPTUR. They voted ‘‘no.’’ They don’t want to know how much the American people are spending through their tax dollars at the Federal level because the goal is to figure out how this money was being spent and to hold those companies responsible to look at what costs were over time and so forth. It is amazing and it is really wrong what the pharmaceutical industry is doing to the people of this country. They are killing people. People cannot afford the medicine that they need. Yesterday, and I give this as homework, in The New York Times, there was a great story titled, ‘‘When Health Law Isn’t Enough, the Desperate Line Up at Tents.’’ It was written by what must be a brilliant young reporter named Trip Gabriel, and it reported about a charity group in our country called the Remote Area Medical Expedition. They were in Wise, Virginia, somewhere south of here. What it is is a group of charitable citizens who are in optometry. They are doctors. They are dentists. They donate their time over a weekend, and they go to places in our country that don’t have medical care. So no American should assume that everybody has care and that everybody has insurance, even with the current system. I will tell you, if you want your eyes opened, read that story. Over one weekend, over 2,000 people came. There were people there who were diabetic who had no medication. One woman, they reported in the story, came with a dispenser for insulin, but the needle was broken. Her glucose reading was over 500. They talked about people who were there for glasses. They couldn’t afford glasses. One woman was diagnosed with vision of 20/100 in one eye, and they were looking for glasses that would fit her. They had a gentleman who was coughing, and he thought he had black lung disease. It turned out what he really had was sleep apnea. Finally somebody diagnosed what his problem was. They start out with the story about a gentleman who showed up at that event, and he took them to the trunk of his car and showed them the pliers he was using to rip out his teeth because he had so many decayed teeth and he hadn’t been to the dentist in years. They had dentists. They had all kinds of physicians. They had nurses trying to help people. I read that article and I thought: This is America? This is America? Here are just the first few sentences, if I might. It says: ‘‘Anthony Marino, 54, reached into his car trunk to show a pair of needlenosed pliers like the ones he used to yank out a rotting tooth. ‘‘Shirley Akers, 58, clutched a list of 20 medications she takes, before settling down to a sleepless night in the cab of a pickup truck. ‘‘Robin Neal, 40, tried to inject herself with a usedup insulin pen, but it broke, and her blood sugar began to skyrocket. ‘‘As the sun set in the mountains of southwest Virginia, hundreds of hurting souls were camped out or huddled in vehicles, eager for an early place in line when the gates swung open at 5 a.m. for the Nation’s largest popup free clinic.’’ That free clinic is called the Remote Area Medical Expedition. I just read that. There were several photos in the paper. This is America. So, for the Senate, particularly the leader of Senate who comes from Kentucky, a State that is noted to have very poor medical care, where there are large rural areas where many people, including those who are single who get none of this coverage—right? The single are especially discriminated against—how that could be pushed forward by someone from the State of Kentucky, I simply don’t understand it. And here in this House, where we tried so hard to save the Affordable Care Act and to make necessary changes to it, a lot of those changes are needed in these rural States that don’t have enough people to really set up a large enough exchange. We need to lump two or three States together so you get a pool that is insurable. We know how to fix this. But we don’t need to take more people off health insurance, millions and millions and millions, because we have millions who still are uninsured, and we have industries like the pharmaceutical industry fighting us against trying to get affordable medications to our constituents. I want to thank you for being here tonight and for fighting the good fight for the American people. Really, to have almost a trillion dollars of money given away over the next 10, 15 years to the wealthiest people in our country? You know what? They have doctors. They can afford insurance. Frankly, they don’t need more money. They might benefit by a little less money, actually. Their heirs certainly would. We need a little rigor out there, even among the wealthy in our country, to help us to heal this Nation and to deal with its real medical problems. I will just say this. We were checking today on the diabetic costs across our country. One facility in Ohio, just one veterans facility, over 30,000 veterans in that facility have been diagnosed with diabetes. Many, many of those veterans go for the treatment of dialysis in order to help them to deal with their condition. For 1 year, that treatment costs $100,000. Over a 10year period, it costs $1 million per person who goes through dialysis. Imagine if we were able to prescribe food as medicine, which hospitals are doing in many places, and help people learn how to not become so severely diabetic. We would save so much money across this country, including with our veterans. And more important than money, we would save their lives. We would save the amputations. We would save all of the costs that diabetes incurs over the years. So people would learn how to be healthier. I want to thank you for being here. I am proud of you two gentlemen, Congressman GARAMENDI and Congressman TONKO . You are honorable gentlemen. You have come here from both ends of the country, New York and California. We are here tonight because we know what the American people want. They want affordable healthcare. They want affordable medicine. They are willing to do their part, and nobody should be left out. We can find that answer as the United States of America. We don’t have to accept this set of death panels that they are figuring out over there in the Senate: who is going to die, who is not going to have health insurance, who is going to be shortchanged. Because when that wheel of fortune turns, you never know who in your family is going to get sick. You simply don’t know, and no one should be without coverage. I thank you for being here on the floor tonight and for doing what the American people expect us to do, and that is to defend and protect them. Mr. GARAMENDI. Ms. KAPTUR , thank you for your comments. For years you have been the strong voice of working men and women in the State of Ohio. Thank you for bringing us the message from midAmerica. Also, in your wrapup, you began to talk about the issue of prevention. One of things that the Affordable Care Act does so very well—ObamaCare, if you will—is prevention, particularly for seniors. There is a free annual healthcare checkup for seniors as a result of the Affordable Care Act. When seniors get that healthcare checkup, they also are able to understand that they have high blood pressure, incipient diabetes or other illnesses that ultimately, as Ms. KAPTUR  so correctly pointed out, become extraordinarily expensive if they are not treated. One other fact is that the Medicaid program in America, more than 50 percent of the total expenses in the Medicaid program are for men and women who are in the nursing homes. We are not just talking about families and 
children. We are talking about the elderly that are being cared for in nursing homes. Now, the result of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the reduction of the Medicaid expenditure is that those men and women who are in the nursing homes will no longer have the support to keep them in a nursing home. So what comes of those men and women? What happens to them if they are no longer able to have care in a nursing home? Just let that question hang there because it is a question that our Republican colleagues and the Senate must answer, because the repeal and replace legislation or repeal legislation and wait legislation goes right to the heart of the Medicaid program and the support that enables those seniors in nursing homes to receive that service. In addition to that, what comes of the Medicare program? We know that the Medicare program solvency was significantly increased to about 15 years. It is not going to go bankrupt in the near term as was predicted before the Affordable Care Act but, rather, extended into the outyears. So the solvency of the Medicare program would be reduced, and the free medical checkups, we are not sure whether they would be able to continue or not. So it is not just men and women who are not yet 65 years of age, but it is men and women who are 65 that would see significant pressure on the services that they now receive, and quite probably reductions in the services that they would receive both in the Medicare as well as in the Medicaid program. Mr. TONKO , why don’t we chat for a few moments back and forth here. You in New York, you are faced with the same problems that my constituents in California would be faced with, and that is a repeal seriously hurts people, I mean, physically hurts them. They will not be able to get the medical services that they currently have. I yield to the gentleman from New York. Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and, Representative GARAMENDI , I am so honored to associate my comments with those of yours, to connect with you in this effort to make certain that we stop this foolishness coming from this House and the United States Senate that totally rejects the pleas of Americans across this country to make certain that the dynamics that drove the Affordable Care Act still stay in place, and that being affordability, accessibility, and quality of care. Those are such essential forces. They are the underpinning of the foundation of the Affordable Care Act. When I heard your expression of concern here tonight and pinpointing those various elements of the positive reinforcement that comes from the Affordable Care Act legislation, hearing the voice of two Congresswomen here from New Mexico and Ohio on the floor joining us, it reminds me that our force is the essential force on the Hill in Washington to make certain that the people’s voices are heard. There is anger out there, there is injustice, there is unfairness, and it has to be addressed. I am proud of the efforts that have been made in my State. I know that you talked about the progress in California. In New York, I am proud of what the Governor, Governor Cuomo, and the legislature did in building those exchanges. It took response from each of the 50 States to make this work, or at least we had hoped each State would respond fully. But in New York, we are managing that effort through sound exchanges. I get worried when I see tweets from the President when things didn’t work for awhile in the Senate, when they couldn’t move forward with the repeal or repeal and delay or repeal and replace: Well, we will just let the Affordable Care Act die of its own right. What are you talking about? That sounds to me like a poor attitude, one that wouldn’t do the very best to underpin, through the agencies that are connected to this legislation, to reinforce the markets out there. That is part of this response. When I hear an attitude like that expressed, I am concerned about what the voice over to these agencies will be saying: Look, we need to be a good partner, a sound partner, an effective partner with the Affordable Care Act. I don’t know if we would get that. So that worries me if your attitude is let it just die and crumble. Why? Why can’t you put the American public before politics? Let’s do our best effort. Let’s, in earnest, do our best. Let’s be genuine in our approach. I think it is absolutely incredible. You know, as the Republicans, Representative GARAMENDI , in the Senate race to pass TrumpCare, a bill that would rip coverage away from tens of millions of people, perhaps as many as 30 million—if you would allow me to share a few stories from my district, I think it is so important to put a face onto these discussions. I have documented some of the recent stories we have heard from constituents. Cathryn, a 30yearold in my district, left work to return to school to pursue graduate studies in social work, and she used the ACA exchange, their plans, to bridge gaps in employerbased coverage. b1915 The ACA plans provided her with essential preventative healthcare services and ensured that a major health event would not leave her bankrupt as she was doing what we asked people to do: develop your talent and your skills to serve the general public. So she was pursuing graduate studies. The security and affordability of Catherine’s ACA plan was tremendously reassuring, allowing her to take risks in order to build a career in service to others. That is what the ACA afforded Catherine to do, a 30yearold in my district. Robert, a 52yearold in my district, purchased insurance on a healthcare exchange while suffering from diabetes. Before buying an exchange plan, Robert spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars each month just to purchase insulin, and no other health coverage. Because of the ban on discrimination that could be utilized against him based on his preexisting conditions, Robert can now afford a health plan that covers himself and his family. A couple of other examples, if you will allow me. Tracey, a 38yearold from my district, a certified nursing assistant, needs multiple drug prescriptions to treat preexisting conditions, including diabetes. The Affordable Care Act has made it possible for Tracey to get health coverage for herself and her family. Without the ACA, Tracey would not be able to pay her doctors or her drug companies. As recently as January, Tracey was still paying off old bills for her medical care. This has provided hope for people. We need to make certain we don’t have people digging deeper into their pockets for healthcare coverage. We want to relieve that pressure that is upon them. We want to make prescription drugs affordable. We want to make certain that efficiencies are there in the system so we can save, but get the care to people. That is the difference that we need to cite here. The contrast is that we are trying to make this ACA better and make it work, and we are asking for a bipartisan, bicameral, executive legislative partnership to make it better. Is that too much to ask? Let me share one more story. Elliot, a 56yearold in the 20th Congressional District of New York lost his job in September last year after his company made a massive layoff, even though he just started his job. So through no fault of his own, he lost his employment. Elliot was then left to figure out how to support himself and his 19yearold son who was a Syracuse University student. A COBRA plan would have cost $2,000 a month. Because of Medicaid, Elliot and his son now have quality health coverage as Elliot continues to look for work and his son is pursuing his college education. These are real stories, real hardships, real challenges, real help, real assistance that has come in the way of these families. We don’t need to take that good news and suffocate it. We need to build upon these stories. Now, Senate Republicans are racing to pass a bill that would open the doors to less coverage, rip it away from tens of millions of people, and in many ways perhaps provide for an imposition of lifetime limits on care. What does that do? 
It is a death sentence for far too many people. It would impact severely upon those who are struggling with cancer—working their hardest to defeat that, working with their doctor, their medical community to defeat that impact of cancer in their lives— heart disease, and other longterm illnesses. My friends, this is about being a compassionate voice. It is about utilizing the advancements in medical care, technology, making affordable our healthcare system, making affordable prescription drug costs. There is improvements that we want to make, not give a tax cut for the rich, which has been a terrible response. People would say: Oh, the Affordable Care Act is not working. So if there were improvements required, be fair, be only honest with the public you represent, be there for them. Finally, the last point I will make right here is Medicaid and the changing profile of Medicaid in many of our States. In New York, people need to see where the growth in Medicaid is. And because we have a disproportionate senior population in upstate New York, you are seeing the growth of Medicaid the farther north you go. I ask my colleagues to be sensitive to their constituent base. Don’t be heartless. Don’t be cruel in the outcome. Walk away from this. The silence is deafening at times when it comes to some of the proposals being sent by leadership in this House and in the Senate. Silence is not what is called for here. Outspoken rejection of some of these harsh measures is what we need, and bipartisan cooperation, bicameral activity is what will serve the public best. So I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for bringing us together in what is a very important discussion here in this Special Order. Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank Mr. TONKO  so very much for his comments. He covered the issues very well. I want to go to two issues really quickly that need to, I think, be wrapped up here. First of all, the President talks about the Affordable Care Act dying, and it is not going to make it. That could happen because of actions that he is specifically telling the administration to take. There are three different areas, one of which is being very late in providing the costsharing funding programs for those people who are purchasing insurance. It is discretionary right now. We ought to make that mandatory and not given the President the option of not providing those funds. If those funds are not provided, then, yes, the exchanges will collapse. Secondly, we know that there is the cross subsidization from one insurance company to another called reinsurance that tries to balance out the risk pool of each individual insurance company. Some insurance companies, for many different reasons, wind up with a very high risk, high cost population. Others are able to have a very low risk. The risk needs to be balanced out between those two. If that is not done, then there will be a death spiral amongst the insurance companies. Thirdly, under the Affordable Care Act, people are mandated to buy insurance or else pay a penalty. That penalty is enforced by the Internal Revenue Service, which has been specifically given instructions by the President not to enforce the law. That will lead to those young and healthy invincibles not buying insurance because there is no penalty. That will cause the insurance pool to become more risky and, again, start that death spiral that is so much talked about. The death spiral can be avoided, and the Affordable Care Act is drafted and written in such a way as to avoid it. So my plea to the President is: Use the law. Do not cause the Affordable Care Act to collapse. Mr. Speaker, please pass on to the President that the President has within his power to maintain the Affordable Care Act. He also has within his power to cause the Affordable Care Act to collapse. Now, the final point—and help me with this, Mr. TONKO —is that the Democrats have known for 5 years that there are improvements that need to take place within the Affordable Care Act, and we have pleaded with our Republican colleagues to allow those improvements to take place. We have had a deaf ear from our Republican colleagues. So as we go into this possible crisis, let it be known that the Democrats are seeking improvements in a variety of areas. We heard about the drug prices. I know, Mr. TONKO , you were talking in your earlier presentation about some of the improvements that can be made. So jump in here. Interrupt me, if you will. Mr. TONKO. To repeat what my colleague just said, I will say that we want to work with the American public. We have said over and over again that it is about affordability, accessibility, quality of care. Share with us the improvements that you think will work. Let us know of the hurdles in the road that you have faced. Remind us that Medicaid serves the needs of our parents and grandparents in nursing homes. Remind us that those who are born with challenges in life are served well by healthcare coverage and Medicaid. Remind us that those living with developmental disabilities, showcasing their abilities requires Medicaid to make it work; chronic illnesses requiring an insurance clause that addresses preexisting conditions, building upon an essential health benefits package. We are with you. We walk with you. We raise our voices with you. We lift our hearts with you. We want to be victorious with you and for you. Let’s not let them rip away this health insurance for the opportunity to provide tax cuts for the very wealthy. Again, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak forcefully in this given Special Order. It is so important to save the Affordable Care Act, make it stronger, and respond to the needs of people across this country who are speaking out. Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank Mr. TONKO  so very much, once again, from the East Coast and the West Coast, I hope, to a message that America has listened to. I just looked out here in the audience and I noticed that our colleague from Texas is here to speak. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. GARAMENDI for yielding. I was detained at another meeting, but I could not help but conclude our very important Special Order. And I do want to emphasize that we have a better deal. We have the opportunity to be able to stabilize the markets. We heard from Mr. COHEN today, who is from the great State of California, who says: The Affordable Care Act does work. Subsidies do work. And if we go the route of the Senate—the tragic vote today—Americans will wind up paying more for premiums than their own income. So I join in saying we can fix and stabilize—fix the Affordable Care Act, stabilize the healthcare system, and ensure that 49 million people do not lose their insurance by 2026; or with the Senate bill, 32 million don’t lose their insurance. So I simply conclude with this: I met with a family who has an autistic child—a young woman who wants to live on her own. She can’t do that without the Affordable Care Act. I met with a young man by the name of Matthew, who spent $700,000 over a 2 year period because he has a chronic illness; $73,000 on his medication in the last 6 months. The American people need us to do for them what the government can do, and that is to ensure a healthcare system for all. That is what the Affordable Care Act’s underlying premise is. That is what Democrats have as their message. Mr. GARAMENDI , I believe in saving lives. That is what I want to do with the Affordable Care Act. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. JACKSON LEEvery much for her comments. Indeed, we do look for a better deal, better jobs, better wages, better education. That is our goal, and we can do that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
TRIBUTE TO FORMER CONGRESSMAN RALPH REGULA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a good friend who passed away last week: the former Congressman from Ohio, Ralph Regula. Ralph Regula served in this body for 36 years, from 1973 to 2009. He ran in 1972 to replace former Congressman Frank Bow. He got on the Appropriations Committee in 1975, and I remember him telling the story of how that happened. When Gerald Ford was in the leadership here in the House, he praised former President Gerald Ford for getting him on the Appropriations Committee, in which he became a cardinal, in all the many years he was on the Appropriations Committee. Some major things that he helped do in his time here in Congress were: he found funding for the Cuyahoga Valley National Park; he formed the Ohio and Erie Canal National Heritage Corridor; and he worked with his wife to create the National First Ladies’ Library in Canton. Having had many conversations with him over the years, I know all the work he did to support the National Institutes of Health, medical research, and also National Parks around the country that he so treasured. Last week, when Congressman Regula passed away, he left his wife, Mary, and three grown children: Martha, Richard, and David. Congressman Regula was born December 3, 1924, in Beach City, Ohio. From 1944 to 1946, he served in the United States Navy. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Mount Union in 1948, where The Ralph and Mary Regula Center of Public Service and Civic Engagement is housed. He earned his law degree in 1952, and went to law school at night while working as a teacher. b1930 He also served on the Ohio State Board of Education from 1960 to 1964. He served in the Ohio senate. He was elected in 1966, and he served in the Ohio house one term when he was elected in 1964. During his time in the State house, he created the Northeast Ohio Medical University complex and Stark State College, which is paying many dividends to the residents of northeast Ohio. Ralph was a good friend, and he always made sure that the staff knew that constituents came first. He even had a lapel pin button made up to remind his staff. He truly did. So my little memento that I remember was when I came here in the early 1980s, representing as a farmer in the Ohio Farm Bureau, we had an appointment at that time, and Ralph was my Congressman. Ralph was a farmer, too, and loved his beef cattle. He was an early riser. We had an early meeting well before 8 a.m. Another county Farm Bureau president from Wayne County and I got there in his office, Steve Grimes, and Ralph Regula said to us: Did you guys eat breakfast yet? We said: No. He said: Come with me. I guess he took us down to the Members’ dining room. I remember this because I brought this picture. How I got this picture was one of the agricultural media reporters tagged along and took this picture. It was in one of the local agricultural papers back in Ohio. My parents were so proud of the fact that our Congressman—my Congressman— would meet with us and take us to breakfast in the Capitol that they called the paper and got the print, and they framed it. A few years ago, I had the privilege to speak at the McKinley Day Dinner in Stark County when I was redistricted in that area. Ralph and Mary were there. I brought this picture and passed it around to show them. Of course, this picture is 33 years old. What is really neat about it is we both had brown hair. I remember Ralph and Mary got a big kick out of that. Another time that I remember that was really a treasure is he had Senator THAD COCHRAN come to his house one weekend, and he invited all the agricultural leaders from the district to have breakfast there one Saturday morning. I remember that quite well as a great experience. A lot people said that Ralph Regula cared. He really did care. He really cared about the constituents he represented. He was a true public servant. Another issue is he had a relationship at the time with President Reagan. They hit it off really good because they got talking about their farms. Of course, Ralph Regula had a beef cattle farm outside of Navarre, Ohio, in Stark County. They were talking about how to build fence. Ralph used to tell that story, and you can tell that he held that dear to him. I first met Congressman Regula in 1974. He was the commencement speaker at the first graduating class which I was in at the Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute in Wooster, and Ralph was a fairly new Congressman at the time. But he came and spoke. I remember that. That was my first chance to get to know Congressman Regula at the time. I do have here some notes from his former staff. I just want to read them because I think words say a lot. Ralph left an impression not just on his constituents but also on his staff. Susan Ross, who worked for Congressman Regula, offered some insight and stories about Ralph. Ralph’s motto was ‘‘Constituents First,’’ according to Susan. One day, Ralph got a frantic call from a woman whose daughter was gravely ill in Mexico. She needed help immediately, as she didn’t have a passport and couldn’t find her birth certificate. By the next day, she was on her way to Mexico to help her daughter return to the U.S. Ralph made sure that his constituent could get a copy of her birth certificate and called the State Department to get her a passport within just a few hours. Considering the bureaucracy of government, this is a minor miracle. That is how committed he was to the people of Ohio. Ralph would go out of his way to help people. Ralph had a red pickup truck, and after the September 11 attack in 2001, he drove it home with the luggage of several constituents who were stranded here because of the attacks and no way to rent a car and obviously the planes were not flying. A former schoolteacher himself, he would say to the teachers: The lower the grade, the more you should be paid; and when you look out at your class, you have 30 little mirrors looking back at you. Susan wrote: We are so grateful for the chance to work alongside and learn from this giant of a man. His accomplishments are legendary, and his legacy can be seen across all of Ohio. It was an honor and privilege to call him our boss. When former staff members say those kinds of things about their former boss, that says a lot. I had the privilege to know Ralph for three decades. Two of those decades he was my Congressman, and then the last decade he wasn’t because of redistricting. I had a different Congressman and a different congressional district. Then 4 or 5 years ago now, redistricting, they moved me into the Stark County, Ohio, area, and Ralph became a constituent of mine. There were a few times here a few years ago that Ralph came in and visited me in the office, and we had some great conversations. It seemed a little strange because I can remember, in the 1980s and the 1990s, I would be visiting Ralph here in the Rayburn Building for pork producers in the Farm Bureau talking about agricultural policy and talking to another farmer who is also a Congressman, too. Those are fond memories that I will treasure for the rest of my life. I think that we are so glad that so many are standing out here tonight to pay tribute to Congressman Ralph Regula because he was a true public servant and loved his constituents, loved Stark County, Ohio, and loved his farm. So it is a privilege to make a few remarks tonight to pay tribute to him for his 36 years of service in this Chamber and this body and all the service he did throughout his life to help the people of Stark County, Ohio, the 16th Congressional District in the State of Ohio, and the United States. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TIBERI ) who is from the 
Columbia area and who served some of the time here when Congressman Regula was here. Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman GIBBS for yielding. The Akron Beacon Journal, a few days ago, wrote an extraordinary editorial about Ralph Regula. The last paragraph sums Congressman Regula up best: ‘‘What would benefit Congress and the country today are more lawmakers like Ralph Regula, devoted to their districts without losing sight of the larger picture. He wasn’t just superb at legislating. He delivered what governing requires.’’ I couldn’t say it any better. We in Ohio lost a truly wonderful person, a great American. Ohio has lost three of them in the last year who I served with here in the United States Congress who made this body a better place and who made this country a better place: nearly a year ago, Steve LaTourette from northeastern Ohio; earlier this year, Mike Oxley; and now Ralph Regula. Ralph Regula was the dean of the delegation even before I got here, and he was the dean of the delegation when I came here in 2001. One of the great things that Ralph Regula did on our side of the aisle when we were in the minority and then when we were in the majority is he strategically placed members of our team from Ohio throughout all the committees. So you had people on the Appropriations Committee, you had people on the Ways and Means Committee, on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and on the Armed Services Committee. Ralph was so thoughtful that way trying to make sure that we represented our State in all sorts of ways. I got to know Ralph mostly sitting in that corner with Dave Hobson, Ralph Regula, and Steve LaTourette. The dean of the delegation didn’t speak loudly. He often spoke softly, but his words were meaningful—and usually right. He was a thoughtful guy who cared about our State, who cared about our country, and who taught so many of us how to legislate not just on the Appropriations Committee, but actually how to get things done. I have fond memories of the lessons that he gave us on an ongoing basis. I only got to serve with Ralph for 8 years. There are others in the room who got to serve with him a lot longer. But it is safe to say what the Akron Beacon Journal said is right: He knew how to get things done. He did it in a bipartisan way, he did it with his constituents in mind, and he did it because it was the right thing to do. There is a long list of things that he accomplished and that got done. He didn’t brag about it. He just did it in his softspoken, nice, gentlemanly way. The gentleman from Navarre contributed and gave more than he ever got. His former staff knows, the former Members on both sides know it, and he will always be remembered for that great spirit that he had around this place—a true gentleman describes the gentleman from Navarre. It was an honor and a privilege to serve with him. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STIVERS). Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of an incredible leader from my home State of Ohio but also for the United States: Congressman Ralph Regula. He was a teacher, a patriot, and a veteran. He served during World War II in the United States Navy. He had been a schoolteacher and a school principal, and he devoted his life to public service. His career in government began with service in the Ohio house of representatives and the Ohio senate before he came to Congress in 1972. For nearly four decades in Congress, Congressman Regula became known as a leader who was willing to reach across the aisle to get things done—to compromise—both on Capitol Hill and with the White House. He worked to pass legislation that helped his district and the American people. His spirit of bipartisanship carried throughout his career when he remained an outspoken advocate, even in his retirement, for bipartisanship. He was truly an example of how to get things done. Through his role on the House Appropriations Committee, he served as an important advocate for Ohio, including funding for the Cleveland Clinic and support for the Great Lakes. He was the quintessential example of what it means to be a public servant. Mr. Speaker, my thoughts go out to his wife, Mary, and the rest of his family. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA ) who is from Bowling Green, Ohio. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I, too, would like to express my sympathies to Mary and all the Regula family on Ralph’s passing. I got to know Ralph a long time ago because my dad served here for 30 years. Dad was elected in 1958, Ralph was elected in 1972, and toward the end of their terms that they were here together—of course, Ralph served on for 36 years—their offices were very close to one another. I know that in those days sometimes you had a little more time than we seem to have today, but folks could actually go to one another’s office and sit down and chat. I know that Dad and Ralph were very good friends. What has been said by my other colleagues is true; Ralph worked hard. He served his district well, he worked hard, he did his job, he served the people of his district, and he served the people of this country. At all times, though, he always was a gentleman. I know that for a fact because I know that when I was younger, I always liked to be able to come here with my dad, I was able to sit in a lot of meetings, and Ralph was an incredible individual. One of the things that my dad always said was that there was always a difference in life between people who wanted to be politicians and public servants. Dad said that it was very simple: A politician is a person who sees how much they can take from the people they represent for their own benefit, while public servants see how much they can give of themselves to the people they represent. Ralph did this over and over and over again, giving of himself. Marcia and I do want to express our regret to Mary and all of Ralph’s family on his passing because, again, we have lost a great friend, a great colleague, and it is tough to say goodbye. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I am sure the gentleman shares a lot of childhood memories running around here with his dad being a Congressman and Congressman Regula for all those years. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) who is from the Cincinnati area. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. GIBBS for organizing this Special Order here this evening in which we are honoring Ralph Regula, our former colleague. I had the pleasure of serving with Congressman Regula for 14 years here in this great institution. Ralph Regula was truly a gentleman in the truest sense of the word. He served Ohio and our Nation with a dignity and grace that few will ever match. When I think of the phrase ‘‘disagreeing without being disagreeable,’’ I think of Ralph Regula. b1945 Ralph was a lot of things. He was an attorney, a teacher, a school principal, a veteran, a farmer, and a loving husband, father, and grandfather. But perhaps most of all, he was dedicated to serving the people of the 16th Congressional District and his country. He was born in Beach City, Ohio, in 1924—the same year my mom was born, by the way. Ralph first served his country, as my father did, in World War II. My dad was in the Army and served in Europe. Ralph was in the Navy from 1942 to 1946 during World War II. Ralph then graduated from Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, where he met his wife, Mary, and later obtained his law degree from William McKinley School of Law in Canton. Ralph had a passion for education. Before getting into politics, he served his community as a schoolteacher, as I also did. He was then a principal and even ran for the Ohio Board of Education. As a former teacher myself, as I mentioned, I know the time you spend with students helps shape the way you view the world. Ralph was no different. He brought those experiences with him here to Washington, D.C., and put his 
passion to work on the Appropriations Committee. Prior to being elected to Congress, Ralph got his start in politics as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives and, later, the Ohio Senate. In 1972, he ran for Congress and won, beginning a long and impressive congressional tenure. Ralph served 18 terms, 36 years, and he was a leader on the Appropriations Committee. In that role, he helped to shape the country, but he never forgot where he came from: Stark County, Ohio. Back in 1998, Ralph and his wife, Mary, were instrumental in the establishment of the National First Ladies’ Library in Canton, and they both remained very involved in the library’s operations over the years. Many Ohioans and Cantonians remember him for his staunch support of Stark County’s park system, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and the Towpath Trail. While many around the Nation will remember Ralph Regula as an important figure on the Appropriations Committee, a role he served in for many, many years, I will remember him as a respected colleague and someone I was proud to call a friend. Ralph was a softspoken, oldschool gentleman. By the time I was elected to Congress back in 1994, Ralph Regula was the dean of the Ohio delegation. A few years after Congressman Regula retired, I became the dean of the Ohio Republican delegation, and I tried to model my approach to the role that he set. He set a great example for all of us who serve here in the House because he truly was a gentleman. Tonight, as we remember our former dean, I hope that we also remember his ability to work across the aisle. Ralph always treated everyone with respect and genuinely listened to the viewpoints of others. He believed that bipartisanship was a virtue and would work tirelessly to find common ground. I think we can all learn from his example. I would note that MARCY KAPTUR , who is one of our more respected Democratic colleagues in the House, is here this evening. I think it is a tribute to the bipartisanship that Ralph Regula showed over the years. I know that she worked not only with him, but with many of us in a bipartisan manner. That is just the way that Ralph Regula operated. Mr. Speaker, Ralph Regula was a decent, hardworking family man who was dedicated to Ohio, and particularly the 16th Congressional District and the people of Stark County. He was a public servant and a role model. He will be deeply missed. To Ralph’s wife, Mary; his daughter, Martha; his sons, David and Richard; and the entire Regula family, please know that we are saddened by your loss. We share that loss. We appreciate the time that you allowed Ralph to serve our Nation. You are in our thoughts and our prayers. God bless you all. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Toledo (Ms. KAPTUR ), who serves on the Appropriations Committee and who, I am sure, has some interesting tales to tell about Congressman Regula. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the kind gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for arranging this Special Order this evening. I thank Congressman CHABOT for his kind words and all the Members who have come to pay tribute to our beloved colleague, Ralph Regula. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor my late friend and respected colleague who served 18 terms and was a gentleman farmer, the very Honorable Congressman Ralph Regula of Ohio. Ralph passed away earlier this month in Bethlehem Township, Ohio. He was 92. To his beloved wife, Mary, for whom we all hold deep affection, and their family—Martha, Richard, David, and their children—please let me extend heartfelt sympathy and deepest affection. I had the privilege of serving with Ralph for 26 years, many of those on the Appropriations Committee. As others have mentioned, Ralph Straus Regula was born in Beach City, Ohio, on December 3, 1924, right before the Great Depression. In 1948, he graduated from Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, and went on to receive a degree in law as a night student from William McKinley School of Law in Canton, and then went on to serve in the United States Navy during World War II. Some of my memories of Ralph include him pulling into the congressional garage on so many occasions in his spiffy red pickup truck, always thinking about what was happening back in Ohio on his farm. That truck had many purposes. So many evenings we were in the same building and I could see him walking down the hall with Mary, his wife, well after 9 p.m. in the evening after having put in a very long day here in Congress. The press never reports about the Members who are dutiful and do their work. They generally focus on those who run into a little bit of trouble or get into a fracas, but Ralph Regula was the type of citizen who holds this Republic together. He was first elected in 1972 and was a longstanding, prominent figure in our body, serving 36 years in the House by the time of his retirement. At the time he retired, he was dean of the Ohio delegation and number three in seniority on the Republican side of the powerful Appropriations Committee. His service embraced the tenure of seven U.S. Presidents. As a lawmaker, Ralph was a champion of crossparty collaboration, as others have referenced, and he was a moral compass in an era of personal enrichment. Ralph is remembered as a hardworking, constructive, affable, intelligent, and effective Member. He set a very high standard. I tried to write words that remind me of Ralph—certainly ‘‘talented,’’ ‘‘honest,’’ ‘‘hardworking,’’ ‘‘sensible,’’ ‘‘understated,’’ ‘‘straightforward,’’ and ‘‘eventempered.’’ If you never met him, he was sort of a cross between Andy Griffith and Robert Redford. He was eventempered and not vindictive—and he had reason to be vindictive. He described himself as a conservative in spending but a progressive in programs. A proud Canton resident, he worked tirelessly to honor the legacy of his hometown hero, President William McKinley. Regula sought to preserve the fellow Ohioan’s memory by fighting to keep the name Mount McKinley for the summit in Alaska, homage to the man who represented his same district. During my time in the House, I have had the pleasure of serving alongside Ralph on the Appropriations Committee, where he was distinguished for sensible solutions that worked for Americans and for Ohioans. When he served on the Labor, Health, and Human Services Subcommittee, he instructed me, when I got to Congress: This is where you really help people. Ralph was dedicated to that. He had such a heart, but he didn’t wear it on his sleeve. He supported working people. There are many votes he cast in favor of the minimum wage. His father was a coal miner. He understood what it was to do that kind of work for a living. On the centennial of the Metro Parks’ creation, we remember his adoration and commitment to our public lands, founding one of northeast Ohio’s proudest landmarks, the Cuyahoga National Valley Park. He dedicated so many of his years to creating that park, the Ohio and Erie Canal system, and expanding that park to among the top 10 most visited in the United States of America. He attended to Ohio while he attended to the Nation. He had the guts to pass new user fees for all national parks to raise money to improve them, so he was thinking of the future. He was the founder and leader of the Steel Caucus in this House—that was one of the first places that I met him— and an early and effective voice about foreign dumping and about the importance of manufacturing in America, the importance of that steel industry and having fair trade among nations. With his wife, Mary, he was instrumental in creating the National First Ladies’ Library in Canton, Ohio, a most amazing place, with important untold stories about valorous women in our country that, for years, had been largely hidden from the public. I recommend that the public go to the website of that library and just read about the First Ladies of this country—not just who they were, but 
what they endured. I learned so much that I didn’t know. Ralph brought phenomenal experience to his public service. Others talked about how he had practiced law, serving in the Navy, held a degree in business administration, served as a school administrator, a teacher, a principal, State legislator, and served on the Ohio Board of Education. He was so levelheaded. An article in the The Washington Post reported that he introduced language in appropriations bills and procedural maneuvers to fight efforts to change Alaska’s Mount McKinley name. Obviously, he held the seat that was once occupied by President McKinley, the 25th President, who, sadly, was assassinated in 1901. As a graduate of the old William McKinley School of Law in Canton, Mr. Regula did not want to see the name of his fellow Buckeye erased from the tallest peak in North America. Ralph said: The law says it is Mount McKinley, and no President can change the law by the flick of a pen. When he set his mind to it, he prevailed. His vast experience on the legislative front led him and drove his successful efforts to invest millions and millions of dollars in the improvement of healthcare for the American people, as well as Ohio institutions such as the Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and MetroHealth. He championed the Great Lakes and fought mightily to find a way to clean up coal. I can remember being on the Republican side of the aisle. He said: Congresswoman KAPTUR , you have got to help me clean up coal. He was always looking for a way to try to make life better. He advocated for the National Endowment for the Arts. He worked to clean up Florida’s Everglades and led the construction of the popular children’s farm here in Washington at the National Zoo. When people come to public service at the national level, they learn that it is very hard to accomplish things over a brief period of time. It takes a long time. It takes decades to do something of merit. Ralph certainly achieved that. In 2010, the Cleveland Plain Dealer quoted him. I will end my tribute to him this evening with a quote that he gave to the Plain Dealer. He said: ‘‘Inflammatory rhetoric may satisfy the partisans, but it does little or nothing to move the legislative ball to the goal line.’’ He was talking about the necessity of breaking legislative gridlock and advocating bipartisan compromise. I think by Congressman BOBGIBBS being on floor tonight, by my being on the floor tonight, in a bipartisan spirit, giving tribute to Ralph Regula, this is a life that Members of Congress can learn from: real achievement, real merit, real honor. He brought real meaning to the word the ‘‘Honorable’’ Ralph Straus Regula. May God let him rest in peace and bless his spirit. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, in closing, we heard tonight that we will miss Ralph Regula. He was a dedicated public servant. He didn’t grandstand. He worked hard, and he got the job done for the people of Ohio and the people of this country. We will sorely miss him. Best regards to his beloved wife, Mary, and three children and the rest of the Regula family. It was an honor and privilege to know Ralph Regula. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today to offer my tribute on behalf of my predecessor, mentor, and most importantly my friend, the late Congressman Ralph Regula. We not only had the chance to share the same district but we celebrated the same birthday, something that always made our connection feel stronger. Congressman Regula represented the 16th District of Ohio in the United States House of Representatives from 1973 until his retirement in 2009. For thirtysix years and eighteen terms, Ralph Regula brought commonsense, Ohio values to Washington each and every day. Ralph came to Washington, often in his ubiquitous red pickup truck, to do a job for the American People. His was an office held in trust for a time and then relinquished with grace when that season of his life was over. Ralph Regula began his career as a teacher and grade school principal. Throughout his long career in public service he always encouraged students who approached him to ‘‘Learn something new every day’’. It was more than advice: it was a heartfelt wish that every young person he met would embrace a lifetime of learning and go on to become the very best versions of themselves. As a public servant, Ralph Regula was a thoughtful, conscientious man of the people. From humble beginnings as village solicitor in Navarre, Ohio, Ralph brought his experience as an educator to the Ohio Board of Education, and from there, to the Ohio state house where he served in the Ohio House of Representatives and the Ohio Senate. In 1972, Ralph Regula was elected to Congress to represent the 16th District of Ohio, an office he always said he held in trust for the people he represented back home in Ohio. His constituents sent him back to Washington eighteen times, asking for and receiving his best service and judgment on their behalf in the People’s House. In Congress, Ralph Regula served most of his tenure in the Committee on Appropriations. Ralph would say he was one of the keepers of America’s checkbook. In that role, Ralph brought his own brand of fiscal conservatism to bear on the great issues facing the United States. As chairman of the Committee on Appropriations Interior subcommittee, Ralph was instrumental in securing the future of Cuyahoga Valley National Park. I have no doubt that Ralph Regula will be remembered for many things during his time in Congress. I think his sense of fairness and his bipartisan approach to lawmaking will, no doubt, be among the best attributes recalled by his friends and colleagues. Debate ended at the doors to the House, but the friendship always endured. Ralph was foremost, though, a family man. The great love of his life, Mary, was his partner through thick and thin. Partners in all things, Ralph and Mary built a life together and raised three wonderful children: David, Richard and Martha. In closing, Mr. Speaker let me just say this: It truly was the honor of a lifetime to know Congressman Ralph Regula and call him my predecessor, mentor, and my friend. He will be dearly missed by all. f
