Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this week, the Senate is poised to completely break Donald Trump’s promises on healthcare. Remember, he promised insurance for everyone, it would be less expensive, and it wouldn’t touch Medicaid. Well, the CBO report, out yesterday, makes it devastatingly clear that the Republicans are ready to repudiate all three of those promises. Next year alone, 15 million Americans will lose their healthcare coverage. Over the course of the decade, that number will swell to 22 million Americans. And because they have disguised the impact to appear later in the next decade, we will watch those numbers skyrocket. Less expensive? Well, under their proposal, a 64year old with a $56,800 income—not upper middle class by any stretch of the imagination—will, by 2026, face an annual insurance premium of $20,000. Impacts are most pronounced on lowincome and older Americans. Won’t touch Medicaid? Their proposal anticipates $772 billion over the next decade to be slashed from that budget, a 26 percent cut for the health insurance provider that gives care to most Americans, 16 percent fewer people, people with higher costs, less coverage, and poorer insurance. They take a stab at the concern about the destabilization of the insurance market, which their proposal will do, by taking away the mandate that people have coverage, allowing people to wait until they are sick but still requiring insurers to cover them. There is an escape hatch. They don’t have to provide that if there has been a break in coverage. Then there is 6 months’ delay required before people can sign up. Think about what a 6 month delay could mean for somebody who is just diagnosed for cancer. It is the equivalent of a death sentence. The people you trust for your healthcare do not support this bill. The American Medical Association, hospitals, people who deal with rheumatism, cerebral palsy, cancer advocates, across the board they express reservations or outright opposition. Who do you trust with your medical care—who do you rely on who supports it? No one you rely on supports this measure. And make no mistake, healthcare in America will be worse. That is why the people you trust don’t support it. Seniors in nursing homes and disabled children will suffer and, yes, we ought to admit it; people will die. There is very good research available that is logical, suggesting that for every 20 million people who do not have insurance coverage, an extra 24,000 people a year die year after year. And why are we doing this? To fulfill a campaign pledge and to be able to cut taxes for those who need it the least. This massive reduction in healthcare finances massive tax reductions. This is immoral. There is a reason that it was hatched in secret, keeping it away even from Republican senators while it was being formulated, and why they are trying to jam this through in 1 week—a parody of Republican complaints about not enough process for ObamaCare. This is unprecedented and it is wrong. It is our job, each and every one of us, to make sure the American public knows what is at stake before it is too late. f 
SUPPORT FOR THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of New York). The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, last week’s general assembly meeting of the Organization of American States, the OAS, in Cancun, was intended to get greater support from the region to hold Nicolas Maduro and his regime accountable for their horrific actions against the Venezuelan people. However, we fell short of the 23 votes needed to fully enforce a resolution condemning Maduro for convening a fake constituent assembly with the 
purpose of undermining the democratically elected national assembly. I commend the 20 nations. Thank you to the 20 nations that stood up to the Venezuelan tyrant; especially I want to single out Barbados, the Bahamas, St. Lucia, Jamaica, Guyana, and Belize. To our allies in the Caribbean who voted with the people of Venezuela and not with the regime, I say: Thank you. And to those who voted against the people of Venezuela and with the regime, my message to you is: Wake up. The Maduro regime is a sinking ship and, as that economy continues to implode, it will take some of the Caribbean nations along with it. It is in the best interest of the Caribbean nations to work with the United States, with Canada, with Mexico, and other regional allies to put an end to the abusive tactics of the Maduro regime once and for all. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, countries like Nicaragua, whose leader Ortega is a kindred spirit of Maduro, spoke out to oppose the meeting and criticized the OAS for what it called interference in Venezuelans’ domestic issues. Ortega condemned the OAS for taking its rightful action to apply the InterAmerican Democratic Charter for Venezuela, yet Ortega wants us to believe that he is in favor of negotiating in good faith with the OAS to improve the electoral, the political, and the human rights situation in Nicaragua. What a farce. Ortega has been doing Maduro’s bidding at the OAS since day one, and we see right through him. Ortega has illustrated time and time again that he is not interested in any reforms, nor is he interested in restoring any democratic values back to the people of Nicaragua. But Ortega was not the only one who abandoned the people of Venezuela. No. El Salvador is another nation that has not once voted alongside the U.S. on issues related to Venezuela, even though we continue to provide funds for the Central American Alliance for Prosperity plan. They like our money. They just don’t want to look at things our way at all. Last week, I signed onto a letter led by my dear friend ALBIO SIRES from New Jersey. He wrote this letter to the Department of the Treasury, urging it to designate the El Salvadorian Foreign Deputy Minister Jose Luis Merino as a foreign narcotics kingpin for his ties to illicit activities to drug trafficking, to money laundering, for the FARC—the FARC that is a U.S.designated foreign terrorist organization. It is pathetic that the Venezuelan regime continues to use certain countries at the OAS as its puppets to shield itself from regional criticism. In the last 2 months, Mr. Speaker, more than 70 people have been killed by Maduro’s regime in Venezuela. Hundreds have been arrested. Hundreds have been injured by the violence, including a 17yearold protester who was shot in pointblank range by pro Maduro police thugs. It is unacceptable for us to stand idly by as this cruelty continues to happen. It is a disgrace that the region could not come together in a united front to call out the Maduro regime for the violent thugs that they are, a disgrace to our democratic principles and values, and a disgrace to the InterAmerican Democratic Charter for which the OAS stands. The deteriorating situation in Venezuela is an important matter for the region, for our own interests, Mr. Speaker. Our message must be to those countries that continue to vote against the people of Venezuela: Stop being cowards. Be courageous. Stand up to those corrupt bullies in Venezuela. Do it for the people of Venezuela. How many more have to give their lives in Venezuela for you to wake up? And if you don’t stop to reassess your support for the thug Maduro, and your willingness to turn a blind eye toward the suffering of the Venezuelan people, perhaps America will start to reassess its relationship with you. f 
AMERICAN GROWN FLOWER MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, today I proudly introduce bipartisan legislation to recognize July as American Grown Flower Month. I have seen firsthand the value of the grown flower industry playing an important role in our economy and community during my visits with our Central Coast growers in my district. California produces threequarters of all cut flowers grown here in the United States. This generates thousands of jobs across our State and drives a staggering $1.13 billion in the economic activity each year. Whether it is celebrating Mother’s Day, a birthday, or a graduation, flowers have been used to mark special occasions dating back thousands of years. I am committed to recognizing this industry’s remarkable contribution to our country by designating July as American Grown Flower Month. We officially celebrate the incomparable beauty flowers bring to our homes and to our celebrations year round. I also want to urge the White House to consider having American flowers in the White House for all occasions. 
65TH ANNIVERSARY OF LEVITTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 65th anniversary of my hometown, Levittown, Pennsylvania. On June 23, 1952, the first 20 families moved into Levittown, which is one of the first planned communities built in the U.S. With its partially framed housing, immature landscaping, and muddy streets, Levittown, in 1952, is a frontier outside of the city of Philadelphia. Levittown’s first official family, the Doughertys, moved into their home on Stonybrook Drive and embraced the American Dream of homeownership. And as Mrs. Dougherty told reporters in Levittown, she described Levittown as country living with city conveniences. Between 1952 and 1958, Levitt & Sons built 17,311 singlefamily houses with lawns. b1015 There were six models a family could choose from: the Levittowner, the Rancher, the Jubilee, the Pennsylvanian, the Colonial, and the Country Clubber. Levitt & Sons pushed the boundaries of housing construction by perfecting the homebuilding assembly line. Levittown remains a special place in Bucks County. Originally designed as a completed community, Levittown grew into the model middle class community. In fact, it became a popular place for hundreds of returning World War II veterans who wanted to start families of their own. Now Levittown is home to over 50,000 residents with schools, churches, parks, and businesses that foster a sense of community for families to live and work. Residents of Levittown have worked in our steel mills, built our infrastructure, and served in our military—all while raising their children. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call Levittown my hometown, and I am grateful to represent this closeknit and hardworking community. Congratulations to all who have called Levittown home for the last 65 years. Happy birthday, Levittown. RECOGNIZING NETWORK OF VICTIM ASSISTANCE  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Network of Victim Assistance, NOVA, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. NOVA seeks to support, counsel, and empower victims of sexual assault and abuse in our region through advocacy and community education. By utilizing individual and group counseling, victims of sexual assault and abuse can regain control of their lives, and through education programs, children and communities learn to be advocates for victims of abuse, as well as prevention and personal safety. Additionally, NOVA Bucks County maintains a 24hour hotline to be able to support all sexual assault victims to get the assistance that they need, as well as assistance in court and safety programs for those with disabilities. I was pleased to tour their facility earlier this year. I am thankful for the work of Penny Ettinger, Kathy Bennett, Steve Doerner, Keith Kirkner, 
Mandy Mundy, Bill Hoblin, and so many of the NOVA staff and volunteers serving Bucks County, including generous volunteers such as Tina Greenwood. Through its programs and projects, NOVA empowers victims of sexual assault and abuse, providing them with the resources and security they need to live in spaces free from violence. I am proud to stand with them in their mission to stand with victims in the fight to end sexual assault. 
SENATE HEALTHCARE REPEAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, this week we expect that our colleagues in the Senate will vote on the latest version of TrumpCare. Recently, I voted against a very similar bill because it will be a disaster for Oregonians and Americans. Under the Senate bill, millions of people—up to 22 million people—will lose coverage. Mr. Speaker, many of my constituents are rightly worried. One of those is Kalpana. Kalpana is caring for loved ones with cancer. As she put it recently, she is sandwiched by cancer. She manages intravenous chemo treatments for her 7yearold son who is fighting leukemia. Presently, he is winning that fight. Her father has been through countless therapies in his decadelong battle with prostate cancer, which has now spread to his lymph nodes. Kalpana is amazing—our own local wonder woman. Fortunately, she can devote time and attention to her family’s care without having to choose between paying for healthcare and paying for rent, food, and other basic necessities—for now. But after the House vote on TrumpCare, she said this: I feel like someone had punched me in the gut. Before the Affordable Care Act, families lived in fear that a cancer diagnosis or a heart attack would leave them in economic ruin and make them ineligible for insurance in the future. Early in my career, I worked at Legal Aid. I did financial counseling with clients who were struggling— often because they got sick with no insurance or because they had insurance that didn’t cover them when they needed it. We can’t go back to the days when medical debt drove too many families into bankruptcy and financial ruin. Oregonians and Americans need the stability of knowing they will have affordable healthcare coverage when they get sick or when they are injured. With the Affordable Care Act, families across the country have had that peace of mind and security that comes with having affordable health coverage. All of that is in jeopardy this week. Mr. Speaker, this is the United States of America. Healthcare can and should be available for all, not just the healthy and the wealthy. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject TrumpCare, and let’s all get back to the table and talk about how we can improve—not take away—access to affordable healthcare for our constituents. f 
IMMIGRANT HERITAGE MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CURBELO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, June is Immigrant Heritage Month, and as the son of parents who fled Castro’s Cuba, like so many other residents of south Florida, I am especially proud of my district’s rich immigrant history and culture. From smallbusiness owners to law enforcement, hundreds of thousands of immigrants and their descendants across south Florida are contributing to our economy, culture, and local communities as living examples of American success. I know from firsthand experience the great and generous spirit of the American people and the unimaginable opportunities our Nation provides to all who are willing to work for them. Despite the longstanding tradition of welcoming immigrants to our shores, our Nation continues to have vigorous debate about immigration policy. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the current debate has left thousands of immigrant children, who were brought to this country by their parents, in constant fear of deportation to countries of origin many of them don’t even remember. They have attended school with our own children, graduated high school, sometimes even serving in the military, and today are seeking to contribute to American society and help grow our economy. Mr. Speaker, the President, the former President, and Members of Congress in both Chambers and from both parties agree that these young people, commonly referred to as DREAMers, should be treated with compassion. I too agree, which is why I introduced legislation that would give these young people the certainty that they deserve. The Recognizing America’s Children Act creates three pathways to legal status for them: academic, military service, or employment. All qualified applicants would be thoroughly vetted, and any individual who has been involved in serious criminal conduct will be disqualified. Mr. Speaker, immigration reform means strengthening security at our border and modernizing our visa program to keep Americans safe, but it also means offering immigrants who love our country just as much as we do the opportunity to fully participate in the American experience. It is my hope that this Immigrant Heritage Month will lead us to act in this regard. MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS SEMIPOSTAL  
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, neurological and psychiatric disorders have exacted a tremendous toll on our society. Despite the great scientific strides being made daily in neuroscience research, the underlying causes of conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, and traumatic brain injury remain unsolved. For true breakthroughs to occur, researchers require additional data to better treat these conditions. To address this, the previous administration announced the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative in 2013. Known as the BRAIN Initiative, this collaborative publicprivate research will advance our understanding of how the brain functions as researchers work to map the brain and study how individual cells interact in both time and space. The data generated from this research will help scientists fill in the gaps in our current understanding and provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring how the brain enables us to record, process, utilize, store, and retrieve vast quantities of information. This information will also provide researchers with a better understanding of mental illness and posttraumatic stress disorder in hopes of better treating these diseases and reducing the number of suicides each year. I was pleased that the 21st Century Cures Act, which I supported here in the House and was signed into law, authorized $1.51 billion for this important research. Mr. Speaker, to help accelerate this project and raise public attention to this initiative, today I introduced the Mental Health Awareness Semipostal Stamp Act with Representative GRACE  NAPOLITANO to raise awareness for this important cause. This would come at no cost to taxpayers. Revenues generated from the sale of a specialized postage stamp would be directed to the National Institute of Mental Health to further this ambitious program that has the potential to revolutionize neurological and psychiatric care all around the world. 
PHILANDO CASTILE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) for 5 minutes. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the death of my former constituent, Philando Castile, whose shocking and completely unnecessary death has now been seen by millions around the world via video. I mourn not only his death but also the complete failure of local law enforcement and the criminal justice system to protect his most precious right, the right to life. Philando, like so many other young African Americans before him, 
interacted with local law enforcement, responded peacefully, did exactly what he was supposed to do, yet he wound up dead, shot six times at pointblank range by an officer who saw him as something less than human. He is dead for no good reason except for the color of his skin and the fact that his ethnicity fed into an implicit, sick, and deadly bias held by some police officers that Black people present an imminent threat simply by virtue of who we are. That bias is pervasive, not just among some police officers, but also throughout our criminal justice system. Anyone who views the video of Philando’s police shooting can see that he should not be dead and that the officer who killed him should have been held accountable. But as in far too many other cases, the justice system failed Philando and his family in the most outrageous way. The sad truth is that, in 2017, we continue to suffer under a justice system that provides justice for some but not for all. As I join with Philando’s family and millions of other Americans who were outraged by the complete lack of accountability for his death, I cannot but help remember another tragic case, the death of my 18yearold constituent, Mike Brown, almost 3 years ago in Ferguson, Missouri. As I watched Philando’s family screaming out for justice, they reminded me of something that Mike Brown’s mother, Lezley McSpadden, told me. She said: Congressman, I want them to know that he mattered to me. Well, he mattered to me, too, as well as Philando. So did Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, and so many others who have died at the hands of local police for no good reason and without any consequences. Mr. Speaker, I have supported local law enforcement for over 30 years, and I continue to have no doubt that the vast majority of police officers perform a difficult, dangerous, and essential job with honor, bravery, and integrity. But I also know that too many other officers clearly lack the temperament and training to deescalate interactions before they become deadly, and that continues to cost many innocent lives. That is why I have introduced, along with my good friends, Congressman STEVE COHEN of Tennessee and Senator TAMMY DUCKWORTH of Illinois, the Police Training and Independent Review Act of 2017. This legislation has already earned almost 100 cosponsors. My bill would protect both police officers and the citizens they serve. It would require sensitivity training in the areas of race, ethnic bias, disabilities, and interactions with new immigrants. It would also establish incentives to encourage States to adopt new laws to require an independent prosecutor in all cases when police use deadly force. This legislation deserves a fair hearing and an upordown vote in this House. I will close with this: a brief teaching from the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on the occasion of another needless tragedy, the police killing of civil rights worker Jimmie Lee Jackson by an Alabama State trooper in 1965. In his eulogy, King said: ‘‘A State trooper pointed the gun, but he did not act alone. He was murdered by the brutality of every sheriff who practices lawlessness in the name of the law.’’ f 
b1030 IT IS TIME TO GET OUT OF OUR 16YEAR WAR IN AFGHANISTAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, in one of the Capitol Hill newspapers today is this cartoon, a cartoon showing a general with several stars on his shoulder, saying: ‘‘Sixteen years of blood, bombs, bullets, and devastation, and no one’s winning,’’ talking about our 16year war in Afghanistan. And then the cartoon shows a very greedylooking man holding a briefcase called War Incorporated, with all kinds of cash sticking out of both sides and with this greedy smile saying, ‘‘Oh, I wouldn’t say that.’’ And that is what this war is now all about, this 16year war. It is being held up and continued only because so many people and companies are making money out of it. Just yesterday, in The Washington Times, there was this story entitled, ‘‘War and Waste,’’ and I would like to read some of that story. ‘‘Those are the basics for outfitting an Afghan soldier. But in that simple uniform combination are the threads of two troubling stories—one about the waste of millions in American taxpayer dollars’’—actually, it is many billions—‘‘the other about the perils of propping up a partner army in a seemingly endless war. ‘‘Together these tales help explain why some in Congress’’—and it should be everyone in Congress—‘‘why some in Congress question the wisdom of investing even more resources in Afghanistan, nearly 16 years after the United States invaded the Talibanruled country in response to the alQaida attacks of September 11, 2001. The Army general who runs the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan calls it a stalemate. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says the U.S. is ‘not winning.’’’ And I will continue with this story: And, sadly, the only Americans who are being killed in recent weeks have been killed by the Afghan soldiers who we are paying and who we are there trying to help out. Continuing this story: ‘‘The long war has generated repeated examples of wasted funds, which may be inevitable in a country such as Afghanistan, where the military has been built from scratch, is plagued with corruption and relies almost completely on U.S. money for even the most basic things, including salaries and uniforms. Among the costs rarely noted publicly: The Pentagon has spent $1 billion over the past 3 years to help recruit and retain Afghan soldiers.’’ And then, I continue with the story: ‘‘The Pentagon has not disputed the gist of findings by its Special Inspector General for Afghanistan, John Sopko, that the U.S. spent as much as $28 million more than necessary over 10 years on uniforms for Afghan soldiers with a camouflage ‘forest’ pattern that’’ is totally ‘‘inappropriate for the largely desert battlefield. ‘‘In a report released this past week, Sopko’s office said the Pentagon paid to license a propriety camouflage pattern even though it owns patterns it could have used for free.’’ The Pentagon spent $28 million to get something that it could have gotten for free. ‘‘The choice,’’ it said, was based on the seemingly offhand fashion preference of a single Afghan official. ‘‘‘This is not an isolated event,’ Sopko said in a telephone interview. The U.S., he said, has been ‘in a mad rush to spend money like a drunken sailor on a weekend furlough.’ It reflects a pattern, he said, of spending too much money, too quickly, with too little oversight and too little accountability.’’ And he continues, Mr. Sopko: ‘‘‘This was more than just a bad fashion move,’ he said. ‘It cost the taxpayer millions of dollars’ more than might have been necessary. ‘‘Money is rarely part of the debate over what the United States should do differently or better in Afghanistan, and thus the accumulating costs are often overlooked. ‘‘Since 2002, the U.S. has spent $66 billion on Afghan security forces alone’’—in addition to many, many billions more on other things in trying to do nation building in Afghanistan, which we never should have been doing in the first place. ‘‘In recent years, this spending has grown’’—listen to that. In recent years, this spending has grown over the $66 billion. ‘‘Stephen Biddle, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said the money wasted on camouflage uniforms is symptomatic of a broader problem of official corruption that has sapped the strength and spirit of too many Afghan soldiers.’’ And he added this: ‘‘‘The real problem in Afghanistan is not, ‘‘Can we get a rational decision about which camouflage design it should be.’’ The real problem in Afghanistan is that cronyism and corruption’’’—that word is in that story several times—‘‘‘corruption in the government and the security forces saps the combat motivation of the soldiers.’’’ Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to end this very wasteful war and get out of Afghanistan. 
TRUMPCARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak about a young man by the name of Will, who is 34 years old and tells us a story that, if he was a Canadian, there would be a good chance that he could live 17 more years. He has cystic fibrosis, and I imagine there are many families with children who have that, but he is concerned about TrumpCare and the impact. At age 2, he was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a hereditary disease impacting 30,000 Americans. He says: 
Imagine being under water and coming up for air, but instead of breathing, you uncontrollably cough that air out. The harder you try to breathe, the more you cough. At its worst, this disease feels like a long, drawn out panic attack set to the soundtrack of an endless hacking cough. At 34, statistically, I have 7 more years left before my lungs cease to function. 
He mentions that if he were in Canada, statistically, he would have 17 more years because of the healthcare, but he also says this is not an exaggeration: 
The cold data from a recent study by the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the conclusion is that Canada’s nationalized single payer healthcare system that guarantees health insurance for everyone is the primary reason why Canadians with my disease will live longer. 
For the past 4 years, however, my disease has gone into reverse. I have been gradually getting better. It is an extraordinary sensation. A new medication called Kalydeco made by a company in Boston has given me the promise of extending both the length and quality of my life. I have been healthy enough to work abroad as a freelance journalist. 
A year and a half ago, Will got married. 
My wife and I hope to one day have kids, but today is a sobering day. The House Republicans replaced the Affordable Care Act, and if the Senate bill goes through, a plan that likely won’t allow me to remain on this drug, then my longterm plans go out the window. I have a preexisting condition. My outlook would likely regress back to the one of shortterm survival and carpe diem. That is a very different future than the one I plan to have. 
That is what TrumpCare represents to millions of Americans: higher costs; less coverage; not 22 million now, but in 2026, 49 million Americans will not be insured. How can you? Where is the moral standing? It guts protections for preexisting conditions no matter what kind of smoke and mirrors the Senate is trying to tell us. It does not exist. It has got a crushing age tax. If you are over 50, more of your income will be used for your insurance premiums, up to $12,000 to $15,000. And it steals from Medicare. It makes the Medicare trust fund insolvent. In my own State of Texas, here is a long chart that talks to each Member, including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, how many people in their district will lose their health insurance. I would ask the question: Is there any mercy? Is there anyone that understands? In my district alone, almost 100,000— 89,000—individuals will be losing their insurance; almost 20,000 of those will be children. And it goes on in other Members’ districts, talks about children: 7,000, 9,000, 8,000, 15,000, 13,000, 12,000, 10,000, 14,000, 18,000, 16,000 children in different districts in the State of Texas will lose their insurance. And then Will, who would have and has now, because of the Affordable Care Act, a decent life, with a preexisting condition that he described, how would you like to come from under water and try to breathe and that breathing is undermined by the hacking of that cough? I hope that this bill is derailed. I hope that TrumpCare in the House and the Senate never sees the light of day, not because I don’t want to work with my colleagues, but because the chronically ill will suffer and many will die. The statistics show that in the State of Texas, Mr. Speaker. I conclude with this one sentence, Mr. Speaker. I want to go back to Mr. CLAY, and I ask the Attorney General to investigate the shooting of Mr. Castile, and to do it now. 
IMMIGRATION AND SANCTUARY CITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, as a Representative of the great State of Texas, I want to first acknowledge and preface my remarks with the fact that most people that are entering these United States illegally are doing so because they want a better life for their families. That said, it doesn’t make it right. As has been said, and I have said it before, we are a nation of immigrants for sure, all of us, but we are also a nation of laws. When the Federal Government abdicates its responsibility to secure our border and enforce our immigration laws, we not only fail in our sacred duty to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law, but we put American lives at risk. 121, that is the number of lives that have been lost from 2010 to 2014, lives that could have been saved if we had the political courage to enforce our immigration laws regarding criminal aliens. Here is something even more outrageous. Of the over 36,000 criminal aliens released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody over the course of a year, 1,000 of them were reconvicted of another crime. These avoidable, tragic deaths from violent crimes continue to happen across the country, and many of the criminal aliens who have committed them have found refuge in our Nation’s sanctuary cities. These are lawless cities, let’s be clear, cities whose actions undermine the basic American tenet that we are a nation of laws, not of men. Fortunately, we have the opportunity to stop this madness and do the job the American people expect their government to do, their first job, and that is to keep Americans safe. Passing the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act would impose significant penalties on States and cities that refuse to follow Federal immigration laws and cooperate with authorities. Additionally, it would allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to prohibit law breaking immigrants in DHS custody from being transferred to sanctuary cities. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act only addresses one part of the problem in this area, a problem that we all know will require further reform; but, nonetheless, this is a good, commonsense law, and it will move our country in the right direction towards safer, stronger communities. In addition to supporting the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, I have cosponsored the DavisOliver Act, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. In addition to holding these cities accountable for harboring criminal aliens, we need to ensure that our State and local law enforcement officials have the authority to actually do their job, and that is enforce all of our Nation’s laws. Together, I believe the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and the DavisOliver Act will have a major impact on stopping illegal immigration and deterring lawlessness at the hands of criminal aliens who have repeatedly proven that they will break our laws, harm our citizens, and disrespect this great Nation. Mr. Speaker, let’s empower the President and local law enforcement agencies to do their job. Let’s honor the Constitution and respect the rule of law. Mr. Speaker, let’s simply put America first. 
b1045 BROKEN PROMISES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, as a candidate, Donald Trump made some very big promises on healthcare to the American people. GOP leadership in both the House and Senate have echoed those promises. But the TrumpRyan healthcare bill and the Senate version of the GOP bill fail to deliver on those promises. Donald Trump promised healthcare for all of the American people. Even though the ACA expanded health coverage to more than 20 million Americans, Donald Trump said he didn’t 
think it provided enough people with coverage. He said: ‘‘We’re going to have insurance for everybody,’’ and, ‘‘I’m not going to leave the lower 20 percent that can’t afford insurance.’’ The Congressional Budget Office says that 14 million people will immediately lose coverage under the TrumpRyan plan, and 24 million people will lose coverage by 2027. The Senate version of the bill isn’t much different. Trump also promised that Americans would enjoy cheaper health insurance, with ‘‘much lower deductibles.’’ His Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price, said that ‘‘nobody will be worse off financially.’’ But the GOP healthcare plan would cause an increase in health premiums by 15 to 20 percent in the first 2 years alone, according to the Congressional Budget Office. During the Republican Presidential primary, Donald Trump bragged that he was ‘‘the first and only potential GOP candidate to state that there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.’’ But the GOP health plan guts Medicaid more than ever before. It freezes enrollment and unravels the Medicaid expansion. Donald Trump and the GOP leadership are breaking their promises to the American people. Their healthcare bills take away coverage from millions. Deductibles will go up. Copays will go up. TrumpCare would gut essential health benefits, which would mean soaring costs for people with preexisting conditions. It will provide worse coverage to those lucky enough to still be able to afford it. And to what end? They are stripping healthcare from millions of people in order to give a tax cut to the wealthiest Americans who need it the least. They are lining the pockets of the rich while leaving our families out to dry. The GOP wants to take away healthcare coverage from millions of hardworking Americans who just want to feel secure and know that they and their families will be able to see a doctor and get treated if they get sick, without putting themselves or their families in financial ruin. They are robbing Peter to give PAUL RYAN and his cronies a tax cut. In Arizona, we have seen firsthand the damage that Medicaid cuts can wreak. In 2011, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer cut Arizona’s Medicaid funding and froze enrollment. Families who were on Medicaid at the time could only continue to receive benefits if their income remained below the Federal poverty level. A family who worked hard to raise their income even the tiniest amount above the poverty line would lose Medicaid coverage permanently, even if their income went down later. About 150,000 adults in Arizona lost their Medicaid as a result of those changes. People would get sick and be unable to see a doctor just because they couldn’t afford it. In some cases, people were forced to decide between paying for lifesaving care or paying their rent. If Medicaid expansion goes away under the GOP healthcare plan, around 400,000 Arizonans could lose coverage, according to AHCCCS in Arizona. That includes 26,700 cancer patients and about 47,000 who are working to overcome different levels of substance abuse, including opioid treatment. People in other States across the country would experience similar devastating outcomes. Senators JOHN MCCAIN and J EFF FLAKE witnessed the disastrous effect of taking away healthcare coverage for people in Arizona. They know more than anyone else how many lives can be ruined. Some Republicans have already voiced strong concerns about this bill’s impact on their constituents. If they are serious about these concerns, it will only take three Republican Senators to take a stand and grind this process to a halt. Unfortunately, so far, Senators MCCAINand F LAKE are not among them. Senators MCCAINand F LAKE face a very stark choice: they can do the bidding of Donald Trump and deprive millions of healthcare coverage, or they can take steps to defend the health and financial security of the Arizonans they were elected to represent. The people of Arizona haven’t been shy about letting our Senators know how they feel and why they feel it, but it is time to dial up the pressure. Senators MCCAINand F LAKE must understand that they owe it to Arizona families to vote ‘‘no’’ on TrumpCare. If they don’t, Arizona will hold them accountable. It is time for my colleagues in the House to put pressure on the Senators in their own States to do the right thing and vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. We owe it to our constituents to stand up for them and make sure that this catastrophic plan never sees the light of day. 
MONSIGNOR WILLIAM O’NEILL CELEBRATES 50 YEARS WITH SAVANNAH DIOCESE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Monsignor William O’Neill, who celebrated his Golden Jubilee of Ordination on June 4, 2017, marking his 50th year of service with the Catholic Diocese of Savannah. Irish Catholics have been an important aspect of Savannah’s culture and history since their arrival during the mid19th century. Today, Savannah maintains important aspects of Irish Catholic culture, and is now home to the third largest St. Patrick’s Day festival in the world. A native of Ireland, a newly ordained O’Neill arrived in the heat of a Georgia summer in 1967. His first assignment was to St. Mary on the Hill in Augusta. Later, Father O’Neill would go on to manage the cathedral at Abercorn and Harris, which has become an architectural staple in the city of Savannah. Father O’Neill’s graciousness and love for the Catholic faith and its Savannah followers led him to begin the renovation of the cathedral on Abercorn and Harris in 1998, which involved the removal and cleaning of over 50 stained glass windows, the replacement of the slate roof, and the restoration of the building’s interior. On February 4, 2001, Father O’Neill was made the first priest of the Savannah Diocese in nearly 34 years to be invested with the title of Monsignor, which serves as a recognition of his commitment to the Diocese. Although he has since retired, Father O’Neill remains an active part of the Diocese. I congratulate Father O’Neill and I thank him for his commitment to the First Congressional District of Georgia. RETIREMENT OF FLETC DIRECTOR CONNIE L . 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Ms. Connie Patrick for her service to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, as she retires as its director this Friday, June 30, 2017. Director Patrick began her career in law enforcement in 1976, when she was sworn in as a deputy with the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office in Titusville, Florida. Her hard work and determination gave her the opportunity for a promotion to serve as a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. After 20 years with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, she began her work with the FLETC. Director Patrick’s impeccable work ethic gained her a promotion to Director of the FLETC in 2002. She has since served in that capacity. Under Director Patrick’s leadership, local, State and, Federal training facility growth has increased by an astonishing 22 percent. The FLETC has also trained more students during her tenure than it did in its first 36 years of existence. As Director of this division of Homeland Security, Director Patrick oversaw training for a majority of Federal officers and agents from more than 90 Federal organizations on the local, State, and national levels. These facilities graduate approximately 63,000 law enforcement officers annually. To date, Director Patrick is the longestserving head of any component of the Department of Homeland Security. Director Patrick has also found the time to serve as a leader among members of the National Sheriffs’ Association Education and Awards Committee, as well as the executive committee of the National Law Enforcement Exploring Committee. I thank Director Patrick for her invaluable dedication to ensuring that 
our law enforcement officers are properly trained to protect our loved ones. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the St. Mary Missionary Baptist Church on its 87th anniversary this year. In 1930, God gave a group of dynamic trailblazers, under the leadership of the church’s first pastor, Reverend R.D. Cooper, a vision to help establish a permanent place of worship. They purchased land and built the first structure that would become St. Mary Missionary Baptist Church. On that location, the members of St. Mary embraced the church’s unified goal of ‘‘Touching Lives for Christ.’’ As pastors came and went over the years, each had their own vision on how to improve and enrich the church and its congregation. The church’s current leader, Minister Lawrence F. Baker, Sr., joined St. Mary as its pastor in 2005 and made many improvements and purchases that helped the church grow its membership while never losing sight of its vision. St. Mary is a truly blessed congregation with its kind and charitable members serving the community any way they can. As the church continues to grow, the good people of St. Mary touch more lives every day. On June 11, communities and congregations from all over came together to celebrate St. Mary’s history and future. I congratulate Minister Baker on his impressive leadership of this dynamic organization. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 54 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Rabbi Gary Klein, Temple Ahavat Shalom, Palm Harbor, Florida, offered the following prayer: Religious traditions teach that people and God are to work together to create a better world. Therefore, as we begin this day of work of the House of Representatives, we pray first, O God, that You join with medical professionals to help Congressman SCALISE  and others injured with him experience complete recoveries. We also pray that You bless the efforts of this legislative body so that the collective courage, dedication, compassion, and wisdom of its Members help this country maintain its position as ‘‘a light unto the nations.’’ You have also taught us through the Talmud, a work of Jewish religious literature, that trying to improve the world, even if you do not complete the task, is life’s most sacred duty. Help us and our legislators to also understand the Talmudic concept that reinforces this when it states: If you save a single life, it is as if you saved the entire world. O God, help each of us as Americans recognize the significance of the work done by our legislators, and help us to always be grateful to them. God, we also pray that You keep our legislators healthy and safe so that they may continue their work of improving the world. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. HIMES led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING RABBI GARY KLEIN The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my great friend, Rabbi Gary Klein, who has led the Temple Ahavat Shalom of Palm Harbor, Florida, for the past 30 years. Temple Ahavat Shalom is a congregation that serves nearly 500 households in my district. Since coming to Pinellas County in 1987, he served on the board of the St. Leo University Center for CatholicJewish studies and currently serves on the National Council of AIPAC. Rabbi Klein is a longtime advocate on behalf of the U.S.Israel alliance. As cochair of the Congressional Hellenic Israeli Alliance, I welcome his continued advice and counsel, especially as it relates to security in the Eastern Mediterranean. For several years now, I have joined Rabbi Klein and the congregation for Passover Seder, and I very much look forward to continuing this tradition. I am thankful for his friendship, and I wish him many more years of blessed leadership. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning because yesterday the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization that we rely on in this Chamber for truth, told us that the Senate healthcare bill—socalled healthcare bill—will throw 22 million Americans off of their insurance. Two thirds of those, 14 million, are Medicaid patients—the poorest people in America, elderly people in nursing homes. I don’t have a voice in the Senate, Mr. Speaker, but if I did, I would say: I understand how important it is to deliver on the promise you have been making for 7 years to repeal ObamaCare. The Republican base is demanding it, but it can’t possibly be demanding the throwing off of their healthcare 22 million Americans. Mr. Speaker, I also don’t have a voice in the oval office, but if I did, I would ask this President, I would say: Sir, you promised to do three things: you promised to increase coverage, to lower deductibles, and to lower premiums for the American people. I would say: Mr. President, this bill in the Senate does the exact opposite of all three of those things. So I would say: Mr. President, if you keep your word, stop this Senate bill from passing. 
HONORING JAMES WILDERMUTH (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Indiana’s Rural Teacher of the Year, James Wildermuth of North Miami Community Schools. Mr. Wildermuth is well deserving of this high honor awarded by the Indiana Small and Rural Schools Association. He is truly an exceptional Hoosier educator who has had a profound impact on student achievement and who exemplifies leadership in a way that should inspire all of us. In addition to his 17 years as a teacher, Mr. Wildermuth also serves as a district adviser for the local Future Farmers of America program. I am grateful that North Miami’s students have Mr. Wildermuth as a role model and a mentor, always keeping them not only engaged in the lesson at hand but focused on using these lessons to succeed in life. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Second District Hoosiers, I want to thank Mr. Wildermuth for all he does to educate, support, and guide his students on the path to achievement and to make our community stronger. 
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AWARENESS (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about posttraumatic stress disorder, otherwise referred to as PTSD. Roughly, 5.2 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed in a given year with posttraumatic stress disorder. Many of these individuals are men and women who have bravely served our Nation’s military. The Department of Veterans Affairs indicates that between 15 and 30 percent of Vietnam veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime; about 12 percent of Desert Storm veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD in a given year; and between 11 and 20 percent of those serving in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom have also been diagnosed with PTSD in a given year. So today, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day, I call on all of us to do more to help our fellow Americans. We can do more, and we must do more. We must be able to look at those Americans with PTSD in their eyes and say: You are not alone, and we are with you, and we are going to continue to give you the same service that you have given our country. f 
HONORING SERGEANT DILLON BALDRIDGE (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Dillon Baldridge, who was killed in action on June 10, 2017, from wounds sustained in Nangarhar province, Afghanistan, while supporting Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Combat Infantry Badge, and the Army Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster. His prior awards and decorations included the Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal with three oak clusters, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, and the Expert Infantry Badge. Last week, hundreds of North Carolina residents gathered in Ashe County to pay tribute to Sergeant Baldridge as he was laid to rest. We should all take time to pause, reflect, and honor the sacrifices of those like this young man from Youngsville, North Carolina, who have given their lives in the pursuit of a more prosperous and free America. May we endeavor to live worthy of their legacy and guard vigilantly the history and stories of our fallen. 
FLIGHT SAFETY LEGISLATION (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, 8 years ago, Western New Yorkers witnessed tragedy due to inadequate pilot training. A poorly trained pilot crashed a commercial jet into a neighborhood in our community, ending the lives of those on board and one on the ground. Since then, the victims’ families of Flight 3407, who suffered unimaginable loss on that day, have turned their grief into a powerful citizens’ fight to strengthen pilot training and flight safety rules. The families of Flight 3407, who are here today, led the charge urging Congress to pass landmark flight safety legislation in 2010, including rules that could have prevented the tragedy that they all suffered. Since then, there have been 7 years of no fatal commercial crashes on domestic U.S. airlines. Now the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization is nearing and some want to beat back this tremendous progress. Let’s be clear, what is being proposed is a rule change that will allow less experienced pilots to fly commercial jets again. The safety of the flying public should never be compromised again. I am prepared, along with the Western New York delegation and with the 3407 families, to protect these reforms once again, because we know the painful lessons of accepting anything less. f 
MAINTAINING GREAT LAKES’ ECOSYSTEM (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, the Great Lakes are a national treasure, and nobody knows this better than the people in my home State of Michigan. Our environment, economy, and quality of life depend upon maintaining a healthy Great Lakes ecosystem. One of the most harmful threats are invasive species like Asian carp that decimate every ecosystem in their path. Last week, we learned some alarming news when a live Asian carp was found just nine miles from Lake Michigan beyond the electric barrier. If Asian carp are able to infiltrate the Great Lakes, it would be devastating for Michigan’s fishing, boating, and tourism industries and all the jobs they support. The Army Corps of Engineers has completed a report called the ‘‘Brandon Road Study’’ that provides a roadmap of how to best prevent Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes. They should release it immediately. We must take bipartisan action before it is too late. We simply cannot allow, Mr. Speaker, Asian carp to wreak havoc on the Great Lakes. 
b1215 OPPOSING TRUMPCARE (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose TrumpCare, a bill that 
will cause at least 22 million Americans to lose healthcare. Senate Republicans and House Republicans drafted their bill in secret, behind closed doors, and without a single hearing. But after seeing the bill, Mr. Speaker, I know why they kept it a secret. TrumpCare will allow States to eliminate essential healthcare benefits like emergency room visits, preventative screenings, and prescription drug coverage. TrumpCare will gut Medicaid $772 billion and allow insurers to charge hardworking Americans more money for less coverage. It will cost the State of Ohio, my State, more than $25 billion, giving 400 of the richest families a massive tax break. Hardworking Americans should not have to choose between going to the doctor and putting food on their table. Republicans should work with Democrats to create a healthcare system that gives all Americans fair health coverage. 
NATIONAL POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AWARENESS DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today is National PTSD Awareness Day. Today and during the month of June, we raise awareness for those suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. After a trauma or lifethreatening event, it is common to have reactions such as upsetting memories of the event, increased jumpiness, or trouble sleeping. If these reactions do not go away or if they get worse, you might suffer from PTSD. There are organizations and resources that can help both individuals and professionals to discover ways to identify and manage PTSD symptoms and explore effective treatments. PTSD is especially prevalent for those who have served in the military, though not all of our military servicemembers suffer from PTSD. A non servicemember may be exposed to a single trauma—for example, a car accident—that can also cause the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I worked as a rehabilitation therapist, and I have seen incredible strides that people with injuries can make with access to appropriate rehabilitation. There is help and support for those who have posttraumatic stress disorder. As a nation, we must stand ready to support them. 
VOTER RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, with the Shelby County v. Holder decision, the Supreme Court effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act. At the time, Chief Justice John Roberts said that the key protections the Court removed from the act were, as he put it: ‘‘extraordinary measures to address an extraordinary problem.’’ Sadly and extraordinarily, many of those problems still exist. I would argue that the Voting Rights Act was extraordinarily successful. Since that decision, the Federal Court commented that a voter ID law in North Carolina didn’t stop fraud. Instead, the provisions that were struck down ‘‘target African Americans with almost surgical precision.’’ Courts found significant disenfranchisement caused by new laws in Wisconsin as well. Mr. Speaker, every American has a right and the freedom to cast their vote without interference. People have fought and bled for that right. We are in danger of going back to a time when those rights were cast aside. That is why it is time for Congress to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act to modernize the law, to put back in place provisions stripped from the Voting Rights Act, and to ensure that no State can discriminate by creating barriers to the ballot box. If we want to remain a nation that empowers its citizens, we need swift action on this bill. f 
PATRIOT WEEK (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, we need to get back to the core values that our Nation embraced 241 years ago. That is why this year I have reintroduced my Patriot Week resolution, H. Con. Res. 12, which creates a national week of appreciation for the brave individuals, documents, and values that define our Nation’s history to be taught in schools and honored in workplaces across America. Patriot Week would begin on the solemn anniversary of September 11 and end with Constitution Day on September 17. Mr. Speaker, our founding principles have been ignored and eroded. Society has seemingly lost interest in the longstanding history that made our country great. As we approach Independence Day, we must reflect on who we are as a nation and how we can improve what is good for generations to come. America has become too divided, and we must get back to the core values that make our country great. Just as immigrants learn the history of our country, high school seniors should be able to pass, at minimum, the same citizenship exam upon graduation. Ronald Reagan once said that ‘‘freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.’’ His words must serve as a wakeup call to every one of us today. I urge my colleagues to support Patriot Week, and I would like to take this opportunity to wish our Nation a happy and safe Independence Day. We are grateful for all those who serve to keep us safe at home, in our Nation’s Capital, and all over the world. f 
OPPOSING TRUMPCARE (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed that the Senate version of the Republican healthcare bill, TrumpCare, is even meaner and more heartless than the Housepassed version. It is so mean that already some Republican Senators have come out opposing even bringing this bill to the floor for debate. But, of course, that won’t be the end of it. We should beware of the backroom deals that will be attempted to get Republican Senators on board to move this terrible bill forward. But any amount of window dressing or backroom deals won’t change the basics. This bill will require Americans to pay higher costs. Don’t just look at premiums. Look at the outofpocket expenses that Americans will have to pay. It will go up for worse care and for less coverage. If you are age 50 to 65, get ready, because you will see an age tax. You will have to pay up to five times what younger, healthy Americans will pay. Of course, this bill, because it rewards those at the very top, steals from Medicare. It makes Medicare less sustainable. We ought to reject this legislation. We ought to do it now, and we ought to send that message to every Member of the U.S. Senate. 
RECOGNIZING LEXMARK’S EXCITING NEW PROGRAM TO TRAIN VETERANS (Mr. BARR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly recognize Lexmark International, a global leader in printing solutions headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, for its development of an innovative program for training U.S. veterans and soontobeseparated Active Duty personnel with the goal that they can become certified service technicians of Lexmark printers. The program, called the Lexmark Printer Service Training Partnership, is under the auspices of VALORR, the Veterans Association of Lexmark: Organized to Recognize and Respect. We all recognize that our veterans bring with them tremendous knowhow and a cando attitude, the ability to step into new fields and master them quickly. By completing the printer 
service training program, these veterans will be certified to service Lexmark printers worldwide. I am proud that my constituents at Lexmark have developed such a thoughtful program for veterans. I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing those companies and organizations going the extra mile for those who have served our Nation in uniform. 
MEDICAID CUTS (Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep misgivings about the recent healthcare proposals put forth by the Senate. This bill, like the American Health Care Act, proposes drastic cuts to Medicaid and would saddle my constituents and Americans with skyrocketing premiums and deductibles. We are placing our hardworking families and young children, our elderly, veterans, and Native Americans in harm’s way by making coverage unaffordable and unattainable. The cost of this legislation will be paid by those who can least afford it. Recent reports show that the cost of Medicaid cuts in this bill would cost Arizonans more than $7 billion. This means hundreds of thousands of people, including nursing home patients who rely on affordable, lifesaving coverage, will be kicked off their Medicaid coverage. From the beginning, these pieces of legislation have been crafted behind closed doors without input from doctors, nurses, and healthcare leaders. While we play partisan games, the health and wellbeing of our families, friends, and neighbors are at risk. If we want to get serious about fixing our healthcare system and bringing down costs, we must work together on bipartisan legislation. 
TRUMPCARE (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, this week, Senate Republicans are very likely to vote on a bill that would take away health insurance from 22 million Americans, people like Marcia and Grace Kohler in Boulder, Colorado. The Kohlers, like many other families, were able to have access to healthcare through the Affordable Care Act. At the age of 8
1⁄2, Marcia’s youngest daughter, Grace, was diagnosed with childhood leukemia. She endured 26 months of extensive treatments and several chemotherapy sessions per week. In Marcia’s own words: ‘‘Going through this process without the assistance of healthcare is unimaginable. It brings tears back to my own eyes.’’ We are simply not a nation that turns its back on our most vulnerable citizens. 39 percent of all children in this country are supported on Medicaid, 64 percent of nursing home residents, and 30 percent of adults with disabilities. I hope my colleagues in the Senate right now think of Grace and all those like her. I hope that they think about the millions of Americans that will have the rug pulled out from underneath them if they pass their cruel bill. For some it is a matter of debt or taxes, but for many it is simply a matter of life or death. f

Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made in order as original text. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. House Resolution 382 will ultimately drive down healthcare costs and make care more affordable to millions of Americans across the country. In 2017, we have had a conversation in America about how health insurance costs have drastically increased in the past 7 years. We need to fix our health insurance market, a task that House Members and Senators have been working hard on for the past few months, but if we are truly going to address outofcontrol health insurance costs, we need to start looking at the cost of supplying care itself. That is where H.R. 1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, plays a vital role. H.R. 1215 focuses on lowering the cost of care by placing checks and balances on the excessive and frivolous lawsuits faced by doctors and other healthcare providers. A GAO report found that rising litigation awards are responsible for skyrocketing medical professional liability premiums. Unfortunately, these premium costs are passed on to the patient and, in many cases, are passed on to American taxpayers. The reforms in H.R. 1215 will make care more affordable for patients and will improve access to care, especially for rural America. Over time, unending and excessive lawsuits have limited the amount of doctors nationwide, particularly in States that have not instituted their own reforms. With a string of frivolous lawsuits levied against our medical community, many Americans who would become doctors and practice in certain parts of the Nation simply decided against it. The reforms in H.R. 1215 will especially help rural and underserved urban communities, where quality healthcare can be difficult to access. Incentivizing medical professionals to serve in communities that might otherwise be overlooked should be one goal of our healthcare reform efforts. I know the healthcare challenges faced by so many in eastern Colorado, where access to quality care is sometimes limited. We need doctors who are willing to invest in these communities, but we need to empower these doctors by freeing them of frivolous and excessive lawsuits. Beyond just access to care, the growth of frivolous malpractice lawsuits has led to a change in the way care is provided. Many providers are forced to practice defensive medicine. In doing so, doctors order unnecessary, excessive diagnostics not because the patient needs them, but because the doctor attempts to avoid a frivolous lawsuit. The practice of defensive medicine increases costs for the patient without providing any discernible benefit. The legislation we are considering is key to increasing the affordability of care and the access to care for all Americans. This bill is supported by the American Hospital Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians. The American Medical Association has also voiced their support. But let me be clear: The bill before the House today does not limit access to justice for legitimately wronged or injured patients. It does not hamper a wronged patient from recovering damages for their injuries. The bill simply imposes a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, a provision that has worked well in California, where this legislation has already been successfully implemented and modeled for decades. But there is no cap on economic damages that a patient may incur in a malpractice situation, and the bill’s cap does not preempt any State law that otherwise caps any form of damages at amounts either higher or lower than the cap in H.R. 1215. The legislation also limits the contingency fees that lawyers can charge when bringing a malpractice case on behalf of a client. In other words, we don’t want to incentivize lawyers to push forward with illegitimate cases. We want patients who have been wronged to have access to a fair trial, where they walk home with the winnings in their own pocket, not their lawyer’s. H.R. 1215 builds on the successes of medical malpractice reforms in States like California and Texas. In these States, similar laws have increased access to affordable medical care. They have created an environment where doctors can focus on helping patients rather than spending time in endless litigation and dealing with threats from the trial bar. The legislation before us, while creating a uniform national playing field, protects State laws by allowing flexible reforms to be used at the discretion of States. State courts will still hear medical lawsuits as always. The reforms at hand today deal with care that was provided or subsidized by the Federal Government, including through a tax benefit. 
We must pass this legislation for the American taxpayer. The taxpayer doesn’t deserve to have their hard earned dollars simply end up in the pockets of trial lawyers due to frivolous lawsuits. That is why H.R. 1215 is a critically needed reform. Unlimited and opportunistic lawsuits help no one except trial lawyers. Consequently, our doctors have to increase their costs and practice expensive defensive medicine, costing patients and taxpayers. And when our physicians are impacted, so are we. Trial lawyers too often stand between patients and their doctors. With the looming threat of excessive, unending lawsuits, healthcare providers have to worry more about the trial lawyer at their door than the patient in their office. H.R. 1215 places important limits on these lawsuits so that the truly wronged are compensated without enriching trial lawyers at the same time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today, one that provides for consideration of the Protecting Access to Care Act. This bill would significantly alter how families and patients that are injured as a result of medical error are able to hold healthcare providers, facilities, or device makers accountable to make sure that that same thing doesn’t happen to other people. This bill decreases patient safety. It undermines the ability of people who are wrongfully injured by medical malpractice or faulty medical devices to be compensated for their injuries, and it violates the 10th Amendment to our Constitution, the rights reserved to the States. Before I turn to the merits, or lack thereof, of this bill, I want to discuss the process under which this bill came to the floor. The Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over this bill, had zero hearings on this legislation, heard from zero experts, and went straight to markup. Despite the overwhelming opposition to this legislation, the Judiciary Committee did not want to hear from groups like the American Bar Association, Patient Safety America, the National Disability Rights Network, or the National Protection Alliance. When I see the American Bar Association, who the committee refused to hear from—I know my colleague from Colorado is an attorney. I just want to inquire of my colleague from Colorado if he is a member of the American Bar Association, and I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BUCK. Proudly, no. Mr. POLIS. Okay. Well, that is the association which many attorneys, excepting, of course, my friend from Colorado, are a member of. The supporters of this bill point to its consideration in previous Congresses for hearings, but we have over 50 new Members who didn’t hear a word about this bill from any experts before it was rushed to the floor. We are considering this bill under a very restrictive rule. That means there were 24 amendments filed. This rule only allows the House to debate and vote on five of them. That means 19 of them, amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans, were simply just tossed out in the Rules Committee. That is what this rule does. If this rule were to pass, it would mean that the efforts of 19 Members to offer ideas to improve healthcare wouldn’t even be allowed to be debated or voted upon here on the floor of this House. It is no coincidence that eight amendments filed by Democrats, and not one Democratic amendment was made in order. Only 5 out of 24 ideas from Democrats and Republicans were made in order. One amendment filed by my colleague, Representative JACKSON LEE, would have provided an exception to the bill for any medicalrelated injury to a child, which seems like common sense. At least have a debate about it. If people disagree, let them disagree. Let’s have a vote. This rule continues this very closed process, where Democrats and Republicans are shut out of participating in the bills that appear fully formed without the opportunity for us to represent our districts and offer amendments to improve and make these bills better, to reduce costs, to improve the quality of care. What I wonder, Mr. Speaker, is: Where is the open process promised by Speaker RYAN? This Congress hasn’t even considered a single piece of legislation under an open rule, and we have had many, many bills brought to the floor under closed rules and without any committee hearings. But, you know, I am beginning to not be surprised so much anymore because secretiveness seems to be the standard that Republicans are setting in this Congress. How the Republicans have handled their healthcare bill from start through now is a perfect example of the closeddoor, secretive process that has become, tragically, the standard operating procedure for this Congress. The Republican healthcare bill will increase healthcare costs, provide less coverage—22 million fewer people will be covered—increase costs for those who are lucky enough to keep their current coverage, and reduce access to healthcare for the American people. It puts a burden on small businesses, on the middle class, on rural healthcare providers, while handing hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to big corporations and special interests. TrumpCare is a billionaire’s tax cut disguised as a healthcare bill, and it will be one of the largest transfers of wealth from the middle class and the working families to the top 1 percent of Americans. Effectively, it is removing benefits from people in rural counties and cities across our country and giving those tax cuts mostly to people in New York and Hollywood. That is what Republicans are delivering with this bill. When the American people were finally given the chance to see the Senate’s healthcare legislation, the American people overwhelmingly rejected it. Only 16 percent of the American people approve of the plan. Democrats oppose it; Republicans oppose it; independents oppose it. The Congressional Budget Office’s recent score of the bill says that coverage will significantly decrease under this bill and that the costs of deductibles for patients will go up. Patients will have to spend more out of pocket, those that are lucky enough to even have insurance after this cruel bill. But there is still time to stop it, and I call upon my colleagues to prevent this bill from moving forward. The bill that Republicans are trying to ram through Congress is not truly meant to make improvements to our healthcare system but to take money away from the middle class and working families and put it into the pockets of a very few people who benefit from the tax cuts under this bill: for people making millions of dollars a year. This bill makes it harder for middle income families and for lowincome families to access quality, affordable healthcare, makes it harder for individuals who have preexisting conditions or have genetic disorders or long term diseases from accessing lifesaving medical attention, and cuts critical healthcare services for disabled children in schools that many of our school districts rely on. And they want to do this all with a closed process. I offered three amendments to improve healthcare in our Education and the Workforce Committee. All were defeated on a partisan vote. b1245 Every Republican voted not to allow those. No Democrat, as far as I know— certainly not me—has been invited to present our ideas to Republican leadership or President Trump. Democrats have lots of ideas to improve the Affordable Care Act. I am sure many Republicans do, too. Those ideas are not reflected whatsoever in this bill or in the closed process that prohibits Republicans and Democrats from even offering our suggestions to improve this bill. So, here we are, debating another piece of healthcare legislation that did not go through an open process. Democrats were shut out of the amendment process completely. This bill would make it more difficult for victims of medical malpractice to seek or receive compensation for their injuries. It is inconsistent with the 10th Amendment, which reserves these rights to the States that are not enumerated in the 
Constitution, and unlike the Democrats’ approach to medical malpractice reform in the Affordable Care Act, which provided funding for pilot programs in the States to reduce the risk of medical malpractice liability consistent with the 10th Amendment. Many constitutional experts—I would add, many conservative constitutional experts—believe that this approach is unconstitutional because of the 10th Amendment. We have learned that this bill does not actually protect access to healthcare but, instead, undermines a Statebased tort system, making it more difficult for patients to be compensated from bad actors. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter signed by over 60 national and State organizations opposed to H.R. 1215. 
JUNE12, 2017. Re Groups Urge You to Vote NO on H.R. 1215. Hon. Paul Ryan, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : The undersigned consumer, health, labor, legal and public interest groups strongly oppose H.R. 1215: The ‘‘Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017.’’ This bill would limit the legal rights of injured patients and families of those killed by negligent health care. The bill’s sweeping scope covers not only cases involving medical malpractice, but also cases involving unsafe drugs and nursing home abuse and neglect. Even if H.R. 1215 applied only to doctors and hospitals, recent studies clearly establish that its provisions would lead to more deaths and injuries, and increased health care costs due to a ‘‘broad relaxation of care.’’ Add to this nursing home and pharmaceutical industry liability limitations, significantly weakening incentives for these industries to act safely, and untold numbers of additional death, injuries and costs are inevitable, and unacceptable. The latest statistics show that medical errors, most of which are preventable, are the third leading cause of death in America. This intolerable situation is perhaps all the more shocking because we already know about how to fix much of this problem. Congress should focus on improving patient safety and reducing deaths and injuries, not insulating negligent providers from accountability, harming patients and saddling taxpayers with the cost, as H.R. 1215 would do. For example, this bill would establish a permanent acrosstheboard $250,000 ‘‘cap’’ on compensation for ‘‘noneconomic damages’’ in medical malpractice cases. Such caps are unfair and discriminatory. For example, University of Buffalo Law Professor Lucinda Finley has written, ‘‘certain injuries that happen primarily to women are compensated predominantly or almost exclusively through noneconomic loss damages. These injuries include sexual or reproductive harm, pregnancy loss, and sexual assault injuries.’’ Also, ‘‘[J]uries consistently award women more in noneconomic loss damages than men . . . [A]ny cap on noneconomic loss damages will deprive women of a much greater proportion and amount of a jury award than men. Noneconomic loss damage caps therefore amount to a form of discrimination against women and contribute to unequal access to justice or fair compensation for women.’’ Other provisions in H.R. 1215 are just as problematic. The proposed federal statute of limitations, more restrictive than a majority of state laws, lacks complete logic from a deficit reduction angle since its only impact would be to cut off meritorious claims, forcing patients to turn to the government for care. The bill would repeal joint and several liability even though the Congressional Budget Office says this could increase, not lower, costs. H.R. 1215 would overturn traditional state common law and would be an unprecedented interference with the work of state court judges and juries in civil cases. Its oneway preemption of state law provisions that protect patients (there are some exceptions) makes clear that the intent of this legislation is not to make laws uniform in the 50 states. Rather, it is a carefully crafted bill to provide relief and protections for the insurance, medical and drug industries, at the expense of patient safety. We urge you to oppose H.R. 1215: The ‘‘Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017.’’ Thank you.

Mr. POLIS. Some of the groups are the Gerontological Advanced Practice Nurses Association, Justice in Aging, Long Term Care Community Coalition, National Education Association, National Consumers League, National Disability Rights Network, Public Citizen, Public Justice, and many, many other great organizations. I hope my friend from Colorado is a member of at least two or three of these wonderful organizations. I will furnish the entire list to him. This bill preempts State tort law that has been developed over the last 200 years and is contrary to the 10th Amendment of our Constitution. It imposes an arbitrary cap on the amount of noneconomic damages a victim can collect under a Federal law coopting the ability of States to do their own medical malpractice laws and hamstringing them with regard to the reforms that they can undertake. In fact, capping damages also increases taxpayer spending. According to a joint study by Northwestern University and the University of Illinois, they found that capping economic damages actually increases Medicare part B spending. I would point out another horrible feature of the cruel Republican healthcare bill is that it guts the Medicare trust fund and would lead to Medicare becoming insolvent sooner rather than later by draining the Medicare trust fund of over $100 billion. That is another aspect of this bill. No wonder they didn’t want us to see it, Mr. Speaker. No wonder they kept it in a locked closet from even Republicans who were allegedly writing it, like KENBUCKand my friend, Senator GARDNER , who was on the committee writing it and who later said he hadn’t seen it. No wonder it was hidden, when you find out it actually leads to Medicare insolvency sooner, when you find that it throws 22 million people off the insurance that they already have, when you find out it raises rates for those who are lucky enough to maintain their insurance, when you find it takes money out of our schools, when you find that it risks throwing our elderly out of their nursing homes who rely on Medicaid. This bill is a symptom of a problem. I am not a doctor; my friend from Colorado is not a doctor; but when I ask my doctor what you do when there are 
symptoms, it is treat the underlying cause. Let’s do that. This bill doesn’t do that. This Republican Senate bill that throws people off insurance doesn’t do that. Let’s begin a process where we get ideas from Democrats and Republicans to work together to reduce costs in healthcare, to expand coverage in healthcare, and to improve the quality of healthcare for American families. This bill is not focused on protecting patients. It increases the risk to patients. It drains Medicare of additional money. This bill will not reduce costs to patients. In fact, no healthcare bill being debated in Congress right now actually improves patient care or reduces costs to patients. Those should be two pillars, two goals of healthcare reform: Can we reduce costs, and can we improve patient care? This bill risks making patient care worse in an unconstitutional way. The Senate bill actually will increase costs to patients, increase deductibles, make more people lose their insurance, make you pay more for insurance you already have if you are one of the people who is lucky enough not to lose it under the cruel Republican bill. Instead of politicizing and polarizing access to healthcare—literally a life anddeath issue for American families—let’s work together to find solutions that reduce costs, increase coverage, and improve care. The Senate Republican healthcare bill meets none of those three critical criteria that the American people demand in healthcare reform: reducing costs, increasing coverage, and improving the quality of care for ourselves and for our loved ones. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I know my friend from Colorado did not mean to insult me when he referred to me as a lawyer, but I want to make a quick distinction. I spent 25 years as a prosecutor, not a lawyer. Prosecutors put people in prison and make the world safe for all of us; lawyers get people out of prison and make the world less safe for all of us. I want to make that distinction. Mr. POLIS. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BUCK. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. POLIS. Prosecutors are lawyers as well. So I just wanted to be clear that it is not an insult. Being an attorney is a fine profession. There are some attorneys on both sides, both defending as well prosecuting criminals, but they are both attorneys. I just wanted to clarify that. Mr. BUCK. Reclaiming my time, do not tell prosecutors that they are merely lawyers. To be a prosecutor is a higher standard. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ). Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am not an attorney either, Mr. Speaker. I am a physician. As a matter of fact, I am an obstetrician. I think, of all the professions impacted by malpractice issues, perhaps, Mr. Speaker, obstetricians have been the most impacted. I remember going back as a medical student and trying to figure out what type of doctor I wanted to become. My wife and I were blessed somewhere in there to have our first child. I remember when that little girl was given to me and I heard her cry, it was maybe the greatest single moment of my life. As a young medical student, I was very impressed and said: That is what I want to do. I want to bring babies into the world and have that moment when I get to give a baby to a mom and she looks at that baby and it is just a very special moment. It is just the most agape love I have ever seen, a mom with a perfect heart towards that little baby. I wanted to do that. So I started telling my professors I wanted to be an obstetrician. Every professor I met said: Don’t do it. You are going to get sued. Malpractice prices are screaming. You are not going to like that job anymore. No one wants to go into obstetrics. Well, guess what? My professors were right. I did it anyway. The average obstetrician gets sued between three and four times in their career. Malpractice remains the biggest deterrent of physicians choosing to go into obstetrics. The average obstetrician has to spend 2 to 3 months every year just to pay for their malpractice insurance. I am very blessed. Over 20 years ago, Kansas undertook similar tort reform as this, and our malpractice costs have stabilized. My malpractice insurance was pretty much the same 20 years after we enacted the legislation to curb some of these costs. I think it will be true for me to say that my friends that are obstetricians in other States without malpractice tort reform, their premiums are often three times higher than ours in Kansas. We have seen this work very, very well in Kansas. The good news is that this legislation will not impact any of that work as well. I very much am in favor of this malpractice tort reform and how it is going to impact healthcare. I predict that this will help lower premium costs some 3 to 4 percent when enacted. Malpractice is a huge cost of the current cost of healthcare. This is a first step of many that Republicans are encouraging or want to implement to start lowering those costs of premiums. Small Business Association members were here in D.C. just 2 months ago. When they walked out of that meeting, I was expecting them to come back and tell me their concerns were mostly regulatory concerns, but their number one concern was the cost of healthcare premiums. This is a small step. If we can lower their healthcare costs 3 to 4 percent, this is a great, great opportunity for us to help them out. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this bill. I encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to support this bill. It should be bipartisan support for this legislation that will help drive healthcare costs down. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ). Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I think a couple of points, before I get to the main portion of my remarks, that the manager of the bill threw out need to be addressed. First of all, my wife is a prosecutor. I like prosecutors, but they are lawyers. I was a trial lawyer until December 31 of last year. Guess what? We sue drunk drivers. We sue for people who get hurt when it is not their own fault. I come from a State where contributory negligence is the law. So I appreciate the reverence you hold prosecutors in—I do, as well—but we are all lawyers. I also want to point out that, while there may be people on the floor who are not lawyers, you can’t honestly believe this bill gives you equal access to justice, and here is why: You have a cap on noneconomic damages. So a person who is injured by a doctor and a person who receives the exact same injuries from some other tort have two different recoveries that they can reach. One is capped; one is not. That is not equal justice, in my judgment, under the law. In addition, you all are the probusiness party, yet you all want to get into how people contract with one another. I would suggest that is inconsistent with your probusiness approach. Mr. Speaker, what this bill really underlies is a fundamental mistrust for our constituents. Think about it. Juries are made up of our constituents. What you are really worried about is that your constituents are not going to get it right when they are sitting in that jury box and making decisions. Your constituents are wise enough to send me and 435 of us here to the Congress to make decisions about trillion dollar budgets, yet you don’t trust them to sit in the jury box and make the very important decisions for their fellow citizens when they are injured. Mr. Speaker, I want to suggest that this bill clearly violates the spirit of the Seventh Amendment, the right to trial by jury, by putting these limitations on the jury, by putting limitations on access to justice. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is reminded that Members are to direct all remarks to the Chair. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I was glad my colleague pointed out that it violates the Seventh Amendment. Now we add that to the 10th 
Amendment. So there are actually two Amendments. I am not even an attorney, but I know this violates two Amendments to our Constitution. That is pretty impressive for one bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1215. My Republican colleagues seem to have a fixation with caps. In their healthcare bill, they slash Medicaid and, for the first time in its history, cap Federal funding. The result: hospital closures, reimbursement and staffing cuts, reduced access, and lower quality. Now, in this bill, they want to impose another cap, a cap on noneconomic damages for injured healthcare consumers. So who will be hurt? It will be people like the 76yearold woman whose tailbone had to be removed because her bed sores went untreated for 12 days or an 81yearold resident who died because her ventilator was dislodged, alarms sounded, and no one responded. How about the family of a 92yearold man who died after suffering from malnutrition and dehydration and was found with live insects in his eyes and mouth? How do we put a $250,000 value on those injured? Besides, this is a solution looking for a problem. There is no medical malpractice lawsuit crisis. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of claims dropped more than 40 percent and the amount paid fell 23 percent. But we do face a medical crisis. Nearly half a million Americans die every year from preventable medical errors, and many more are permanently injured. This bill does nothing to solve that problem. Instead, it just takes away the right of the injured consumers. b1300 And if you believe that average Americans should not be barred from the justice system as they seek to hold wrongdoers accountable, then you must oppose this bill. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I just want to make one point. I have heard a number of times now that this bill is a solution searching for a problem or it does nothing to help our underlying cost. The Congressional Budget Office, the very office that my friend relies on for the most recent estimate of those that will decide not to seek insurance under the Senate healthcare bill, has estimated that this bill will save taxpayers $50 billion over 10 years and reduce medical malpractice insurance premiums by 25 percent to 30 percent. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to inquire of my friend from Colorado whether recognizing those savings is in fact a Federal responsibility or a State responsibility. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I will remind my friend from Colorado that the very $250,000 cap that we are talking about in this bill is the same cap that has been adopted by the Colorado State Legislature. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, exactly. What I would further add, then, is whose prerogative is it to institute this kind of cap: States like our own State of Colorado, which has that cap? Or Washington, D.C. insiders behind closed doors? I yield to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I would remind my friend again that the States that have adopted any cap—it could be $250,000, it could be $500,000, it could be $1 million in noneconomic damage caps—will not be affected by this bill. This bill only affects those States that have no caps, and it is Federal money that is being used to pay for these. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, this effectively coops States and forces other States to do the same thing that my colleague’s and my State of Colorado has already done. It goes beyond that as well. Under the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, this should be a power reserved for the States. Mr. Speaker, I would like to shed light on a serious issue facing millions of students nationally and in my home State of Colorado. Every day, 50 million students and 3 million teachers face significant health and safety threats due to inadequate school facilities. I have heard about many in Colorado, school gyms that are closed down because their roofs are falling in, staggering statistics that disproportionately affect highpoverty schools, particularly urban and rural schools, and many schools serving a high percentage of minority students. Today we have a chance to address this rampant inequality throughout our school districts and to create jobs in the process. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative BOBBY SCOTT’s Rebuild America’s Schools Act, H.R. 2475, which I am also a proud cosponsor of. Mr. SCOTT’s legislation would invest $100 billion in the physical and digital infrastructure needs of our schools, creating nearly 2 million jobs and creating the education infrastructure we need for the 21st century. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DONOVAN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the distinguished ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, to discuss our proposal. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS) for proposing this amendment. The Rebuild America’s Schools Act would help ensure that each of our Nation’s 50 million public school students, taught by 3 million teachers, will have access to safe, healthy, and highquality learning facilities and internet access sufficient for digital learning in the classroom. This bold proposal would create nearly 2 million jobs, improve student learning, and revitalize under resourced communities. The Rebuild America’s Schools Act is a win for students, families, workers, and the economy; and any responsible infrastructure proposal put forth by Congress should include a bold investment in our Nation’s public schools. Mr. Speaker, this bill was introduced on the 63rd anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education because, despite the promise of Brown, our public school facilities remain largely separate and woefully unequal. Last year, on the 62nd anniversary of Brown, Ranking Member CONYERS and I unveiled the findings of a GAO report that found that more students are attending schools highly segregated by race and class. Now, that most recent GAO report examining the state of our public schools’ infrastructure saw that lowincome and minority students are served by poor and inadequate school facilities. If we are to fully achieve the promise of Brown, then no child should remain in a classroom with a leaking roof or a broken heating system. All students should have equitable access to science labs or spaces for highquality career and technical educational programs. Mr. Speaker, 12 States do not invest any money in capital construction projects in public schools, leaving responsibility of ensuring highquality classrooms up to localities and local property taxes, which virtually guarantees inequitable funding between high and lowincome districts. This bill targets Federal funding for school infrastructure to districts and school buildings with the greatest need for improvement to their physical and digital infrastructure, which would be an important step in fulfilling the promise of Brown. All too often, when Congress talks about infrastructure investment, we speak only about investments in roads, bridges, and other public buildings. Public schools are often left out of the conversation, but schools must be part of that conversation on infrastructure. The Rebuild America’s Schools Act will ensure safe drinking water in schools, prevent instructional materials like textbooks from being ruined 
as a result of broken heating and air conditioning systems, and improve air quality that students breathe in the schools. It will bring access to digital learning for more than 11 million students in nearly 20,000 schools who do not already have it. Finally, the bill would mean highquality jobs for nearly 2 million pipefitters, construction workers, and other hardworking Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to defeat the previous question so we can debate and pass the Rebuild America’s Schools Act. We owe it to America’s students and hardworking families. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I want to inquire of my friend from Colorado, he mentioned when he was introducing the gentleman from Virginia that there are schools that are closing because gym roofs are falling in. I know a number of very generous individuals that would like to contribute. Does the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS) have the names of any of those schools for us? I yield to the gentleman. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to supply those. To be clear, the entire school doesn’t close, just the gym closes. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I do have further speakers. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ). Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Rebuilding America’s Schools Act. Every day, students attend schools that put their health and safety at risk. The average school building is nearly 50 years old, and teachers and children struggle to learn in classrooms without heat, leaking ceilings, and no working internet. Mr. Speaker, our children deserve better. Research shows that poor school facility conditions impact teaching and learning, and disproportionately plague schools that serve lowincome and minority students all throughout America. Regardless of their ZIP Code, all children should have access to a quality education, and no child should have to learn in an unsafe or dilapidated environment. The Rebuilding America’s Schools Act would provide critically needed investments in Las Vegas and rural Nevada to improve our school infrastructure, helping teachers teach and children learn. President Trump has repeatedly promised to rebuild our Nation’s infrastructure. Passing the Rebuilding America’s Schools Act would be the first step in making this happen. We must make an investment in our future generation to guarantee their shot at success. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, when we think about healthcare, we all think about, of course, first and foremost, ourselves and our loved ones and our families. As Representatives of 750,000 people, we also think about constituents that we know, that we have met, for whom healthcare is literally a lifeanddeath situation. I think of my friend Debbie and her son Sam. Debbie’s son Sam was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was 4 years old. He is now 20 or 21 or so. He was a healthy kid, he ate healthy food, an active young child. As Debbie pointed out to me, it is not that anybody chooses an illness or a condition, the illness chooses you. Through the luck of the draw, her son Sam is afflicted with type 1 diabetes. Like many people with autoimmune diseases, it was not poor choices, it was not lifestyle decisions that gave him the disease or even increased his risk of the disease. He was dealt a bad hand with an autoimmune gene that his family didn’t even know that they had. Because of that, Sam has a costly disease. Thankfully, one that can be treated, if not cured, but he has a costly disease for the rest of his life. There is no cure, and the cost of insulin and other lifesaving technologies is very high. Sam has what here in Washington people call a preexisting condition. That is what we are talking about. Without insurance, the cost per month would go from about $400, which Debbie and her husband are able to afford and put together for Sam, to $2,500 a month, which they could not possibly afford to do. Sam is now 20, and because of the Affordable Care Act, he will be on the family’s health insurance until he is 26. That is, if the family can keep their health insurance. The family worries, like so many others, that they might be one of those 22 million families that loses coverage under this Republican healthcare bill. It is a lot of families. It is not going to be any of my colleagues’ families. My colleagues have a government health insurance plan from serving in the House of Representatives. Their congressional staff has access to the exchanges, just like we do, to buy insurance. But 22 million people in each and every one of our districts, 435 districts in this country, in each and every one of our districts, not dozens of people, not hundreds of people, but thousands of real people like Deb and Sam, like a story I shared earlier of Marcia and Grace, will actually lose their healthcare. They will be forced to give up their home, become insolvent, go bankrupt, or die. A choice that no American should have to face. Mr. Speaker, the bill under consideration today is one of many that didn’t go through regular order. There were no hearings. Closed process. They cut out all the Democratic amendments that we had to improve the bill. That is how the Republicans have been handling healthcare legislation this Congress. That is why this approach isn’t working. It is why this approach is so unpopular. No hearings, shut Members out of the legislative process, bring a bill to the floor that was hidden in some closet, written in secret, widely unpopular, throwing people off healthcare insurance, raising rates for those who are luckily enough to keep their insurance. This bill is not aimed at protecting patients. This bill before us and the Senate Republican healthcare bill make it more difficult for Americans to deal with reallife healthcare issues that were dealt over the course of life for ourselves and our families. We need a reset, Mr. Speaker. We need to reset and start real discussions about improving healthcare. How could Democrats or Republicans work together to reduce costs? Democrats and Republicans should work together to expand coverage. We shouldn’t be talking about whether 22 million people lose coverage or 10 million people lose coverage or 5 million people lose coverage. Let’s talk about 5 million people gaining coverage, 10 million people gaining coverage. Let’s reset and frame the discussion about how more people can have access to healthcare. The problem we are trying to solve is not how can we get less Americans to have access to healthcare. That is why this bill is so unpopular. If that is the problem Republicans are trying to solve, they solved it in this bill. Less Americans will have healthcare. But that is not the problem that the American people want us to address in Congress. More people with healthcare, and people want to save money. They want their insurance rates to be lower, their deductibles to be lower. They want to save money. There are some lowhanging fruit in terms of costs in healthcare, administrative overhead, wasteful and duplicative spending, that we can go after together. These are good ideas, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican. One of the amendments that I proposed was pricing transparency. One of the problems in the healthcare marketplace is nobody knows how much anybody charges. Different insurers and private payers pay widely different amounts for the exact same procedure. Let’s at least disclose the pricing and have transparency so market mechanisms will work to pull down rates by promoting competition. b1315 By not allowing the market into healthcare, we are creating inefficiencies and raising rates. Let’s come together on that. Let’s come together around a lot of good ideas that Democrats and Republicans have bills on and have amendments on. But, no, they are not even allowed to be debated and not even allowed to be voted on either on 
this bill, in which every Democratic amendment was shut down, or in the Republican healthcare bill, in which no process was allowed for Democrats to improve the bill. We have never even been invited into the secret backroom to figure out what was being debated. We didn’t even see the bill until it was presented fully formed days before it had to be voted on, affecting the lives of 22 million Americans, oneeighth of our entire economy, without any hearings, without any expert testimony, and only days to digest this hundredpage bill. So look, let’s reset, let’s work together to bring down costs, expanding coverage and improving quality, and create a work product in healthcare reform that we can be proud of as Republicans, as Democrats, and as Americans; one in which Debbie and her son, Sam, don’t have to worry about giving up their home or facing death; or one in which Grace and her mother are able to live out their lives without worrying about their preexisting condition. Mr. Speaker, I call upon my colleagues to reject this closed rule, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend’s newfound sense of bipartisanship. The Affordable Care Act was passed without a single Republican vote in the House, without a single Republican vote in the Senate, and without any concern of Republican thoughts about how healthcare should be run in this country. Now that the Affordable Care Act is, in fact, failing; now that we have over 90 counties in America that have zero health insurers to choose from in the individual market; and now that we see the Affordable Care Act in a death spiral, all of a sudden, we are concerned about the bipartisanship and how to fix the problem. We have heard zero amendments in the past 6 years to the Affordable Care Act that would have, in fact, improved the Affordable Care Act from the other side of the aisle while they had the President in the White House, and now, all of a sudden, we are looking for bipartisanship and solutions. We will find that bipartisanship and those solutions in the future. Mr. Speaker, if we truly want affordable healthcare in this country, then we need to address the cost of supplying care. H.R. 1215 strikes at the heart of skyrocketing medical care. By limiting frivolous and unending lawsuits, doctors can focus less on the courtroom and more on the patient in the operating room. The reforms made by H.R. 1215 will be especially important for rural America and underserved urban America. Doctors will be able to afford to live and practice in these communities, providing the attentive and responsive care that all Americans deserve, not just Americans who live a few miles from a major hospital. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. I know Democrats and Republicans have different policy approaches to reforming our healthcare system, but this legislation has already been implemented by Democrats in the State of California, where it has proven successful. Now we have the chance to apply this approach more broadly, in a way that will help millions of Americans. This effort has been bipartisan in the past and should be bipartisan today. Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this bill, Representative STEVE KING. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the resolution, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the underlying bill. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule governing debate of H.R. 1215, the ‘‘Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017’’ and the underlying bill. I oppose the rule for H.R. 1215, the ‘‘Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017’’ for the following reasons: There were twentyfive amendments proposed by colleagues from both sides of the aisle. Only five of those amendments were made in order. What did all five of those amendments have in common? These amendments were all submitted by my Republican counterparts. The rule for this bill incorporates none of the amendments offered by my Democratic colleagues. Mr. Speaker, that exclusion is problematic. The amendments not made in order reflect the crippling partisanship of the House majority. I also oppose the underlying bill on the merits, because it limits noneconomic damages to a mere $250,000, which if enacted, would have a disproportionately adverse impact on women, the poor, and other vulnerable groups. When given the opportunity, members refused to incorporate an amendment that would increase that cap to reflect the cost of inflation and a concern for the humane treatment of those individuals affected by medical malpractice. H.R. 1215 provides immunity for health care providers who dispense defective or dangerous pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Finally, I oppose the bill, because it creates an excessively short statute of limitations period, makes it harder for victims to obtain adequate legal representation, and imposes the risk of loss on victims rather than wrongdoers. Mr. Speaker, there are numerous examples of people who have suffered at the hands of medical providers and whose lives will never be the same. Consider the case of Olivia, an exceptionally bright high school senior from Santa Monica, California, who had gained early acceptance to Smith College in Massachusetts. She never made it to Smith College, because after a medical procedure was completed and while Olivia was still under anesthesia, a fellowintraining pulled the catheter causing Olivia’s vital signs to plummet. Hospital staff waited more than ten minutes to resuscitate her, but it was far too late for Olivia. She passed away, and her promising future disappeared. This tragedy never should have happened. Mr. Speaker, instead of wasting time on this giveaway to special interests, we should be improving the Affordable Care Act, and opposing any bill that would leave over twenty million Americans uninsured, and investigating Russian involvement in our democratic processes. For these reasons, I oppose the rule and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 382 O FFERED BY  MR. POLIS At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2475) to provide for the longterm improvement of public school facilities, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 2475. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to 
yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 497) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain public lands in San Bernardino County, California, to the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District, and to accept in return certain exchanged nonpublic lands, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 497 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act’’. 
In this Act: (1) CONSERVATION DISTRICT .—The term ‘‘Conservation District’’ means the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District, a political subdivision of the State of California. (2) NONFEDERAL LAND .—The term ‘‘nonFederal Land’’ means the approximately 310 acres of land owned by the Conservation District generally depicted as ‘‘SBVWCD to BLM’’ on the Map. (3) MAP.—The term ‘‘Map’’ means the map titled ‘‘Santa Ana River Wash Land Exchange’’ and dated September 3, 2015. (4) NONFEDERAL EXCHANGE PARCEL .—The term ‘‘nonFederal exchange parcel’’ means the approximately 59 acres of land owned by the Conservation District generally depicted as ‘‘SBVWCD Equalization Land’’ on the Map and is to be conveyed to the United States if necessary to equalize the fair market values of the lands otherwise to be exchanged. (5) FEDERAL EXCHANGE PARCEL .—The term ‘‘Federal exchange parcel’’ means the approximately 90 acres of Federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management generally depicted as ‘‘BLM Equalization Land to SBVWCD’’ on the Map and is to be conveyed to the Conservation District if necessary to equalize the fair market values of the lands otherwise to be exchanged. (6) FEDERAL LAND .—The term ‘‘Federal land’’ means the approximately 327 acres of Federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management generally depicted as ‘‘BLM Land to SBVWCD’’ on the Map. (7) SECRETARY .—The term ‘‘Secretary’’ means the Secretary of the Interior. 
(a) E XCHANGE AUTHORIZED .—Notwithstanding the land use planning requirements of sections 202, 210, and 211 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1712, 1720– 21), subject to valid existing rights, and conditioned upon any equalization payment necessary under section 206(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(b)), and subsection (b) of this Act, as soon as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, if the Conservation District offers to convey the exchange land to the United States, the Secretary shall— (1) convey to the Conservation District all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the Federal land, and any such portion of the Federal exchange parcel as may be required to equalize the values of the lands exchanged; and (2) accept from the Conservation District a conveyance of all right, title, and interest of the Conservation District in and to the nonFederal land, and any such portion of the nonFederal exchange parcel as may be required to equalize the values of the lands exchanged. (b) EQUALIZATION PAYMENT .—To the extent an equalization payment is necessary under section 206(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716), the amount of such equalization payment shall first be made by way of inkind transfer of such portion of the Federal exchange parcel to the Conservation District, or transfer of such portion of the non Federal exchange parcel to the United States, as the case may be, as may be necessary to equalize the fair market values of the exchanged properties. The fair market value of the Federal exchange parcel or nonFederal exchange parcel, 
as the case may be, shall be credited against any required equalization payment. To the extent such credit is not sufficient to offset the entire amount of equalization payment so indicated, any remaining amount of equalization payment shall be treated as follows: (1) If the equalization payment is to equalize values by which the Federal land exceeds the nonFederal land and the credited value of the nonFederal exchange parcel, Conservation District may make the equalization payment to the United States, notwithstanding any limitation regarding the amount of the equalization payment under section 206(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716). In the event Conservation District opts not to make the indicated equalization payment, the exchange shall not proceed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan, commonsense piece of legislation, the Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act. This bill reflects a compromise negotiated at the grassroots level among the cities, county, mining companies, wildlife agencies, and water organizations for over two decades in the Upper Santa Ana Wash area. The bill simply authorizes a land exchange of 327 acres of Bureau of Land Management land for 310 acres of land currently owned by the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District. This exchange facilitates the implementation of the broader Upper Santa Ana Wash Land Management and Habitat Conservation Plan, which identifies opportunities to expand existing aggregate mining operations to support new infrastructure developments; enhance water storage for the surrounding communities; and establish protected habitat for certain threatened and endangered plants and species. After the exchange, the Bureau of Land Management will use the land to protect critical habitat and will enhance the region’s water conservation and storage efforts by recharging more than 77 water basins. The land acquired by the Water Conservation District, which is currently adjacent to two aggregate mines, will allow local mining companies to expand and create greater efficiency in their current mining operations. The companies estimate that this small exchange will result in approximately $8.5 million in new infrastructure projects and a $36 million increase in annual payrolls from the new sites. This bill is supported by a wide variety of stakeholders in my district, including the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District, the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, San Bernardino County, the city of Highland, California, the city of Redlands, California, CEMEX, the Endangered Habitats League, Robertson’s Ready Mix, and Inland Action. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 497 authorizes a land exchange in California between the San Bernardino Valley Conservation District and the Bureau of Land Management. After 15 years, stakeholders have finalized the habitat conservation plan for the Santa Ana River Wash that balances the needs of endangered wildlife with regional economic development. This is a stellar example of the Endangered Species Act at work, and I commend Representative COOKfor his work on this bill. This land exchange is a key component of the Habitat Conservation Plan and a winwin for all parties. It will help protect important wildlife habitat while allowing the conservation district to increase water storage capacity and direct mining activity into the appropriate areas. So again, this is exactly how the Endangered Species Act should work. It is something we should all support. This is a good bill, and I urge swift adoption by the House. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ). Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act introduced by my Republican colleague and regional partner, Colonel PAULCOOK. The Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act is the final step, as he mentioned, to complete the transfer of land between the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District and the Bureau of Land Management, known as the BLM. This legislation allows the BLM and the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District to trade parcels of land which will benefit both the BLM and the conservation district. This land exchange will empower mining companies, Robertson’s Ready Mix, and CEMEX, which sit on land managed by the BLM, to increase efficiency. And as the gentleman mentioned, by increasing that efficiency, these local mining companies will produce aggregate that will support numerous infrastructure projects and approximately $36 million in annual payroll from this site alone. Additionally, the land exchange creates 59 acres of land for the conservation district to use for conservation purposes to protect endangered plants and species and for recharging water in more than 70 basins. The wash plan has been an ongoing project since the late 1980s, when it was a proposal from the cities of Highland and Redlands. As the former mayor of Redlands, I worked on this project at the local level. Years, and actually decades, of studies and committee reports have culminated in this final presentation of the Upper Santa Ana River Wash Plan. The Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act moves this decadeslong process forward, which will 
allow San Bernardino County to take advantage of critical economic and environmental benefits. After years of working on this project at the local level and listening to constituents and local stakeholders’ comments and questions, I can confidently say that this land exchange is widely supported. I have received letters of support from two mining companies affected by the transfer, the County of San Bernardino, the city of Highland, the city of Redlands, the San Bernardino Valley Conservation District, a local chapter of the Habitat League, and Inland Action, which is an organization of regional stakeholders that promote economic growth in the Inland Empire. This bill is a smart bipartisan plan that will help us support our local economy and protect the environment. It is a victory for all involved, and I offer my complete support and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act. I want to commend Representative COOK again. He has been a regional leader on this issue. He has been a colleague. We have worked on many of these issues that border our two districts. He has been incredibly thoughtful in his approach to this. He has done a yeoman’s work with his staff in carrying forward this bill, and it is always a pleasure to work with my colleague. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, obviously, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 497, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
TERROR LAKE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT UPPER HIDDEN BASIN DIVERSION AUTHORIZATION Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 220) to authorize the expansion of an existing hydroelectric project, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 220 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. TERROR LAKE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT UPPER HIDDEN BASIN DIVERSION AUTHORIZATION. 
(a) D EFINITIONS .—In this section: (1) COMMISSION .—The term ‘‘Commission’’ means the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. (2) TERROR LAKE HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT .— The term ‘‘Terror Lake Hydroelectric Project’’ means the project identified in section 1325 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3212), and which is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project number 2743. (3) UPPER HIDDEN BASIN DIVERSION EXPAN SION.—The term ‘‘Upper Hidden Basin Diversion Expansion’’ means the expansion of the Terror Lake Hydroelectric Project as generally described in Exhibit E to the Upper Hidden Basin Grant Application dated July 2, 2014, and submitted to the Alaska Energy Authority Renewable Energy Fund Round VIII by Kodiak Electric Association, Inc. (b) AUTHORIZATION .—The licensee for the Terror Lake Hydroelectric Project may occupy not more than 20 acres of Federal land to construct, operate, and maintain the Upper Hidden Basin Diversion Expansion without further authorization of the Secretary of the Interior or under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.). (c) SAVINGS CLAUSE .—The Upper Hidden Basin Diversion Expansion shall be subject to appropriate terms and conditions included in an amendment to a license issued by the Commission pursuant to the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.), including section 4(e) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 797(e)), following an environmental review by the Commission under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ). Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, this legislation, H.R. 220, allows for the expansion of the Terror Lake Hydroelectric Project on Kodiak Island, Alaska—by the way, which is larger than New Jersey. The Terror Lake Hydroelectric project provides 31 megawatts of hydropower capacity to the Island’s approximately 13,789 residents and, of course, the largest Coast Guard station in the United States. Kodiak Island is roughly the size, as I mentioned, of New Jersey. This means it is reliant upon the electric generation on the Island mostly by hydro at this time, some diesel. With the growing electrical demands of the residents of Kodiak, the Kodiak Electric Association will not be able to meet their needs without requiring additional resources or will be forced back to increasing the use of diesel. There is no reason why a hydrorich community like Kodiak should ever have to rely on diesel fuel for power generation. They wish to expand their operation by increasing their water resources, and I agree. My legislation allows the Kodiak Electric Company to divert small flows of additional water from Upper Hidden Basin into Terror Lake by digging a 1.5 mile underground tunnel. This diversion will increase the water resources at Terror Lake by 25 percent, resulting in an additional 33,000 megawatthours of generation each year and totalling an estimated output in the project of approximately 168 million megawatthours annually. The issue at hand is the tunnel would need to go through Kodiak Island National Wildlife Refuge, which is Federal land, to the State land where the water diversion would be located. My legislation authorizes the Kodiak Electric Association to occupy not more than 20 acres of Federal land to construct, operate, and maintain the Upper Hidden Basin Division expansion without further authorization of the Secretary of the Interior under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Alaska has tremendous hydroelectric potential, and I look forward to moving additional commonsense reforms to provide our rural and remote communities for new opportunities to obtain reliable and affordable hydropower. Mr. Speaker, may I say that the Fish and Wildlife Service supports this, there is no objection to it, it is a solution waiting to happen, so we are going to dig a tunnel. This is really about a tunnel. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 220 would authorize an expansion of the existing Terror Lake Hydropower project in Alaska to meet increased powder demands from Kodiak Island. The expansion would have to comply with environmental protections required under the Federal Power Act and National Environmental Policy Act. This bill unanimously passed both the House Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I want to thank Mr. YOUNG for his persuasive presentation both in committee and on the House floor. I fully support the sensible bipartisan legislation and urge my colleagues to vote for it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I was going to say a few words about this bill here, but I would be in fear of my life if I changed anything on Congressman YOUNG ’s statement. So with that, I think he did an outstanding job presenting, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. 
COOK) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 220, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1415 ROBERT EMMET PARK ACT OF 2017 Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1500) to redesignate the small triangular property located in Washington, DC, and designated by the National Park Service as reservation 302 as ‘‘Robert Emmet Park’’, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1500 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Robert Emmet Park Act of 2017’’. 
Congress finds as follows: (1) Robert Emmet was one of Ireland’s most prominent historical figures, having led an effort to secure Irish independence in 1803. (2) Although Emmet’s efforts initially failed, they succeeded in inspiring new generations of Irish men and women to struggle for independence. (3) For his efforts to gain Irish independence, Emmet was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death by hanging. (4) Robert Emmet’s ‘‘Speech from the Dock’’ motivated many of the efforts that led to an independent Ireland following 1916’s Easter Rising; (Emmet famously said that ‘‘To [Ireland] I sacrificed every selfish, every lasting sentiment . . . I wished to place her independence beyond the reach of any power of earth . . . to procure for my country the guarantee which Washington procured for America . . . to exalt her to that proud station in the world.’’). Emmet was strongly influenced by American democracy and the American Revolution. (5) Emmet had family members similarly admiring of the United States and dedicated to the cause of Irish independence, including his brother Thomas Addis Emmet who went on to become a prominent Attorney General of New York. (6) Emmet has been revered by generations of IrishAmericans for his leadership, courage, and sacrifice. (7) Fifty years ago on April 22, 1966, the Robert Emmet Statue was dedicated on a small parcel of National Park Service land (reservation 302) at the corner of 24th Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW in Washington, DC. (8) Robert Emmet’s statue is the central feature of reservation 302. (9) Many leading Members of Congress, including Speaker of the House John W. McCormack and Senators Everett Dirksen and Mike Mansfield served on the Robert Emmet Statue Dedication Committee. (10) Other members of that committee and participants in the dedication ceremony included Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, Representative Michael Kirwan, Ambassador of Ireland William P. Fay, and Rector of St. Matthews Cathedral John K. Cartwright. SEC. 3. REDESIGNATION OF ROBERT EMMET PARK. 
(a) R EDESIGNATION .—The small triangular property designated by the National Park Service as reservation 302, shall be known as ‘‘Robert Emmet Park’’. (b) REFERENCE .—Any reference in any law, regulation, document, record, map, paper, or other record of the United States to the property referred to in subsection (a) is deemed to be a reference to ‘‘Robert Emmet Park’’. (c) SIGNAGE .—The Secretary of the Interior may post signs on or near Robert Emmet Park that include one or more of the following: (1) Information on Robert Emmet, his contribution to Irish Independence, and his respect for the United States and the American Revolution. (2) Information on the history of the statue of Robert Emmet located in Robert Emmet Park. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1500, offered by our colleague, Representative JOSEPH  CROWLEY of New York, renames a small triangular property owned by the National Park Service in Washington, D.C., as Robert Emmet Park. Robert Emmet, sometimes referred to as the George Washington of Ireland, was a prominent historical figure known for his role in the Irish rebellion of 1803 and for his classic ‘‘Speech from the Dock’’ that inspired future efforts to gain Irish independence. The small National Park Service reservation that is redesignated by this bill includes a statue of Robert Emmet, originally cast in 1916 by IrishAmerican artist Jerome Connor. In April of last year, the statue was rededicated at a ceremony that also jointly marked the centennial of the 1916 Easter Rising. The statue and park, located just a few blocks from the Irish Embassy, are a source of pride to the Irish community. I wish to thank Representative CROWLEYfor his sponsorship of this bill, and also Mr. Jack O’Brien of the Ancient Order of Hibernians for his tireless work in support of this legislation and his lifelong dedication to Irish cultural projects. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as my friend, Mr. COOK, just pointed out, H.R. 1500 designates a small triangle of land in Washington, D.C., as Robert Emmet Park. The parcel is home to a statue of Robert Emmet, a seminal figure in Ireland’s quest for independence. The bill also authorizes the National Park Service, which manages the area, to add interpretive displays and signage to the area. Emmet admired the independence we achieved in this country and only wanted the same freedom and liberty for his compatriots in Ireland. Designating this small plot of land and the accompanying statue as Robert Emmet Park will stand as a constant reminder of the call to liberty and freedom that binds our Nation together. I would like to thank my friend, Representative CROWLEY from New York City, who is also a proud son of St. Patrick, for his work on this bill, and I urge its swift passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ). Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding me this time. I also want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee here in the House of Representatives for moving this bill and helping to put this bill on the floor today in a bipartisan spirit. I would also like to acknowledge the majority and minority staff who have been very helpful to my office in this effort. True, this is not the first time this measure has been considered. It passed the House during the last Congress, but the session ended before it could be moved forward in the Senate and into law. It was then, as it is now, a bipartisan bill. I would like to acknowledge all of the Members who are cosponsors. In substance, the bill would, as has been said, name a small parcel of the land in Washington, D.C., as Robert Emmet Park. Emmet was honored by the United States over 100 years ago when a statue of his likeness was donated to the Smithsonian Institution. That statue was welcomed by no less than President Woodrow Wilson himself. After 50 years, the museum moved the statue to the land where it rests now, an unnamed parcel of land. The rededication committee counted many key leaders, including thenSpeaker of the House John McCormack, Senator Everett Dirksen, and Senator Mike Mansfield. Even President Lyndon Johnson conveyed his pride in Emmet, stating: ‘‘We Americans are proud to accord a place of honor here in the Nation’s Capital to Robert Emmet, whose struggles and sacrifices bespeak the yearnings of mankind throughout the ages.’’ 
So it is clear that, on a bipartisan basis, Congress has long recognized the significance of this statue and its role in keeping alive not only the memory of Robert Emmet, but the ideals for which he stood. At present, the statue of Emmet is the only statue on this small piece of land. This bill would take the next logical step by naming the land for Emmet. It is a fitting tribute since, for generations, many American schoolchildren learned the words of Emmet’s famous speech, which became known as the ‘‘Speech from the Dock.’’ I often wonder what Abraham Lincoln was taught as a boy. We all learned the Gettysburg Address, but, in fact, Abraham Lincoln could recite the ‘‘Speech from the Dock’’ by memory. It couldn’t have been an easy speech for Emmet to give when one considers that he was expected to be executed after giving that speech. Emmet had been an Irish independence leader who was deeply influenced by George Washington and the struggle for American independence. He was inspired by the American fight for democracy and selfdetermination. But after a failed effort to achieve independence, he was captured by the British, as were many others over centuries of struggle. In his speech, Emmet said: 
Let no man write my epitaph; for as no man who knows my motives dare now vindicate them, let not prejudice or ignorance asperse them. Let them and me rest in obscurity and peace, and my tomb remain uninscribed, and my memory in oblivion, until other times and other men can do justice to my character. When my country takes her place among the nations of the Earth, then, and not till then, let my epitaph be written. 
Shortly after giving that speech on September 20, 1803, Robert Emmet was hanged, drawn, and quartered. But Emmet’s words lived on. In fact, groups named the Emmet Monument Association were founded in the United States. Their stated purpose was to build a burial monument to Emmet, one that would, of course, include an epitaph. But because Emmet called for Ireland to be free before his epitaph was written, these groups were actually Fenian freedom organizations. They and other American groups were quite active in the United States for many years all across our Nation. They came before subsequent American roles in the struggle for Irish independence, and their presence played a major role in American political life for many decades. So I respectfully urge the passage of this bill. It does not require spending funds, and it does not alter the park or the park system. It would basically include the name Robert Emmet Park to a small piece of land where the Emmet statue rests. Many Americans, as well as our government, have long recognized the significance of the park and statue in keeping alive not just the history of Robert Emmet, but what he stood for. I am glad that continues today. Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again thank the majority and the minority members of the Natural Resources Committee as well as their staffs. Their support made it possible for this measure to once again be on the floor today. I would like to thank the hardworking staffs of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Park Service who have taken care of the Emmet statue and park for these many, many years. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1500. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
ESTABLISHING A VISITOR SERVICES FACILITY ON THE ARLINGTON RIDGE TRACT Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1073) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to establish a structure for visitor services on the Arlington Ridge tract, in the area of the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1073 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
In this Act, the term ‘‘Arlington Ridge tract’’ means the parcel of Federal land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as the Nevius Tract and transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1953, that is bounded generally by— (1) Arlington Boulevard (United States Route 50) to the north; (2) Jefferson Davis Highway (Virginia Route 110) to the east; (3) Marshall Drive to the south; and (4) North Meade Street to the west. 
SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF A VISITOR SERVICES FACILITY ON THE ARLINGTON RIDGE TRACT. 
Notwithstanding section 2863(g) of Public Law 107–107, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to construct a structure for visitor services to include a public restroom facility on the Arlington Ridge tract in the area of the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1073, brought to us by our Natural Resources Committee colleague Congressman DONBEYER of Virginia, authorizes the National Park Service to construct a visitor services center at the United States Marine Corps Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. The United States Marine Corps Memorial is one of the emblematic sites of our Nation’s Capital. As a marine, the memorial is especially near and dear to my heart. It represents our Nation’s gratitude and esteem for the Marines and those who have fought beside them. While the statue depicts the flag raising on Iwo Jima—one of the most iconic events in World War II—the memorial is dedicated to all marines who have given their lives in defense of the United States since 1775. Each year, the memorial attracts over 1 million visitors and hosts several popular events, including Summer Sunset Parades and the Marine Corps Marathon. Despite this popularity, the memorial lacks basic visitor services such as permanent restroom facilities. The bill before us authorizes the construction of a visitor services center that includes permanent restroom facilities, thus allowing those visiting our Nation’s Capital to visit and appreciate this grand memorial with increased comfort. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, H.R. 1073, authorizes the National Park Service to construct a visitor services facility that includes a restroom at the U.S. Marine Corps Memorial, also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial. The memorial is located in Arlington, Virginia, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, and a short drive from the Pentagon and from here. This iconic statue of marines raising the flag over Iwo Jima is one of the country’s most recognized memorials— the most recognized memorial in the whole world—and receives a tremendous amount of visitation. Unfortunately, there are no permanent restroom facilities at the site. It goes without saying that this is a major hurdle to visitor comfort, especially given that this is a popular destination of our veterans, not all of whom are able bodied. However, once this bill becomes law, the National Park Service will be able 
to construct a restroom with funds that have already been donated for this purpose. This is in keeping with a broad policy of improving accessibility of all the memorials on and around The National Mall. This bill is a long time coming. I want to thank my bill cosponsors for their support, Mr. COOK of California and Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. I understand that our good friends from the Park Service are watching with excitement and pleasure this afternoon as we take this up on the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1073. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REAUTHORIZING THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HISTORIC PRESERVATION PROGRAM Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1135) to reauthorize the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation program. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1135 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HISTORIC PRESERVATION PROGRAM REAUTHORIZED. 
Section 507(d)(2) of the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 (54 U.S.C. 302101 note) is amended by striking the period at the end and inserting ‘‘and each of fiscal years 2018 through 2024.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. b1430 Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 295, introduced by Congressman JAMES CLYBURN from South Carolina, reauthorizes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation program. Since 1988, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation program has awarded over $60 million in grants to assist Historically Black Colleges and Universities with needed maintenance and rehabilitation of historic buildings on their campuses. These projects may include repairing damaged masonry, upgrading electrical and plumbing systems, or fixing leaking roofs. Although the needs of our Nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities exceed the amounts authorized by this legislation, future funding provided to this program will help to ensure that the rich history of these campuses remains preserved for future generations. I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1135 reauthorizes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation program. This program provides grants to revitalize and conserve historic structures at Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Virginia. I am very proud and grateful of the five HBCUs we have in Virginia: Virginia State, Norfolk State, Hampton University, Virginia Union University, and Virginia University of Lynchburg. I point out that the Nation’s first elected AfricanAmerican Governor, Douglas L. Wilder, was a graduate of Virginia Union University. Since the program was first authorized in 1988, as Mr. COOKhas said, there has been over $60 million in grants to help restore iconic structures on many of these college campuses, and two thirds of this money appropriated has been leveraged to generate matching funds to maximize the impacts of taxpayer dollars. But despite all the progress made with respect to revitalizing these campuses, there is still a lot of work that remains to be done in all 107 HBCUs. Reauthorization and sustained support for this program is long overdue. So I would like to thank my esteemed colleague from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ) for all of his hard work and relentlessness to bring this bill to the attention of Congress. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this good bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ), the distinguished leader. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, as a student and former teacher of history, I have worked during my tenure in Congress to preserve and protect our Nation’s historic treasures. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, commonly called HBCUs, are some of the most important historic educational institutions in our country. There are over 100 HBCUs in the country, and eight of them are in South Carolina. I proudly represent seven of them and I am a graduate of one. Many of them have buildings and sites on their campuses that have existed for over a century and are of great historical significance. Unfortunately, many of the historic buildings and sites on these campuses have deteriorated over the years and are at risk of being lost if not preserved and protected. In 1998, at the behest of the Congressional Black Caucus, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, surveyed 103 HBCU campuses to identify the historically significant sites on these campuses and project the cost of restoring and preserving these properties. The GAO identified 712 historic buildings and sites, and projected a cost of $755 million to restore and preserve them. Each of these sites has national significance to American history, and I believe we have an obligation to be stewards of these historic treasures. In 2003, working with our former colleague Jim Hansen of Utah and our current colleague and my dear friend JIMMY DUNCAN of Tennessee, Congress expanded the program and authorized expenditures of $10 million annually for 5 years. I have seen the results firsthand. Last year, Allen University rededicated the historic Chappelle Auditorium on its campus in Columbia, South Carolina, which was painstakingly restored thanks to funding from this program. Originally built in 1925, this building was central to the cultural life of African Americans in South Carolina for generations. In 1947, Reverend Joseph A. DeLaine attended an NAACP event at Chappelle Auditorium that inspired him to organize Black families in Clarendon County to petition their school district to provide buses for Black students who, at the time, were forced to make a daily walk of 9.4 miles to school. That was 9.4 miles to school and 9.4 miles back home. The legal case that grew from this petition, Briggs v. Elliott, precipitated the frontal attack on segregation in the country and was later combined with four other cases that became Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, at the Supreme Court. Overturning the separatebutequal fallacy, Brown ended legal segregation throughout America. This is just a singular example of the history living on HBCU campuses. Because of our past efforts, historic buildings and sites at 59 HBCUs in 20 States have received funding from this program. However, many historic structures are still endangered. 
Consequently, in the omnibus appropriations bill for 2017, which passed earlier this year, Congress included $4 million for HBCU Historic Preservation so that we could continue this progress. Last year, the House passed this bill unanimously, but it was not taken up by the Senate. I thank Chairman BISHOP and Ranking Member G RIJALVA  for supporting it again today. This bill is supported by the United Negro College Fund, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The HBCU Historic Preservation program serves as an essential purpose to HBCUs, which have a special place in the fabric of American history, culture, and education. Countless individuals have worked tirelessly to cultivate HBCUs, and their legacy is seen in graduates whose achievements adorn the pages of American history. From Booker T. Washington, to Mary McLeod Bethune, W.E.B. DuBois, to Martin Luther King, Jr., HBCU visionaries and graduates have set powerful examples of leadership. The legacy of HBCUs is one of significant courage and steadfast determination. The structures on these campuses across the country are living testaments to AfricanAmerican history, and they deserve to be stabilized and restored. HBCUs are among America’s national treasures that must be preserved and protected for future generations. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this needed legislation. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ), a distinguished Member of Congress. Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the reauthorization of the HBCU Historic Preservation program. There are ten HBCUs in North Carolina. The Johnson C. Smith University is in my district. I am pleased to see strong bipartisan support that recognizes how integral Historically Black Colleges and Universities are to our Nation. I am a proud graduate twice of North Carolina A&T, a retired 40year professor at Bennett College—both HBCUs in Greensboro. Most of the structures that this program will help preserve date back to the founding of these schools, most founded in the 19th century. These structures teach us about the lengths that African Americans went through to be educated and to fight for their place in American society. They also provide important lessons for today, reminding us of how far we have come as a society and how these structures were once built to cope with Jim Crow America but now are used to educate our future lawyers, doctors, and politicians. They also remind us of how far we have to go, how we must continue to address the numerous inequities HBCUs face compared to other universities when it comes to educating the next generation. Funding from this program finances repairs that schools with large endowments take for granted, repairs from water damage, asbestos, lead paint, improvements to heating and ventilation systems, and increased physical accessibility for the disabled. The program helps modernize HBCU campuses, creating a suitable environment for learning and achievement, while allowing these institutions to attract prospective students who deserve an education. W.E.B. DuBois reminded us: Of all of the civil rights for which the world has struggled and fought for for 500 years, but the right to learn is undoubtedly the most fundamental. In short, Mr. Speaker, this program is necessary to update HBCU infrastructure and maintain their competitive edge as institutions of higher learning supporting that fundamental right. The President has said these schools are a priority for his administration. They are absolutely a priority for me as well as for my colleagues of the CBC and the bipartisan HBCU Caucus. So passing it proves that Congress can come together to achieve something substantial for these schools and continue the conversation surrounding HBCUs. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 91⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD ). Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my good friend Congressman JIMCLYBURN ’s bill to reauthorize the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation program. I have known JIMCLYBURN for more than 35 years, and this has been his passion ever since I first met him many years ago. I thank Mr. CLYBURN for his passion and his leadership on this issue. Since 1988, the HBCU Historic Preservation program has provided more than $60 million to HBCUs all across the country to support infrastructure and facilitate learning. Both my undergraduate and law school alma mater, North Carolina Central University in Durham, an institution that I am now proud to represent in Congress, has greatly benefited from the program. And I might say that my father graduated from Shaw University, which is an HBCU, and later from Meharry Medical College. My mother attended high school at Shaw University and graduated from college at Hampton Institute, now called Hampton University. Mr. Speaker, HBCUs fill a unique and important role in our Nation’s higher education system and in our country’s narrative. Not only do HBCUs train our workforce of the future by producing the most AfricanAmerican students who can earn science and engineering doctoral degrees, they are integral parts of our national identity. The more than 100 HBCUs spread across the country house the books and the memorabilia from freedmen and former slaves dating back many years. Many of the historic buildings on the campuses of HBCUs were used as meeting places during reconstruction and during the civil rights movement. HBCUs represent the past, the here and the now, and the future of our country. By reauthorizing this important program through 2024, we can honor the many important faculty and students that have helped HBCUs endure, support people at those institutions today, and prepare our workforce for the future. I strongly support this bill. I commend my dear colleague, Congressman JIMCLYBURN , for his enormous leadership on this important issue. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation. b1445 Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ). Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1135, to reauthorize the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation program. I am so grateful to Congressman CLYBURN for his leadership over the years to strengthen and protect the Historic Preservation program on behalf of our Nation’s HBCUs. He has been a tireless advocate on behalf of historic preservation of HBCUs, and I am honored today to join him in this effort. Mr. CLYBURN  has worked tirelessly during his time in Congress to preserve and protect our Nation’s historic treasures and the legacies of those who came before us. Many of us have HBCUs in our district. They represent a steep history of student activism in the civil rights movement. Many of the buildings, sites, and historic records that exist on these campuses have existed for over a century and a half. In 1998, as a matter of fact, the GAO found that there were 712 historic buildings and sites on HBCU campuses. If we do not do more to protect and preserve the vestiges that remain, we will surely lose this important history. Tuskegee University is one university in my home State of Alabama, where Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, and the Tuskegee Airmen all made their place in our Nation’s history. Stillman College; Selma University; Concordia College; Miles College; 
Talladega College; Alabama A&M University; and Alabama State University, where my mother and father graduated, are Historically Black Colleges in the State of Alabama. At Talladega College, these funds were used to restore Foster Hall, which was erected for girls and teachers in 1869, and is the oldest dorm on that campus. This program has helped so many HBCUs in my State. The buildings were nearly destroyed 5 years ago, but the funds from the historic program were used to restore the buildings on Talladega’s campus. When I think about my own district, the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama, at Miles College in Birmingham, students were leaders in the civil rights movement and led a selective buying campaign at local department stores and major retailers in 1963. Congress has recognized that we have a responsibility to be stewards of these great national resources since we first enacted grants to HBCUs for historic preservation in 1996. The program was then expanded in 2003, thanks to Mr. CLYBURN and others. Historical buildings and sites at more than 60 HBCUs have benefited. If we continue making investments in this program, we can meet the dire historic preservation and restoration needs that remain at these threatened sites. We must not only know our history, but we must also protect our history. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to continue this important work by voting for this bill today to reauthorize the HBCU Historic Preservation program through 2024. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager of this legislation, the cosponsors, Mr. CLYBURN , and so many others who have been part of this historic legislation for their leadership on it. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a member of the bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus and as an original cosponsor of H.R. 1135. H.R. 1135 would authorize the appropriation of millions of dollars from 2018 through 2024 to the Historic Preservation Fund to provide assistance for the restoration and preservation of historic structures at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Let me indicate that this has been a long journey. The reauthorization is very special and emotional to many of us. As many of us know, Historically Black Colleges and Universities came at the wake of the ending of slavery and were a place of refuge for so many students. I am reminded of those individuals who, as freed slaves, told stories of walking miles to be able to get to a school like Fisk University or to a school for so many in North Carolina and South Carolina or all throughout the South. They were great refuges for individuals who wanted a better life. It is important to note that in the 1980s, the National Park Service awarded more than $65 million. These grants require you to cover 30 percent of the project. So it is not a handout. It is a handup. It is preserving the history of this great Nation. I am very grateful to the Congressional Black Caucus. When the question is asked, ‘‘What is the Congressional Black Caucus and what do we do,’’ I will say without shame that we are the conscience of this Nation and we recognize that we have a responsibility to protect the vulnerable things of this Nation, whether it be people or things. So the idea was to make sure that not only students have a brilliant education, but those who would seek knowledge will be able to come to the campuses of these Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I happen to represent two State schools: Texas Southern University and Prairie View A&M. There are many HBCUs throughout the State of Texas. We are grateful for the leadership that they have given. They have history. Soon I will be establishing what we call the Emancipation Trail, which chronicles the announcement of freedom in Texas. It was called Juneteenth. It was 2 years that some learned about their freedom after everyone else was free. Those stories are being told at the HBCUs, but at the same time, STEM education is being taught. Oakwood College, a historically Black college of the Seventhday Adventist Church, educates huge numbers of doctors. I am told it has the largest number of African Americans that go into medical school. STEM is very important to our HBCUs. Texas Southern University has a renowned homeland security program. This is a good bill, and I thank my colleagues for voting for this very right and positive bill. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus and an original cosponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1135, which reauthorizes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation Program. H.R. 1135 would authorize the appropriation of $10 million annually from 2018 through 2024 for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide assistance for the restoration and preservation of historic structures at Historical Black Colleges (HBCUs). Specifically, H.R. 1135, reauthorizes $10 million in annual appropriations for the National Park Service grant program supporting the preservation of historic buildings on the campuses of historically black colleges and universities. Since the 1980s, the National Park Service (NPS) has awarded more than $65 million to more than 80 HBCUs to repair historic buildings on their campuses. To be eligible for grants under the program, recipients have to cover 30 percent of the cost of a project. Eligible projects include stabilization, masonry repair, removing lead paint or other hazards, and the improvement of access for the disabled. Mr. Speaker, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Preservation Program exists to preserve, and stabilize historic structures on HBCU campuses through projects such as structural stabilization, masonry repair, replacement of antiquated electrical and plumbing systems, abating environmental hazards such as asbestos, ameliorating termite damage, and replacing leaking roofs. The HBCU preservation project is critically important because much of the history of African Americans has been lost due to it not being considered important enough by historians to study and the fact that many of the repositories of that history—black churches— have been destroyed by arson. I thank and my colleague, Assistant Democratic Leader JAMES CLYBURN for his work in bringing this important legislation to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that one of the greatest HBCUs in the country, Texas Southern University, is located in my congressional district. Texas Southern University has a rich history with nine academic units, 1,000 dedicated staff members, and over 9,200 esteemed students. Like most of my HBCU Caucus colleagues, I have worked closely with my local HBCU to provide funding and resources needed to enable them to fulfill their mission of educating the next generation of social engineers and conducting research programs addressing issues of major concern to the African American community. I was proud to spearhead the initiative that brought more than $13 million in financial aid relief for the students and campus of Texas Southern University. I also worked with TSU administrators to initiate digital archive projects to preserve the records of two of its most distinguished alumni, the legendary Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland, both of whom preceded me as the Member of Congress for the Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas. I was pleased to facilitate a partnership between Comcast and TSU’s School of Communication to provide scholarships and internships to TSU students and inkind marketing services to the university. I helped secure funding needed to establish the Center for Transportation, Training and Research in the TSU College of Science, Engineering, and Technology. HBCU’s have played a critical role in American history. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stated: 
The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character—that is the goal of true education. 
HBCUs do not just educate—HBCUs have and will continue to fill an important role in education opportunity and engagement for millions of young people from diverse backgrounds. I ask my colleagues to support reauthorization of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation Program by joining me in voting to pass H.R. 1135. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1135. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
BUREAU OF RECLAMATION PUMPED STORAGE HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT ACT Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1967) to amend the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 to authorize pumped storage hydropower development utilizing multiple Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1967 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bureau of Reclamation Pumped Storage Hydropower Development Act’’. 
SEC. 2. AUTHORITY FOR PUMPED STORAGE HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT UTILIZING MULTIPLE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION RESERVOIRS. 
Section 9(c)(1) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. 485h(c)(1)) is amended by inserting ‘‘and pumped storage hydropower development exclusively utilizing Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs’’ after ‘‘including small conduit hydropower development’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK), a valuable member of the Committee on Natural Resources, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today, we are here to consider a bill that aims to remove barriers to improve our Nation’s water and power infrastructure. Just last Thursday, the House passed a bill designating the Bureau of Reclamation as the lead agency when it comes to permitting new and expanded water storage projects. Today, the bill before us seeks to clear up regulatory confusion over the development of new pumped storage hydropower. Hydropower can and should be part of an alloftheabove energy strategy now and well into the future. It is a reliable and emissionsfree source of electricity that accounts for a majority of the Nation’s total renewable electricity generation. In my home State of Colorado, we have over 60 operating hydropower facilities that generate more than 1,100 megawatts, including new projects such as Carter Lake, South Canal, and Ridgway Reservoir. However, as is the case nationwide, there is potential for new hydropower generation in Colorado. My bill, the Bureau of Reclamation Pumped Storage Hydropower Development Act, H.R. 1967, looks to pave the way for additional clean hydropower generation by clearing up regulatory permitting confusion at existing Bureau of Reclamation facilities. We worked with our colleague from central Washington State, Mr. NEWHOUSE , on this bill. His interest stems from a reallife example of where it is unclear whether the Bureau of Reclamation or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have permitting jurisdiction on pumped storage hydropower projects at the Columbia Basin Project. The project’s proponents want to build a project that pumps water to and from two of the project’s reservoirs for hydroelectric generation. But because of potential dual permitting requirements, there have been serious delays in bringing this potential 500 megawatt project online. Similar to a public law authored in 2013 by our committee colleague and fellow Coloradan, SCOTT TIPTON , that cleared up confusion on the Bureau of Reclamation’s pipes and canals, my bill makes it clear that the Bureau of Reclamation is the lead agency that will oversee pumped storage development for projects exclusively utilizing the agency’s facilities. The regulatory clarification in my bill will help pave the way for more pumped storage by incentivizing developers who will, in turn, pay the American taxpayers for the use of Federal facilities. In a hearing earlier this spring of the Water, Power, and Oceans Subcommittee, which I chair, even our friends on the other side of the aisle agreed that we should be doing all we can to incentivize clean, renewable hydropower generation at existing Federal facilities. That is why this bill was passed by the House Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent in April. I urge my House colleagues to join me in promoting clean, renewable hydropower generation as part of our Nation’s alloftheabove energy strategy by supporting this bill, the Bureau of Reclamation Pumped Storage Hydropower Development Act. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1967 would amend the permitting process for pumped storage hydropower projects utilizing multiple Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs. Currently, hydropower projects involving Reclamation facilities are subject to either the FERC permitting process or the Reclamation permitting process, based on whether a Reclamation facility was originally authorized for hydropower development. The unique nature of pumped storage projects, which require the use of multiple separate reservoirs, can mean that a single proposed project can be subject to both Reclamation and FERC’s permitting processes, since different reservoirs are under different agency jurisdiction. If enacted, H.R. 1967 would subject pumped storage projects using multiple Reclamation reservoirs to just the Reclamation permitting process instead of the process for both Reclamation and FERC. Like FERC, Reclamation’s permitting project requires authorized pumped storage projects to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and other statutory requirements. While I believe that H.R. 1967 is a commonsense bill and I support its passage, I also support ongoing efforts to incorporate feedback from the Colville Tribe in Washington State as this bill advances to the Senate and proceeds through the legislative process. Mr. Speaker, I had the remarkable opportunity to live in Switzerland for 4 years, and hiked and climbed many of the Alps. It was fascinating to see the highaltitude dams that made hydropower the dominant form of power in the country. Eighty percent of all electricity was hydropower or nuclear. I thank my good friend, Congressman LAMBORN from Colorado Springs, for his leadership on this issue. I encourage unanimous passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, as this Chamber considers H.R. 1967, the ‘‘Bureau of Reclamation Pumped Storage Hydropower Development Act,’’ I would like to provide some brief remarks regarding issues raised by the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. The Colville Tribe has been participating in a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proceeding related a proposed pumped storage project on Lake Roosevelt and Banks Lake in north central Washington. A portion of Lake Roosevelt is within the boundaries of the Colville Reservation. The Colville Tribe has raised several questions about the project’s potential impacts to culturally and economically important fisheries in Lake Roosevelt, water quality, and to revenues the Tribe receives from the Bonneville Power Administration from the operation of the Grand Coulee Dam. 
Because of these questions, the Colville Tribe and the project proponents have been involved in ongoing discussions in hopes of reaching an agreement on how to proceed with the project review process. As those discussions proceed, I would like to provide my commitment to work with the Colville Tribe and the project proponents as the legislative process moves forward. Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS.

The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. COOK) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1967, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1500 REAFFIRMING THE COMMITMENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION’S PRINCIPLE OF COLLECTIVE DEFENSE Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res 397) solemnly reaffirming the commitment of the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s principle of collective defense as enumerated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 397 Whereas more than 250,000 Americans died in the Second World War to liberate Europe from the scourge of genocidal fascism; Whereas in the wake of the cataclysm of the Second World War, the United States, Canada, and European partners founded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Washington in 1949; Whereas the foundation of NATO is collective defense as enumerated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty which states that, ‘‘The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.’’; Whereas NATO is one of the most successful military alliances in history, deterring the outbreak of another world war, protecting the territorial integrity of its members, and seeing the Cold War through to a peaceful conclusion; Whereas Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty has only been invoked once in history when alliance members came to the aid of the United States following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; Whereas NATO allies and partners, including Canada and countries in Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe, including countries of the Western Balkans, and the former Soviet Union have stood alongside the United States in joint operations in the Western Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere around the globe; Whereas NATO remains the foundation of United States foreign policy of promoting a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace; Whereas at the Wales Summit in 2014, NATO leaders agreed that each alliance member would spend at least two percent of its nation’s gross domestic product on defense by 2024; Whereas multiple Presidents have reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to the collective defense guarantees in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty; and Whereas the Constitution of the United States grants Congress the sole power to declare war: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives— (1) solemnly reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s principle of collective defense as enumerated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty; (2) strongly supports the decision at the NATO Wales Summit in 2014 that each alliance member would spend at least two percent of its nation’s gross domestic product on defense by 2024; (3) condemns any threat to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom and democracy of any NATO ally; and (4) welcomes the Republic of Montenegro as the 29th member of the NATO Alliance. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Speaker RYANand Minority Leader P ELOSI . I want to thank Leader MCCARTHY and Minority Whip HOYER for their leadership on this important resolution and, of course, Ranking Member ENGEL , who has also been a strong supporter of the NATO alliance. Mr. Speaker, in 1949, 12 free, democratic nations bound themselves together in an unprecedented defense alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These founding members acted in the aftermath of the Second World War to promote peace in Europe, to promote their freedom, and to face the threats they saw emerging on the horizon. Now, more than six decades later, this alliance has been the cornerstone of transatlantic security, and it has attracted other freedomloving democratic nations to join its ranks. Of course, article 5’s principle of collective defense has been key to the success of the alliance, and we will not forget how the United States has benefited from that principle as NATO members unanimously elected to come to our support after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks, nonconventional attacks by terrorist groups against our people, these are threats that NATO’s founders could not have anticipated, yet they are the challenges that we must act now to address. We are stronger, no question, when we act together. Now, Moscow’s strategic objective is to break apart the NATO alliance to boost Russian geopolitical influence in Western Europe. In light of this, it is even more important that NATO members meet the standard of investing 2 percent of their GDP on defense. We appreciate the few who already meet the minimum requirement: Estonia, Greece, Poland, and the U.K. At the administration’s urging, others have stepped up their game, such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania, but others have further to go. This resolution calls on NATO members to meet these commitments while also reaffirming our commitment to NATO and to the article 5 provision for collective defense. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. Let me start by thanking the leaders on both sides of the aisle who worked to bring this measure forward: Speaker RYAN and Leader PELOSI ; the majority leader, Mr. MCCARTHY ; the minority whip, Mr. HOYER ; and my friend from California (Mr. ROYCE ), our chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. Speaker, NATO has been the most effective alliance of the 20th and 21st centuries. It stood as a bulwark against communist aggression during the Cold War. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, it has played a critical role in building an integrated Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. 
At the heart of the alliance is the value enshrined in article 5: An attack on any ally is an attack on all allies. That commitment has been so strong across the decades, that the alliance never once invoked article 5 during the long standoff between East and West during the Cold War. In fact, article 5 has only been invoked one time in NATO’s history, when the ruins of the World Trade Center were smouldering in New York City as the world rallied around the United States. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, NATO allies did what we always knew they would: they said the attack on us was an attack on all of them as well. Since then, for nearly 16 years, American troops have fought and shed blood and died alongside men and women serving in the uniforms of our NATO allies. Mr. Speaker, this isn’t a commitment we as Americans can take lightly. While I am glad President Trump finally affirmed the commitment of the United States to article 5, I think it is important for Congress to do it as well. The administration’s hotandcold approach to the alliance caused a lot of unneeded heartburn for our allies and caused even the best of friends to question our commitment. NATO is not a thing that can just be thrown in with everything else. It is very important to us, and we should allow our allies to meet their commitments laid out at the NATO summit in Wales. It is very important that we do that. Right now, especially, we need to be clear on our commitment to NATO. The danger that Russia poses to the alliance, to Western democracy and an integrated, unified Europe, is the greatest test in a generation. If there are cracks in the surface, you can bet that Vladimir Putin will do all he can to exploit them. Fracturing Western unity is his top goal, and the United States needs to be strong in our commitment to NATO. Today, the House is saying we will not waver. We are sending a message to our allies and partners and to Moscow that a wager against NATO is a losing bet. I would like to see the House take an even tougher stance against Moscow and immediately pass the Senate’s Russia sanctions bill. This legislation won overwhelmingly bipartisan support in the other body, and I am confident we could act on it swiftly in the House. With this measure today, we are saying with one voice that article 5 is sacred, that NATO is strong, and the resolve of the United States and our allies won’t be weakened by a bully sitting in Moscow. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman as well as the ranking member. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Speaker RYAN’s measure which reaffirms America’s commitment to NATO, article 5 and the principle of collective defense. Like my colleagues, I believe that NATO has been indispensable in deterring another world war and in protecting our values and ideals. It is our commitment to each other and to those ideals that have made our alliance so strong, so effective. It is that commitment to each other that has enhanced the territorial security and stability of each one of us. Let us not forget that it was following the terrorist attacks of 9/11 that NATO invoked article 5 for the only time in its history, coming to the defense of us, the United States. This was a signal of unity, of strength, and that is what makes article 5 so special. I also appreciate the pledges of our alliance members to share the burden of the cost of our mutual defense by aiming to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense by the year 2024. That is so important, Mr. Speaker, because NATO’s role over the years has evolved. We are no longer facing just the threat of communist aggression; we are facing a multitude of threats against our mutual national security interests around the globe, and we need to be prepared for whatever comes our way. I am pleased to reiterate my support for Speaker RYAN’s resolution. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their commitment to NATO and to the principle of collective defense. It is ever so important in these dangerous times. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, recently, I was in Brussels, and we met with NATO officials on a codel led by the Democratic leader, Ms. PELOSI . Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ). Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his extraordinary leadership on the committee, as well as the bipartisan nature of this legislation that Mr. ROYCE and Mr. E NGEL are bringing to the floor. I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congresswoman ROSLEHTINEN . Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan resolution reassures our friends, it rebuffs our foes, and it reminds the world that America’s commitment to NATO’s common defense pledge is ironclad. When President Truman signed the NATO Treaty nearly 70 years ago, he called the alliance, ‘‘a long step toward permanent peace in the whole world.’’ NATO has guaranteed the security of the American people and our allies for decades. Now some people don’t remember what those decades were like, fighting the threat of communism. Article 5, the collective defense provision, is the core of that security guarantee. Article 5, as the gentlewoman just mentioned, was invoked only once: when America’s allies joined in the fight against alQaida after the September 11 terrorist attacks on our country. I, like many of my colleagues, have traveled to Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places and seen that our NATO partners have shed blood in the name of article 5 in our common fight against terrorism. Our commitment to article 5 is a commitment to brave men and women across the world who risk and give their lives for the NATO alliance. Previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have strongly and unambiguously stood by NATO and article 5. I was very sad, I will be very honest with you, my colleagues, when meeting with NATO leaders at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels, a building dedicated to the victims of the 9/11 attacks, President Trump refused to clearly and unequivocally reassure our NATO partners that he would honor article 5. We in this Congress of the United States, acting in a bipartisan way, want to remove all doubt that the U.S. commitment to the principles of a mutual defense embodied by NATO are ironclad. I keep using that word. Every day, Putin searches for cracks in our NATO alliance. We must convey to him that this alliance is ironclad. And now, just on another related subject, it is about our national security. While we are glad to be passing this resolution affirming America’s commitment to article 5, the bipartisan bill sanctioning Russia languishes in the House. While the White House caters to Putin, Congress must hold Russia accountable for its actions by passing the IranRussia sanctions bill. It passed the Senate 98–2—98–2—strong bipartisan support for a bill that contained the Iran and Russia sanctions. We can’t go home for the Fourth of July without passing that legislation. It is my understanding it was just a blue slip problem that could be easily resolved. That is how it was characterized when the President of Ukraine said to us that they really need the Russian sanctions enforced and strengthened. Let us have the courage to stand up to those who menace the free world and stand by our partners in support of a peaceful, democratic, and free future for all. What we are doing today is very important. It is not just about a bill. It is not just about an agreement. It is about values. It is about security as a value, something we take an oath to protect and defend. This NATO agreement helps us do that, but we must also do what flows from it and say to the Russians, who are the point of NATO, you are going to have sanctions because of your aggression in Eastern Europe, and at the same time send that message to the Iranians. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a very strong unanimous vote for this. This is something so bipartisan, so wonderful. It is a good day. It is a good bill. It gives us all hope. I urge our colleagues to vote ‘‘aye’’ and call upon the Speaker to bring the other bill to the floor. I hope our distinguished chair and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee will be able to be part of bringing it to the floor very soon. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, the distinguished ranking member, and I thank my friend Mr. ROYCE , the chairman of the committee, for their leadership. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 397, reaffirming the commitment of the United States to NATO’s principle of collective defense as enumerated in article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. b1515 As the head of the U.S. delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and as rapporteur for the Transatlantic Subcommittee, I can attest to the anxiety within NATO regarding the administration’s commitment to the alliance. Case in point, one cannot talk about the U.S. commitment to article 5 in 2017 without mentioning President Trump’s failure to embrace it in full view of our NATO allies when he was in Brussels earlier this year. It has been widely reported that even the President’s own national security team was blindsided by the omission. I welcome this resolution, but it would have made a stronger statement to bring it to the floor immediately after the President’s disconcerting speech in Brussels. This resolution maybe is less a profile in courage as it is a sigh of relief. Since the House failed the leadership test on this account, let’s redeem ourselves by taking up the EngelConnolly bill on Russian’s sanctions, and the IranRussia sanctions package recently passed in the Senate by 98–2, and send it to the President’s desk for signature. Any delay only furthers the trend of obsequiousness to the executive branch and enables this administration’s disastrous retreat from global leadership. I am proud to support this resolution, I am glad it is on the floor, and I hope it is an auger of things to come. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL ). Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative ENGEL and Chairman ROYCE for their leadership. Like my colleague, who just spoke, over the last 4 years, I have been privileged to help represent the United States at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Mr. Speaker, I would like to borrow a line from a very wellknown poet who said, ‘‘No man is an island,’’ recognizing that human beings do not thrive when isolated from others, a concept that is recognized by all religions. This is more true than ever as our world becomes increasingly dangerous. And, more than ever, the United States of America needs friends to stand strong and stand up for our mutual democratic values. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution, committing the United States to NATO article 5 collective defense. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the Democratic whip, who is an original cosponsor of this resolution. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank Mr. ROYCE and Mr. E NGEL for their leadership. I also want to thank Mr. MCCARTHY , Speaker R YAN, and Leader PELOSI for their strong support of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I went to Brussels over the Memorial Day break. We met in Brussels with the NATO leaders. The Deputy Secretary General was there, and we spoke about the confidence that our European allies had, and needed, for the continuing viability of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and our commitment to the mutual defense of the members of NATO. That has been for 70 years the critical—over 70 years, really—the critical stability that we have seen in the European Plain, and it needs to continue to be. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this resolution, which reaffirms our Nation’s commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s article 5 and the common defense among our NATO allies. For 70 years, as I said, NATO has kept the peace in Europe and around the world. Now, that does not mean that we have had peace everywhere in the world, but it does mean that we have not had world conflagration, as we saw in the last century. From the Cuban Missile Crisis to the fall of the Iron Curtain, NATO’s unity in the face of common threats has helped prevent a direct Soviet attack against America and against our allies. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has been adapting to meet threats new and old. Together, NATO members have served on the ground in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and enlargement has made the allegiance even stronger. Now, with Russia once again putting forward an aggressive posture to its neighbors and the world—in addition to visiting Bosnia, we also went to Lithuania and to Estonia, and I visited Denmark, as well—there is no doubt that the neighbors of Russia feel a pressure that has, over the last 15 years, not been as present. NATO’s common defense commitment is as vital to global security and America’s security as it has ever been. We know that Russia interfered with our elections and has used cyber attacks against our NATO allies to subvert their democratic institutions as well. Estonia, in particular, has developed, and is developing, defenses to cyber attacks. We, the United States, the leader of the free world, must make it clear, unequivocally so, both to Vladimir Putin and to our NATO allies, that the United States stands firmly by its commitment to the alliance and its collective defense. It has only been once that article 5 has been implicated, and that was after 9/11, when all of our European allies in NATO said that an attack on the United States was perceived as an attack on them, and they pledged their unity and alliance and action. An attack on one is an attack on all—an attack on democracy, on freedom, on the values that this country and our NATO allies stand for. It is in that context, Mr. Speaker, that I urge my colleagues to join us in giving this resolution—it says here on this text—a strong vote of passage. More than that, I hope this is a unanimous vote of passage. This is the oppression of the leader of the free world that we will not only lead, but we will act. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, we should be clear that Vladimir Putin is testing us. He attacked our democracy in last year’s election, he is working to create divisions among our allies, and he would love nothing more than to see NATO fail. If the United States offers anything less than our fullthroated support for the alliance, and our ironclad commitments to article 5, Moscow will see that as an invitation to undercut transatlantic unity and fracture our critical bond with Europe. I am glad the House is coming together to ensure that it doesn’t happen. I hope we can continue to work in a bipartisan way to shore up our alliances and push back on Russian aggregation. This is a real threat. Russia is not our ally. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this measure, and I urge all Members to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, as a coauthor of this resolution, I also want to thank the other coauthors, including STEVE COHEN of Tennessee, who has been a leader on NATO issues. Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say, for the advancement of our own security, the promotion of our values, and 
a strong statement of support for our friends and allies, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 397, a resolution that reaffirms the United States’ commitment to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and its principle of collective defense. In the aftermath of World War II, the greatest conflict in human history, the United States, Canada, and their Western Europe allies founded the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 in Washington. Founded on the principle of collective defense, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that, ‘‘The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.’’ In the 68 years since the Treaty’s ratification, Article 5 has only been invoked once, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when NATO members came to the aid of the United States. NATO sent seven planes with 830 crewmen from 13 countries to protect American skies until May 2002, marking the first time in American history that the continental United States was protected by foreign forces. NATO allies and partners have stood with the United States in joint operations in the Western Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere around the world. Until this year, every American president since the treaty’s signing in 1949—Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama—has publicly reaffirmed the American commitment to Article 5. American presidents have affirmed this nation’s commitment to come to the aid of any NATO member that is under attack. That is the symbolic meaning of the immortal words spoken by President Kennedy in West Berlin at the Brandenburg Gate in 1963: ‘‘Ich bin ein Berliner.’’ Mr. Speaker, the principle of collective defense is the core of NATO’s founding treaty and the NATO alliance has been the backbone of American national security and foreign policy for nearly 70 years. The strength and solidarity of this western alliance kept Western Europe whole, prosperous, and free and paved the way for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the liberation of the nations of Eastern and Central Europe, many of which have now been integrated into NATO. The Constitution of the United States grants Congress the sole power to declare war, but Article 5 does not increase the chance of war. Rather, NATO is a bulwark against the outbreak of war because it deters aggression by any adversary. As a result, NATO is the most successful military alliance in world history, successfully deterring the outbreak of a third world war, seeing the Cold War to a victorious conclusion, and protecting the principle of territorial integrity. This is why I strongly support H. Res. 397, which reaffirms the commitment of the People’s House to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. The resolution also expresses support for the agreement reached at the 2014 NATO Wales Summit calling upon each NATO member nation to allocate at least two percent of its gross domestic product to defense by 2024. The resolution also condemns any threat to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom and democracy of any NATO ally and welcomes the Republic of Montenegro as the 29th member of the NATO alliance. I urge all Members to join me in affirming the commitment of the United States to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty for this important resolution by voting for H. Res. 397. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 397. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
CONDEMNING THE VIOLENCE AND PERSECUTION IN CHECHNYA Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 351) condemning the violence and persecution in Chechnya, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 351 Whereas, on April 1, 2017, the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that authorities in Chechnya, a republic of the Russian Federation, had abducted, detained, and tortured over 100 men due to their actual or suspected sexual orientation; Whereas multiple independent and first hand accounts have subsequently corroborated the Novaya Gazeta report, and describe a campaign of persecution by Chechen officials against men due to their actual or suspected sexual orientation; Whereas, as a result of this persecution, at least three deaths have been reported and many individuals have been forced to flee Chechnya; Whereas Chechen officials have denied the existence of such persecution, including through a statement by the spokesman for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov that ‘‘You cannot arrest or repress people who don’t exist in the republic.’’; Whereas the same spokesman for Ramzan Kadyrov has also stated that ‘‘If such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return,’’ and credible reports indicate that Chechen authorities have encouraged families to carry out socalled ‘‘honor killings’’ of relatives due to their actual or suspected sexual orientation; Whereas Chechnya is a constituent republic of the Russian Federation and subject to its laws, and Ramzan Kadyrov was installed as the leader of Chechnya by Russian President Vladimir Putin; Whereas Chechen authorities have a long history of violating the fundamental human rights of their citizens, including through extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, and torture of government critics; Whereas Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed reports of persecution in Chechnya and termed them ‘‘phantom complaints’’; Whereas Russia’s Human Rights Ombudsman, Tatyana Moskalkova, has also claimed that such reports should not be believed because formal complaints have not been registered with the appropriate authorities; Whereas the Russian Federation is a participating State of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and thus has agreed to guarantee the fundamental human rights of all of its citizens; Whereas, on April 7, 2017, the United States Department of State issued a statement saying ‘‘We categorically condemn the persecution of individuals based on their sexual orientation’’ and urging the Government of the Russian Federation to take steps to ensure the release of all those wrongfully detained in Chechnya, and to conduct a credible investigation of the reports; and Whereas, on April 17, 2017, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley issued a statement saying ‘‘Chechen authorities must immediately investigate these allegations, hold anyone involved accountable, and take steps to prevent future abuses. We are against all forms of discrimination, including against people based on sexual orientation. When left unchecked, discrimination and human rights abuses can lead to destabilization and conflict.’’: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives— (1) condemns the violence and persecution in Chechnya and calls on Chechen officials to immediately cease the abduction, detention, and torture of individuals on the basis of their actual or suspected sexual orientation, and hold accountable all those involved in perpetrating such abuses; (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to protect the human rights of all its citizens, condemn the violence and persecution, investigate these crimes in Chechnya, and hold accountable all those involved in perpetrating such abuses; (3) calls on the United States Government to continue to condemn the violence and persecution in Chechnya, demand the release of individuals wrongfully detained, and identify those individuals whose involvement in this violence qualifies for the imposition of sanctions under the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–208; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note) or the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (Public Law 114–328); and (4) affirms that the rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression and freedom from extrajudicial detention and violence are universal human rights that apply to all persons, and that countries that fail to respect these rights jeopardize the security and prosperity of all their citizens. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the ruler of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, rules a dictatorship of medieval brutality. Those who challenge or simply displease him often disappear in that country, or they are murdered outright. His latest campaign of persecution is aimed at gay men and women, and those perceived to be gay, who have been abducted, tortured, and even killed, with many others that are forced to flee the country. When the Russian newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, reported these atrocities, his spokesmen dismissed the accusations, saying that such people ‘‘don’t even exist in the republic,’’ and then threatened the journalists who brought the story to light. Caught unaware by the unexpected publicity, Chechen authorities have choked off independent sources of information. We do not know the exact status of this campaign or its many victims, but there is no doubt that the situation there for sexual minorities in general has long been, and remains, oppressive. Disturbing reports indicate that Kadyrov has now turned his focus from abducting and torturing gay men and women to pressuring their families to murder them through socalled honor killings of these men and women. This is despicable. Vladimir Putin deserves some of the blame here. Chechnya is a constituent republic of the Russian Federation, of which he is the President. As such, he has a sworn responsibility to ensure that the Russian Constitution is fully implemented, which, at least on paper, professes to guarantee basic rights for all citizens. Russia is also a signatory to many international agreements that formally commit it to protecting a broad array of human rights. Yet the Russian Government’s response has been largely dismissive, if not twofaced. Kremlin spokesmen have called the reports phantom complaints, yet also recommended that victims report grievances to the Chechen authorities accused of carrying out the attacks. And, of course, there has been no criticism of Kadyrov in the Russian statecontrolled media— barely even a mention of the issue. That is why this resolution is of such importance. By shining a light on these crimes in this dark corner, we seek to give hope to those who otherwise may have none at all. And we say unequivocally, to Kadyrov, and to Putin, that these atrocities are in plain view, and that their cowardly and evasive responses are not fooling anyone. I want to thank Chairman Emeritus ROSLEHTINEN , the author of this resolution, and Ranking Member ENGEL for their leadership on this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1530 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me first thank my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee, particularly Ms. ROSLEHTINEN  from Florida, and Mr. CICILLINE from Rhode Island, for their work on this measure, and for their leadership supporting LGBT communities around the world. I also thank Chairman ROYCE  for support of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, day after day, we hear new reports of abuse of LGBT individuals in Chechnya. This spring, authorities rounded up hundreds of gay men. Some were tortured, some were murdered. Reports from civil society and activists tell us that Chechen authorities have rounded up LGBT individuals, beaten them, tortured them with electric shocks, and outed them to their families in the perverse hope of provoking socalled ‘‘honor killings.’’ This is horrific. Let’s not forget that Chechnya is part of Russia, as the chairman said. These crimes—this disregard for human rights and human dignity lie at the feet of Vladimir Putin and his crony in Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. No one anywhere should face violence, persecution, or death because of who they love. ‘‘Gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights,’’ as Hillary Clinton said when she was Secretary of State. But under Putin’s rule, those rights are a myth. So I was disappointed when Secretary Tillerson testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee about whether those atrocities were on the agenda with his Russian counterparts. ‘‘These are on the pending list,’’ he told us. The United States should never put basic human rights on the ‘‘pending list.’’ Unless we shed a light on these abuses and demand that they be stopped, we are betraying our most fundamental values. So today I am glad the House, in a bipartisan way, is speaking out to condemn this violence and persecution, to stand up for the freedoms of assembly and expression, and to say that we believe that LGBT rights are human rights that must be protected around the world. I am glad to support this measure. Again, I thank Chairman EDROYCE , ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , and D AVID CICILLINE . Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), the chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and, of course, the author of this measure. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank, as always, our esteemed chairman, Mr. ROYCE from California, as well as Mr. ENGEL from New York, who really run our committee in the most fair, bipartisan way possible. I think that our committee is an example for the rest of the House. But I am so grateful to have worked alongside my chairman and ranking member, and all of the colleagues in the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a bipartisan manner; particularly, Mr. ISSA, Mr. C ICILLINE , Mr. S MITH, and Mr. LOWENTHAL , in introducing and bringing to the floor this important resolution, H. Res. 351, Condemning the Violence and Persecution in Chechnya. Since early April, there have been credible reports that gay or perceived tobegay men in the Russian republic of Chechnya have been rounded up, have been detained, have been put into prison camps by the authorities of Chechnya. And according to international human rights groups and activists on the ground, the situation has rapidly escalated. Despite the international attention and the rage, the beatings and torture did not stop. Men continued to be tortured on a daily basis, and, allegedly, at least 20 men have been killed. The latest reports indicate that lesbians are also being targeted now. This government campaign targeting LGBT individuals is also inciting ‘‘honor killings.’’ Families are being threatened and act out of fear of also being persecuted. This is appalling. Putin has given free rein to the Chechen leader and has significant influence over what goes on in Chechnya. Let’s not forget Russia’s deplorable human rights record of silencing religious minorities, of prohibiting freedom of expression, of restricting free association of LGBT individuals. This is Russia’s record. It is Chechnya’s as well. Nothing has been done. No perpetrators have been brought to justice. This is why it is up to us in the United States to not sit idly by while this statesponsored persecution is ongoing. This bipartisan resolution, Mr. Speaker, does not only shed light on this dreadful human rights disaster, but it also calls on the officials of Chechnya to immediately put an end to the abduction and violence of individuals based on their real or perceived sexual orientation. It calls on Putin to uphold the international commitments and protect the human rights of all people upon which Russia has entered. They have signed these commitments, yet they don’t fulfill them. It holds accountable those individuals in the attacks who will also be sanctioned under two existing U.S. sanctions laws that we have passed: Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. Today, this body has the ability to once again be that strong voice for human rights of all individuals and to send a clear message to any oppressor that the United States will not turn a blind eye against violence, harassment, 
and discrimination, no matter where it happens. As a country, we have the responsibility to promote our deeply cherished American values and reaffirm our commitment to fundamental freedom, especially for those who live under the shadow of oppression and tyranny. We stand in solidarity with the persecuted, with the religious minorities, with the ethnic groups, with the suppressed women, and, in this case, with the LGBT community, because the respect of human rights of all people remains a U.S. foreign policy priority. I thank my colleagues for their overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle who have supported this important resolution, which sends a unified message that the United States is committed to promoting human rights and that this crisis must end now because this matter is not just an LGBT issue—as important as it is—it is a human life matter and it deserves support from all of us. Everyone deserves dignity. Everyone deserves respect in the place they call home, no matter where that is around the world. It is time to put an end to Chechnya’s barbaric LGBT purge. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time and I thank the ranking member as well. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ), a coauthor of this resolution and someone who is fighting for human rights all the time. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 351, which condemns the violence and persecution against LGBT or perceivedtobe LGBT individuals in Chechnya. This resolution is an example of the strong bipartisanship of the House Foreign Affairs Committee under the leadership of Chairman EDROYCE and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL . I thank my good friend, ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , who has long been a champion of the dignity of all people around the world, for introducing H. Res. 351. I also thank the chairman and ranking member for working with us to ensure this resolution was passed without delay and with the support of the full committee. On April 1 of this year, the Novaya Gazeta, one of the few independent Russian newspapers, posted a chilling report detailing a concerted campaign by Chechen authorities to identify, round up, torture, and murder gay or perceivedtobegay men and women in the Chechen region of Russia. Dozens of suspected LGBT men and some women have been rounded up with estimates of more than 100 people being detained, and at least three murdered, maybe many more. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the reports. When confronted with accusations, his spokesman denied there were any gay people in Chechnya, and explained that, ‘‘If there were such people in Chechnya, law enforcement agencies wouldn’t need to have anything to do with them because their relatives would send them somewhere from which there is no returning.’’ In fact, there have been credible reports that Chechen authorities have forced family members of those detained or those suspected of being gay to commit ‘‘honor killings’’ or face violence and retaliation against their entire families. Chechnya is a small, conservative region of Russia, and LGBT people there face a level of isolation and danger that is unthinkable to those of us living in the freedom of the United States. Even those who have managed to escape Chechnya continue to face danger from extended family members or Chechen authorities within Russia and even parts of Europe. That is why it is so important that the United States work with our partners in Europe and assist in making sure that those fleeing the violence in Chechnya are relocated somewhere they can be safe. H. Res. 351 condemns the violence and persecution against LGBT individuals in Chechnya and calls on Chechen officials to immediately cease the abduction, detention, and torture of individuals on the basis of their actual or suspected sexual orientation, and hold accountable all those involved in perpetrating such abuses. Furthermore, this resolution calls on the government of the Russian Federation to protect the human rights of all its citizens, condemn the violence and persecution, investigate these crimes in Chechnya, and hold accountable all of those involved in perpetrating such abuses. We must remember that President Kadyrov is a close ally of President Putin, and that the Russian Government has essentially sanctioned the atrocities that are being carried out on its soil. That is why it is so important that representatives of the United States Government, at the highest levels, raise this issue with President Putin and other Russian officials. I was extremely disappointed when Secretary of State Tillerson appeared before the Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this month and admitted that neither he nor the President had raised this issue with anyone in the Russian Government. The United States must make it clear that human rights abuses will not be tolerated. The President, the Secretary of State, and other senior officials must raise this issue consistently with the Russian Government and make it clear that they must protect the lives and safety of all Russian citizens. Additionally, the Trump administration must take steps to ensure that any Russian officials involved in these atrocities are being sanctioned under the Sergei Magnitsky Act and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which we passed last year. Events like these are exactly why these bills were passed, to ensure that government officials involved in gross human rights abuses do not have the privilege of accessing American markets or traveling to the United States. Furthermore, the administration should be working in concert with our European allies to ensure that Russia is being held to its international obligations and treaties. The lives of vulnerable men and women are at stake, and every day that we remain silent, we condemn more to a dark fate. I am pleased that the House is considering this resolution tonight. I urge my colleagues to support it. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ), a valued member of the committee. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding. I rise to remind us that Martin Luther King once said: ‘‘Injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere.’’ We are all in this together. The idea that we can cherrypick whose rights we will proclaim and defend is a mistaken notion. It is also unAmerican. So the future rights of LGBT members in Chechnya are important to Americans, and we need to stand up for their security, their safety, and their fundamental human rights. This resolution is important. I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for bringing it before us. I congratulate my good friend, ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN , and D AVID CICILLINE for their leadership. I am proud to support this resolution today. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Let me, first of all, again thank Representative ROSLEHTINEN , who is always working really hard and is on top of issues that are so important. We really appreciate her leadership and everything she does in the committee; Mr. CICILLINE , who has fought for LGBT rights; and, of course, my partner on the committee, Chairman ROYCE . Things like this show the bipartisanship of our committee, which I think is really important. Occasionally we hear talk about Vladimir Putin that implies some sort of moral equivalency between the way he runs Russia and American policies. If you want to know how false that comparison is, take a look at what is happening in Chechnya. Take a look at the violence that Putin’s thugs are waging against innocent citizens. That is how Putin regards the rights of his own people. That is what we are here to condemn today. The United States should continue to make advancing and protecting human rights a foreign policy priority, including the rights of LGBT communities. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this measure. I thank Chairman ROYCE , and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of this bill, I, again, thank Chairman Emeritus ROSLEHTINEN . I thank Ranking Member ENGEL , as well as Representatives DARRELL ISSA, D AVID CICILLINE , C HRIS SMITH, and G ERRY  CONNOLLY for their important work on this resolution. The abduction, torture, and targeted killings that we are seeing in Chechnya are an affront to the core universal values that all nationstates must strive to protect. The U.S. has a long history of speaking out on behalf of persecuted minorities, and that is what we are doing here today. We cannot end injustice everywhere, but we can expose it. We can bring it to the world’s attention and, in so doing, give hope to its innocent victims. I ask all Members to speak clearly and to speak unanimously in condemning this violence. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 351, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

HONORING FRANK KUSH (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a legendary Arizonan, Frank Kush, who passed away last week at age 88. Frank is best known for his career as coach of the Arizona State University Sun Devils football program. He won 176 games over 21
1⁄2seasons, the most ever in Sun Devil history. He was named national Coach of the Year after the 1975 season and was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995. Coach Frank Kush was not only concerned with wins and losses, he was a mentor for young men and ensured that their professional and academic development rose above their athletic prowess. Coach Kush influenced hundreds of young men during his career at Arizona State. His impact is ever present in the lives of his former players, and his legacy will never be forgotten. 
TRUMPCARE (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, today a number of us were able to go to the children’s hospital here in Washington, D.C., and met two miraculous families, children with complex, chronic diseases. With the love of their parents, one could not tell they were different from any other child, yet they had horrific and difficult medical conditions. Those parents were middle class working families, and said that, without Medicaid, the half a million dollars of healthcare that keeps those beautiful children alive and leads them to a pathway of a life of love would not be possible. I am glad that the Senate TrumpCare bill has been stopped in its tracks, the same bill that the CBO has said will cause 49 million Americans to lose their insurance in 2026. There is no pathway to reform this bill. There is no White House meeting, no Presidential cajoling and shooting deals back and forth. These are lives of Americans, and as long as it takes, we will fight to the end to stop the demolition of the Affordable Care Act, which most Americans, over 50 percent, want the Affordable Care Act. Stop the foolishness. f 
CONGRATULATING THE NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ASSOCIATION (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, also known as NATCA, on its 30th anniversary. Since its foundation, NATCA has worked to guide aviation policies and improve working conditions for its members with one goal in mind: to ensure that passengers arrive safely to our destinations. I would also like to recognize three remarkable individuals—Billy, Jim, and Mitch—whom I have met through NATCA’s advocacy efforts. These men are committed to public service, first through their service in our Armed Forces, and then later as air traffic controllers ensuring that Miami’s skies remain safe for all. Though Mitch has now retired, I know that his contributions to our Nation have not stopped. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating NATCA and its members on 30 years of outstanding public service. 
UKRAINE MILITARY OFFICIAL KILLED (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as cochair of the Ukrainian Caucus, and I will include in the RECORD an article reporting on an act of violence that has taken place in Ukraine. Yesterday, a bomb exploded in the car of a highranking Ukrainian special forces official, Colonel Maksim Shapoval, in Kiev, in what Ukrainian authorities are calling an act of terrorism. Shapoval’s heroic unit fought in eastern Ukraine, where a conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been raging since 2014, with mainly citizens being 
killed, over 10,000 innocents in that country. Shapoval’s death comes almost a year after prominent Ukraine journalist Pavel Sheremet was killed by a similar explosion in Kiev as he drove to work. No one has been brought to justice in that murder case. A number of other public figures have also been killed under shady circumstances in and around Kiev in recent years. Denis Voronerkov, a former Russian member of Parliament who fled to Ukraine, was shot dead in central Kiev in March 2017. Lawyer Yuri Grabovsky, who had represented a Russian soldier captured in Ukraine, was found dead with a gunshot wound in 2016. This has all the fingerprints of Putin’s Russia, who will stop at nothing to blunt liberty. America must be a friend to liberty and an enemy to tyranny. I call on this administration to help Ukraine defend itself against these hostile acts of war against liberty. 
[From theguardian, June 27, 2017] UKRAINIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER  KILLED BY CARBOMB IN KIEV (By Alec Luhn) A highranking Ukrainian military intelligence official has been killed by a car bomb in Kiev in what authorities are calling an act of terrorism. An explosive device destroyed the Mercedes being driven by Col Maksim Shapoval at 8.15am local time, police said. The car’s bonnet was blown open and its roof and driver side door almost completely destroyed, video footage from the scene showed. ‘‘The picture of the crime looks like it was a planned act of terrorism,’’ interior ministry spokesman Artem Shevchenko told local media. The military prosecutor said his office would lead an investigation. Police said a female passerby with shrapnel wounds to her legs received medical treatment after the explosion, as did an elderly man who suffered shrapnel wounds to his neck. According to the defence ministry, Shapoval was a colonel in military intelligence. The Ukrainian Pravda newspaper quoted law enforcement sources saying he had headed a special forces unit. Yury Butusov, editor of the Censor.net news website, said in a Facebook post that Shapoval’s unit had fought in eastern Ukraine, where a conflict with Russia backed separatists that broke out in 2014 has killed more than 10,000 people. He claimed Russian intelligence could have killed Shapoval. Shapoval’s death comes almost a year after prominent journalist Pavel Sheremet was killed by a similar explosion in Kiev as he drove to work. A documentary film released last month revealed evidence suggesting that Ukraine’s spy agency may have witnessed the planting of the car bomb that killed Sheremet. No one has been brought to justice in the murder case. A number of other public figures have also been assassinated in and around Kiev in recent years. Denis Voronenkov, a former Russian MP who fled to Ukraine, was shot dead in central Kiev in March. ProRussian journalist Oles Buzina was shot in a driveby in 2015, and lawyer Yuri Grabovsky, who had represented a Russian soldier captured in Ukraine, was found dead with a gunshot wound in 2016. CONGRATULATING THE EDEN PRAIRIE EAGLES (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Eden Prairie High School girls lacrosse team for recently winning their third consecutive State title. The Eagles showed perseverance and grit by overcoming an early deficit to The Blake School in the championship game. It was the ninth meeting between these two schools in the State’s final in a 10year period. Eden Prairie rallied back to win 16–10, giving them the State title. The girls’ drive for another championship led them to have a 20–1 overall record, the number one ranking in the State, finishing 19th in the country. Senior Naomi Rogge and sophomore Abby Johnson both carried the team by scoring four and six goals, respectively. These student athletes work extremely hard, Mr. Speaker, not only on the lacrosse field, but also in the classroom. Our community is very proud of their hard work and dedication, and I am delighted to share that these young women rose to the occasion and claimed yet another championship. Congratulations to the Eden Prairie Eagles on their win. 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HERKIMER COLLEGE (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of Herkimer College. Established in 1966 as New York State’s 29th community college, Herkimer College opened its doors for classes in 1967. The inaugural class consisted of 221 freshmen, and for the first 4 years, Herkimer College held classes on the upper floors of the old Remington Arms factory in Ilion, New York. In 1971, the college moved to its presentday location in the Village of Herkimer. Like the Village of Herkimer and Herkimer County, Herkimer College is proud to share its name with a Revolutionary War hero, General Nicholas Herkimer. As commander of the Tryon County Militia, General Herkimer valiantly fought at the Battle of Oriskany. To honor General Herkimer and Herkimer County’s rich history, Herkimer College’s athletic teams are nicknamed the Generals. Today, Herkimer College currently enrolls over 3,000 students and boasts more than 20,000 graduates. The college offers over 40 degree programs and is consistently ranked as a top 100 community college in the Nation. Over the course of five decades, Herkimer College’s benefit to the local community is evidenced by over $75 million in economic impact in Herkimer County, annually. Today I recognize Herkimer College for an exceptional 50 years and offer my best wishes for many, many successful decades to come. f 
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED FUNDING TO VETTED WATER RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about something called congressionally directed spending when it comes to Army Corps projects. I have a bill, which is called the REPAIR Act, which would make a limited change to the House rules definition to allow Congress to direct funding to vetted water resource development projects of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. The REPAIR Act does not authorize or appropriate any new funds for these projects, which comprises just onehalf of 1 percent of our overall annual discretionary spending, and stays exclusively within the budget cap set by Congress. After several years of divided government, almost every Member of Congress here has experienced the direct correlation between our inability to provide for these projects over the executive agencies, especially as it pertains to these essential public works projects. The REPAIR Act is a zerocost solution to this problem that will simply allow Congress to respond to the water resource infrastructure needs of their communities rather than waiting for an unelected, faceless bureaucrat in the executive branch to move on these projects. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the REPAIR Act. 
RECOGNIZING CONGREGATION MICKVE ISRAEL (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Congregation Mickve Israel in Savannah, Georgia, as it celebrates its incredible 284th anniversary on July 11, 2017. Just 5 months after General James Oglethorpe settled the colony, Jewish settlers fleeing persecution in Europe arrived in Georgia. They sought refuge in Savannah, where they were free to practice their beliefs. This brave group soon founded the Congregation Mickve Israel. Predating our country by several decades as the first congregation in the South, Mickve Israel set an important precedent for the Jewish people. As such, wars, plagues, and religious struggles each challenged the congregation over the years, yet Mickve 
Israel has withstood the test of time. It continues to be a beacon for the faithful and now welcomes 380 families inside its walls. The story of Mickve Israel is special to the people and has been recognized for its achievement since its early years. President George Washington sent a personal letter to the congregation to honor its members and wish them well. Since then, numerous Presidents over the years have made similar gestures, each one acknowledging the congregation’s longevity and importance to the Jewish community. I would also like to acknowledge the congregation’s importance and congratulate Congregation Mickve Israel in reaching this impressive milestone. I know this religious community will continue to serve a caring, faithful, and integral role in Savannah, Georgia. 
b1645 OPIOID ADDICTION CRISIS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURPHY ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I am joined by a number of Members here to talk about one of the most insidious problems our Nation has faced in a long time. It is the problem of opioid abuse. We are in a crisis mode. We have now reached a point where we will have more deaths from drug overdoses this year than there are names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington. That is a frightening concept. There is almost no county, no State in America, that is not affected by this. Some areas have much more. Places in eastern Kentucky, southern West Virginia and up the Ohio Valley, and places in New England and out West have seen this as a growing problem as death rates rise. There are things we can do about this. But in order to have some discussion of what we can do about this, we are going to talk about how we got to this problem and then what we can do to go beyond that. I want to start off by yielding to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, to talk about what this means in one State alone, the State of Oregon. Mr. WALDEN. I thank the gentleman, who chairs our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee and is so passionate in not only finding a solution to the opioid epidemic, but also his great work on mental health reform as well, as was passed into law in the 21st Century Cures legislation. As you know, the year before, the Energy and Commerce Committee also passed legislation to begin to address this issue. We will be doing a lot of work, going forward, to look at what is working on the ground and what is not. Addiction, as you well know from your clinical experience, is an equal opportunity destroyer. It is a crisis that doesn’t pick parties. It doesn’t pick people because of their race, age, or socioeconomic status. We all know someone impacted by the opioid epidemic. It has literally touched every corner of our country and every community in our States. The epidemic has hit close to home in my home State of Oregon, where more people now die from drug overdoses than from deaths in automobile accidents. I have met with community leaders, first responders, doctors, police officers, patients, and those on the front lines of this fight against opioid addiction. At roundtables throughout the Second District of Oregon, I have heard firsthand accounts of the impact of the opioid epidemic. It didn’t matter if I was in a rural eastern Oregon community or a more populated city in southern Oregon. The tragic stories were all too similar and all too familiar. Medical professionals across Oregon told me about the rapid acceleration of the opioid epidemic over the last 20 years. They have witnessed patient after patient fall into the traps of addiction. I heard from Oregonians who have struggled with the epidemic themselves. At our roundtable, a woman in Hermiston talked about how she became addicted to painkillers. After a minor foot injury, she got a prescription for an opioidbased painkiller. In her decadeslong battle with this addiction—trying to get off of this addiction—she was forced to travel more than 5 hours into Washington State just to find a provider who could help her with Suboxone and get off of her addiction. There was nobody locally who could help her. I heard from a father whose son was a high school athlete. He was prescribed opioids after a sports injury. Tragically, he became addicted. Soon, he transitioned to what we know as a cheaper and more deadly version of the drug known as heroin. Sadly, this young man would not survive his addiction. He died from heroin. It devastated the family and stole another American in the prime of his life. This story is repeated all too often. Combating the opioid epidemic in Oregon and every State of the union is going to require a real bipartisan team effort to continue, from elected officials with the input from healthcare experts and those on the front line of this fight in our local communities. In the Energy and Commerce Committee, we stand shouldertoshoulder, all of us together, saying: What can we do more to help in this crisis; to seize the opportunity before us; to look at the legislation that was enacted in the last Congress to make sure that the grants are getting to the ground, as they are in my State; and that we are getting the help and that it is actually working? It is one thing to pass a bill. It is another to make sure it is implemented correctly and that it actually works effectively. I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania, Chairman MURPHY , for the work that he is doing on this and the compassion he has for those families who are tragically caught up in this addiction. Together, we are going to find our way through it. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman for his passion and hard work on the Energy and Commerce Committee. We know this is a lifeanddeath issue. This is one of those things where Members are coming together from both sides of the aisle to deal with. Let me lay out the background here. How did we get here? About 80 percent of addictions begin with a prescription. When we see what has happened here on this chart of heroin increased use and prescription opioids, there is something that occurred at the beginning of this millennium where things really began to take off. On this next poster, seeing here how this is increasing at such a rate—about 9 or 10 percent—it is understandable you are looking at some of these rates increasing severalfold just in the last decade, with increasing jumps. As fentanyl has gotten here, it is even worse. Back in 1980, Dr. Hershel Jick, a Boston doctor, wrote a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine, and he said this: ‘‘Out of nearly 40,000 patients given powerful pain drugs in a Boston hospital, only four addictions were documented.’’ Since he published that letter, it has been cited again about 600 times. Doctors, academics, pharmaceutical companies, and others use it as evidence of the unlikeliness of developing addiction. But it has been criticized soundly, saying that never should have been said. In fact, The New England Journal of Medicine took the unusual step of posting a onesentence warning over the socalled Porter and Jick letter to the editor that the Journal published in 1980, and it says: ‘‘For reasons of public health, readers should be aware that this letter has been heavily and uncritically cited as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.’’ Accompanying this note was an analysis from Canadian researchers exploring the frequency the letter had been cited, which was almost 600 times. Here is the tragedy of this. Many physicians and many pharmaceutical companies said: See, prescribe these opioids; people will be okay. That was found not to be the case. Jump ahead to 2001, when The Joint Commission released their pain management standards, and then shortly after that the American Medical Association said: let’s make pain one of the 
vital signs. The other vital signs being blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. But when pain was also made one of those as well, doctors began asking questions about that, and basically screening people along the lines of: On a scale of 1 to 10, what is your pain level? Everything else is measured with an instrument objectively, but pain is subjective. In fact, it is so subjective that it was found that 51 percent of people who are on an opioid have a mood disorder, such as depression or anxiety. There is a huge amount there. The thing about this, if a person fails to screen for presence of a mood disorder, along with other aspects, you really increase their risk for addiction. About 50 million Americans, for example, have low back pain. Twenty five million of those are on an opioid. Of that group, about 40 percent have been found to have depression. If you combine depression and opioid use, you could triple or quadruple your risk for misuse, abuse, and addiction. It would make sense that before a doctor prescribes in these cases, concurrently they would also be screening for mood disorders. That does not appear to be the case. Here is another part of the problem. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospital payments are tied to patient pain satisfaction surveys, which reward hospitals financially when patients give them a high rating for managing pain. In turn, the hospitals get less money if the patient says: my pain was not handled. That is actually question 14 of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey. It asks the question: How often did the hospital or provider do everything in their power to control your pain? Doctors feared negative responses, as did many hospitals, and it was found that probably had an impact on increasing prescriptions. Another part of the problem is treatment access. Quite frankly, if you want to get help, you can’t find it. Unfortunately, getting access to highquality treatment is unlikely in the United States. Of the 27 million Americans suffering from addiction, less than 1 percent receive evidencebased treatment. We have a shortage of trained providers, and half the counties in America have no psychologists, no psychiatrists, and no clinical social workers. Let me add to this also that medicationassisted treatment is one of those things put up here as a treatment method. If I show you here, medicationassisted treatment is when a person is replacing their illegal drug with something like methadone or Suboxone, which Chairman WALDEN  just referred to. But here is part of the problem. It is supposed to be the doctor writing the prescription and then the patient is getting other treatment. But as is found with medicationassisted treatment, just in Pennsylvania alone, nearly 60 percent had no counseling in the year they received the buprenorphine. Forty percent were not drugtested in the year they received the buprenorphine. This is important because a person may receive a prescription but still remain on heroin or another drug. Thirtythree percent have between two to five different prescribers writing them a prescription for this. Where do all those prescriptions go? This is one of the top diverted drugs. Many times, the patients simply take those drugs, sell them, and buy the street drugs. Twentyfour percent of those buprenorphine prescriptions didn’t see a physician in the prior 30 days. In other words, with medicationassisted treatment, we simply have a failure to provide other treatment and a low expectation for improvement, in many cases thinking we will replace one addiction with another. Another part is in the area of hospital care. When treating opioid and heroin addiction, inpatient and residential treatment is crucial for full recovery, but there are simply not enough treatment centers and beds. Today, our Nation suffers a shortage of 100,000 inpatient treatment beds. Further, we don’t have enough providers. When we do have providers, many times they end up overprescribing. There was a law in the United States back in the Nixon era called 42 C.F.R., consolidated federal registry. Basically, it made it so that physicians could not find out in the record if a patient was on other opioids, in treatment for that, or taking buprenorphine or methadone. So what happened? Someone shows up in the emergency room, they are in pain, perhaps a doctor looks in the record and doesn’t see anything there, and writes a prescription. If that person was in treatment and was recovering from an addiction, and at that point not taking other drugs, look at what just happened. The doctor may prescribe some opioids for that patient who was used to taking quite a few at any given time to have an effect. Now they have this, and they are no longer thinking: I will take just one or two. They may take more. So you risk overdose. The second thing you do is risk a relapse. That person was perhaps clean for months or years. Now they have OxyContin or some other opioid, they take it, and they have a relapse. But there is a third problem that goes with that, and that is the person may be on other drugs, such as benzodiazepines or other respiratory suppressants, and that becomes a problem because then the doctor doesn’t know about drug interactions. So we have this law in place which prohibits sharing of information about substance abuse treatment between doctors. Doctors unknowingly prescribe these for people. It causes more problems. We need to deal with this. Another level here is fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid which is a staggering 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. It has a high potential for abuse. A mere 2 milligrams is fatal. A single packet of sweetener for your coffee is 1,000 milligrams. Take two of those and that is enough to kill you. Since last 2013, fentanyl has contributed to at least 5,000 overdose deaths in the U.S., and that is soaring. However, due to gaps in the data collections, it is likely the number of overdose deaths in the U.S. is actually much higher. A lowcost, highprofit, hardtodetect profile of fentanyl is increasingly more trafficked to traffickers and relatively easy to manufacture. China is a major part of this, in that the illegally manufactured fentanyl shipped to the U.S. via labs in Mexico, smuggled across the border, then hits our streets. One other thing I want to point out here, in terms of this problem. If we look at what some have analyzed in terms of areas that are hotspots for substance abuse, you can see in here for persons on disability, look at the sections in Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, along the Mississippi Valley, up the Ohio Valley, and parts out West. This isn’t the only causal factor. Many times you have people on disability and pain, and what happens is they may be prescribed opioids as part of that. When you look here, where ageadjusted death rates occur for drug poisoning—those overdose deaths—look at the hotspots in America. It is just about the same out here in the MississippiOhio Valley, portions out West, where you have these problems. All of these come together in terms of crime, in terms of drug cartels, in terms of fentanyl, in terms of poor access to treatment. I mentioned the hospital beds. By the way, over half the counties in America have no psychiatrist, no psychologist, no social worker, and no licensed drug treatment provider. b1700 It is no wonder we are in this mess. We will talk more about some solutions here, but I wanted to recognize a number of Members who might want to talk about this. Let me first go to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). Representative CARTER is also a pharmacist. Let’s hear some of his perspective. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the gentleman for hosting this Special Order. This is certainly a very important subject, one that I am very familiar with. It is indeed an epidemic in our country. There is not a State nor a district that hasn’t been touched by this problem. Countless people have succumbed to this issue. That issue is the 
use of opioids and the devastating impact on our communities. Recent data showed that overdose deaths have jumped by over 50 percent in the decade leading up to 2015. In addition, nearly 1,300 people died in Georgia in 2015 from drug overdoses. These are statistics that need to be urgently addressed. We have made great progress with the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, but we have an opportunity to do more. One staggering statistic is that last year it is estimated that roughly 60,000 people died from drug overdoses—a number that is far too high. Just earlier this month, four people in central Georgia died in a matter of 2 days due to opioid overdoses from falsely labeled drugs. That instance is not only troubling because it reflects growing painkiller use in the rural parts of my State, but because it also represents another problem: counterfeit and fake drugs. An issue that I have been working on is the growing trend of drugs and drug ingredients being ordered abroad and delivered through the mail to addresses around the country. A recent Wall Street Journal article mentioned the synthetic opioids that are being brought into this country and the methods by which they are doing it. An example of one of those drugs is fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is wreaking havoc across the country. We must not only look at the types of drugs that are being used, but also how people are acquiring them and how to effectively limit that. Our enforcement personnel are working diligently with the Postal Service to find ways to curb this trend, such as using advanced data. But it is a topic that needs more work. By cutting off their ability to purchase these dangerous synthetic opioids, we can help to limit this epidemic. As a lifelong pharmacist, I have seen firsthand the dangers and problems associated with opioid abuse and its impact on our communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to counter this trend in hopes of saving lives. Again, I want to thank the gentleman for hosting this tonight. It is so very vital to our country. Thank you for allowing me to speak. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. As a pharmacist, when people come into the pharmacy, for example, if they want to get Sudafed, a cold medication, they have to go through some special process. It is behind counter. Is that right? Mr. CARTER of Georgia. That is correct. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Now, what if they wanted to pick up an opioid prescription? Do they have to show an ID? Are they required by law to have the same kind of restrictions? Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Yes, they are. They have to show an ID in order to pick it up. Now, the prescription itself is a C2 prescription, so if we don’t recognize them at the pharmacy, we have to ask them for their ID to make sure that is indeed the person who is picking it up. We also have a program in Georgia, in fact, a program that you are very familiar with, a prescription drug monitoring program, that allows us to go and check a database to see if that person has actually been doctor shopping or is pharmacy shopping and getting it at other places. That has helped us. It is a great tool in fighting this epidemic. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. But as the gentleman knows, that is data within the State, but across State lines, that data is still not populated. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. That is one of the major problems. For instance, in my practice, I practiced in Savannah, Georgia, which is on the South Carolina line, and only 2 hours from the Florida State line. That was a constant problem for us. I could look at my data all day long, but I wouldn’t know whether they had gotten something filled in South Carolina or in Florida. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I appreciate that. That is a problem we are going to have to fix in our committee. I want to call up the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON ), eastern Ohio. Speaking of being able to jump across State lines and have prescriptions filled, minutes away from the Pennsylvania/West Virginia border, could travel down there, and also part of that deadly area along the Ohio Valley where so much of this is occurring. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. JOHNSON . Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I want to thank my colleague, Representative MURPHY , for holding this Special Order on such a critically important topic. And you mention that my district borders the State of Pennsylvania, and it does. And I have had so many incidents of engagement with my constituents on the opioid addiction issue. Several of them really stick out. Representative MURPHY , one of those happened in Pennsylvania. Occasionally, because my district goes all the way up to the top into northeast Ohio, occasionally I fly in and out of Pennsylvania. I was there a couple of years ago, and I was sitting in the lounge waiting for a flight. I happened to be on a phone call, and I noticed that a gentleman began to look my direction. He very patiently waited until I got off the telephone, and then he came over, introduced himself. He recognized me, and he said: I am not one of your constituents, but I know that you represent a district just across the border in Ohio. He said: But I want to implore you, to beg you and your colleagues in Congress, please do something about the opioid addiction. He said: Our 21 yearold son died of an overdose in January. He had just gotten out of a rehab, was doing well, had gotten a job. He came home one Friday night, said he was going out with some friends. The next morning his mother and I found him dead in his room. I hear stories like that all of the time. I can tell you that the opioid addiction epidemic that is streaking across our country is not one that we are going to be able to arrest our way out of. It is not one that we are going to be able to incarcerate our way out of. It is an issue, my dear colleagues, that is going to take everybody from the top to the bottom, from the President of the United States all the way down to the family members. I am talking about local government officials, law enforcement, the judiciary, faithbased organizations, community organizations. This is something we are going to have to all be engaged in. We have appropriated, as you know, Representative MURPHY , hundreds of millions of dollars, billions, in fact, to attack the opioid epidemic. More is needed. We are not going to be able to simply throw money at this problem. It is going to require a cultural change within our country. I have so many other stories, but I don’t want to take up more time because I know I have other colleagues here who want to testify on this very important issue. Just know that I am with you. We take this issue very seriously in our district. Back in Ohio, we are constantly reaching out to law enforcement, mental health providers, healthcare providers, faith and communitybased organizations, and families on how to attack this problem. I thank you for giving me a chance to speak on it. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman from Ohio. I want to next recognize the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON ). Certainly he sees this issue, too. As I mentioned before, one of the problems physicians have, if they do not know what kind of prescriptions that person is on, for example, a medical record may show if a person has an allergy to penicillin or something, but you may have no idea that that patient may, for example, be taking buprenorphine or methadone unless they tell you or you test for it. And as a surgeon, what happens when they go to get anesthesia and the complications come from that, but it is part of the reasons why we have to make sure that you as a physician have access to these records, things we can clean up. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON ). Mr. BUCSHON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this Special Order tonight to talk about this really important subject on behalf of the American people. The opioid abuse disorder and drug addiction have impacted every community in our Nation. The epidemic knows know boundaries; does not discriminate based on age, gender, or socioeconomic status. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 91 American lives are lost every day from an opioid 
abuse overdose. Unfortunately, drug overdoses in Indiana have increased fivefold over the past decade, and southern Indiana and the Wabash Valley, the area I represent, are bearing the brunt of this devastation. This year in Vigo County, Indiana, population around 108,000 citizens, authorities have responded to over 16 opioid or heroininduced overdoses already this year. Vanderburgh County, Indiana, 182,000 citizens, saw 29 deaths from overdose in 2016, which is a fourfold increase from the prior year. This year, the county has seen 25 confirmed heroin or fentanylrelated overdoses already, but the coroner thinks it may be more. Just this month, we have seen reports of instances of an opioidbased drug called gray death in Evansville, Indiana. We are working here in Congress with our States and local communities to finally bring relief to these families, but a lot of work has to be done. While we still have much to do, over the past couple of years, we have actually made significant progress to bring hope to our communities and expand access to treatment for those who need it. I was proud to be part of our efforts that we put into law, the landmark legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, and I had the opportunity to author a portion of CARA that expanded access to medicationassisted opioid use disorder treatment, ensure patients have wider access to more comprehensivebased treatment options, and helped minimize the potential for diversion. As Congressman MURPHY mentioned, the key here is ongoing therapy, counseling, and monitoring. Medicationassisted treatment is not a panacea, but it is a component of a more comprehensive treatment plan for each individual. Through our work in implementing the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress has provided significant funding for the States. In fact, Indiana recently was granted nearly $11 million from the Department of Health and Human Services to help us with this epidemic. Again, most of us know someone, a family member, a friend, a neighbor, who has been impacted by this epidemic in some way. As a physician, I have seen the power of addiction up close and have focused on shaping real policy solutions here in Washington, D.C., to improve access to treatment for patients who are battling their problem every day. We all share in this fight, and we can’t end this epidemic through policy changes alone. It is ongoing, and it is going to take all of us working together as a community to meet this challenge. In that respect, I have met with and have been working with people who represent medical schools and residency programs in our country to help better educate the physician on prescribing habits as it relates to pain, whether that is surgical pain or chronic pain. It is a multifaceted approach, and I commend Congressman MURPHY  for his dedication to helping end this crisis in our country, and I thank him for yielding. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for his impassioned words and dedication here. I want to refer back to my map here a moment. Dr. BUCSHON was referring to his district in southern Indiana here, which, on this 2014 map, was already showing high mortality rates for those who have drug overdoses. Look here in the State of Washington, also an area that, on this 2014 map, showed a lot of problems, and now the problem is getting worse. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ) to speak on this issue. b1715 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership on this important issue and for the opportunity to address the House on this very important topic. Mr. Speaker, as you have heard, our Nation is facing an epidemic. Over the past two decades, opioid overdoses have quadrupled. Think about that. They have quadrupled in the United States. My home State, as Dr. Murphy has just mentioned, has faced significant increases in drug overdose death rates, including a 70 percent increase in synthetic opioid overdose deaths in just the last 10 years. It is clear that this is a crisis, which is why we in Congress are committed to combating this growing epidemic. Late last year, Congress passed sweeping legislation, called the 21st Century Cures Act. It was bipartisan legislation that authorized $6.3 billion in funding to bring our healthcare innovation infrastructure into the 21st century. This legislation included $1 billion for opioid intervention and prevention treatment programs throughout all 50 States. Earlier this spring, the Federal Government began awarding grants in order to confront this crisis, including $11.7 million to the State of Washington. While these funds will help expand treatment options, there is still much more work to be done at the Federal level, which is why I cosponsored legislation like H.R. 1057, the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention, or STOP, Act. Designed to stop dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl, which you heard about, and carfentanil from being shipped through our borders, this legislation will combat bad actors from China and India who have been taking advantage of weaknesses in international mail security standards to break U.S. customs laws and really wreak havoc on our communities. This is just one step of the opioid crisis that we must address. We need to combat the illicit drugs coming into this country as well as equip doctors, nurses, and first responders with the resources they need to treat pain appropriately. We also need to support better access to care for individuals suffering from psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. And, most importantly, we must ensure these drugs are not falling into the hands of our Nation’s children. My colleagues in Congress and I are committed to combating this epidemic to keep it from causing further harm to our Nation’s families and communities. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s comments and his dedication to helping his State of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), whose district is just north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to talk about some of the problems, in his experience, and his thoughts about what we should be doing about substance abuse. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his long work in this field, not just the last 2 years but, really, a lifetime in this space. I commend him for that work. Also, with mental health issues, he has been helping educate Congress about moving toward solutions. My colleague has outlined the scope of the national problem we have, and each of us can talk about our respective districts and what has been going on there. In my district, just over the border from my colleague’s, western Pennsylvania has been especially hard hit. In Beaver County, we saw 102 overdose deaths related to opioids in 2016, up from 30 in 2013. In Cambria County, we lost 94 people to overdose deaths in 2016, a startling 62 percent increase from 2015. The stories just keep coming. A story of the mother who lost her 10th child, her youngest child, to this epidemic, who insisted that the words ‘‘damn heroin’’ be put in her son’s obituary. Or the couple we learned about before Christmas, who overdosed, and 3 days later their infant died from neglect, all three being found 4 days after that. Mr. Speaker, it is all hands on deck to address this crisis. We are coming together at the Federal, State, and community level to develop a comprehensive strategy to stop this epidemic and to share best practices at every level. That is what a big part of our Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, passed last year, was all about—an important first step. Another asset we have, Mr. Speaker, is the Office of National Drug Control Policy. This week, I led a bipartisan group of my colleagues, in a letter to President Trump requesting that the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy be reelevated to a Cabinetlevel position. Since its inception, this Office has played a central and critical role in fighting drug trafficking and drug addiction. Both the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy and its Director have played, and should continue to play, a central role in this effort. The Office was created in 1988 with the AntiDrug Abuse Act. Its mission is to fight the Nation’s drug problem through three areas: prevention, addiction recovery, and enforcement. The Office’s Director, commonly referred to as the ‘‘drug czar,’’ was elevated to the Cabinet in 1993 by President Clinton, who wanted to raise the Office’s profile in order to coordinate and emphasize legislative efforts on the Hill. More importantly, he wanted to focus and emphasize efforts within the administration for the antidrug efforts of the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Obama administration removed the Office from the position it had in the Cabinet. When it comes to drug addiction as well as to the illicit drug trade occurring across our southern border, the challenges have never been greater. This is no time to retreat in our efforts, and it is time to restore the Office of National Drug Control Policy to the Cabinet. The Office is a very important part of the fight against the opioid epidemic, particularly because it plays a crucial role in coordinating efforts at various levels of government. In addition to the legislation that we are passing here in Congress, the administration has a crucial role to play, as do leaders at the State and local level. We all want to end this crisis, and this common cause unites us, perhaps more than any other issue, across party and partisan lines. Again, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for giving me this opportunity, and I thank him for his work in this area. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend for his dedication on this issue. And, yes, he is right: we have to cross party lines and work on this together. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), another friend, who has seen these problems, as well, in his district and knows full well how these problems have merged well into the Ohio area, as it is an insidious problem. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in this most important area. Mr. Speaker, the heroin and opioid scourge is running this country into the ground, and, unfortunately, the problem appears to be getting worse, not better. That grim reality is particularly true in my district in Cincinnati, where, during a single week last summer, city health officials reported 174 overdoses in 1 week. Deaths caused by opioids have doubled in my district, where, during the first 4 months in 2017, the Hamilton County Coroner’s Office had already logged in hundreds and hundreds of opioid overdoses—heartbreaking numbers. But numbers only tell part of the story. The circumstances surrounding the spike in overdoses can, at times, be horrifying. A couple of months ago, in Cincinnati, Ohio, a 9yearold girl called 911 about both of her parents, who overdosed on heroin in their SUV. She told the dispatcher she was scared and that her parents wouldn’t wake up. The girl didn’t know where she was or what was wrong with her parents, but she, fortunately, knew how to call 911. That call saved her parents’ lives. But no little girl—or little boy, for that matter—should ever be placed in that situation by their parents, or by anyone. These types of stories are becoming all too common. Opioids don’t discriminate based on age or race or socioeconomic class. Opioids can kill anyone, in any neighborhood. Every day, there are more headlines about how heroin and other opioids are basically taking over the country. The simple fact is that nearly every Member of Congress could come to the floor today and share a similar story from their own district. That is why, Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we work together to find new and more successful ways to combat the opioid epidemic. We need to put politics aside and help people in need. Last year, we came together in a bipartisan manner to pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, and I think there is a good chance that the expanded treatment and recovery options that legislation created will help some of those suffering from addiction to turn their lives around. While CARA will give local law enforcement and healthcare officials more resources to fight opioid addiction, we need additional legislation to help combat the importation into the United States of extremely dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl and carfentanil, which many have blamed for the spike of heroin overdoses. According to the DEA, much of the supply of these two dangerous drugs on our streets originates overseas, particularly from China and India. Bipartisan legislation is being led by Representative TIBERI and Senator PORTMAN , the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention, or STOP, Act. It would update the customs process to require that advanced electronic notice of all packages, large or small, be provided to Customs officials. Providing this information to Customs before the packages arrive will help them, meaning the Customs agency, to intercept more illegal shipments and prevent these dangerous drugs from reaching drug traffickers within our borders. I am hopeful that this legislation will be embraced with the same bipartisan enthusiasm that we saw with CARA because the heroin and opioid problem in this country is too serious, too significant, and too widespread for us not to work together at every level of government to find a solution to this epidemic. It is way overdue. We need to work together in a bipartisan manner about this. I again want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership in this area. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio. I point also on this map here to the Cincinnati area in southern Ohio, which is one of the hot spots in 2014 that has continued to grow as a problem. We recognize this is both a local problem and a nationwide problem. I want to tell a story here. Last December, when the President was signing into law the 21st Century Cures Act, which included my legislation, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, a former State Senator from West Virginia took the stage to introduce it. David Grubb talked about his daughter, Jessie, who, herself, had been in rehab, in treatment, something like three or four times, had had several drug overdose instances and had been revived. But what happened to her also is part of what they called the loaded gun that never should have happened. She went into the hospital for some surgery, but the doctors and nurses never told her discharging doctor that she was in recovery for heroin addiction. The point we made before about the NASPA list, or the other lists there, or the 42 C.F.R., blocks information from going into the medical record. So while someone was out to protect her privacy, they didn’t protect her from death. She was given a prescription of 50 opioid painkillers. Remember, I said before that when a person is given this prescription, they run the risk of relapse, overdose, or bad drug interactions. In her case, it was an overdose that finally took her life—another important reason why we have to deal with this 42 C.F.R. and get rid of that arcane and, quite frankly, deadly law. Let me talk about some other recommendations of what I believe Congress can do to help. The references made before by Dr. BUCSHON and others about the prescription drug monitoring program—and also BUDDY CARTER of Georgia mentioned this, too—where a pharmacist or a physician can say, ‘‘Is this person on other opioids? Have they jumped across the border? Have they seen four, five, or more physicians for some opiates?’’ by having a better PDMP, prescription drug monitoring program, or National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting program, we have to make sure that all States use the same system and that it collects data from across borders so doctors can easily see this. But part of this, too, in dealing with the 42 C.F.R., is understanding Federal 
law prohibits including buprenorphine and methadone in the PDMP. How absurd and how cruel that is that a doctor would not even be able to know that a patient is taking one of those prescriptions. Also, some of these drugs can end up being a respiratory suppressant, and when the patient takes another drug such as benzodiazapine, it can add to that effect and add to further complications. Another aspect, too, which we must be further engaged with is vigorous public education programs across all age groups, beginning with early elementary school. b1730 When schools have some of these programs—and we will bring forth some models that talk about these programs in a future hearing I will be holding in the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee—these are very, very important to help students, early on, understand the dangers of this. This is not just recreation, but it is so easy to slip into addiction. Given that 80 percent of drug abuse begins with a prescription, whether it is a student, athlete, perhaps a football player who injures a leg or something and he is given some of these drugs, it is essential the whole family be counseled from the onset, understanding the concerns and dangers of continuing to take these drugs. We also have to have drug takeback programs and public education programs stressing the importance of proper disposal of unused opiates and pain prescriptions to prevent them from being stolen or misused. For example, if a family is selling their home and they are having an open house and strangers come into the house and while they are there they say, ‘‘Can I use your restroom?’’ and the family lets them do that, don’t be surprised if that person has no intention of buying a house but does have an intention of going into the bathrooms and checking the medicine cabinets and finding any medication and taking it. Also, when teens come over to the house for parties or socializing, don’t be surprised if they also go into medicine cabinets, look in drawers in the bathrooms or drawers in other places of the house looking for some of those drugs which they, themselves, will take or sell. We have to make sure we have vigorous patient education programs about doctorprescribed opioids to make sure people know about that before the addiction takes foot. And taking one of these prescriptions may only take 3 or 4 weeks before it begins to kick in and cause problems. I know myself, back in 2005, I was in a rollover accident in Iraq with a couple of other Members of Congress. Our vehicle rolled, and as a result of that accident, I ended up having a mild concussion, snapping my neck, having some temporary paralysis, and a great deal of pain. Well, battlefield medicine is one that gets you out of the area, stops the bleeding, stops the pain, and ships you off to some other hospital, and that was the case for me. But I know what happens. Everywhere I landed in a helicopter or an ambulance, appropriately so, the physicians would ask me a number of orienting questions, but also say: ‘‘Are you in pain? On a scale of 1 to 10, how much pain are you in?’’ And when I proceeded to say that number, immediately, as they would do for many other people in the battlefield, they would administer morphine or some other pain reliever and move you on from there. What happened, though, returning to the United States, where pain continued for me, I was prescribed some pills for that pain, but I was also prescribed fentanyl. Never once was it ever described to me: ‘‘Be careful with this. This is highly addictive. This is a problem.’’ Now, after a few weeks on this and recognizing it was hard to even do my job because I couldn’t keep my head clear, I just said: ‘‘That it is. I am not taking this anymore.’’ But at that point, my body had already begun to develop some tolerance for this, and when I stopped taking it, I had some reaction. Granted, it was not as severe as some of those who have been taking these drugs at a higher dosage and longer, but I could feel myself actually saying I understand what people mean when they say their skin feels like it is peeling off of them and they feel a sense of nausea and other problems as well. Now, I can’t even imagine what it is like for someone who is taking higher doses for longer periods of time. But it is extremely important that, every time a prescription is written, pharmacists have an opportunity to counsel patients and doctors are also doing more than simply passing out a prescription. Pharmacists should do what BUDDY  CARTER was saying before: make sure they have the person showing a photo ID. Is this, indeed, a prescription they are picking up for themselves or claiming they have it for someone else? Perhaps that prescription was stolen from someone. We have to make sure that we also understand, for those out there trying to legalize marijuana, I caution you, because the marijuana that is out there on the streets or presented in many areas can cause tremendous psychiatric problems for those who are already at risk. The longer you are on some of the types of marijuana, the greater risk you have for things like delusional behavior. We have to make sure we also eliminate Medicaid payments for those question 14 responses I made reference to before when you are in the hospital to ask if the hospital adequately addressed your pain. In the area of treatment and recovery, we have to expand the mental health workforce. As I said before, half the counties in America have no psychiatrists, no psychologists, no drug and alcohol counselors, and those who are out there likely have their schedule so filled, they don’t even have room to treat someone. Not all of them even know how to treat addictive disorders. The fact that a majority of people who may have an addiction disorder also have a concurrent mental health disorder is another reason why we have to increase this workforce by tens of thousands. Just for child and adolescent psychiatrists alone, we need another 21,000 of those. We need tens of thousands more psychologists. It is important that the schools of medicine, schools of psychology, and schools of social work are graduating more people with these degrees and getting them into our workforce. I have had legislation before, and we passed some things in the 21st Century Cures Act and in my Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, to provide more funding so that more of these folks can continue with their education. It is essential. It is like trying to fight a war without soldiers, trying to fight this war, which is killing more people every year than the entire war in Vietnam, but we do not have the soldiers to fight this. We also have to make sure that, with regard to the governmentsponsored medicationassisted treatment which I referred to before, we cannot simply rely on synthetic opioid maintenance alone. We have to make sure there are requirements to have that person in counseling and treatment. I have heard from some persons that go to those treatment programs that they have no counseling at all, and some have great counseling. In some cases, sitting in the waiting room, perhaps a nurse or someone simply checks up on them: ‘‘What are you doing? How are you doing?’’ That is considered and written down as group therapy. That is not acceptable in any way, shape, or form. We need 100,000 more inpatient psychiatric beds, and we have to make sure insurance companies recognize that an addictive disorder is a chronic disorder. Simply giving someone a weekend or a few days for withdrawal and then putting them back on the street is not an answer. That is why we have to encourage private insurance companies and Medicaid and Medicare. And I say Medicare because a large number of people who are having some of these problems are also the elderly. We have to make sure that we increase the availability of fastacting opiate blockers for first responders, such as Narcan. But let’s keep this in mind: In some cases, we hear of some of those pushers of these drugs who also give an accompanying dosage of Narcan, recognizing that the drug will bring that person to a neardeath experience. 
We have heard from first responders and others, law enforcement, where someone may actually have a party where someone will remain there expecting that someone will actually have an overdose and die in order to bring them back to life. That is how some of these people are seeking some of those experiences. We have to make sure that States review their laws, as some are doing, that if you take one of these opiates and you do have that neardeath experience, perhaps that should be treated the same as a suicide attempt, that that person is in imminent danger of harming themselves or someone else and perhaps determine if they need an inpatient psychiatric stay. We have to make sure we have support of employment for those in recovery to break the cycle of recovery and reexposure. Many times, persons who are trying to stay clean, they can’t get a job because they can’t pass the drug test, so they may be in a job and have exposure to other people who still end up with substance abuse. We have to make sure they have higher standards and increased accountability for payment models that require evidencebased treatment in halfway houses, threequarter houses, and residential treatment facilities. We have to deploy certified addiction counselors to emergency rooms because we know that, when a person comes to an emergency room, if they see an addiction counselor there, they are not just simply given a business card and told, ‘‘Call someone next week and we hope you get treatment’’; but if they see an addiction counselor in the emergency room, they increase their chances of followup by 50 percent, according to a Michigan study. We must make sure the FDA is working with companies to find alternatives to opioids and that, again, Medicaid and other physicians are educated on some of those aspects. Physician training has to also be ramped up: require them to have training in opioid prescribing practices on risk for addiction and abuse and prescribing limited dosages. Instead of prescribing dosages for a month, perhaps just a couple of days. In many cases, they are not adequately trained in alternatives to opioids and the potential harm of overprescribing. We have to increase training requirements for healthcare providers who deliver this medicationassisted treatment. Right now, in many cases, they only have a few hours of training, and then they can go and prescribe this and have very little, if any, training at all in drug addiction counseling. Before doctors write a prescription, we can make sure they are looking at the NASPER list or other lists as well. In the area of law enforcement, it is critical that what is called the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program is made more available, with greater access around the country. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left in our segment here? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH ). The gentleman has 7 minutes remaining. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. We have to make sure we have more border security so that we are intercepting these drugs as they come across the border. We need funding for the post offices because, in many cases, unwittingly, the letter carriers are the ones who are delivering to people’s homes fentanyl and other drugs. In the incarceration system, we have to make sure we are testing inmates for the presence of drugs in their system during their incarceration. We can offer them medications which, upon discharge, actually block any effects of some of these drugs. We need to also make sure that Medicaid and other insurance companies’ payments resume immediately upon release from their incarceration to prevent them from relapsing or returning to the drug culture. We also have to make sure we have solid data collection. In many cases, when we show the charts about death rates around the country, the charts may be grossly inaccurate. In many cases first responders, paramedics, and coroners do not keep accurate data on these rates. The persons themselves may not even be tested to see if they died from a drug overdose. There are several items in here listing what we can be doing here as a nation, and there are many more. The point is we have fallen short and we have seen some problems with this. There is more that we can do and we must do in order to save lives. I know I just have about 3 minutes left, Mr. Speaker, am I correct? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) to talk about some of the issues dealing with substance abuse. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman MURPHY for his incredible leadership on this important topic and for holding this Special Order this evening. I can tell you, the citizens of the State of Ohio are paying attention. The opioid epidemic continues to intensify with over 2 million people addicted to prescription opioids and more than half a million addicted to heroin in 2015, alone. According to an estimate from The New York Times, drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50; and drug overdoses are the leading cause of accidental death in our country, with prescription opioids responsible for more than 20,000 deaths in the United States just in 2015, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. I have to mention that Medicaid plays an important role in addressing this epidemic because it is a lifeline program, providing coverage to over 650,000 nonelderly adults with opioid addiction and covering a range of treatment services. Ohio, tragically, leads the Nation in opioid overdoses in 2014. Sadly, deaths have continued to rise with increased use of heroin and fentanyl. Many States have expanded Medicaid, including Ohio, to cover adults who make a modest $16,500 a year per individual. By broadening coverage of adults, the Medicaid expansion reaches many low income adults with opioid addiction who were previously ineligible for coverage and facilitates access to treatment. The opioid epidemic is so bad that even librarians are learning how to treat overdoses for individuals who come into libraries. Mental health can be comorbid with opioid abuse, and those suffering from that duality are truly an American tragedy. For an addict to complete rehab and recovery successfully, they need to work in concert. And over half of uninsured nonelderly adults with an opioid addiction had a mental illness in the past year, with over one in five operating with a serious mental illness, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. To address the gravity of the challenge, I want to put on the RECORD the work that Lucas County, my home county, is doing with their DART program, which engages hospitals, mental health centers, and businesses in the community. Believe it or not, according to Sheriff Tharp, the DART program has helped nearly 2,300 overdose victims and has a 74 percent success rate of getting people into detox and treatment programs at a total cost of about $370 per individual. This is truly an amazing record, and I wish to include in the RECORD the information about other counties in the district that I represent. The opioid epidemic does not just affect the addicted. Lucas County Children Services is struggling to help children displaced by the opioid epidemic. The agency has been repeatedly forced to do the unimaginable tasks of comforting children as first responders work to save their parents from a heroin or fentanyl overdoses. On several occasions, it has had to break the terrible news to these children that their parents succumbed to their addiction. LCCS is also coping with a dramatic increase in the number of children placed in protective custody because their families have been blinded by substance dependence. The State’s current budget proposes no increase for this program, which is a shame. This is no time to short change children. Finally, I submit for the RECORD a story of the Guest family of Lorain, Ohio, whose daughter Tera died of a heroin overdose at the age of 24. According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer: ‘‘Tera Guest, 24, died Jan. 29, 2014, shortly after she and her sister used painkillers and a heroinfentanyl mix. Her death marked the end of a twoyear period that included stints in treatment and losing custody of her two children to her mother. 
‘‘Tera is among the hundreds who have died of overdoses within the last three years in Lorain County. The county coroner’s office said a record 67 people died in 2013, followed by 60 in 2014 and 62 in 2015.’’ Lori took her tragedy and turned it into action and formed the Lorain Community Task Force, which is a group that raises awareness and provides assistance to addicts and their families. Lori stepped up, and now Congress must do the same. We cannot turn our back on these people now. We must fight, we must work together, we must put politics aside. Only then can we begin to heal our Nation from this crisis. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ). Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this critical issue. As was laid out, communities across this country, communities like mine in northeast Wisconsin, are in the midst of a public health crisis. It is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. It is an American issue, one that should bring us all together. Opioid abuse is wreaking havoc on our homes, our schools, our churches. Its devastating effects are destroying our families and the lives of our loved ones. As was pointed out, more Americans will have died from drug overdoses in 2017 than there are names on the Vietnam War Memorial. That is alarming. That should put it into sharp relief. As a Marine veteran, I am acutely aware that servicemembers are more susceptible than the average person to addiction. In fact, veterans die from accidental drug overdoses at a 33 percent higher rate than the rest of the population, and something must be done to reverse this awful trend. I commend our State lawmakers in Wisconsin who are doing aggressive work on this front, and I commend the gentleman and everyone who has spoken out for doing the same thing at the national level, and I look forward to working with him. Because headline after headline reminds us of the tragic loss of life that has resulted from our Nation’s opioid and addictions risk, we have to step up. We have to take action. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I deeply appreciate the gentleman convening this Special Order this evening. It has been fun working with him in the past on creative, bipartisan efforts to try and make sure the Federal Government is a better partner on this. I look forward to working with him on legislation that will make it easier to be able to have the information available that people need for integrated treatment and his commitment to trying to bring people together to understand the problem and the fact that we are agreed more than we are divided on these things. I look forward to working with him on some progress in the months ahead. b1745 Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oregon, and I thank all the Members speaking here tonight. I want to say, as you saw, this was a bipartisan coalition of Members. We are much better off working hand in hand to pass legislation that changes issues than standing next to each other as pallbearers for another 59,000 people in our Nation next week. Mr. Speaker, with that and with some hope that we can pass this legislation and save some lives, I yield back the balance of my time. f

ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank all my fellow Members that are speaking up on this very important issue. I appreciate Dr. Murphy taking the lead. It is something that has not gotten enough attention. We continue to have people dying, and we need to deal with the issue. It is interesting: some people find great hope in their religious beliefs. Throughout America’s history, Christianity has been an important foundation. No, you didn’t have to be a Christian to participate in government, to be a Founder, but, as Ben Franklin said, we know because he wrote out the speech in his own handwriting immediately afterwards, as requested. So often, teachers teach that he is a Deist, as so many of the Founders, we are told, were Deists. Yet in his own words, in his own handwriting, at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, at 80 years old, 2 to 3 years away from meeting his Judge, his Maker—severe gout, arthritis, overweight, trouble getting up and down—he said these words: ‘‘I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid?’’ Franklin said, we have been—by the way, that is obviously a reference to Jesus’ comment about the sparrow, and God seeing the sparrow, watching the sparrow. But he goes on and he makes it very clear, as his own words indicate, that unless—he said: ‘‘We have been assured, sir, in the Sacred Writing that except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.’’ Again, referencing Scripture. Those are not the words—any of them—they are not the words of a Deist. So teachers that have been miseducating people for so long, I know they are just passing on what they were taught, but there has been so much miseducation for so long. Regardless of what else, we don’t try to force our religious beliefs on anyone. That is not what the House of Representatives is for. But since it formed such an important part of our founding and a part of the discussion for most of our Nation’s history, it is important to point out that those Scriptures that Ben Franklin referenced at the Constitutional Convention, the Scriptures that have been quoted so often— We know the Bible is the number one, far and away, most quoted book in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Nothing else anywhere even close. It has brought hope to people that had no hope. So it is interesting that, as our Nation moves further and further away from the source of so much hope for so much of our Nation’s history, and for those who lived through that part of our Nation’s history, the hope that Franklin Roosevelt brought to the microphone when he read the famous prayer on DDay as American soldiers were fighting, as he said, against those forces of evil, drawn from a country that was used to peace that were fighting forces of evil. But they had hope. That hope and prayer that Franklin Roosevelt gave over the microphone for several minutes now is condemned by so many. 
That hope that served as the foundation, the building blocks for the beliefs of Sam Adams, that so many around in those days gave credit as being an important foundational building block for the revolution, for the new Nation. We are arriving at a time when record numbers of people are dying. We heard today in our Judiciary hearing, I believe it was 144 Americans each day are dying of drug overdoses. Who dies of a drug overdose? People without hope, people who are drawn to drugs to provide a good, warm feeling. We have more military members killing themselves than at any time probably in any nation’s history. I don’t know that for sure, but it is just hard to imagine a time in any nation’s history when so many of its veterans are taking their own lives, a time when so many of our active military have taken their own lives. Obviously, as people have said over the years, that is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, and it is the act of someone without hope. So we know, regardless of whether people accepted Christian beliefs or not, Christianity, throughout our Nation’s founding, provided hope. The Bible provided hope for those who were slaves through the 1700s and 1800s. So many were Christians, and it was the Bible, it was those wonderful spirituals, it was Scripture that gave them hope to endure and get through the horrors of slavery. Though Abraham Lincoln bragged in his early twenties about being an infidel and not believing in God, Steve Mansfield, in his book in the last 5 years or so about Lincoln’s struggle with God, documents his going from being an infidel to a point where, as President, he read Scripture constantly. Dr. Rufus Fears, a brilliant history professor at the University of Oklahoma, asked me once: You know why Lincoln’s speeches are so good and touch our hearts? And I said: I don’t know. They are just really wellworded. They are great speeches. He said: No. He was reading so much Scripture by that point in his life, like the Gettysburg Address, he wrote his speeches as if they were Scripture. His words provided hope because he referenced Scripture so much. And whether atheist, agnostic, Muslim, Buddhist, whatever, so many have a general knowledge of what Christians believe, and it is very basic. God, according to Genesis, the Old Testament, He created the world, created the universe, created man and woman. Basically, we got the Bible as an owner’s manual, giving us important history so that we could get a good look at what works and what doesn’t, and what the owner expects, and how we can live the most joyous and hopeful life even through terrible, perilous times. Christianity goes on and, in the New Testament, points to the belief that the Old Testament, as we refer to it, points to the Messiah coming to be born in Bethlehem. So many of the prophecies about the Messiah to come. Even if one believes Jesus was not the Messiah, incredible that He could fulfill those prophecies the way He did. And Christians, as people of most religions understand, believe what John 3:16 says: ‘‘For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.’’ So, clearly, Christian religion is based completely on love; that God so loved the world, that he gave His only Son, who was perfect, unblemished with sins of the Earth. And only something—someone unblemished could take away the sins of the world. And the additional exclamation point that makes clear that Christianity is a religion based on love: it was made clear by Jesus himself when He was asked by the lawyer, naturally: What’s the greatest commandment? He said: love God, and the others like it. Love each other. And on those two commands hang all the law and the prophets. If you were to go about outlining the Ten Commandments, they easily fall under those two headings: Love God, love each other. But then Jesus also made clear: Greater love hath no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. And Jesus knew, because whether you believe he was the fulfillment of all the prophecies from the Old Testament or not, He could have escaped. He made no effort. He gave himself out of love. It is easy to say He is either a liar, or He is a lunatic, or He is exactly what He said. But his acts were based on love. He gave his life for a world that needed an unblemished lamb. b1800 With that background, Mr. Speaker— and, of course, the Supreme Court outlined it much more thoroughly in the late 1800s as it came to the conclusion well after the horrid case of Dred Scott, when the court analyzed and made clear, determined, pronounced: Even though everyone in the United States is not a Christian, this is a Christian Nation. And everything that the Court called into view in their decision testified to that fact, as the Court pronounced. Now, so why am I going into this? It is because we have hit what may be as low a point as we have ever hit in Congress. When Russell Vought was being questioned, on the same day, another person named Comey was testifying here on Capitol Hill. Russell Vought was being questioned by Senators so they could determine how they wanted to vote on whether or not he could fill a role in the administration. This low point in our Nation’s history has to rank down there as one of our low points. When so much throughout our history has testified to the fact that Christianity was such an important part of our foundation, of everything that has been good in America, the ending of slavery, driven and guided by churches. Sure, there were some atheists involved. The revolution following The Great Awakening, 1730s and 1740s, ended up yielding a revolution that produced the greatest country in the history of the world by virtue of the opportunities, by virtue of the protections for freedomloving people around the world, by virtue of, you know, the opportunities and the assets, and that a country would ultimately arise where the number one health problem for the Nation’s poor was obesity. With more opportunities, more assets, more freedoms, even then Solomon’s Israel—incredible country with many religions— celebrated here in the United States. But as General Jay Garner was told when he was in Iraq after Saddam Hussein was driven out—he has told me twice—actually, three times has said it when I heard him speaking back in 2004. I called him. He reiterated it. He told me again in last September. Yes, I remember it correctly. He talked to a direct descendant of Mohammed in Iraq about what kind of government the U.S. should help Iraq have. I will contend we shouldn’t be about nation building, but that was his order and that is what he was doing. And he said that this descendant of Mohammed with a black turban said he was going to explain in his native tongue, because they were recording it. And then after he finished, he said: Now, let me just give you, in a nutshell, what I told you we need here for a government in Iraq. We need a government formed by Iraqis, a government composed of Iraqis, and a government based on a constitution which is based on the teachings of Jesus. A descendant of Mohammed told Jay Garner that the best hope for a country was a constitution based on the teachings of Jesus, because basically those teachings of Jesus are the only way in which a nation can allow freedom of religion. No matter which religion or agnosticism, atheism, whatever religion, it is not going to be able to truly allow freedom of religion unless it is based on the teachings of Jesus. And that is what this insightful descendant of Mohammed in Iraq told retired General Jay Garner. So we get to 2017, a hearing on the same day Comey testified, this appointee nominee by President Trump, Russell Vought, a great man, a fine man, had his Christian beliefs perverted, twisted into something that was represented to be hateful. It is a religion based on the love of God and the love of His Son that would give his life for others. Senator SANDERS said: ‘‘Let me get to this issue that has bothered me and bothered many other people. And that is in the piece that I referred to that 
you wrote for the publication called ‘Resurgent.’ You wrote, ‘‘Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned.’’ Senator SANDERS then went on and said: ‘‘Do you believe that statement is Islamophobic?’’ Mr. Vought replied: ‘‘Absolutely not, Senator. I am a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith. That post, as I stated in the questionnaire to this committee, was to defend my alma mater, Wheaton College, a Christian school that has a statement of faith that includes the centrality of Jesus Christ for salvation, and . . . ’’ Senator SANDERS interrupts: ‘‘I apologize. Forgive me, we just don’t have a lot of time. Do you believe people in the Muslim religion stand condemned? Is that your view?’’ Mr. Vought relied: ‘‘Again, Senator, I am a Christian, and I wrote that piece in accordance with the statement of faith at Wheaton College.’’ Senator SANDERS said: ‘‘I understand that. I don’t know how many Muslims there are in America. Maybe a couple million. Are you suggesting that all those people stand condemned? What about Jew? Do they stand condemned, too?’’ Mr. Vought replied: ‘‘Senator, I’m a Christian . . . ’’ Senator SANDERS at this point is shouting: ‘‘I understand you are a Christian, but this country are made of people who are not just—I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?’’ Mr. Vought replied: ‘‘Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that, as a Christian, that is how I should treat all individuals . . . ’’ Senator SANDERS responded: ‘‘You think your statement that you put into that publication, they do not know God because they rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned, do you think that is respectful of other religions?’’ Mr. Vought said: ‘‘Senator, I wrote a post based on being a Christian and attending a Christian school that has a statement of faith that speaks clearly in regard to the centrality of Jesus Christ in salvation.’’ Senator SANDERS said: ‘‘I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about.’’ And that came from—the quotes came from an article in the National Review quoting from the hearing itself. That is why I say, Mr. Speaker, this may be the low point for hope in America when a sitting Senator condemns someone who is simply quoting from the teachings of Jesus, teachings that even a descendant of Mohammed knew was helpful in creating a great nation. We have come a long way from the hope that abounded within the founders of this country, within the hope of those who fought to bring about the end of the horrendous, hideous practice of slavery, where human beings treated brother and sister human beings with chains in bondage. And now we come to a point that I feared—and I brought it up when hate crime legislation was discussed—that the day would come when the religion of the world based on the love of God and the love of Jesus Christ would be twisted to the point that it would be called hateful. Jesus said: ‘‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’’ He is either a liar or a lunatic or he is exactly who he said he was. But that is not hateful. It is not hateful to believe in a religion where you want to share the joy and the hope that comes from it. One of the results, maybe it is a—not a result, but more of an unfortunate situation that exists. When you take away the hope of the Christian religion, condemn people for believing Jesus is the hope, as he said he was, or as our friend, the late Chuck Colson, pointed out: ‘‘Our hope is not going to arrive on Air Force One.’’ He believed the hope was in Jesus. And now we have someone who is declared totally inappropriate to be a government official because he believes the teachings of Jesus. It is not hateful to believe the teachings of Jesus. In fact, someone—I know I have Jewish friends who have said: I thought Christians blamed Jews for killing Jesus. Well, the truth is that anyone who is a true Christian, if they blame Jews or anyone else for the death of Jesus, they are not a Christian. They don’t understand the belief that Jesus died for me and for anyone who has done wrong in this life. b1815 So it is a sad day, it is a sad week, and it is a sad month to look how far we have come from the hope that was once so prevalent. Now we are in a society where suicide is rampant—144 drug overdoses a day, and that doesn’t count all of the suicides by veterans and Active Duty military. Christianity is a religion of love. May God grant wisdom to any Senator who thinks otherwise. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
