Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, Ms. Tijuana Fulford, founder and executive director of the Butterfly Effect Project in Riverhead. In 2014, Ms. Fulford set out to establish a free program to provide young girls with the tools they need to achieve selfconfident futures in hopes of bringing forth a generation of strong, independent, and knowledgeable women. This program has grown from 4 to 108 young girls with an evergrowing waitlist. These are girls who are empowered with the resources necessary to secure a prosperous future for themselves and their families. Through financial, educational, emotional, and career support, the Butterfly Effect Project is building community involvement and curtailing the effects of cultural and mobility limitations. With locations in Riverhead and Bellport, the Butterfly Effect Project is having such a positive effect on young girls from Riverhead, Flanders, Calverton, Mastic, Shirley, Bellport, Westhampton, Peconic, Patchogue, and West Islip. The Butterfly Effect Project has provided an invaluable service to our community. I applaud Ms. Fulford for her dedication, and I look forward to witnessing the growth of her organization and the bright future of so many of the young women it supports. 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s mantra is ‘‘no collusion.’’ He says this constantly because he wants people to think collusion—a hard thing to prove—is the only question in the Russia investigation. It is not. Even putting aside the mounting evidence that Trump did collude with Russia, there is an equally serious question about obstruction of justice, and, for that, the evidence is overwhelming. The greatest hits of Trump obstruction include: Requesting an improper loyalty pledge from FBI Director Comey; Telling Director Comey to drop the Flynn investigation; Asking the DNI and the CIA Directors to lean on Comey to drop the Flynn investigation; Firing Comey when he continued the investigation; Admitting on national TV that the firing was because of the Russia investigation; Admitting, essentially, the same thing to top Russian officials in a White House meeting; Drafting a deliberately misleading statement for his son about the infamous Trump Tower meeting; Attempting to fire Special Counsel Mueller; And, most recently, this hamhanded choreography with Chairman NUNES to undermine all of the pending investigations—an attempt to set up the argument that we should drop the Russia investigations and, instead, investigate the investigators. That is just the ‘‘Greatest Hits of Obstruction,’’ volume I. There is a lot more to come, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
SOUPER HERO SOUP DRIVE (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize some reallife super heroes from my district in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Students from Brookwood, Keystone, and Mill Creek Elementary Schools in the Bristol Township School District collected thousands of pounds of canned soup, dressed as ‘‘souper heroes,’’ and delivered it to the Emergency Relief Association Food Pantry in Levittown. Mill Creek Elementary School collected 1,581 pounds of soup, Brookwood Elementary School collected 1,365 pounds, and Keystone Elementary School collected 1,016 pounds of cans to help those in need. Mr. Speaker, I am so inspired by these outstanding young members of our community, who at a young age are already working hard to help people around them in need and make their community a stronger and a better place. I know we can all learn something from those boys and girls. I encourage every school in Bucks and Montgomery County to follow the lead of Brookwood, Keystone, and Mill Creek Elementary Schools and find new and fun ways to help those in need. f 
DEVASTATION OF HOUSTON SCHOOLS HIT BY HURRICANE HARVEY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as school children rise across America to go to a place of work for them, but a place of joy, of learning, I rise today to reenforce the importance of education in the State of Texas. The Texas education administrator, along with the Governor of the State of Texas, will be receiving a letter from me reaffirming the plea of local officials—both governmental and educational officials—to give Texas school children, because of the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, a waiver for 2 years for them to be able to improve their scores and to keep the schools open that the parents and the community want to have open. Many of my school districts—seven of which I represent—have faced the tragedy of Hurricane Harvey: the displacement or relocation of their children and the devastation of their schools, including the Houston Independent School District. It has historic schools. So my plea is that this is, likewise, a Federal issue. I was a strong supporter of the SUCCESS Act where we look at different elements, other than testing. Let’s look at the holistic aspect of the school children of Houston. Let’s give them a waiver. Let’s understand Hurricane Harvey. Let’s fix the schools and keep them open. That is my fight, and that is my commitment. 
CONGRATULATING PYEONGCHANG WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES ATHLETES (Mr. STEWART asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate all 243 United States athletes that have secured qualification in the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games. I am proud to say that 15 of these Olympians come from my home State of Utah. Through their talent, their hard work, and their dedication, I am confident that they are going to represent Utah and, in fact, the entire United States very well. These individuals come from all walks of life. Some are in the middle of their professional careers, some are students, many of them are parents. Together, these individuals will be able to showcase their immense strength 
and skill through unparalleled determination. Although these Olympians are not guaranteed success or a medal, it doesn’t prevent them from doing what they love to do. We should all look up to these Olympic athletes for inspiration to become better, stronger, and more dedicated to reaching our goals, even when we know it is tough. I wish these athletes good luck in the upcoming events, and I thank them for representing the United States and the great State of Utah. As we watch the Olympics, all of us look forward to hearing our national anthem played and hearing them chanting: USA, U SA. 
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING ALONG TO GET ALONG (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I sent my first paycheck as a bag boy at the A&P—$19andsomeodd cents—to the Barry Goldwater campaign. I was 16 years old. I have been involved in almost every major Republican campaign in my State and nationally since then. But the Republican Party I grew up in was the fiscally conservative party. I wish it still was. But we will pass a spending bill today that is everything but fiscally conservative. Our national debt is now over $20 trillion. This bill will speed us down the road to $30 trillion. Our deficit last year was $666 billion. This bill will make it even higher this year. There is nothing fiscally conservative about this bill. Spending was already going up. Now we are busting the budget caps and adding another $300 billion more. Anyone who supports this bill cannot accurately say that they are fiscally conservative. It is very sad to me that the Republican Party I love is now going along to get along and spending many, many billions that we simply do not have. 
AMERICA MUST LEARN FROM PUERTO RICO (Mr. BROOKS of Alabama asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, Congress faces a debt junkie spending bill that risks an American bankruptcy that threatens the dissolution of our military. That is why a past Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and current Secretary of Defense have both identified America’s debt as our greatest national security threat. America must learn from Puerto Rico, which suffered a debt default in 2016 that destroyed its economy and forced it to fire public sector workers, raise sales taxes to a record 11.5 percent, and close over 100 schools. Worse yet, Puerto Rico’s insolvency meant it lacked the resources to protect itself from known hurricane risks like that of Hurricane Maria. Mr. Speaker, debt junkies don’t care one twit about America’s bankruptcy risk. I do. That is why today I will vote against their financially irresponsible spending bill that will likely trigger a $1 trillion deficit this year. f 
CONGRATULATING BLESSED TRINITY FOOTBALL (Mrs. HANDEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HANDEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the State champion football program at Blessed Trinity High School in Roswell, Georgia. Under the leadership of Head Coach Tim McFarlin, the Blessed Trinity Titans finished with 13 wins and just 2 losses to earn their first ever State football championship title this past season. The 4A class in Georgia is a tough one, and I congratulate the other teams in this bracket for their efforts as well. But with the outstanding leadership and mentorship of Coach McFarlin, the Titans did prevail. Last week was also Catholic Schools Week. I had the pleasure of visiting Blessed Trinity Catholic School. During my visit, I included time with the AP government students, as well as with students in their STEAM program, which focuses on science, technology, engineering, arts, and math. My thanks to Principal Brian Marks, and to all of the students and the faculty there for a terrific visit and for being such a great part of the community in the Sixth District.

SMALL BANK HOLDING COMPANY RELIEF ACT OF 2018 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 725, I call up the bill (H.R. 4771) to raise the consolidated assets threshold under the small bank holding company policy statement, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BYRNE ). Pursuant to House Resolution 725, the amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–57 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 4771 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018’’. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018. It is a bipartisan bill which passed our committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 41–14. Mr. Speaker, this exact same provision came out of the Senate Banking Committee also with a very strong bipartisan vote of 16–7. First, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE) who is a very hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. I want to thank her for introducing this legislation and helping lead our congressional efforts to provide regulatory relief to our Nation’s community banks. She is a great asset to our committee and widely respected. The Federal Reserve Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement is a regulation that allows certain bank holding companies that have less than $1 billion in assets to hold more debt at the holding company level than would otherwise be permitted by current capital requirements. They do this as long as they meet a number of ongoing requirements and restrictions. H.R. 4771 would raise that threshold for qualifying institutions from $1 billion to $3 billion, thus allowing more community banks to raise more capital by the issuance of debt. By increasing this threshold, H.R. 4771 provides much needed relief for bank holding companies from overly burdensome capital and leverage requirements that were truly intended, Mr. Speaker, for the largest and most complex global financial institutions. It is a reoccurring problem, Mr. Speaker. Again, over and over, the regulatory burden on our community financial institutions is causing us to lose one approximately every other day in America. These are rules that have made it, again, more difficult for small banks to raise capital. And while the bank holding companies will no longer have to abide by these rules under this bill, again, there are plenty of safeguards that continue to be in place to protect the safety and soundness of the institution and its customers. But these institutions present no threat to the safety and soundness of our financial system. First and foremost, the Federal Reserve retains the right to impose capital standards on a holding company if they determine it is needed. In other words, this is a ‘‘may’’ bill and not a ‘‘shall’’ bill. The $3 billion threshold remains totally within the discretion of the Federal Reserve. It is permissive. Next, capital rules and regulations will continue to apply to the subsidiary banks of the holding company level. Again, let me repeat, the capital rules and regulations continue to apply to subsidiary banks. All institutions must continue to meet certain qualitative requirements, including those pertaining to non banking activities, offbalancesheet activities, and publicly registered debt and equity. These requirements ensure that the higher leverage the policy statement allows does not pose any undue burden on subsidiary depository institutions. So the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act will indeed make it easier for small, hometown community banks to raise capital. And as they raise more capital, they can turn it into more Main Street jobs, more economic growth, and more home ownership opportunities for our constituents. In fact, passing this bill will immediately benefit community banks all across America. Not the big banks, not Wall Street banks, as I have no doubt the ranking member will say in her remarks, but again, it will be community banks that will benefit. If you don’t believe me, ask them. Ask the Independent Community Bankers of America and its 5,700 community bank members. As a matter of fact, the passage of this bill, Mrs. LOVE’s bill, has been an important, longstanding goal of the Independent Community Bankers of America because they have been suffering and suffocated by an avalanche of red tape with massive increases in regulatory burdens, which has caused consolidation with much, much larger competitors. Because of increased regulation and compliance costs, again, many of them have found it difficult to access and raise capital. This is the capital that is needed to capitalize our small businesses. Small businesses are struggling for access to credit, and the incredible regulatory burden placed on home buyers has simply complicated the buying process. b1115 These higher costs are being felt at the same time that paychecks are only now beginning to grow for working families thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Just don’t take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. Let’s listen to just one community banker who happens to be from West Virginia. They wrote in and said: 
What no one in a position of power seems to realize is that many customers in our 
country prefer to deal with a smaller, hometown institution, with people they know and trust. If a customer has a question about their loan or their deposit, they simply pick up the phone and call or drop by. If we don’t know the answer, we find out and let them know as soon as possible. But it appears that Congress and the administration are attempting to get rid of smaller institutions, so there are a lot fewer institutions to deal with, and those are the large ones who are too big to fail. 
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what happened under the DoddFrank Act. Continuing: 
Please just try to remember that small financial institutions and small businesses are the heart of America. The American Dream is to work hard, learn, and make a good life for yourself and your family. In the meantime, it includes working in your community or neighborhood to help others out. Even as a small institution as ours, we sponsor Little League Baseball teams, soccer teams, the county junior fair, and many other activities. We realize if we don’t support local small businesses, they soon won’t be here. 
Those words could have been written by almost any community financial institution in America, Mr. Speaker, and they ring so true. In order to keep our small communities alive, we have to keep their small businesses alive and we must keep their small banks alive. So, again, it is so important that we enact H.R. 4771 and that we reduce this red tape on our community financial institutions. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Utah for introducing the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018. This bill is another Republicanled measure to roll back appropriately tailored policies to regulate the financial services sector that ignores the hardlearned lessons of the catastrophic 2008 financial crisis. We have seen this same flawed approach in H.R. 10, which I called the ‘‘Wrong Choice Act,’’ last year, and we are seeing it again in the Senate as it considers advancing Senator CRAPO ’s Wall Street giveaway, which includes a provision identical to the bill that we are considering today, along with several other harmful provisions. The Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement was first issued in 1980 to enable the transfer of ownership of small community banks by allowing small, noncomplex bank holding companies to operate with higher levels of debt than would normally be permitted. The original policy statement established a threshold of bank holding companies with less than $150 million in assets, but this level was increased to $500 million in 2006. The policy statement allows certain small bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to hold more debt at the holding company level than would otherwise be allowed by capital requirements if the debt is used to finance up to 75 percent of an acquisition of another bank. Put another way, the policy statement is important because it allows small institutions like community banks and minorityowned insured depository institutions to access additional debt so they can continue serving their communities without compromising bank safety and soundness. Thus, it is important that the threshold level be carefully calibrated so it cannot be abused by speculative investors. If the threshold is raised too high, it will encourage more mergers and acquisitions, riskier banking activities, and reduced banking services and credit availability to rural, lowincome, minority, and underserved communities. In 2014, Democrats worked with Republicans to examine this threshold and reached a reasonable compromise to raise the threshold to $1 billion. This change was implemented only after closely consulting with regulators to determine the appropriate threshold level to help community banks grow without making them targets for mergers and acquisitions. The $1 billion threshold is sensible and reasonable in light of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s exhaustive study several years ago on the definition of ‘‘community bank.’’ While the FDIC factors in other considerations, their definition of a community bank includes a dollar threshold of banks with less than $1 billion in assets. According to 2016 data from the Federal Reserve, 87 percent of all bank holding companies are covered by the current $1 billion threshold. This means that a large majority of the industry currently benefits from the adjusted 2014 threshold increase in the policy statement, including all truly small community banks. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting that the bipartisan compromise reached in 2014 included other important safeguards, such as excluding any bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with less than $1 billion that are engaged in significant nonbanking activities. It also gives the Federal Reserve the ability to exclude any bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies from the policy statement, regardless of size, if it concludes that the exclusion is warranted for supervisory purposes. But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not hesitated to try and push the threshold higher. Last Congress, just a little more than a year after a bipartisan compromise to increase the threshold, Republicans pushed through the House another bill, H.R. 3791, that would have significantly increased the threshold from $1 billion to $5 billion. That bill faced a veto threat from the Obama administration, as it should have, and it went nowhere in the Senate. Last year, Chairman HENSARLING included a provision in H.R. 10, the ‘‘Wrong Choice Act,’’ to drastically raise the $1 billion threshold to $10 billion. Because the Senate now appears set to move a bill that raises the threshold, but to nowhere near that level, we now find ourselves back on the floor of the House today considering a new bill to triple the threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion. While it is a slightly less drastic increase than the one in the bill Republicans pushed through the House last Congress, tripling the policy statement threshold to $3 billion so soon since the last threshold increase is still unwise. There simply has not been sufficient time to see what effect doubling the policy statement threshold from $500 million to $1 billion really means for community banks. Congress should at least examine the data and understand the effects of the last change before making another one. We should not ignore the concerns raised by experts that this approach will allow small banks to take on more debt than they otherwise need and may actually promote mergers and acquisitions so that we have fewer community banks, not more. While Republicans push bills like H.R. 4771 in the name of helping community banks, this is yet another proposal that would likely result in fewer, not more, community banks. Even the Treasury Department under this President, President Trump, only recommended raising the threshold to $2 billion. So they are $1 billion even beyond what the President supports. That was in a report issued last year. As I mentioned, H.R. 4771 is one of the many harmful provisions in Senator CRAPO ’s financial deregulatory bill that is advanced in the Senate. Senator CRAPO ’s bill also includes many other harmful rollbacks that would fundamentally weaken our framework. It would roll back certain stress testing requirements for megabanks like Wells Fargo and would exempt or weaken enhanced standards for many of the large banks in the country. The Senate bill also would gut rules for foreign banks like Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse. It would also eliminate a requirement that many banks collect and publicly report critical Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA, data. HMDA data is used for many important policy purposes, including to identify mortgage lending discrimination against many Latinos, African Americans, and other minority groups. I could go on and on, but the list is longer than the time that we have allotted. The bottom line is I strongly urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 4771 and the other efforts by congressional Republicans and this administration to deregulate Wall Street and the banking industry and roll back the clock to a time not long ago when we had weak 
oversight and few safeguards that protect consumers, investors, and taxpayers. You can see what is happening. At one point, the opposite side of the aisle said: ‘‘Let’s jump to $5 billion.’’ And then, Mr. HENSARLING said: ‘‘No, let’s jump to $10 billion.’’ This is done without any thought or consideration for what they are doing and the risks that they are placing on these little banks to be bought up and the mergers to take place. You can see there is no real thought, no real review, no real consideration given when you say: ‘‘Let’s go from $1 billion to $3 billion to $5 billion to $10 billion, whatever we can get.’’ We are saying: ‘‘No, that is wrong. Don’t do that. Don’t do that to these community banks.’’ Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE), the sponsor of this legislation. Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4771. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank Chairman HENSARLING for his support of this bill, as well as the cosponsors, Mr. GOTTHEIMER and Mr. M EEKS , for making this a bipartisan effort to help community banks. Economic freedom and personal freedom run hand in hand. In order to ensure personal freedoms, Americans need access to credit as individuals, on behalf of their families, and in their businesses. That is why I am proud to have introduced this bill. H.R. 4771 is a very simple bill to help small banks and savings and loan companies get access to the capital they need to make credit available in their communities. These small banking institutions are critical to people in the local communities in which they reside. They support the credit needs of families, small businesses, farmers, and entrepreneurs. Community banks are often the principal lending source for many people, whether they are purchasing a home or starting a business. In many counties around the Nation, our community banks are the only banking presence that residents have. When these community banking institutions are overwhelmed with regulations and mandates, many of which are meant for larger institutions, it is the hardworking families and lowincome Americans in those communities that suffer. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about people. Community banks give people the credit they need to pursue their dreams, buy a home, buy a car, and own and grow their businesses. In fact, proximity to a community bank increases the chance that a new small business will be approved for a loan that they need to succeed. By raising the consolidated asset threshold under the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion in assets, hundreds of additional small banks and thrift holding companies will qualify for the coverage under the policy statement and, therefore, be exempt from certain regulatory and capital guidelines. These capital standards were originally established for larger institutions and disproportionately harm small holding companies. Many holding companies that are above the current threshold face challenges with regard to capital formation, just when regulators are demanding higher capital levels. The exemptions provided in the policy statement make it easier for a small holding company to raise capital and issue debt. This bill is about making sure that regulations fit the size of the institution. Mr. Speaker, a similar effort was passed into law during the 113th Congress under suspension by the House and by unanimous consent in the Senate. That bill raised the threshold from $500 million, where it had been since 1996, to $1 billion. b1130 That legislation also extended the exemption to savings and loan holding companies. While we are glad that we were able to achieve that increase, which roughly helped 500 small bank and thrift holding companies, why wouldn’t we extend those benefits further? H.R. 4771 would bring even more small institutions within the scope of the policy statement. We have already seen the benefits of the last increase. One success story we have heard was an instance where 35 bank holding companies pooled their resources together to issue debt under the policy statement. That debt was then downstreamed to their respective banks where the capital was then used to make loans in the communities they serve, illustrating the great multiplier effect that the policy statement can produce. H.R. 4771 seeks to extend that flexibility and success to a greater number of small institutions and the communities they serve. Opponents of this increase have alleged that changing the regulatory threshold would put communities and the Deposit Insurance Fund at higher risk. But the policy statement contains not one but several safeguards designed to ensure that the small bank holding companies that operate with the higher levels of debt permitted under the policy statement do not present an undue risk to the safety and the soundness of the subsidiary banks. Mr. Speaker, to sum it up, this bill is not about supporting banks. It is about supporting families. It is about supporting communities and small business. It is about making sure that smallbusiness owners have access to the credit they need to expand and to thrive. I recently heard of a businessowner in my community who employs about 30 people. Most of these people that she employs are women who are trying to take care of their families and make a little bit more so that they could put some money in their pocket or buy a car. She would like to expand her business, but it—— The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BYRNE ). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Utah. Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, she would like to expand her business to employ even more people, but she continuously receives red tape, and it makes it very difficult for her to be able to provide for her community. This is about families sitting around the kitchen table imagining the possibilities of renovating their home and the entrepreneur dreaming of starting a restaurant or being her own boss. Raising the threshold received strong bipartisan support in the Financial Services Committee, and I hope that it will receive equal support in this Chamber. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman for this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what the other side wants. They want $5 billion at one point, they want $10 billion at one point, and now they want $3 billion. They just throw it up against the wall and hope something sticks, and we are saying: Don’t put these community banks at risk. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ), the vice ranking member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member WATERS for yielding. I know she understands the danger in yielding to me as much time as I may consume. I will just take a couple of minute on this. I rise in opposition to H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act. There are unaddressed concerns as to the effect this bill will have on community banks that serve so many of our constituents, whether it be through more bank consolidation or whether it will encourage small banks to take on more unsustainable debt. The Federal Reserve has a small bank holding company policy statement that outlines ownership transfer of small community banks and savings associations ‘‘by allowing their holding companies to operate with higher levels of debt than would normally be permitted.’’ The holding companies that qualify for the policy statement can have up to $1 billion in assets, a limit that was reached, in a bipartisan effort, in the 113th Congress. Yet, even though this new threshold was enacted just at the end of 2014, we have seen multiple efforts to raise the limit even higher. According to data from the Federal Reserve, under the current $1 billion 
threshold, 87 percent of all bank holding companies and 72 percent of savings and loan holding companies are holding nearly $1 trillion in assets under that billiondollar threshold. It is too soon to know the effects of increasing the threshold to $1 billion. Why are we pushing to raise it even further without sufficient information as to the effect on the market of the last increase? And we may disagree on the conclusion we come to, but a concern I would like to address is that while we are raising this question, while we are debating whether to raise this threshold without, I believe, sufficient knowledge as to the full impact of the last increase, we are taking time on the floor when we have so many other unaddressed concerns that get no time on this floor. You know, as members of the committee, and certainly other Members of the House understand, I spent a good deal of my time working on issues related to the conditions of America’s cities and towns. A whole subset of American towns, even in a period of economic growth, which we all acknowledge has been sustained now over the period of the last 8 years, many communities are continuing to be left behind. Why is that? I am sure there are a lot of reasons. I am sure some of my friends would argue that some of the issues addressed in this legislation might touch on them. But one thing I know for sure, the crumbling roads and bridges and water and sewer systems in those communities are so serious, the problem is so great. The unaddressed issues of violent crime in many of those same cities, which this House continues to leave unaddressed, essentially ensures that any change in the regulatory structure in the marketplace is not sufficient to deal with the underlying and really troubling problems that these communities face. You know, a year ago, the President came to the floor of this House and talked about a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. He came back and said it was going to be $1.5 trillion with one little asterisk, only $200 billion from the Federal Government. State and local government is supposed to make up the rest of it. I raise this because often the arguments in favor of taking some of the regulatory protections off these institutions are that it is supposed to unlock the marketplace to rebuild these communities when these communities are so shackled to the bottom of the ocean that no rising tide will raise them. If we don’t get control of the incredible struggle and deterioration in these older cities, nothing we do on this floor otherwise is going to make it right for those folks. I represent one of those towns. You have heard me talk about my own hometown of Flint. There are so many other communities that are struggling. The jurisdiction of a committee does include addressing the condition of urban America. I would just hope, and really ask, that we spend a bit more time on those questions. I would feel much more comfortable having a debate about what the regulatory structure looks like if I felt like there was sufficient attention being given to those issues. In the meantime, because of the questions that I have already raised about the impact of this legislation not being fully understood, even the last increase in the threshold not being fully understood, I am going to urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to say that, as the ranking member appears to be vexed at where the $3 billion number came from, it is the product of bipartisan compromise, something I invite her to engage in more often, and this particular bill is supported by almost half the Democrats on the committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE MEYER ), the chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for the time. To say that the current regulatory climate presents challenges for small financial institutions would be a drastic understatement. Today, regulators require more and more from community banks in terms of both regulatory oversight and capital requirements. The gentlewoman from Utah has crafted legislation that seeks to alleviate some of these pressures facing our community banks. Small bank and thrift holding companies confront unique challenges with regard to capital formation, which is a particular concern at times when regulators demand more and more capital. Understanding these challenges, the Fed has recognized that small banks have limited access to equity financing. The Federal Reserve small bank holding policy statement gives relief from certain capital guidelines and requirements, making it easier for a community bank to raise capital and issue debt, and to make acquisitions and form new bank and thrift holding companies. I would like to digress for just a little second here. I haven’t heard anybody talk about it, and I think it is very important, Mr. Speaker, that we talk about the timeframe prior to 2008, whenever we were averaging about 150 to 175 new banks and credit unions every year. But between the timeframe of 2010 and 2006, we averaged one. That is significant because small businesses get their loans from small banks. And without this access to capital for small businesses, we will dry up our small businesses in this country that are the job creators. So by increasing the threshold, the Fed’s policy statement from $1 billion to $3 billion, we have the opportunity to help more banks operating in our community, and hopefully be formed in our communities, and help our lending to our constituents. Similar legislation has been contemplated in the House on a number of occasions. The language in this latest iteration is identical to the bipartisan language proposed in the Senate Banking Committee bill and is similar to legislation that passed the House in the 114th Congress and included in my CLEARR Act. H.R. 4771 will go a long way in ensuring that our Nation’s smallest institutions are able to grow stronger and continue to serve their constituents. I want to thank Mrs. LOVE for her leadership on this legislation and Chairman HENSARLING for his commitment to issues facing community banks and credit unions. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ). Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to have this opportunity. I thank the chairman as well, and I want to thank the ranking member for all of the work that she has done in this area. She has been a part of the avantgarde to protect and maintain community banks. One of the great difficulties that we have had with our committee is defining what a community bank is. We have had testimony to indicate that a community bank can be $50 billion or more. We want to make sure that the small institutions that the chairperson is talking about continue to exist. It is unfortunate, but if we pass this legislation, there is a good likelihood that the level of consolidation that will take place will be antithetical to the very commentary that we are hearing with reference to the need for community banks, small banks to make sure small businesses will receive loans. There is a contradiction contained within the very effort that is being made. I am honored to have with me a statement from over 200 civil rights community organizations, labor unions, businesses, investors, faith based businesses, community and civic groups; and this statement reads—this is from them, but I concur with it: ‘‘Raising the limit to $3 billion is a policy well calculated to significantly reduce the number of community banks in the U.S. First, raising the limit will allow mediumsized community banks of $2 to $3 billion in size to more easily acquire smaller community banks. . . .’’ That is a significant comment because the acquisition of smaller banks is going to cause us to have fewer smaller banks, and the argument that is being made is that the smaller banks are the ones that are servicing small businesses. 
It goes on to read: ‘‘. . . reducing the number of independent community banks. Second, allowing holding companies to borrow excessively will raise the risk of bank failure the next time the financial system is under stress. ‘‘A $3 billion limit is unjustified, as there is no evidence that community banks over $1 billion in size are currently too small to survive. According to a recent FDIC report, ‘While economies of scale are important for community banks, historical trends in the size distribution of community banks that have survived over the last quarter century do not suggest that economies of scale require a community bank to grow or merge to asset sizes larger than $1 billion.’’ My point is that I am a proponent of community banks. b1145 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. The point is that I am a proponent of having small banks. I call small banks community banks. I am a proponent of this. If I am a proponent of it, then I support the notion that we cannot allow them to be consolidated such that we will have fewer of them. I think this legislation is a little bit misguided in that it contradicts the very premise upon which it rests. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say that I am shocked that anybody would come here and say that they want to support community banks and they supported DoddFrank—the very reason these community banks are being gobbled up. The whole idea of this legislation is to allow them to come together and protect themselves and not be gobbled up by the big banks they vilify in the first place. Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, we have been hearing some of the details of the bill, but here is the real message: this is about our small communities and small banks that are the lifeblood of those communities. A little earlier you heard the ranking member talk about this being about Wall Street. Do you know what? She is right. This is about Wall Street. Wall Street was one block away from where I lived on Sanford Street in Zeeland, Michigan. By the way, we were connected by Main Street and Central Avenue. That is what it is about. Whether it is Wall Street in Zeeland, Michigan, or Sanford Street, or my friends in Baldwin, Michigan, this is about our small communities. What does a strong local community bank bring? It brings local investment. And what does that local investment bring? Stability, predictability, trust, trust among the farmers, among those corner pub owners, or among those small hotel owners that may be depending on the stray traveler that is going to be coming through. This has been sort of viewed as a risk to these small banks. It is actually the opposite of that. Either, A, one small community bank is going to merge with another small community bank and they are going to remain small community banks under that $3 billion threshold; or, B, what we have been seeing a lot of—and this is what the chairman was talking about—they are going to get gobbled up by a large bank that doesn’t qualify under this legislation. And guess what. They are far more likely to remove those ATMs and far more likely to move those local branches out of places like Tustin and Luther and Baldwin and Holland. I can tell you this: if you went and said that this is anything other than about strengthening our small community banks, it shows, A, one is either wildly out of touch or, B, playing politics. That is the sad part, because I can tell you this: if you go talk to my friend Debbie SmithOlson, who is the CEO of LakeOsceola State Bank in Baldwin, Michigan—located in the poorest county in the State of Michigan, one of the top 100 poorest counties in the Nation—and you told her that this was about Wall Street, she would laugh. If I went and talked to my friends at Macatawa Bank and tried to describe this as being about helping big banks and Wall Street and rolling back Dodd Frank, they would first look at me in stunned silence, and then they would ask me: Are you serious? Well, unfortunately, that is the kind of rhetoric that you are hearing out here today. Let’s make sure that we understand what this is really about: strengthening our small banks, which strengthen our small communities and strengthen our smallbusiness owners. That is what is going to continue this economic comeback that we are experiencing here in the United States. I commend the gentlewoman from Utah in her work on a bipartisan manner on the basis that this has been coming together with people of goodwill trying to come up with a solution to make sure that we don’t see needless consolidation in a banking community that has already been so hit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUIZENGA. As I wrap up, this is about making sure that we have a solid community banking system. We know that they have been under assault under these DoddFrank provisions that have come through, which I don’t think were necessarily maliciously put in, but they were misunderstood about what those effects were going to be. The gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE) is rectifying that. Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage my colleagues to support that and to vote ‘‘yes’’ for this very important bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for us to understand the support that community banks have gotten from this side of the aisle. I know that my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle, oftentimes, advance the argument that they are the only ones who care about community banks and that we don’t understand community banks. And, oftentimes, they have arguments that basically would have one conclude that we don’t really advance the cause of community banks. I would just like to remind my colleagues in this Congress of the work that we have done in support of community banks. We have supported, and successfully supported, less frequent exams for wellrated community banks with less than $1 billion. The exam cycle is now 18 months instead of 12 months for these strong small banks. We took into consideration the concerns of community banks about the examiners coming too often, disturbing the banks, oftentimes, tying up the personnel in the bank. So we agreed to not have them come in every 12 months and to extend that so that 18 months will give some relief to the community banks so that they don’t have to deal with the auditors in such a way that disturbs the bank. We also moved successfully to eliminate an annual privacy notice for community banks and credit unions whose policies have not changed and the consumer has already notified. Well, we did that. We eliminated these annual privacy notices for the community banks and for credit unions who have not changed their policies, and there is no need to have to continue to insist that they have these annual privacy notices. Well, we went further with less stringent SEC registration rules for small thrifts, providing parity with other banks; and access to credit for privately insured credit unions, allowing them to join the Federal Home Loan Banks program; improving mortgage licensing for community banks and credit unions by allowing regulator access to the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry, while maintaining confidentiality protections. I just cite this because it is so important to understand what we have done on this side of the aisle to ensure that our community banks are strong, that they are there for our communities, that they provide the loans, that they 
assist in developing our communities. What we don’t understand oftentimes is why our friends on the opposite side of the aisle, in the name of community banks, will come with proposals that hurt community banks. We have pointed out that our friends on the opposite side of the aisle have gone so far as to try and get everyone to believe that we should increase this amount of debt that they could carry up to $10 billion. That is totally irresponsible, totally. And even when they attempted to go to $5 billion, totally irresponsible, down to $3 billion, because I guess they just say: Well, we have to try to get some more opportunities for small banks to carry this debt. Well, they don’t answer the question about what happens when these small community banks are burdened with debt that they cannot take care of, that they cannot pay. They don’t talk about the fact that that is going to cause the community bank to close. And they certainly don’t talk about putting them in a position where they will be brought up. So I would simply say for those of us who have proven our support for community banks and who continue to engage with community banks about what we can do to ensure their strength, to ensure that they are there to provide the loans in the neighborhoods and in the communities that they serve, I think we have identified ourselves and we have defined ourselves. We would simply ask those who are listening to this debate to continue to know and understand what is happening between these different sides of the aisle, to look at what we have done, and to understand how we have been helpful in our support for community banks. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to simply use a term popularized on the other side of the aisle. These are crumbs, deregulatory crumbs, offered by the ranking member when, in fact, she and others on the other side of the aisle have their handprints all over DoddFrank, which 90 percent of community bankers will tell you is the number one reason they are going out of business, which is why we have to enact this bill. Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), the vice chairman of our Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act. I also want to thank my colleague from Utah, Representative LOVE, for her hard work on this important issue. We have extensively discussed the challenges that small banks face in the current regulatory environment, both on the House floor and in the Financial Services Committee, including, just yesterday, a debate on the Mortgage Choice Act. These challenges contribute to the continued retreat of community banks from small towns and underserved communities across our country, including those that dot my district in the hills and valleys of western Pennsylvania. This hurts families and Main Street businesses by depriving them of the access to financial services that they desperately need. The Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act will allow more institutions to operate under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, which will help them raise additional capital by issuing debt. It will also make it easier for covered institutions to form new holding companies, fund existing holding companies, and make acquisitions. Altogether, this is a smart, targeted bill that will help more small financial institutions grow and adjust to the changing economic and regulatory landscape. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to remind my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle that the community banks with $1 billion to $5 billion in assets already have sufficient access to capital markets and, as a group, are exhibiting help and resilience. Raising a threshold to exempt banks with over $1 billion from important minimum leverage and capital requirements will do little more than encourage banks to take on debt—as I have reminded you time and time again today—endangering their soundness and potentially depriving their customers of muchneeded banking services should the bank fail. Setting the consolidated assets threshold at $1 billion was a bipartisan decision that struck a balance between allowing small banks to access capital to better serve their customers and ensuring their safety and soundness. Raising the threshold would be an unnecessary and risky change. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. ROSS), vice chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mrs. LOVE, from Utah for presenting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in support of H.R. 4771. It is said that all politics are local, but might I also suggest that all economic growth is local as well. Local in the sense of small businesses. Small businesses, the moms and pops who put their ideas at risk in order to create their American Dream of growing a business and creating jobs. Yet, what does it take? It takes access to capital. Yet, since DoddFrank, we have not seen that access to capital available to our small businesses, who so desperately need it, in order to grow our economies, especially at the community level. In fact, might I even suggest that DoddFrank has only one attribute in terms of job growth, and that is the creation of the one fastest growing job out there: compliance officer—compliance officers that banks and financial institutions now have to hire in order to meet regulatory burdens that take away from the bottom line of consumers who want to achieve the American Dream. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act, will allow that access to capital that is so desperately needed at the local level, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. b1200 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Okay. So we have heard it again. We hate DoddFrank. We hate DoddFrank. We hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We don’t believe that DoddFrank should have created the reforms that they did. Just forget about the fact that there was a subprime meltdown in 2008, that this country went into a recession, almost a depression. Throw all of that out of the window. Forget about what was happening when the big banks failed and we bailed them all out. Forget about reforms. Oh, how much we hate DoddFrank. We just blame DoddFrank for everything. Please. I think that, as credible legislators, we are beyond the point of wrapping up everything that we don’t like and accusing DoddFrank reforms for causing problems to everything and everybody, including the community banks. The fact of the matter is, if we want to strengthen, preserve, and make sure community banks are available to our communities, we won’t take on public policy that would put them at risk with having more debt than they can take care of, and we won’t put them at risk of being bought up and these mergers taking place. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to request of the ranking member, on her time, if she will begin to name the community banks that were responsible for the 2008 financial crisis, ostensibly, that was supposed to be answered by Dodd Frank. She will have some time to think about that. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ). 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act, and I commend my friend from Utah, MIA LOVE, for her amazing leadership on this important issue and her tireless effort to bring relief to the community banks that lend to small businesses and families in my district and in towns all across America. By reforming the onerous onesize fitsall regulations mandated by the DoddFrank law that roped small community financial institutions in with large global toobigtofail megafirms, this commonsense bill will give community banks and the customers they serve more clarity and allow them to focus on their important mission of lending to homeowners and businesses. This legislation also makes it easier for small and mediumsized institutions subject to DoddFrank mandates to form new holding companies, fund existing holding companies, and make acquisitions by issuing debt at the holding company level. Now that they are subject to the Basel III capital requirements, many community banks have found it difficult to access and raise capital. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. I yield the gentleman from New York an additional 30 seconds. Mr. ZELDIN. The consequence of this choke hold on community lending means less mortgages, less small business loans, and less economic growth. H.R. 4771 fixes this and facilitates the ability of community banks and savings institutions to raise needed capital. I urge adoption of this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and I am prepared to close, so I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Democrats support targeted, measured relief for our community financial institutions. We recognize that these smaller banks and credit unions intimately know their communities and how best to serve them. But we also know that changes to the rules that are designed to ensure that community banks are safe and sound can have unintended consequences. While community banks did not cause the 2008 financial crisis, they were at the center of another crisis just two decades before. When I came to the Financial Services Committee, thousands of savings and loan holding companies were failing and causing serious harm to the communities they were supposed to serve. This was due, in part, to the fact that lawmakers thought it was wise to weaken safeguards on these savings and loan holding companies, allowing them to take on more leverage and offer riskier products. I fear that Congress will again pass legislation today that will ultimately cause harm to both the very community banks we want to help and the hardworking Americans that rely on them. And now, Republicans are trying to raise the threshold as high as possible. In the chairman’s ‘‘Wrong Choice Act,’’ he would raise the threshold tenfold, to $10 billion. At the end of last Congress, Republicans sought to raise it to $5 billion. A few months ago, the Trump administration recommended raising it to $2 billion, and now, a little less than 3 years after we reached a bipartisan compromise, we are inexplicably considering legislation to raise it to $3 billion. I tried to tell you just a few moments ago, they don’t know. They are just throwing it up against the wall: whatever we can get. Next they will be asking for $20 billion. No, you have moved away from $10 billion; you have moved away from $5 billion; now you are at $3 billion. Your President wants $2 billion. We say, leave it as it is. Mr. Speaker, if you are listening to this and feeling dizzy, it is understandable. None of these levels are backed by the same careful consideration Congress gave to the threshold 2 years ago, and I am afraid it is exactly the kind of legislating that set the groundwork for the savings and loan crisis and left thousands of communities without access to banking services. When I came on, Members of Congress were fleeing the old Banking Committee. They wanted to get out of there because they had been responsible for public policy that had put the S&L business at risk, and now that was all failing. They were fleeing it, and they were punishing people, all the new Members coming on, and making them go on this committee because they knew that they had nobody else to serve on it. So I have been there. I have seen it. I have experienced it. I am a part of DoddFrank reforms. I served on the conference committee. I worked with Dodd. I worked with Frank. I know what we should be doing. Before I close, I would like to remind my colleagues that this bill and many of the other oneoff financial services bills Republicans are pushing should really be viewed as setting the table for the dangerous deregulatory package making it through the Senate. That package, which our committee has not even considered to thoroughly understand the interactions of all the rollbacks it contains, weakens oversight of Wall Street and the Nation’s largest banks under the guise of community bank relief. H.R. 4771 is one of the many provisions in the Senate bill that, when taken together, will risk further bailouts and harm homeownership in America. Every time this House passes another provision of that bigger bill, we make it more likely that critical safeguards and protections will be eviscerated at the expense of our Nation’s homeowners and consumers. I urge all Members to soundly reject H.R. 4771 today and to reject the larger Senate legislation if it comes to the House. I comfortably say, despite the fact that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle are trying to frame this in a certain way, they really don’t know what they are doing. Reject this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ), a hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support for H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act. This bill is another example of the rollback of burdensome regulations of the DoddFrank Act, which Barney Frank himself says missed the mark, particularly with respect to small banks. I appreciate the Member opposed calling attention to Democrats who have worked across the aisle to benefit community banks. In fact, 11 of them support this bill in our committee, and I appreciate them for doing that. I appreciate the cosponsors who are Democrats, who worked across the aisle with my colleague, Mrs. LOVE, to pass this good bill through our committee, and I look forward to seeing more colleagues pass this in a bipartisan way across the floor of the House today. How about giving small institutions a chance to start taking back some of their market share? Instead of too big to fail, what DoddFrank has done is made things so that small banks are too small to succeed. These exemptions that are in this bill make it easier for small bank holding companies to raise capital, to issue debt. Under the current capital requirements, small businesses just can’t compete with the larger banks, and the large banks have celebrated this in their own statements, celebrating the effect of DoddFrank in protecting their market share and helping them grow it. Under current capital requirements, that is what we have seen: bigger banks getting bigger, and smaller banks getting fewer. We need to give community banks the ability to breathe from the regulatory burden that has been shoved down their throats. And if you want to make big banks smaller, you can try to regulate them more, but we have demonstrated that is their competitive advantage. Frankly, all benchmarks are easier to audit. Just picking a number here in D.C. is easier to audit, and this is a compromise to what would be a good solution to look at systemic risk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. I yield the gentleman from Ohio an additional 30 seconds. Mr. DAVIDSON. We are losing nearly one community bank a day, and that is having a devastating impact on local businesses and communities. I urge all of our colleagues to support H.R. 4771. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 4
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, our community financial institutions play a vital role in our local communities, particularly in rural areas like the Fifth District of Texas, our east Texas counties, and yet they are being crushed, crushed by the sheer weight, volume, complexity, and expense of regulation brought about by DoddFrank. I hear so much from the ranking member about how much her side of the aisle cares about community banks, but their words are belied by their actions in supporting Dodd Frank, supposedly meant for Wall Street, but it is hurting Main Street. We have a bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4771, that will give a little bit of ability for community banks to protect themselves from the onslaught of this regulatory burden. The whole idea, again, Mr. Speaker, is to ensure that community banks can at least gather and merge amongst themselves so they are not gobbled up by the big banks that are vilified by the other side of the aisle in the first place. Again, Mr. Speaker, this is actually— you wouldn’t know it from the ranking member—a bipartisan proposal, supported by almost half—half—of the Democrats on the Financial Services Committee. And again, there is great bipartisan work on our committee. Almost threequarters of our bills are bipartisan; it is just few of them that are supported by our ranking member. Let’s do one small thing today. Let’s have the House do one small thing today, Mr. Speaker, that will help them survive a day more so that they can lend money to a hardworking family to buy that first home, so that they can lend money to somebody to realize their American Dream of perhaps starting their own small business. After having to get that paycheck at the local factory for so many years, now they can finally go out and start their own small business. Maybe it is a matter of sending the first kid to college. But all of this, all of this disappears. These hopes and dreams disappear with our community banks who are still failing, unfortunately, at the rate of one approximately every other day. This is unacceptable. This is totally unacceptable. So we have one deregulatory measure here—one—to help our community banks survive. And we hear from so many of them, Mr. Speaker. Here is one from Indiana that says: 
Regulations have significantly reduced our ability to make judgment calls on credit decisions. When I first came to First Savings Bank, I had a number of people tell me that the First Savings Bank gave them their first loan, probably when they didn’t deserve it. Today, they are business and civic leaders. And I guess we made the right call then. However, today we cannot make that call. Washington has made that call, and the answer is no. One reason, one voice of one banker telling us why we need the bill from the gentlewoman from Utah. Here is another from a banker in Texas, who said: 
When I started banking, the community bank business model was built around bankers helping their communities to thrive. Today, customers are confused when they have to sign so many papers to open a deposit account or borrow money. I can only think of one explanation, and that is our government thinks our customers are too stupid to come into the bank and negotiate a private transaction with their banker, the community banker that they go to church with, the community banker whose kids go to school with the customers’ kids, and the community banker whose wife is in the local charity with the wives of the banker’s customers’ wives. 
I have been a banker for over 30 years, and I have never been more discouraged than I am now. Good bankers are fleeing the industry. The days of making a commonsense decision for the benefit of a customer are gone. For me, retirement can’t come soon enough. 
I have got binders and binders full of these testimonies, Mr. Speaker. As the local community banks leave, so leave the credit opportunities of so many lowand moderateincome Americans. It has got to stop. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the House to enact H.R. 4771. Let’s stop the carnage, let’s encourage community bank living, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 725, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed with an amendment in which the concurrence of the House is requested, a bill of the House of the following title: 
H.R. 582. An act to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require multiline telephone systems to have a configuration that permits users to directly initiate a call to 9– 1–1 without dialing any additional digit, code, prefix, or postfix, and for other purposes. ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 96) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure the integrity of voice communications and to prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of such communications. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 96 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017’’. 
Part II of title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 251 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are considering S. 96 to improve rural call completion. S. 96 will require the Federal Communications Commission to establish call completion standards for intermediary providers that sometimes have not routed calls properly in rural areas of our country. By focusing on these standards, we will ensure that the highquality telephone service people in big cities may take for granted will be shared by those Americans living in harderto reach areas. I appreciate the bipartisan work of Congressman DAVID YOUNG and Congressman PETER WELCH . Their companion bill, H.R. 460, passed the House on January 23, 2017. I also thank Senator KLOBUCHAR and Senator THUNE for their work on rural call completion. Without the bipartisan and bicameral work of all of these Members, we would not be here today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also rise to support S. 96, the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act. It is a bipartisan bill championed by Representative DAVID YOUNG and cosponsored by a number of other Members, including Representatives WELCH and L OEBSACK  from the Energy and Commerce Committee. We deal with a lot of technologically complicated issues on the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, but this bill aims to address the most essential function of our telephone system: making sure that all Americans’ calls go through. Many people take for granted our modern communications tools. But in rural America, even the basic function of connecting a call is sometimes next to impossible. Consumers tell us often when they call rural areas, they are met with false busy signals or calls not even arriving, just silence. This isn’t just an important problem for rural Americans, but also for people in all of our districts who want to reach loved ones across the country and can’t. This status quo is unacceptable. We need reliable telephone service to keep us connected. It is too important for everyday life, particularly in the wake of the terrible natural disasters that swept through our country earlier this year. It is clearer than ever that basic phone service is critical when responding to emergencies and critical for everything from finding a job to managing your health. We know that problems with call completion are often related to intermediate providers—the middlemen hired to route calls. This bill requires intermediate providers to register with the FCC and comply with service quality standards. These commonsense steps should make it easier to figure out when providers are cutting corners or not doing their jobs. Ultimately, the bill puts consumers first by helping them make sure that we can stay connected to one another. S. 96 is a bipartisan bill that passed on suspension earlier this Congress and last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support it today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ), the distinguished chair of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the vice chairman, Mr. LANCE , for the work that he has done on this issue and the ranking member, Mr. DOYLE , for his work on this. As Mr. DOYLE mentioned, many of these issues are complex, and they are things that we do approach on a bipartisan basis. The bill that we have before us on rural call completion is something that Mr. YOUNG and Mr. W ELCH have put time and effort into. They fully understand that while so many of us who work here in an area where a call going through is something that you just take for granted that it is going to happen, that in many parts of our districts, like my district in Tennessee with rural counties, many times you will have those dropped calls or they are degraded calls, or you cannot get the call to go through at all. In times of emergency and in times of trauma for families, when they are trying desperately to get in touch with elderly parents or with home healthcare providers, to get that constant busy signal just adds to that stress of life and that concern for the wellbeing of those who are on the other end of that phone. Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. WELCH  and Mr. YOUNG for the job that they have done to push forward with this legislation. As was mentioned earlier, we have previously passed this in the House, and we are pleased that the Senate has moved forward, has taken this up; and we are seeking to finish this up and move it to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, and I encourage everyone to support this legislation. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ), who has worked so hard on this issue. 
Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act. This is a bill that I introduced in a bipartisan fashion with my colleagues here on both sides of the aisle in the 114th Congress, and we passed it in 2016. Here in the 115th Congress, we passed it again, but we didn’t quite get it to the finish line. But here we are. I want to thank my Democratic colleague from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ) for joining me in introducing the legislation. It is much needed. I want to thank Senator KLOBUCHAR  and Senator THUNE for finally getting the Senate to act on this important legislation. This is the Senate bill. To me, it doesn’t matter whose name or what number is on this bill. It is about good policy getting through to the finish line. Telephone companies often rely on intermediate providers to connect calls from larger networks to local service providers. All too often, especially in rural areas, those calls are poor quality, looped, dropped, not even connected, or disconnected. This failure hurts our families, small businesses, farms, and consumers in rural America who are in need of emergency assistance, public services, or are simply trying to do business. Families and businesses in rural America should have the same communication access as those living in urban areas. Improving rural call completion rates and quality are important to ensuring the strength of small towns and granting Americans the choice to live and thrive in whatever community is best for them and their family—rural, urban, or wherever. Our bill will help address this problem by requiring providers to register with the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, in order to meet quality standards and ensure reliable phone service in rural areas. It also prohibits providers from using intermediary routing services not registered with the FCC. After years of hard work in Congress and by stakeholders spread throughout Iowa, across the heartland, and across the country, I am happy to see this meaningful legislation finally moving again, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman WALDEN ; Ranking Member P ALLONE ; and the subcommittee chair and ranking member, Mrs. BLACKBURN and Mr. DOYLE , for their help and leadership on this issue. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. NOEM). Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act. Most Americans can rely on their phone service to keep in touch with loved ones. They can respond to urgent work when away from their place of business and respond to emergencies. But many of my constituents in South Dakota continue to have these critical calls dropped with absolutely no warning. More specifically, companies in the business of routing voice calls sometimes purposely drop longdistance calls headed for remote areas as a way to save money. While this is inexcusable just for the sheer inconvenience, some of these calls involve emergencies, leaving families in unnecessarily dangerous situations. The provisions within this bill are simple. We simply direct the FCC to establish basic quality standards for providers that transmit voice calls. This will help ensure businesses, families, and emergency responders can count on phone calls being completed. Mr. Speaker, I love living in a small town in America. It is where I grew up, and it is where I have chosen to raise my family. Dependable phone service shouldn’t be a question for those who make the choice to live in wideopen spaces, especially when we are making new, amazing technological advances on a daily basis. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation and ensure that those in South Dakota and rural areas across the country can rely on their phone calls going through. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation, and I hope all Members will vote for it when it comes to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1230 Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, the House should pass this legislation unanimously. We are one country: urban, suburban, and rural, and this will help rural America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BURGESS ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 96. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 582, or Kari’s Law, was sponsored by my good friend, Congressman GOHMERT . This important bill passed earlier this Congress on January 23, 2017. I am pleased that at this time it will be sent to the President to be signed into law. The residents of Texas know of a very painful story. Kari Hunt was murdered in a hotel room by her estranged husband in 2013. Kari’s 9yearold daughter did the exact right thing she knew to do, which was to call 911. Unfortunately, she did not know to dial another digit to get an outside line; and, parenthetically, I would not have known that. This legislation will ensure that when you stay at a hotel, you can dial 911 and the call will go through without dialing another number. Kari’s dad, Hank, and Mr. GOHMERT had been relentless advocates to make sure that this legislation becomes law. I commend their efforts and that of Senator KLOBUCHAR and her staff, along with Senator DEBFISCHER . God bless Kari’s family for not giving up and fighting for this law. It is impossible to express how important it is, especially as we approach the 50th anniversary of 911 service next week. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 582, a bill that passed the House last Congress by voice vote. I agree that we must do all we can to make sure that consumers using multiline telephone systems can directly dial 911 without having to dial additional digits first. These are the large enterprise phone systems that we use in big office buildings and hotels. Many of these phones require consumers to dial an extra 9 to get an outside line. Most of us know that, but too many people do not realize that you also have to dial 9 before dialing 911 on these phones, and if you don’t dial the 9 first, you can’t reach emergency services. As you can imagine, in desperate situations, being able to quickly reach first responders can mean the difference between life and death. This very issue led to a tragedy in Texas several years ago. Kari Dunn was killed while her 9yearold daughter tried to call for help. Kari’s daughter did what she thought she was supposed to do in an emergency, dial 911. But because the system she was using required her to dial that additional 9 first, she only heard silence on the other end. Building on the Herculean effort of Kari Dunn’s family, we are one step closer to fixing this problem once and for all. H.R. 582 is an important step toward making our systems work better in an emergency. But for all the good this bill does, it still leaves work to be done. Specifically, these multiline systems still often fail to deliver accurate location information to first responders. That means that if someone calls 911 from this very building that we are sitting in, for instance, precious minutes could tick by as emergency personnel struggle to figure out where the call came from in this enormous complex. That delay could be the difference between life and death. We must act to correct this problem, too, because making sure the call goes through is only helpful if public safety officials can find the caller. Democrats tried to include such a provision in the version of this bill from last Congress, and at that time we received a commitment from Chairman WALDEN to work together on a separate bill to address this concern. We were not able to solve this problem last Congress, and we expect the commitment will carry over to this Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ). Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the vice chairman and the ranking member for their persistence on this measure. I also commend Mr. GOHMERT , who has worked with Kari’s dad and has seen this through. We are pleased to get this on its way to the President’s desk. Indeed, we are going to continue to work on the enhanced 911 requirements because we do think that that is important. Technology allows more precise indications of exactly, precisely where phone calls are coming from. But solving this problem is one we need to do today. All of us who are moms and dads and have children and grandchildren, you train them to dial 911. I am certain that that is what Kari did with her daughter: If there is ever an emergency, dial 911. And the fact is that this required the preceding digit, an extra number, to be dialed in order to access that outside line that would have delivered that 911 call. So as we look at 50 years of 911 service and Kari’s 36th birthday, which is coming up tomorrow, it is so appropriate that we take this action. So I thank Mr. GOHMERT and the members of the committee who have continued the diligence on this. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it gives me great pleasure to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the California (Ms. ESHOO ), a valuable member of our Energy and Commerce Committee. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank our terrific ranking member for yielding time to me and for his leadership and that of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Kari’s Law addresses a very serious problem and it has been outlined by Members on both sides of the aisle, and I support the bill. But it is very important for those who are listening into this discussion this morning that when anyone dials 911 from a hotel, from a large building of several stories, from office buildings, from our office buildings where our offices are—10 floors, 20 floors, 30 floors— seconds really matter and they can make the difference between life or death. You should not have to dial 9 or some other prefix to get help. We already know that that is what happened in this tragic situation where the 9yearold daughter was witnessing the actual murder taking place by her father, the estranged husband of Kari. That woman lost her life. So what is missing in this legislation is accuracy for multiline telephone systems. Once your call reaches the 911 call center, whomever answers that call needs to know exactly where you are to dispatch first responders. Now, if you are in a singlefamily home, it is easy. But if you are in any one of these buildings, hotels, or office buildings, the first responders have to go floor by floor. That takes a long time. We know because we walk from floor to floor just to get over to the Capitol. It takes us 7 or 8 minutes to get from Cannon House Office Building to the Capitol. So if you call 911 again from the 10th floor of a 30story office building, it takes first responders a long time to get there. Oftentimes, during an emergency, individuals who have called in, they don’t really know exactly where they are, or they are so panicked that they are blinded by what is going on that they can’t express that to the dispatcher. That is why location technology is really important. I offered an amendment when this bill was taken up at the Energy and Commerce Committee to include location technology. That was rejected by the majority, but they promised that they would work with me in order to bring that about. Despite a lot of reaching out, et cetera, it didn’t happen. I am once again offering legislation to establish that there will be location technology applied to multiline telephone systems. I think it is essential, and I don’t know anyone who would disagree with that. It just didn’t happen. It is not in this bill. But I think that it is important to highlight, as we celebrate the work that has been done, the important step that this takes, that there is a hole in it. So as has been said by other Members, we are approaching the 50th anniversary next week of the first 911 call ever made in our country. I would like to urge my colleagues to work with me to build on the important progress that this bill represents, Kari’s Law, to ensure that all multiline telephone systems provide a caller’s location when they dial 911 so that the full breadth and depth of an emergency system actually reaches them. Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member for yielding time to me. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ), the principal sponsor. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank my new friend, Mr. LEONARD LANCE , from New Jersey for his great help in marshaling this bill, and I appreciate the bipartisan support. I understand there is another element regarding location and there is some disagreement. I see the merit. I understand some have concerns. But what we found out, just to go back, people have talked about how Kari Hunt was viscously attacked by her estranged husband, and her little 9 yearold daughter calling 911. The way that was learned was—and by the way, she was not only stabbed 21 times, she was repeatedly struck. This is an attack that went on over several minutes. Her brutal, meanspirited estranged husband now says from prison: Well, I don’t think it would have mattered if a 911 call had went through. He was attacking her for several minutes. The police could get there in Marshall in a couple of minutes. It would have made all the difference. b1245 But the way it was learned was that Hank had his little 9yearold granddaughter in his lap after Kari was pronounced dead and was trying to console 
her. She was weeping and said to her grandfather: I don’t know what happened. I kept dialing 911 and nothing ever happened. I would hang up, and I would dial 911, and nothing happened. That is when Hank began to look into it and found out the situation. Then, after he brought it to my attention, we got to looking into it. The hotel associations and the other groups have been very helpful. It turns out that it is not an expense. All it takes is the government directing to make sure these phones are programmed so that when you dial 911, it goes straight out. It won’t cost anything. The programmers themselves have said: Hey, if you have a problem, let us know. We will come out and fix that for free. So all it takes is this government saying: Just do it, so when a child or adult or anyone dials 911 it goes out. I thank my friend, MARSHA BLACK BURN ; I thank Senator K LOBUCHAR for her work; and my staff, Caralee Conklin and Andrew Keyes, particularly, for working on this. Tomorrow, Kari would have turned 36. I believe that this will prevent any other Karis in the future from having their birthday celebrated after they are deceased. This will be a legacy for Kari and for Hank, who are the family, and for her daughter. I thank everyone involved in making this happen, and I thank my Democrat friend for working with us. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we all teach our kids. We teach them how to stay safe and how to respond in an emergency. They learn things like stop, drop, and roll for fires; don’t talk to strangers; look both ways before you cross the street; and dial 911 in emergencies. Unfortunately, there is no lesson explaining that on some phones you must dial 9 to get an outside line before you dial 911. Other phones even have additional numbers, and they are not the same for every phone system. Multiline phone systems like those found in offices—our offices, hotels, and hospitals—make our lives easier by condensing multiple lines into a single phone. One feature of multiline phone systems is that, in order to get outside of the internal lines, you must dial a specific code or set of digits. It doesn’t seem like a big deal or even necessarily life threatening, but to this young girl trying to save her mother, that is exactly what a multiline phone system in Marshall, Texas, became. We have heard the story. In 2013, Kari Dunn was stabbed by her estranged husband while her daughter attempted to dial 911 multiple times. She knew the number to call to save her mother’s life, but she didn’t know to dial 9 to get an outside line. She didn’t realize what a multiphone system represented. The emergency personnel subsequently were not getting notified in time. The Energy and Commerce Committee marked up this bill in a previous Congress and supported its passage into law. I was grateful to support the bill back then. I am grateful to Mr. GOHMERT for continuing to press this issue. I look forward to voting for this again. This tragedy occurred in Texas, but it could have happened anywhere. In emergencies, every minute counts. We must remove obstacles to emergency response, and this bill does just that. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS ). (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, it is a great day. I came down here, also, with Congresswoman ESHOO . We chair the bipartisan NextGen 9–11 Caucus. Fifty years is a great anniversary. The caucus has been around 50 years. It is one of those true bipartisan developments. When ANNA and I started, it was Conrad Burns in the Senate and Hillary Clinton on the Senate side. When addressing 911 services and the problems that roll out when we have a successful program, there is nothing perfect. We have to come back and revisit. But it is like baseball, apple pie, and Chevrolet. What could be wrong with being focused on getting emergency services to people in need? That is why 911 is such a great service. I want to thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for bringing this up. We always have to keep changing and updating. As technology moves from the dialup phone to the iPhone and we start doing text and we start doing video, the NextGen 9–11 Caucus works with industry, the telecommunications sector, and the Peace apps to make sure that our firstline responders have the best opportunity to find, as Anna said, what floor. That is a big issue. Technology will overcome that some day, and we have to achieve what we can achieve now, but never shy away from the fact that we can always refine and get better. This is a good start. I want to thank my colleague from Texas. I appreciate his work. I do appreciate my friends on the Democratic side for their commitment and support on this over the years, not just today. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. I will close for our side now, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I want to first congratulate Representative GOHMERT and Senator KLOBUCHAR for this piece of legislation. I hope that our friends on the Republican side will work with us to improve the location accuracy for these multiline systems. I think that is an important piece of unfinished business that we need to do to make this bill even better. We support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, this is the way Congress should work in a bicameral and a bipartisan capacity. I think those of us who serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee are very proud of our service there. It is the committee in the House of Representatives the sends the most bills to the floor—the most bills that pass, the most bills that pass in the Senate, and the most bills that reach the desk of the President of the United States. This was true of President Obama, as I am sure it will be true of President Trump. This act will improve the lives of the American people. We mourn the loss of the terrible tragedy in Texas, but out of that terrible tragedy we hope to improve the American Nation, and this certainly will do that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 582. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

b0320 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ) at 3 o’clock and 20 minutes a.m. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1892, HONORING HOMETOWN HEROES ACT Mr. SESSIONS, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–551) on the resolution (H. Res. 734) providing for consideration of the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to provide for the flying of the flag at halfstaff in the event of the death of a first responder in the line of duty, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1892, HONORING HOMETOWN HEROES ACT Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 734 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 734 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to provide for the flying of the flag at halfstaff in the event of the death of a first responder in the line of duty, with the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or his designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to adoption without intervening motion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, during consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER ), the ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, this 2year budget agreement begins to repair our military and frees our armed services from the harmful spending caps and the devastating practice of funding our troops with stopgap spending bills. It raises defense discretionary spending levels in fiscal year 2018 by $80 billion and nondefense levels by $63 billion, while raising fiscal year 2019 levels by $85 billion and $63 billion respectively. I have been told that this will move spending levels from 2009 spending levels to 2011 spending levels, consistent with what we had done during those periods of time. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. We saw a shutdown just over 2 weeks ago, and here we are again; I believe this is the fifth one since September. And since the Republicans control every branch of the government, we have to wonder what is going on here. I stood in this same spot after midnight in 2013 and announced that the great government of the United States was closed for business. At that point, they were closed for business for 16 days, which means all the Federal buildings and parks were closed. The vendors who had little momandpop stores, newspaper kiosks, and things at Federal businesses lost all the money, a lot of it, people with lunchrooms. The estimate was $24 billion was lost to the Federal Government. As I recall that particular one, that was because Senator CRUZ, a Republican from Texas, didn’t like the Affordable Care Act and apparently was not in favor of giving healthcare to the American people. The first shutdown that occurred when I first came here was during the Clinton administration, when Speaker Gingrich shut down the government of the United States because he was unhappy with the plane seat in Air Force One that had been assigned to him. And 2 weeks ago, it was blamed on the Democrats, which is very strange, since the Democrats do not have the vote to shut down the House. Only the majority has those votes. And this is the first shutdown in history, as far as we can find, that the group of persons who control the House, the Senate, and the White House have given themselves a shutdown. It is a pretty sad day for us. So here we are, 3:30 a.m., 3
1⁄2hours after a government shutdown once again. We have really got to stop this. I tell you, our fellow Americans are in a state of nervous anxiety. The stock market dropped 1,000 points in a single day, twice this week. We have perplexed the entire United States of America as well as large parts of the world. And I would think that a reasonable person, looking at all this, would be understood to believe that perhaps Republicans are incapable of running the government because it is purely, purely government by nothing but crisis. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the distinguished gentlewoman for her help to make sure that the Rules Committee effectively and carefully got their work done this evening, and I want to thank the gentlewoman. I do know it is 3:30 in the morning, and the entire committee, the entire Rules Committee, was prepared on both sides, and I thank the gentlewoman and the staffs that were included. Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress who are elected by their respective districts come to Washington to represent their districts. But perhaps, I think, more importantly, some bit of those people also take into account, not just the representation of their district, but the pride and authorship they have in particular about America, about being a part of America and us standing together. Tonight, we are going to have a chance to say back to one of our Members who has come to Washington, D.C., representing her home of Puerto Rico, home territory of Puerto Rico, and to say back to her that this body offered its condolences for the storms that happened last year. She stood up, representing Puerto Rico. She is a former Speaker of the House of Puerto Rico. She stands with the people of Puerto Rico. She has come and visited Member after Member after Member to sell to them, not only the attributes of how to fix Puerto Rico, but came and did the things legislatively. With great, great admiration, I will tell you that our next speaker, who is a member of the Republican majority, has really done an outstanding job as a brand new Member of this body; and I am pleased that we can say tonight, included in this package is that disaster package that the House passed last, I think, October. She has worked hard. She has had faith and confidence, not only in her home territory of Puerto Rico, but in her body here, the United States Congress. Mr. Speaker, it is with extreme pride that I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N), the former Speaker of the House of Puerto Rico. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for allowing me to support this rule that will have, finally, this bill to be considered on this floor. I think it is important to acknowledge that still, 5 months after the storm, after Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, 30 percent of Puerto 
Ricans are still without power. That is something that you will never expect in a U.S. territory or neither a State. So that is one of the biggest reasons I stood here, at 3:30 in the morning. Why? Because it is time to show our deeds in terms of supporting a bill that will have the money to restore the power grid in Puerto Rico, to help the island to recover from the last hurricanes. Also, we were facing a medical cliff in April of this year—a medical cliff that will put an end to the insurance to 680,000 patients in the island. That is the reason this bill is so important for Puerto Rico. Actually, we have been waiting for 2 months. This bill has been stalled in the Senate, and I actually am very happy to see that agreement between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate voted 71–28 to have this bill here tonight. Mr. Speaker, I need to say that today Congress will make a critical vote in terms of that we finally have a budget deal, and this is the time to vote, not for ideologies, but for the people, for American citizens all over the States. For the States and territories that were struck by disaster during the last year, this bill will provide billions of dollars, including improvement to Puerto Rico’s electrical power network. It also takes the steps to secure the island’s Medicaid program and ensure that our people do not lose their health coverage. For the past year, I have been fighting to ensure Puerto Rico receives the money necessary to avoid that medical cliff now in April. This funding will give Puerto Rico and Congress the time to craft a longterm solution, not just for Puerto Rico, but for all U.S. territories, and help out the medical problems that we all face. I want to thank, especially, the Speaker of the House, Speaker RYAN, the members of this leadership who have been supporting me all of the way; the chairmen, Chairman WALDEN , Chairman BURGESS , Chairman S ESSIONS , Chairman F RELINGHUYSEN ; and all members of this House leadership who have been working with me, visiting the island, even Members from the other side of the aisle, supporting Puerto Rico. You know what? That is the hard work that we need to do for our people. On the Senate side, I need to thank our special friend and advocate, Senator MARCO RUBIO, who has been supporting this issue since day one. I also want to thank all Members of both Chambers willing to save Puerto Rico from near collapse and to help their fellow citizens in the island. I urge my Democratic colleagues, if we want to help Puerto Rico, now is the time to do it. It is not just talking, it is time to act. It is time to vote for this kind of bill. We can’t be hostage of another bill, and I do support having an immigration bill happen. This is a disaster bill that has been included. It has been included in this budget, and we must take action today. That is the reason; this is the time to show it, not by words, by acts. That is the reason I ask my colleagues to vote for this, not say just we want to help Puerto Rico. This is the time to show you really want to help Puerto Rico; you really want to help the island. I understand that, as the Senate did a few minutes ago, we can come together and support what we are willing to do. In Puerto Rico, there are still a lot of things that need to be done. There are so many needs to be met. But let’s continue to work together, as the Senate did today; and I hope, and I expect, the House can do the same thing. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation must pass before the time runs out on hundreds of thousands of young people who were promised, by a previous administration, that if they registered and paid $500, they could stay in the only country they know. Without any warning, the new President invalidated the program and their lives. The things that they were promised were taken away, and those young people, a part of our lives, are living in fear. I really hope that we can do something about that. It is past time. But I think what happened to them was most unAmerican. So I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM ) to discuss our proposal. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I stand here this morning for Nicole, Miriam, Antonio, Karen, Leo, Adriana, and hundreds of thousands of other young Americans who dream and pray for only one thing: that this esteemed body of elected Representatives, endowed with a solemn responsibility to enact laws, will see a piece of themselves in them; that they will see beyond the circumstances by which they came to call America home and, instead, see the American values that they hold deep in their heart of hearts. I would surmise that there isn’t one congressional district that isn’t home to a DREAMer, and, by God, we are all lucky for it because, to our kids, DREAMers are their friends; to our students, DREAMers are their teachers; and to our seniors and elders, DREAMers are, in fact, their caretakers. DREAMers are entrepreneurs with the grit and determination to do something with nothing, following in the footsteps of intrepid explorers who forged new paths that led us to amazing discoveries. To our economy, DREAMers are a welloiled engine of valedictorians, doctors, software engineers, and technicians hoping to give back to their communities. Their imagination and determination is a driving force in the offices of Fortune 500 companies and the Main Streets of our towns and cities. And every year, for the next decade, DREAMer ingenuity and tenacity will quite literally pump billions into our economy. Their efforts help America grow faster and stronger. And collectively, for our Nation, they represent our future and are a reflection of our values. DREAMers are wideeyed American optimism. They work so hard because they are so grateful and, despite setbacks, they persevere. Despite struggles, they overcome, just as Americans always have. And in the face of unbelievable adversity, DREAMers beam the hopefulness and dynamism that gives meaning to the American promise. Our Founders knew that our democracy wasn’t perfect, but they believed that, as lawmakers and representatives, we would work every day to live up to the ideals they set forth. And today, we have an opportunity to do just that. All we have to do is enshrine the promise that unlocked the incredible potential of these young Americans by passing the Dream Act now. With one vote, we have a chance to unite our country around young people who embody our belief that hard work actually pays off. So I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we can immediately bring the Dream Act to the floor and provide certainty for Americans like Nicole, Miriam, Antonio, Karen, Leo, and Adriana who want to continue to contribute to the country that they love, the only country they have ever known. We cannot afford to wait another day. b0340 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ), a member of the Republican leadership team. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, at 3:40 in the morning, I am a little surprised that some of our colleagues wish to reprise history, but I guess so be it. Some forget here that we passed all 12 appropriations bills in September, to no avail. They sit in the Senate requiring 60 votes. I remember a few days ago I stood here and we talked about math with my colleagues, and the Republicans had 51 votes in the Senate. A democracy requires people work together. The Senate decided not to do that, so we have ended up with a series of continuing resolutions, what I consider to 
be an absolute travesty of governance. We have to fund the government in pieces. A month here, 6 weeks there. The last CR, we almost had a deal. It seemed like there was an arrangement we would have to move forward to fund the government before the shutdown. But, I will stress, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the other Chamber decided to throw the kitchen sink at it, demand their entire legislative agenda be put into a CR; DACA, which we are hearing tonight, then they came up with pensions. It was one thing after another of demands, using funding our military, funding our government, keeping the lights on as leverage for their political agenda. We have a basic function here: keep the lights on. The second thing the Constitution says is to preserve and protect our Nation, which means we have to fund our military. But some have felt this is not necessarily a priority of theirs if they can’t get the other things they want when they want them. We now have a bipartisan agreement that the Senate has sent over. It is far from perfect. I don’t know if we will ever see perfect in this Chamber. In my 35 years of business, I rarely saw perfect, but you take progress and move on. What does it do for us? It fully funds defense at the level that Secretary Mattis requested so we can defend our Nation against the threats we see and take care of our military men and women. It funds community health centers. I have 11 of them in my district. It provides 10year funding for CHIP now— the Children’s Health Insurance Program—near and dear to all of us. It provides a down payment on infrastructure that is badly needed in this country. It provides additional funding for opioid treatment in this Nation, a crisis that we face. So, again, I am left to wonder why it is we want to defeat the rule to turn down this effort, this bipartisan agreement, to add another agenda in there. Why would my colleagues want to do that? At some point in time we take progress. The Speaker has indicated we will deal with DACA. We will also move on to dealing with infrastructure. We will move on to workforce development. We have got serious policy issues to deal with, but the priority we have at this moment in time is to fund the government. We have a bipartisan agreement in front of us that has cleared the Senate. It is now 3:43 a.m. I suggest we simply pass the rule, pass it, and go home and get on with policy next week. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I am saddened that this body is descending down a fiscally irresponsible path, a path to trilliondollar deficits, a path to mortgaging the future for my children and yours. To be clear, what this massive spending bill includes is a 14.6 percent increase in defense spending and a 12.2 percent increase in nondefense spending this year. Next year, a 15.1 percent increase in defense spending and 12.9 percent in nondefense spending. The headlines in The New York Times, Mr. Speaker, says: ‘‘As Deficit Soars Toward $1 trillion, Congress Shrugs and Keeps Spending.’’ I also want to quote from the Los Angeles Times. It says: ‘‘The budget deal also means that the United States probably will be returning to trillion dollar annual deficits . . . .’’ When Trump took office about a year ago, the Congressional Budget Office projected the Nation’s deficit would run between $500 billion and $700 billion. Now, with lower tax revenues and new spending, the deficit will blow past $1 trillion in 2019. To be fair, I have long argued that $500 billion to $700 billion deficits are too large. I have supported spending cuts, and I opposed the massive Republican giveaway to special interests through the tax reform bill. It would be easy to say here, Mr. Speaker, that the Republicans own this deficit, the Republicans own this debt. But that is too easy, Mr. Speaker. Do you know who owns this debt? My family and yours. It is owned by the American people, Mr. Speaker, in the form of future taxation, in the form of future reduction in services, in the form of a future threat to Social Security and Medicare. This fiscally irresponsible path has got to end. I will be opposing this bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who care about the fiscal solvency of this Nation to join me in opposing this irresponsible spending bill. As has been mentioned, this bill also fails to include comprehensive immigration reform or the Dream Act. I would note that comprehensive immigration reform, which passed the Senate with a more than twothirds vote a few years ago, would reduce our budget deficit by over $200 billion in increased tax revenue and increased economic productivity. While the Dream Act and similar measures haven’t been formally scored, they also would contribute to reducing our budget deficit because hardworking Americans would be able to get jobs, pay taxes, and participate in the American Dream. If this massive Republican spending bill passes, it will only dig our Nation deeper into a debt that will become harder and harder to ever emerge from. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this massive Republican spending bill and to get to work on fiscally responsible measures, like comprehensive immigration reform and the Dream Act; to reduce our budget deficit and, hopefully, eliminate it rather than bloat it further and further. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a Statement of Administration Policy, which is referred to as a SAP. It comes from the Executive Office of the President. Mr. Speaker, if I could read the last paragraph: ‘‘If the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign it into law.’’ 
BUDGET ACT OF 2018 —(SEN. MCCONNELL , R–KY) The Administration supports Senate passage of the substitute amendment to H.R. 1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. This amendment raises the defense spending caps for fiscal year (FY) 2018 and FY 2019, a key step toward fulfilling the President’s promise to rebuild America’s military and ensure funding would be provided to support the enacted National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (NDAA). After years of dangerous spending reductions and an unpredictable budgetary environment perpetuated by numerous continuing resolutions, the Bipartisan Budget Act lays the groundwork for full funding of America’s national defense, within the framework of the Administration’s National Security and Defense Strategies and the NDAA. Passage of this legislation would ensure America is prepared to deter and, if necessary, defeat the full spectrum of threats from rival powers, rogue states, and terrorist organizations like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The Bipartisan Budget Act lays the groundwork for higher investments in several Administration priorities, including infrastructure and combating the opioid epidemic, and the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reflect the Administration’s detailed funding priorities for the remainder of FY 2018 and for FY 2019 for both defense and nondefense needs. At the same time, it is critical that the Congress work to decrease nondefense spending in other areas to reduce America’s growing national debt. The Bipartisan Budget Act provides nondefense discretionary spending levels higher than the Administration deems necessary. Additionally, although the Bipartisan Budget Act does include some spending reductions, the Administration has proposed hundreds of billions of dollars in additional spending reductions that the Congress should also enact without delay in order to improve our fiscal state. Further, the Administration recognizes the Congress’s desire to provide significant funding for victims of the recent hurricanes and wildfires, as provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act and previously in the Housepassed supplemental bill (H.R. 4667). The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that adequate oversight is exercised over disasterrelated funds to ensure that these funds reach the communities devastated by natural disasters and are not misapplied. The Administration supports other components of the Bipartisan Budget Act, including greater certainty for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, an extension of funding for Community Health Centers, and repeal of Obamacare’s Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). The IPAB authority allows an unelected, unaccountable board to undertake major changes to the Medicare program. The repeal of IPAB furthers the President’s goal of repealing and replacing Obamacare. 
The Administration also supports suspending the debt limit until March 2019 to provide the certainty to markets around the world that the United States will honor its obligations. Furthermore, the Administration is concerned with future extensions of special interest tax deductions and benefits in the wake of tax cuts and reforms that were enacted in December 2017. The President’s top priority is to keep the Nation safe from those who wish to harm it, both at home and abroad. To do so, the United States military needs the resources provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act, which have previously been supported on a bipartisan basis in the NDAA and in multiple bills passed by the House. If the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign it into law. 
Mr. SESSIONS. There should be no question about that, that the President of the United States is asking not only Members of Congress but the American people to understand how important it is to make sure that this government is up and running, to make sure that our military is funded, and that the men and women who protect this great Nation, those volunteers to our military, deserve a right to have us fully fund our military for the rest of the year. I know and the Chair knows, Mr. Speaker, that this deal is only until March 23. But we should not ever allow our military to be put in harm’s way. They are the ones who protect us, and for us putting them in harm’s way without the money to protect them I think is bad timing and a bad way for us to extend our support to the military. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today, at 10 minutes to 4 o’clock Eastern time, that we can say we are going to move forward with this bill that fully funds the military for the rest of the year. I will ask our Members at the very end, accordingly, to please support this underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), a distinguished member of the Committee on Rules. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise because I believe we ought to help the DREAMers. My Republican colleagues have said they want to help the DREAMers as well, yet they have done nothing. I am deeply frustrated, angry, and disappointed that in the greatest deliberative body in the world, we are constantly prevented from deliberating. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defeat the previous question so we can bring up the Dream Act so we can help nearly a million people in this country, mostly young people who came here when they were very, very young, who know no other country but this country as their own. We ought to find a way to protect them, to give them peace of mind. That shouldn’t be a radical idea. Yet we can’t seem to ever bring to the floor a remedy, a solution to help these people. Speaker RYAN, when he took the gavel in 2015, promised a return to regular order. He said: ‘‘We need to let every Member contribute.’’ He also said: ‘‘We ought to open up the process and let people participate.’’ Well, there is a bipartisan group here who believe we ought to protect the DREAMers, who have a solution: the Dream Act. Let us bring it to the floor, have a debate, and vote on it. If my Republican colleagues don’t want to vote for it, they can vote ‘‘no.’’ But we ought to have a debate on this. This is a bigenough deal. This is an important enough issue where we ought to have this debate. It really is frustrating that at this late hour we can’t even get a commitment from the Speaker of the House to bring this issue to the floor. This spending bill that we are talking about, this budget deal, would pass overwhelmingly. All Democrats, I am sure, would support it if the Speaker would just make one promise, and that is that we can bring a bill to the floor, a bill that we think is appropriate, to help the DREAMers. That is it. If my Republican friends don’t want to support it, they can vote ‘‘no.’’ But to not let an issue like this be debated on the floor, to not think it is important enough to bring before the full House, is unconscionable. I don’t know whether my friends on the other side of the aisle have met DREAMers or not, but they have been here. They have been knocking on your door. These are incredible people. They contribute to this country in so many ways. They have led efforts to help protect people who have been victims of hurricanes all throughout this country. They have saved lives. They serve in our military. All we want is a vote. That is it. And I just, for the life of me, can’t quite understand why this is such a heavy lift. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can have this debate. I am tired of all the excuses. I am tired of all the reasons that we are being given why we can’t debate this issue. This is important. These are real people. These are members of our community. They are our neighbors. The time has come for us to act. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Let’s have this debate. Let’s protect the DREAMers. Let’s do the right thing. But enough of the excuses. Enough of the excuses. It is time to vote. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, this past year, 80 members of our armed services lost their lives in training and noncombatrelated fatalities. We are going to attempt tonight, not wait, to pass a bill which will offer funding for our military. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. I thank the members of the Rules Committee, all of them, for the great service they provide to the House of Representatives, this great House of the people. I wish that the Speaker would treat the House of the people with the dignity that it deserves by giving us an opportunity, just an opportunity, for him to say that he would bring legislation to the floor, the HurdAguilar bill for one, and then the other pieces of legislation regarding DACA so that the House could work its will under the queenofthehill rule. Last night, Mr. CLYBURN , the assistant leader; Mr. HOYER , the Democratic whip; and I sent a letter to the Speaker. It said: ‘‘Dear Mr. Speaker: In the spirit of bipartisanship, we write again to reiterate our sincere desire to ensure that the government remains open and that the priorities of the American people are properly addressed. As you know, Democrats have been clear that we support a budget agreement that ensures our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to protect our country and that America’s middle class and working families have the tools they need to succeed. As part of this agreement, we have always expected that the House and the Senate would address the issue of DACA and the DREAMers. ‘‘Most of our Members believe that this budget agreement is a reasonable compromise to address America’s military strength and critical domestic priorities, like fighting the opioid crisis, boosting the National Institutes of Health, moving forward to resolve the pension crisis, caring for our veterans, making college more affordable, and investing in childcare for working families.’’ The agenda that I read was what we fought for and obtained in the budget agreement. We did not object to the large amount of money that was in the bill for defense, although some had asked: What is the purpose? What is the mission? We said: Let’s go forward with that. But to keep faith with the budget agreement, we insisted that the increases in defense would be met by increases on the domestic side. So we have fought this fight. This is a success for us to get, as I said, the opioid crisis, boosting the NIH, the pension crisis, caring for our veterans, making college more affordable, and investing in childcare for our working families. This was the fight we had 
with the Republicans because they have a reluctancy to support domestic spending. So the fact that this came to agreement after months of going back and forth on the caps, I think, is very important to recognize. But, again, writing to the Speaker: ‘‘We are writing to again reiterate our request that you make a public statement regarding the scheduling of a vote on a DACA bill. Our request is that you publicly state that you will schedule a vote to consider the bipartisan HurdAguilar bill and any other DACA bills that you wish to consider under a Queen of the Hill rule,’’ as I mentioned earlier. ‘‘We strongly believe that Members of the House and their constituents deserve the same dignity that Leader MCCONNELL has extended to Members of the Senate by allowing for a vote on this issue. ‘‘Thank you for your immediate attention to this letter.’’ So we haven’t heard back from the Speaker on this, but I do support defeating the previous question. One of the gentlemen on the other asked: Why would anybody vote against this bill? Why would anybody vote against this rule? Well, because we have an opportunity right here to take matters into our own hands. Defeat the previous question so that we can take up the Dream Act. That would be the House working its will, because we do know that the Dream Act has support on both sides of the aisle. We thank our Republican colleagues, those who have spoken out publicly, for their courage in supporting this protection. If another country said that they were going to deport 800,000 people or place in jeopardy their protections under the law, we would be appalled. We would criticize them. So how can we, the United States of America—give me your poor—you know Emma Lazarus. I don’t have to go into it right now. b0400 But I do. We all carry it in our hearts. So I urge a ‘‘no’’ on the previous question because a ‘‘yes’’ would have allowed us to bring up the Dream Act. I really want to disabuse anyone in this body of any idea that we are not there to support our men and women in uniform and to give them the resources they need to keep themselves and our Nation safe. But I do recognize also that what our military are protecting is the greatest country that ever existed in the history of the world, the United States of America. What is the United States of America? It is a country governed by a constitution that has been a beacon to the world. It is a country populated by the beautiful diversity of America. It is a country that has a beautiful patrimony given to us by God, our natural beauty. Fighting for those values is what we try to do in this bill. Why can’t we extend the hand of friendship and protection to our DREAMers? Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of my colleague if he has any further speakers? Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentlewoman I will be closing as soon as she does. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, let’s acknowledge that a deal like this could have come much sooner if the majority tried bipartisanship from the very beginning. Instead, our Nation has had to go through four shortterm funding fights and two government shutdowns to arrive at where we are this morning. All of that was entirely preventible. It was brought on by the majority’s inability to get its work done. It was little more than a week ago that President Trump stood in this Chamber and gave his State of the Union Address. In it, he proclaimed: ‘‘I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.’’ That was Tuesday. But the following Tuesday, the President said that he would love to see a shutdown. He keeps injecting incredible confusion and uncertainty as to what he actually would be willing to sign into law. I am aware that my colleague, Mr. SESSIONS , did assure us that he wants to sign this bill. Mr. Speaker, it has been an awful long night, and it didn’t need to be. We don’t need to take up every crisis to the very brink. Since you control every lever of power in this government, you have failed the most basic responsibility: to run this government in a sensible and intelligent way. Everybody— all of us—know, whether we want to admit it or not, that this is no way to run a government and certainly not a government as important as the one we were sent here to represent. I also urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question so the House can take up the Dream Act because time is so quickly running out on those young people. It would be a blot on our conscience for the rest of our lives if we did nothing to help. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend and colleague, the ranking member of the Rules Committee; and the entire Rules Committee, Republicans and Democrats; and our staffs for their work late tonight and well into the morning. Mr. Speaker, there was a question about the President of the United States and his advice that he has provided to this body. The President of the United States has indicated through a Statement of Administration Policy that there would be an expectation the President would sign this bill. What does this mean? This means that, as quickly as we can accomplish this rule, the underlying legislation, and the vote, perhaps as early as 7 o’clock this morning or earlier, the President of the United States may sign that; meaning that the American people could wake up today with confidence that the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives has averted a further problem through the leadership of making sure that we move forward to fund the government. Make no mistake about it: there will be people who vote ‘‘yes’’ and people who vote ‘‘no,’’ and that is up to them. But, Mr. Speaker, tonight I would ask every Member of this body for that ‘‘aye’’ vote to do the right thing to fund the government. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote 
against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule ....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question.

Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion. The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. Frelinghuysen moves that the House concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 734, the motion shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to present the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892, a bipartisan, bicameral bill outlining the funding for the next 2 fiscal years and funding for the government through March 23, providing much needed emergency supplemental funding for disaster recovery, and raising the Nation’s debt ceiling. This legislation will help our Nation move forward without the threat of a shutdown or default and with greater budget scrutiny. This bill will also allow us to move past the destructive cycle of continuing resolutions, which undermine the appropriations process and promotes only more uncertainty and doubt about our government’s and this Congress’ ability to function and to meet the needs of those we represent. I am pleased that this legislation includes an agreement reached on a bipartisan basis by House and Senate leaders on spending caps for both fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. Especially important is a substantial increase in funds for national defense. Our Nation faces multiple security challenges and increasingly aggressive, not to mention well equipped, adversaries. We must be prepared to meet these challenges, and we must take care of our men and women in uniform who truly do the work of freedom. After years of reduction in military funding and months of uncertainty caused by continuing resolutions, it is time we provide our Armed Forces with what they need to rebuild and keep our Nation safe. The agreement also outlines investments in important bipartisan domestic priorities such as fighting the opioid abuse epidemic, supporting veterans, and rebuilding and renewing our infrastructure around the Nation. These top line spending levels will enable us to get to work immediately on our 12 appropriations bills to wrap up the fiscal year 2018 and quickly turn our attention to fiscal year 2019. This legislation also includes a short term continuing resolution, our last for this year, which will fund the Federal Government through March 23. This will maintain programs and services that all Americans depend on until all of the annual appropriations bills can be enacted. I look forward to working with our Senate counterparts to negotiate and complete all of these bills ahead of that deadline. In addition to these critical pieces of government funding, this legislation also provides $89.3 billion in emergency disaster funding, funding that has been urgently needed since this House passed its version in December. This funding will provide the residents of Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Western States with the resources to rebuild their lives after last year’s historic and devastating natural disasters. Lastly, this bill increases the debt limit through March 1, 2019, so we can pay our bills and avoid the economic damage of a default. Mr. Speaker, the Senate has just passed this bill, and now it is up to this House to do the same and to send this legislation to the President for his signature. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the bill and reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is a basic constitutional responsibility of Congress to fund the Federal Government and Republican majorities in the House and the Senate are just turning the process into an embarrassing spectacle, running from one crisis directly into the next. It has been clear for 9 months that a bipartisan budget agreement would be needed to enact appropriations law, yet it has taken five continuing resolutions, two lapses in funding, countless hours of effort to take even this first step toward fullyear funding bills, more than 4 months into the fiscal year. I am pleased with many aspects of the budget agreement. Increasing statutory spending caps would allow the Appropriations Committee to write responsible, bipartisan spending bills that will invest in this Nation’s families, communities, and national security. I am also pleased the legislation would provide funding for families and communities in Texas, Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to rebuild their lives following natural disasters. Unfortunately, this legislation cannot be considered in a vacuum. The Speaker of the House’s refusal to commit to considering bipartisan legislation to protect teenagers and young adults from deportation is unjustifiable and maddening. DREAMers are sons, daughters, parents. They are students and teachers. They serve with distinction in our Armed Forces. They pay taxes and contribute to their communities. President Trump and the Republican majority hold the lives and futures of these children and young adults in their hands, yet their only concern seems to be how much they can extract and exchange for doing what a decent human being should do simply because it is right. I cannot vote in good conscience to provide Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the very funding that could be used to deport the DREAMers. I cannot vote to continue the appropriations process while an unthinkably tragic fate hangs over the head of 1.6 million young people. I do hope that in the weeks ahead a bipartisan bill for DREAMers can pass the Senate and enough pressure can be brought to bear on House Republicans to act. History will condemn these Republican majorities if they fail to do what is right. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ), a member of our Appropriations Committee. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, West Virginia is literally ground zero in the opioid epidemic. Our overdose rate is not just a little bit higher than the national average of the No. 2 State. It is actually 33 percent higher than the No. 2 State. So when we passed the 21st Century Cures legislation, dedicating $1 billion to fight this horrific epidemic, it gave us hope; it gave me hope. And that hope was particularly strong in rural States like West Virginia, that finally we might see real resources where it really counts, in rural 
communities. But unfortunately, many of the worsthit States like mine ended up receiving only a minimal amount of funding. Let me give you an example. A more populous State received five times more funding than my State, but my State’s overdose rate was five times higher than the more populous State. This bill, like every bill, has parts I like and parts I don’t like. One of the issues I have fought for is making sure the now $6 billion we are putting towards fighting the opioid crisis will actually get to the places where it matters most. We must use a formula based on per capita statistics to ensure funds go to the hardest hit States and smaller States where the crisis and the need is the greatest. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, and having a direct hand on how the $6 billion will be targeted, I have been reassured that rural States like mine will not be shortchanged and—we will work to make sure the language in our funding bill makes it abundantly clear to the Federal agencies that actually set the allocation formulas—we want resources flowing to where they count most. I want to thank Chairman FRELING HUYSEN and his predecessor Chairman ROGERS for their commitment and leadership to helping. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ). Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House is supposed to be the Speaker of this entire House. And the entire will of this House on the Democratic side and Republican side is to pass a DACA bill but we are running out of time. Instead of following the bipartisan consensus of the majority in this House, this Speaker is yielding to the will of the majority party’s antiimmigration fringe unilaterally, and that fringe is led by this President. If we continue to bend to this fringe, this body, this shiny beacon on a hill, this hopefulness in this country will go dark. The Senate was able to pass the bipartisan agreement due to the hard promise of Leader MCCONNELL and the good work of our Democratic leadership as well to allow—simply allow— the body to vote on a DACA bill. We, however, have no such commitment on this side. 22,000 dreamers in the State of New Jersey: they are doctors, they are lawyers, they are connected to their churches, they are parents, they are teachers, they are business owners. I spent time in a church where a Christian, tithepaying immigrant was taken from his family and put in detention. He was not a threat to anyone. My constituents did not send me here to deport young people who are American and know no other country. I ask you, I beg you, I implore you: Do your job. Save these DREAMers, and until we do, I urge a ‘‘no’’ on this vote. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ), a member of the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, we have a choice today. I want to compliment the work that the committees have done to reach an agreement on these funding levels. I am not here to quibble with those funding levels. What I am here to ask for is a chance. If this is the people’s House, we deserve an opportunity to address these issues. I have never said this is a bad deal. I have just said this is an incomplete deal. It is incomplete because we haven’t had the commitment that we need to address critical issues that are important to our communities. We have addressed some in this: opioids, community health centers. Those are important issues in all of our communities. But we haven’t addressed issues that are important to everyone. Like Leti Herrera who was my guest to the State of the Union who lost her sister in December, who is scared, who wants to know when her priorities are going to be our priorities. She wants to know when we are going to bring up these issues. And I can tell her, the Senate has a commitment; they are going to talk about these issues. But the people’s House has not said that we are going to talk about these issues. We are going to say, well, when the President signs off, then we will have a conversation. He doesn’t have a card that votes in these machines. He has a voice. He should be consulted. He doesn’t have a voice in the people’s House. He doesn’t have a vote here with me and you. All we want is a commitment to bring up a bipartisan, bicameral bill that addresses these issues. All we want is a chance. All we want is an opportunity to address these issues that are important to our communities. Please, please, please give us that opportunity to have that conversation. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I have the right to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the Democratic leader. b0500 Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I also thank her for her outstanding statement of values and what our country is about. I thank her for her extraordinary leadership. I thank all of our colleagues for the unity that we have had over the months when we were having this debate about what this bill would look like. I want to, again, read a letter that Mr. HOYER , Mr. C LYBURN , and I sent to the Speaker last night—I guess this night, because I think it is very important for people to understand the simplicity of our request, the fairness of our request to the Speaker. It says: ‘‘In the spirit of bipartisanship, we write to again reiterate our sincere desire to ensure that the government remains open and that the priorities of the American people are properly addressed. As you know, Democrats have been clear that we support a budget agreement that ensures that our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to protect our country and that America’s middle class and working families have the tools they need to succeed. As part of this agreement, we have always expected that the House and the Senate would address the issue of DACA and our DREAMers. ‘‘Most of our Members believe that the budget agreement is a reasonable compromise to address America’s military strength and critical domestic priorities, like fighting the opioid crisis, boosting NIH, moving forward to resolve the pension crisis, caring for our veterans, making college more affordable, and investing in childcare for working families.’’ Indeed, that is what the fight has been about all along. We have had to fight the resistance on the Republican side to invest in the domestic agenda. So I was pleased to hear some of our Republican colleagues talk about some of the things in this bill that we, on the Democratic side, insisted upon being there. So, Mr. Speaker, we are writing again to request that you make a public statement regarding the scheduling of a vote on the DACA bill. That is our request. That is the request of the House Democrats that Mr. HOYER and Mr. CLYBURN sent this letter last night: ‘‘Our request is that you publicly state that you will schedule a vote to consider the bipartisan HurdAguilar bill and any other DACA bills that you wish to consider under a Queen of the Hill rule. ‘‘We strongly believe that Members of the House and their constituents deserve the same dignity that Leader MCCONNELL has extended to Members of the Senate’’ by stating that he will allow a vote on this issue. We asked him for his immediate attention to this issue, but we did not receive that back. I said earlier that America is the greatest country that ever existed in the history of the world. Aren’t we proud to be Americans? And what is America? America is a country of great people of beautiful diversity that have changed over time from the days of our Founders. ‘‘E pluribus unum,’’ they said. They could never imagine how pluribus it could be, how many, how 
many different people. Yet they established a Constitution that enabled everyone the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is a beautiful thing. Our country has become a more diverse country over time, but still, e pluribus unum. In this vote today, we are just saying to pay respect to the fact that we are a nation of immigrants, constantly reinvigorated by newcomers coming with their hopes, dreams, aspirations, courage to make the future better for their families. That is what America is about. That is what the optimism of our Founders was based on, that every generation would take responsibility. So these newcomers have made America more American. Then who is America? America is our great Constitution of the United States, a great Constitution, which we take an oath to support. And what else is America? America is a great patrimony, this beautiful land that God has given us to be stewards of. It is important to know that our country is our 50 States, the District of Columbia, and our territories. In respect for that, I am very pleased that, in this bill, we were successful in the negotiations to get more funding for the territories, especially Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, an increase over what was in the original disaster bill. But there are other things that are important to note that are in this bill. Again, opioids, mental health, National Institutes of Health, these are Democratic priorities that we fought for. That is why this took so long to come to fruition, because there was a resistance on the Republican side to invest on the domestic side. So they have been increasing the defense number, which we go along with, but wanted commensurate increase on the domestic side, recognizing the domestic side for us and our budget—appropriators know this better than anyone—includes security functions, Homeland Security, the State Department, Veterans Affairs, antiterrorism activities of the Justice Department. So there is much security on the domestic side. That is why we insisted on increasing the number, and that did happen. That did happen. That is why I am able to say in this letter that there are many good things in this legislation. But for some reason, sometimes I think the Speaker thinks he is Speaker of the White House, not the Speaker of the House of Representatives. We should have the opportunity—I touched a nerve there, I hear—to have this House, the people’s House, work its will, not be the recipients of something that might—as he said: Well, if it passes with 60 votes in the Senate and the President approves, then maybe I will bring it to the floor. That is not a commitment. Just let me say again what an honor it is for any of us to associate ourselves with the aspirations of the DREAMers in our country. They are so magnificent. They are a model of patriotism to our country, and all they wanted was the recognition of the Speaker of the House that they are worthy of that. In any event, I thank the various speakers who were presiding the other day. I thank the speakers for their courtesies extended. I thank the Chair, too, Mr. Speaker. But here it is: Yes, I was one of the four principals with the White House negotiating on this legislation. A lot of it came our way. Do you know why? Because nobody wants a shutdown. This is a good bill. It doesn’t do everything, but it is a compromise. But the one thing and the one message to allay fear, to build confidence, to honor the vows of our Founders that we could have done is to say: We, the United States of America, in this people’s House, want to assure you that we will allow the House of Representatives to work its will. Let the chips fall where they may, but give us a chance to allay the fear that is in the hearts of these DREAMers and their families and to remove the tears from the eyes of the Statue of Liberty observing what is happening here. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. A fifth CR—a fifth CR—while one party controls all levers of government, shows the Republicans’ inability to govern. Even more upsetting is their refusal to put a bipartisan DREAMer bill on the House floor. While there are provisions in the Senate amendment that Democrats support, we implore our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to do what is right and to permit a vote on a bipartisan DREAMer bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. RYAN), the Speaker of the House. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. A few hours ago, the Senate passed this agreement with a very big bipartisan vote: 75 percent of the Senate Democrats, 68 percent of the Senate Republicans, Republicans and Democrats coming together on a true compromise measure. I think that is a thing to celebrate. It accomplishes what so many of us had been fighting for. First and foremost, this agreement accomplishes getting the resources that we need to rebuild our military. Also, this includes longdelayed disaster funding to aid recovery from the hurricanes and the wildfires; money to fight opioids, something that knows no partisan boundaries; and the extension of important healthcare programs. This agreement will also allow us to step off this carousel of shortterm funding bills that do nothing but hurt our military and stymie our ability to focus on other important agenda items. And I think that has been noted here tonight. You know, most Americans are not even awake yet, or maybe they are just getting up for the first shift. By the time they catch up with the news this morning, they will see one of two things, depending upon what choice we make here right now. Either Congress will have done its most basic responsibility: funding the government and taking care of our brave men and women in uniform. I really believe that that is what the majority of this people in this body want to see happen. Or they will see a second needless shutdown in a matter of weeks. Entirely needless. Republicans will deliver more than our share of votes this morning. I urge my friends in the minority to stand with us on this bipartisan bill. My commitment to working together on an immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment. Let me repeat. My commitment to working together on an immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment. We will solve this DACA problem. Once we get this budget agreement done—and we will get this done, no matter how long it takes for us to stay here—we will focus on bringing that debate to this floor and finding a solution. But we cannot do that unless we pass this budget agreement. Our military can no longer be held hostage in this process. So, for this morning, let’s honor our troops. Let’s do our most basic job and let’s pass this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, after much consideration, I will reluctantly vote for this legislation. The bipartisan agreement included $6 billion to combat opioid abuse and improving mental health, $2 billion for research at the National Institutes of Health and $4 billion for college affordability. The measure extends one of my legislative priorities, the Children’s Health Insurance Program for 10 years. Since Hurricane Harvey’s landfall in last August, I have worked tirelessly with the Texas Governor, the Texas Congressional delegation, local mayors, county commissioners and police and fire chiefs to identify and meet the needs of impacted Texans. The agreement increases overall disaster relief from $81 billion to $89 billion which means it will increase Texas’s share of that relief and to significantly increase the funding for critical Army Corps flood management projects that help Texas to take necessary measures against future flooding events. Additionally, I have fought hard for many years to fund the needs of our veterans, and our transportation infrastructure. This bill provides $4 billion to reduce the VA healthcare maintenance backlog. There will be $20 billion to invest in infrastructure, including programs related to rural water and wastewater, clean 
and safe drinking water, rural broadband, energy, innovative capital projects, and surface transportation. The agreement includes funding for child care, including the bipartisan Child Care Development Block Grant program and funding for studentcentered programs that aid college completion and affordability, including those that help police officers, teachers and firefighters. Mr. Speaker, I will vote yes on this bill because the measure also closes the Medicare Part D ‘‘donut hole’’ for seniors in 2019. I will continue to work to make sure that Congress follows through on this deal, and that Texas’ 30th District gets what it needs to move our communities, our state and the Nation forward. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to explain the importance of the pending legislation, which extends the Continuing Resolution passed by Congress on January 26, 2018 but expired at midnight, February 8, 2018, by an additional six weeks, or until March 23, 2018. This crucial legislation rests upon three pillars. First, the legislation before us provides $89.3 billion in aid to respond to the damage caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the wildfires in California. Second, the Continuing Resolution pending before us is necessary to finalize and implement a bipartisan and bicameral budget agreement gives parity to defense and non defense discretionary funding and provides $117 billion more funding for needed nondefense investments in the areas of education, public health, infrastructure, community development, and disaster relief than proposed under the Trump FY 2018 budget. Third, I will be advocating for a nay vote on the Previous Question in order to bring to the floor a crucial legislative fix for debate and vote that will provide permanent legal residence and a path to citizenship to the more than 800,000 Dreamers, including the 124,000 who live in Texas, whose lives have been turned upside down because of this Administration’s cruel, unwise, and reckless termination of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. And in connection with legislation to protect Dreamers, I will insist that the Administration rescind the revocation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haiti, El Salvador, and Honduras, or failing that, TPS for those countries be extended by congressional legislation. Mr. Speaker, 44,800 residents of Texas are TPS holders from El Salvador (36,300), Honduras (8,400), and Haiti, who combined are parents of 53,800 U.S.born children in Texas and 14,000 of whom have home mortgages. These TPS holders are integral members of the Texas’s social fabric, having lived in Texas an average of 20 years, and contribute an aggregate $2.2 billion to the Texas economy. This legislation provides $89.3 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to help states, communities, businesses, and individuals respond and recover from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the California wildfires. This amount represents a doubling of the woefully inadequate $44 billion disaster relief package proposed by the Administration and a substantial increase over the $81.1 billion disaster relief funding approved by the House. Ever since the widespread and catastrophic destruction of Hurricane Harvey occurred, I have been working closely with Senator C ORNYN and other federal, state, and local officials, along with my colleagues in the Texas congressional delegation to secure the help necessary for the areas affected by Hurricane Harvey recover and rebuild. The $8 billion increase in disaster relief funding reflected in this legislation is due in strong part to the efforts of Senator CORNYN , with whom I worked very closely to ensure that the interests of Houston and Harris County were promoted and protected. I have witnessed firsthand the pain of storm weary Houstonians who lost their homes, their belongings, and in many cases their jobs. Right now, at this very moment, hundreds of thousands of Texans—in Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Rockport, in Houston and Harris County—remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue tarp roofs and infected with mold. They are struggling and hurting. So this is personal to me. That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local governments so that relief can deliver the resources and services so desperately needed. That is why I am working with the Texas General Land Office Commissioner and have advocated for the immediate release of the $5 billion that was approved in September 2017 and wrote the HUD Secretary to expedite promulgation of the proposed regulations necessary to release the funds, which finally were published this week in the Federal Register for notice and comment. And that is why on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey struck, I introduced the first Hurricane Harvey disaster recovery legislation. I was joined by 44 colleagues in introducing H.R. 3686, the ‘‘Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,’’ which provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland United States. The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically that legislation would provide relief in the following amounts: 1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion 2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion 3. Army Corps of Engineers—Construction: $15 billion 4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion 5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion 6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion 7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million 8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million 9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million 10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million 11. Army National Guard: $10 million 12. Army Corps of Engineers—Civil Investigations: $150 million 13. Coast Guard: $450 million 14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million 15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion 16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million 17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million 18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million 19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million 20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion 21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million 22. FederalAid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion Although, the disaster relief funding provided in the legislation before us is not as robust as the package I have proposed, it is a significant improvement over what was initially offered by the Administration and will provide much needed assistance to disaster victims in desperate need of help. I wish to thank the leadership of the Appropriations Committee, in particular THUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Diaz Balart, and Energy and Water Appropriations Ranking Member Kaptur for including in the legislation before us the following beneficial measures that I requested, including: 1. Authority to establish and implement a $1 billion pilot program to provide small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930, the ‘‘Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,’’ legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and is cosponsored by 16 of our colleagues. 2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Investigations account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million HoustonArea Watershed Assessment Study. 3. This is a highly successful conclusion to the multiyear struggle I waged to secure House approval of this project and funding with the Jackson Lee Amendments to the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for Fiscal Years 2016, 2017, and 2018. 4. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that in awarding CDBG Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local government and public housing authorities that have the financial and administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program. 5. The bill also includes a provision for which I advocated expressly providing that religious nonprofit organizations and houses of worship have the same opportunity to qualify for disaster assistance as their secular counterparts. Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in this disaster relief funding package before us: FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $28 billion to provide critical funding to assist the ongoing federal disaster response to allow up to $4 billion to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs). Emergency Food Assistance Program: $24 million to provide an additional 35 million pounds of food for food banks in states affected by natural disasters. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): $14 million. 
$7.6 million to repair 12 Food and Drug Administration sites damaged by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, including repair of scientific equipment such as those used to test foods for chemical contamination. Economic Development Assistance Programs: $600 million in additional funding to provide grants to communities directly impacted by Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as others disasters declared in 2017. This funding will support immediate relief efforts and longterm recovery projects, including repairing and replacing basic infrastructure needs that are vital for local economic recovery. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $400 million, with $100 million allocated for improving weather forecasting capabilities and data collection efforts to better protect lives and property in the wake of future hurricanes, and with $200 million for fishery disasters causing severe economic harm in coastal communities following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $81 million to repair facilities damaged at the Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers. Legal Services Corporation: $15 million for mobile resources, technology, and disaster coordinators necessary to provide stormrelated services to the population in affected areas. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: $17.39 billion, including $15 billion for flood control and storm damage reduction construction projects and $135 million for high priority Investigation studies for risk reduction from future floods and hurricanes. Of this $135 million, $75 million is to be allocated for the Army Corps of Engineers’ Investigations account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million HoustonArea Watershed Assessment Study I have worked to secure and which has been previously approved by the House. The bill also included $608 million to finance needed federal dredging projects, such as Houston Shipping Channel and $810 million to prepare for and mitigate future flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), will receive $28 billion allocated to the Community Development Fund to repair homes, support local business, and rebuild infrastructure while mitigating future risk. Also included in the legislation is authority for HUD to adjust Section 8 voucher funding for public housing agencies adversely affected by disasters in 2017. Mr. Speaker, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, located in my congressional district, will benefit from the $10.3 million to repair Transportation and Security Administration facilities, security equipment, and access control equipment at airports damaged by the hurricanes. The Texas Gulf Coast will benefit from the $835 million allocated to the U.S. Coast Guard; $4 million of which for site assessments to determine environmental compliance and restoration needs. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will receive $23.5 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to support response and recovery efforts. Other important provisions in the FEMA appropriations: 1. Ensure that religious nonprofit organizations are given the same opportunity to qualify for certain disaster assistance as their secular counterparts. 2. Extend the period of time that local government revenue loss as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria can be considered for the purpose of Community Disaster Loans. 3. Authorize the President to increase the federal cost share for certain disaster assistance from 75 to 85 percent if recipients have taken steps to make themselves more resilient against disasters. The Environmental Protection Agency will receive $6.2 million for the Superfund program to help repair damage sustained to remedies at Superfund sites; $7 million for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program to repair damage to storage tanks to prevent spills and contaminants from leaking into the environment; and $50 million for debris removal and technical assistance to inspect and clean up hazardous waste facilities. Department of Labor: $100 million for disaster response economic recovery through the Dislocated Worker National Reserve. Department of Health and Human Services: 1. $200 million for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2. $50 million for National Institutes of Health; 3. $650 million for Head Start; and 4. $162 million for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, including $60 million for Community Health Centers and $20 million for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration. Department of Education will receive $2.7 billion for Hurricane Education Recovery, including: 1. $2.46 billion to restart operations at elementary and secondary schools; 2. $100 million for institutions of higher education, and students at those institutions; 3. $25 million for education services for homeless children; and 4. $35 million for Project SERV for educationrelated services to help students recover from traumatic events, including natural disasters. Notably, this legislation forgives loans made to four Historically Black Colleges and Universities in response to Hurricane Katrina. Also notably, the CR allocates $14 million for the Government Accountability Office to conduct oversight and evaluate distribution and use of disaster funding across agencies to ensure responsible use of taxpayer funds. Department of Veterans Affairs: $4.1 million to repair damages to the Veterans Benefit Administration Office in Houston, Texas and the Puerto Rico National Cemetery. Department of Transportation: $30 billion to repair damaged infrastructure and help communities recover from natural disasters. Federal Highway Administration will receive $1.3 billion and the Federal Transit Administration will receive $330 million, both for their Emergency Relief Programs. Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. But the disaster relief funding package before us today represents a solid start toward completing the necessary work that must be undertaken to restore the affected communities to their previous greatness. As I conclude, I am remembering a heroic DREAMER, Alonso Guillen, who came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, and died in my congressional district when his boat capsized while he was rescuing survivors of the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area. There is no heart in ending DACA and leaving the fate of 800,000 young persons in limbo and constant fear of deportation from the only country they have ever known, and the only nation to which they have ever pledged allegiance. The way to end this crisis is to bring H.R. 3440, the Dream Act of 2017, to the floor right now and vote for it so it can pass both houses of Congress with a vetoproof majority. A Dreamer seeking to earn her college degree and aspiring to attend medical school to better herself and her new community is not a threat to the nation’s security. Law abiding but unauthorized immigrants doing honest work to support their families pose far less danger to society than human traffickers, drug smugglers, or those who have committed a serious crime. President Obama was correct in concluding that exercising his discretion regarding the implementation of DACA enhances the safety of all members of the public, serves national security interests, and furthers the public interest in keeping families together. According to numerous studies conducted by the Congressional Budget Office, Social Security Administration, and Council of Economic Advisors, DACA generates substantial economic benefits to our nation. For example, expanding DACA is estimated to increase GDP by $230 billion and create an average of 28,814 jobs per year over the next 10 years. That is a lot of jobs. In exercising his broad discretion in the area of removal proceedings, President Obama acted responsibly and reasonably in determining the circumstances in which it makes sense to pursue removal and when it does not. Because of President Obama’s leadership and visionary executive action, 124,000 undocumented immigrants in my home state of Texas have received deferred action. 91 percent of these immigrants are employed or in school and contribute $6.3 billion annually to the Texas economy and $460.3 billion to the national economy. Instead of wasting time scapegoating DREAMERS, we should instead seize the opportunity to pass legislation that secures our borders, preserves America’s character as the most open and welcoming country in the history of the world, and will yield hundreds of billions of dollars in economic growth. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered.
