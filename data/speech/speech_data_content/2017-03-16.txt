Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, in the aftermath of the November elec-tion, it has been exciting to watch the unprecedented outpouring of citizen concern, activism, and, in some cases, outrage. America is finding its voice so Congress can find its spine. Most recently, the people are de-manding Congress be held accountable for the outrageous efforts on behalf of Republicans to dismantle the Afford-able Care Act, forcing more expensive coverage for insurance plans that will not be as good and breaking the Trump promise of better, more affordable health care. It has become clear that the Repub-lican plan would force older Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 to pay 60 percent more for their health insurance coverage. The Republican plan also seeks to unwind the life-changing expansion under Medicaid that has provided care for the poor, disabled, and lower in-come and helps people with mental ill-ness and opioid addiction. Wildly increasing the ranks of the uninsured and lowering the quality of care and affordability is so unaccept-able to the American public that it is exposing deep divisions within the Re-publican ranks. The wrecking crew is being slowed as public awareness and citizen action spread across the country. This morn-ing, the American public has drawn a new assignment: to resist the Trump budget. It is shocking in its reckless cuts to programs that Americans hold dear. b1015 What does it say that the cuts pro-posed to the Environmental Protection Agency are so extreme that even the EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has made a career out of attacking the EPA, found it too brutal even for him? The unnecessary expansion of some defense spending, especially the tril-lion-dollar spending spree that we are embarking on for new nuclear weapons, is completely out of sync with our real defense needs and slashing vital State Department programs that enhance our security. Trump would not just impose shock-ing reductions on peacekeeping and hu-manitarian action, but he would deny the State Department the ability to ex-ercise soft power. This compromises our national security interests and leaves us less safe. Critical and widely supported life-saving medical research efforts will be slashed, reversing years of bipartisan effort to enhance medical research to fight disease, illness, and disability. At a time of housing crisis across the country, some of the few Federal tools to increase affordability and combat homelessness are being cut away. This budget disaster would even zero out Federal support for public broad-casting, even though it represents just a tiny sliver of Federal budget and sup-ports a vital public service. Public broadcasting is supported by an over-whelming majority of Americans, even those who voted for Donald Trump. Ap-pallingly, those cuts would punish

rural and small town America that are more dependent than anybody else on public broadcasting support to be able to maintain that service. The people who are resisting this reckless administration have this new assignment: resist the budget; make clear to their representatives that it should be dead on arrival; that decades of bipartisan support for vital pro-grams to protect the environment, human services, international humani-tarian interest, medical research, even public broadcasting will not be toler-ated. People are making a difference, but America needs all of us to find our voice so that Congress does its job.

PENN STATE EXTENSION IS A VALUABLE SERVICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. T
HOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the efforts of Penn State Extension, which is an educational network that gives the people in Pennsylvania’s 67 counties access to the university’s re-sources and expertise, especially its ag-ricultural resources as a land-grant university. Cooperative extension services began in 1914. The Smith-Lever Act estab-lished a system of cooperative exten-sion services connected to the land- grant universities in order to inform people about the current developments in agriculture, home economics, public policy and government, leadership, 4–H, economic development, coastal issues, and many other related sub-jects. It helped farmers learn new agri-cultural techniques by the introduc-tion of home instruction. Since its inception, it has been fo-cused on informal, noncredit adult con-tinuing education. Thus, cooperative extension is not a service, but a schol-arly content-driven educational mis-sion of the university. This program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agri-culture, State, and county govern-ments. Through these county-based partnerships, Penn State Extension educators, faculty, and local volunteers work together to share unbiased, re-search-based information with local residents. Penn State Extension can help you become a master gardener. It helps teach families how to prepare and pre-serve food safely. It can help you learn about how to start a home-based busi-ness or how to properly prepare tax forms. Penn State Extension helps in-dividuals, families, businesses, and communities throughout Pennsylvania with information and a broad range of educational programs. Everyone in the community can tap into the assets and information of our major research university, and there are numerous ways to learn. You can attend an educational event, take an online course, read a publication, or speak face-to-face with an extension educator. There is no shortage of learn-ing opportunities with Penn State Ex-tension. Mr. Speaker, this is just one way that Penn State is extending knowl-edge and improving the quality of life for all Pennsylvanians. The programs are very localized and touch every county in the State through 21 sepa-rate districts. Extension is particularly helpful to farmers and those involved in the agriculture industry, which is Pennsylvania’s number one economic driver. Whether you are a beginning farmer or you have a few years under your belt, it is good to know you are not in the farming world alone. Extension ac-tivities can help connect you with oth-ers to share ideas, trials, and tribu-lations. In fact, Federal cooperative ex-tension programs have helped more than 137,000 farmers stay in business just since 1985. Without cooperative ex-tension and the underlying research, researchers have estimated that the country would have lost 28 percent more farmers than those who actually left agriculture. Who would feed us? Who would pro-vide that food, fiber, building mate-rials, even forms of energy that our farmers and farm families do today? By design, extension is locally di-rected and responsive to the needs of local communities. I am grateful that Penn State is one of those land-grant universities and can offer this service to the public. It helps keep our local farmers abreast of the most up-to-date information that impacts the industry and impacts the lives of families. It helps promote lifelong learning and provides invaluable support and assist-ance to our communities. That is something for which we can all be very proud.

AN IMMIGRANT STORY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. K
ENNEDY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a family that I have come to know. They came from a hum-ble place, scraping by. Amidst insta-bility in their native land, they could barely keep food on their table. For years, their government ignored their struggle and suffering. Like so many others, they dreamed of a better life in America. Finally, they managed to cobble to-gether enough money to make the dan-gerous journey to our shores. Yet, once here, they discovered that life wasn’t so easy. They were resented for their accents, their faith, and their foreign ways. Doors were slammed in their faces when they sought work. So they worked harder. They leaned on each other and those who came be-fore. They forged a community and they organized. They built churches, businesses, and schools. Slowly but surely, they began to enjoy some meas-ure of success and stability. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that there are Garcias or Asgaris or Rodriguezes that share that same story, but the one I tell is not theirs. This family’s name is Kennedy. Struggling immigrants whose quest for a better life took them from Ireland’s potato famine to Boston’s immigrant barrios. It is the ageless story of a young man looking for a better future, of a family in search of a safe place to settle down, of the sacrifice that any parent would make for the benefit of their children. And it has been re-peated millions of times in every cor-ner of our world in the over 150 years since my ancestors fled their home to find a new one. My father has a memory of my great- grandmother, Rose, that he shared with me once. He was playing outside with friends one day when she called him in. As he fidgeted around and im-patiently tried to sit still, she pulled out a big scrapbook and flipped to a stack of carefully folded newspapers in the back. One after another, she opened them up to the help wanted section. There, she pointed to ad after ad marked in big block letters: No Irish need apply. My great-grandmother’s message was clear: Don’t forget where you came from, don’t forget the blood and the sweat and the tears that generations before you have shed so that you would never feel the sting of prejudice. For my family and so many others, this became a deeply personal fight. In July of 1964, a young Attorney General named Robert Kennedy sat in front of the House Judiciary Committee. There, my grandfather urged Congress to act on immigration reform. Our system, he said, ‘‘is a source of embarrassment to us around the world, it is a source of anguish to many of our own citizens, it is a source of loss to the economic and creative strength of our nation as a whole, it is inconsistent with our prin-ciples and out of step with our his-tory.’’ The opposition that he and other ad-vocates have faced half a century ago sounds eerily familiar to so many of us today: Immigrants will flood our cities and towns. They will take American jobs. They will poison American cul-ture. They aren’t from here. They aren’t like us. They are somebody else’s babies. Fifty years later, the opposition still hasn’t updated their talking points. Fifty years later, our broken immigra-tion system is still a source of embar-rassment, but worse, of anguish and of loss. Fifty years later, we face a threat unlike almost any we have seen in re-cent history: a President who has built an entire campaign—and now an ad-ministration—on the scapegoating of immigrant families. We have watched President Trump threaten our most fundamental Amer-ican values with border walls and bad

hombres. We have heard his racial epi-thets. We have seen cold-hearted exec-utive orders. We have stood in horror as his administration sweeps the coun-try with raids that appear unprece-dented in their utter disregard for fam-ily, community, and common decency. That is why I stand here today, on the eve of St. Patrick’s Day, the proud son of Irish immigrants and the hum-ble beneficiary of our country’s golden doors, to deliver a message to immi-grant families: President Trump does not speak for all of us, and his immi-gration policies are opposed by leaders in Washington who do not take your patriotism for granted. We are grateful for your contribution to our commu-nities, our culture, and our economy. We understand your willingness to walk to the ends of the Earth, to navi-gate oceans and mountains and deserts and war zones because every parent would do the same. We know what you have risked to give them a better fu-ture and what you have sacrificed to be a part of our United States. We stand by your side in the fight ahead. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President.

THE NEED FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. C
OSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the need for bipartisan and comprehensive immigration re-form. I am disappointed by President Trump’s actions on immigration dur-ing his first 2 months in office. I do not say that lightly, because I want this President to succeed, as I want every President to succeed, because if they succeed, so does our country. But the President’s comments and actions to implement policies that don’t hold up American values has me feeling very uneasy. To say the least, his erratic statements made on domes-tic and foreign policy, that he has ei-ther taken back or corrected, dem-onstrates a lack of diplomatic experi-ence. For example, issuing an execu-tive order to build a wall on the U.S.- Mexican border is not a real solution to fixing our broken immigration system. It does little, if anything, to improve our national security, and it would only hurt trade relations with Mexico, which would have a very serious eco-nomic impact not only on American exporters, but especially California’s agriculture industry. Additionally, the Trump administra-tion’s directives to deport undocu-mented immigrants, regardless of how long they have lived here and the con-tributions they have made to our soci-ety, is a strong example of the Presi-dent’s implementing policy that not only is flawed from a human rights per-spective, but it is going to have a nega-tive impact on our economy as well. President Trump is forcing over 11 million individuals who have lived in the United States for decades deeper into the shadows of our communities. They are scared to go to work, scared to go to school, and scared to live their lives. California’s agriculture industry relies heavily on a workforce of indi-viduals who are undocumented and work every single day to accomplish the American Dream for themselves and their families. These individuals are not only contributing to the agri-culture industry, but they are also stu-dents, entrepreneurs, and businessowners. Furthermore, implementing an exec-utive order to ban travel to the United States is not the American way. As many people in my district are aware, President Trump’s first travel ban pro-hibited a 12-year-old girl, Eman, and her U.S. citizen father from coming home to the United States, and his order put them in harm’s way while they waited in Djibouti. b1030 Last month, a Federal appeals court ruled to block that executive order travel ban. Four weeks ago, father and daughter finally came back to Los Banos to rejoin their family. Our President and his team had to go back to the drawing board, as we know, to issue a new executive order. And just last night, his second executive order to ban travel was blocked. The Trump administration claims that the flawed executive orders are: One, a vital measure for protecting national security; Two, work to improve the vetting process; and Three, that the United States has a right to vet people who are entering the country and keep people out who are doing us harm. I agree that we need to work to-gether to protect national security. The Federal Government is obligated to keep our country safe and vet people who enter this country. And guess what? Thorough and rigorous vetting policies are already in place, and they have been going back to the Bush ad-ministration ever since 9/11. That is nothing new. My office receives case-work on a weekly basis regarding visas that are being extremely vetted and in-dividuals who are waiting for years to get the proper visa to come to this country. That is extreme vetting. I strongly encourage the President to work with us in Congress and imple-ment a policy that actually strength-ens our national security, upholds our national security, and upholds our American values that we all cherish. Working together on a bipartisan basis, we can fix our Nation’s broken immi-gration system. Working together, we can make important investments in our infrastructure, and we should. Working together, we can reform our tax system so it is simple and fair. Working together, we can negotiate a farm bill that provides benefits for all Americans. Working together, we can fix the Affordable Care Act. Clearly, in regards to the ACA, my Republican friends have decided to go at it alone. That is too bad. I stand ready to work with the Presi-dent on a bipartisan basis on all of the above, but the President must reach out. I sincerely want our President to do well because that is what is in the best interest of our country, as I want every American President to do well. But it will not happen. It will not hap-pen, my colleagues, my friends, unless we work together. f 
MASSIVE TAX BREAKS FOR THE WEALTHY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. D
EFAZIO) for 5 minutes. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, over the last 7 years, we have heard a lot from the Republicans about repeal and re-place. They voted some 67 times to re-peal the Affordable Care Act, which they call ObamaCare. We have seen their so-called replace-ment plan. Actually, it is a plan to gut the Affordable Care Act and stuff through massive tax breaks for the wealthy. What is new? That is the number one, two, and three priority of the current Republican majority here in the House of Representatives. They got an analysis Monday. It was a little discouraging, but not really. The Speaker touted the fact it would reduce the deficit by $377 billion. Sure, if you take away health care from 24 million people, you can save some money on that end, but you lose a lot on the other end with families going bankrupt. The most frequent cause of bankruptcy in America was an unin-sured healthcare emergency before the Affordable Care Act. Small rural hospitals will be closing their doors all across America if this bill goes through. And even the larger hospitals, having to give more unin-sured care to people in crisis, will be having to jack up prices, and, of course, that means higher premiums for everybody else. Back to the good old days of freedom to choose. In this case, their freedom to choose bank-ruptcy, or death, or who knows what else, under this plan. They have really painted a target on older Americans. They are going to allow the healthcare insurance indus-try—which, by the way, is exempt from antitrust law, so it is not competitive. They keep saying: Competition and choice. How do you have competition when an industry does, and is, allowed to collude to set prices to exclude cer-tain areas or people from coverage or certain diseases from coverage? They can do that all behind closed doors. It is legal for that industry. And they will not include a provision to take away their antitrust immunity as part of this bill. So they are going to allow insurance companies to charge anybody age 50 or

older five times the premium for a younger person. Now, let’s look at, say, a modest income of a 21-year-old of $27,000 a year. They will actually pay $250 less for a policy that will cover less. But that is okay, I guess, sort of, maybe. But for a 64-year-old earning the same amount of money—and there are 64-year-olds out there still working who can’t get Medicare yet and don’t have a big retirement fund—they are still working for modest wages of $27,000 a year, they will see their healthcare costs go from $1,700 a year to $14,600. So a 64-year-old American working person with an income of $27,000 would have a premium of $14,600. Now, how is that going to work? How is that going to work? More than half of their income would go to pay for a health insurance plan. They have put a target square on those millions of peo-ple, and that is absolutely outrageous. This bill is tax cuts very thinly dis-guised as the American Health Care Act. The cuts are pretty astounding. If you earn $700,000 a year, you will get a $37,000 tax cut. Now, those people are really hurting. Those people at $700,000 a year are worried about their health insurance. No, not so much. They prob-ably get it for free through their cor-porate connections, or whatever. And even if they did, with $772,000, they can afford the increase with a $37,000 tax break. But then how about the most privi-leged of the privileged of the privi-leged, those in the top 1 percent whose income averages $4 million a year? They get a tax cut of $207,000 a year under this bill. This bill is tax cuts dis-guised as an excuse for a replacement for the ACA. There are a few other tax cuts, again, really deserving and needy folks—the pharmaceutical industry, $25 billion, and the medical device industry, $20 billion. And health insurance compa-nies exempt from antitrust law can, once again, pay their CEOs $5 million or $10 million a year and take a full tax deduction, which under current law they can’t. So here it is, the goodie bag: Tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, tax cuts for the pharmaceutical industry, health insurance industry, medical de-vice manufacturers; and, for the rest of America, the booby prize, which is healthcare plans that cover less and cost a lot more. Oh, and then a couple of years out, 14 million people will be cut off of Med-icaid. These are really expensive tax cuts, and they have got to be paid for. The Republicans are fiscally responsible. They are going to pay for the tax cuts for people who earn $1 million a year, they are going to pay for the tax cuts for the pharmaceutical industry, but they have to screw a hell of a lot of people to do it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to refrain from using vulgarity. RECOGNIZING RESIGNATION OF MUSTAFA ALI The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. M
CEACHIN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. M
CEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mr. Mustafa Ali’s 24 years of service to the health and wellness of the American people. On March 7, Mr. Ali sent his resigna-tion to Administrator Scott Pruitt. He resigned from his post as the leader of the Environmental Protection Agen-cy’s Environmental Justice program. For more than 2 decades, Mr. Ali led our Nation’s leaders on environmental justice in their search for equalizing the playing field for vulnerable com-munities that have been victims of ac-tions that threaten their public health and the quality of their air, water, and land. In his letter, Mr. Ali said, in part: 
Communities of color, low-income commu-nities, and indigenous populations are still struggling to receive equal protections be-fore the law. These communities, both rural and urban, often live in areas with toxic levels of air pollution, crumbling or nonexistent water and sewer infrastructure, lead in their drink-ing water, brownfields from vacant former industrial and commercial sites, Superfund and other hazardous waste sites, as well as other sources of exposures to pollutants. Despite the many challenges we face re-garding the impacts of pollution and a changing climate, we have just as many ef-fective tools and programs, with long track records of assisting vulnerable communities in meeting their goals of improving public health and enhancing the environmental quality of their local communities. 
Mr. Ali’s resignation is a signal for me. In my eyes, a longtime soldier in the fight to level the playing field for all Americans to live in a clean envi-ronment left the Environmental Pro-tection Agency because it was no longer welcoming for individuals who want to work with facts. As we await the President’s fiscal year 2018 budget, we need to remember how impactful Environmental Justice programs are to our constituents’ health. Flint is one of the most salient examples of what can happen when en-vironmental justice watchdogs are not empowered to do their good work.

OBAMACARE FAILED TO MEET ITS GOALS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because ObamaCare, though well intentioned, has failed to meet its own goals and promises. There is a lot of passion on both sides of the aisle, I know. I just sat through 27 hours of debate in the Energy and Commerce Committee last week. It is clear that Republicans and Democrats have shared goals when it comes to health care. We want lower premiums, more choices, high-quality health care, the best in the world. But ObamaCare did not get us there. And if we continue on the current path, health care in this country is only going to get worse. Premiums this last year alone have risen, on average, across this country by 25 percent. One out of three counties only has one plan available to them. Networks are collapsing. That is why we are working to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We are com-mitted to creating a better healthcare future for every person in America. No back-room deals, no ramming through bills no one has had time to read, and no surprises. Every step of the way, we want to hear from you, the American people. Visit readthebill.gop and give us your feedback. Health care should be an open, transparent process through reg-ular order, and that is exactly what we are doing with the American Health Care Act. f 
OPPOSING GOP REPEAL BILL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. S
EWELL ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-er, today, I rise to express my opposi-tion to the GOP healthcare bill. On Monday, we received from the CBO a report that the House repeal bill will increase the number of uninsured Americans by 24 million in 2026. Fifty- two million Americans will be unin-sured in 2026, which is more than ever before, and definitely more than the Affordable Care Act. The intentions here are clear. The bill’s drafters are choosing to ration care for the elderly and the working class to fund tax cuts for the Nation’s highest earners. Under the GOP bill, a 64-year-old, with an income of $26,000, will have to pay a net of $12,900 more each year for her coverage than she currently does. In addition to the disproportionate harm that this bill will do to seniors, it will also accelerate the insolvency of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years. Mr. Speaker, the GOP plan cuts $880 billion from projected Medicaid spend-ing over the next decade, while pro-viding almost $600 billion in tax cuts to the wealthy and to corporations. Sixty- four percent of the tax cuts would go to millionaires and billionaires, while an additional 20 percent would go to those making between $500,000 and $1 million. Mr. Speaker, less than 1 percent of my constituents make more than $200,000, so it would be irresponsible of me not to voice my concern for a bill that con-tradicts the interests of my constitu-ents so blatantly. When I first got a copy of the bill less than 2 days before we marked it up in the Ways and Means Committee, I was left wondering if the bill was written to address our Nation’s healthcare chal-lenges or just to relieve the wealthy few of their tax obligations. The drafters of this bill made the dis-appointing choice to favor value tested

and failed trickle-down economics over investing in a stronger, healthier America. Large numbers of unhealthy and uninsured Americans are not re-flective of the governing bodies that make good choices. The Republican health plan directly slashes funding for people with disabil-ities by $12 billion, cutting the pro-gram that helps people live in their communities and reach their full po-tential. b1045 I represent a historically underserved constituency in Alabama’s Seventh Congressional District. The median in-come in my district is less than $34,000. The majority of the health providers in my district have a patient population that is disproportionately dependent on Medicare and Medicaid and is unin-sured. These healthcare providers can-not withstand caps to Medicaid or in-creases in their uninsured population. If this bill is implemented without sub-stantial changes, rural health care will be lost and rural lives will be at risk. In my district, I have met constitu-ents who have weekly made choices be-tween whether to buy medicine or to put food on the table. I have a pediatri-cian in my district in Birmingham who will stop what she is doing to track down patients newly infected with STDs so they do not transmit it. In States with so many high rates of STDs in this country, every attempt to curb the spread of disease is critical. The GOP bill guts the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which helps com-munity doctors provide preventative care and reduce the threat of public health crises. Mr. Speaker, over the past several weeks, my office has received over 600 emails from constituents about health care. Many shared positive stories about the Affordable Care Act. Others, particularly those from low-income areas, fall in that gap, that Medicaid gap; and the State of Alabama, like so many Republican-led States, did not choose to expand Medicaid. Unfortunately, the GOP health bill is not the answer. This bill will take Med-icaid away from America’s children, working parents, and seniors in nurs-ing homes. By 2026, nearly 30 percent of Americans aged 50 to 64 earning $30,000 will be uninsured. Surely, Mr. Speaker, this is not what this body intended. This bill is not only morally un-sound, but fiscally irresponsible, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ for the GOP repeal bill.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, my dis-trict is the proud home to Adirondack Park, an environmental treasure. We understand in the north country that protecting our environment plays an important role in promoting economic growth and opportunity. Along with 16 of my colleagues, I am proud to introduce a resolution calling on the House of Representatives to commit to working on economically viable solutions that address the threat of climate change. Clean energy innovation is critical, and this resolution brings together the priority of addressing the risks of cli-mate change with the importance of protecting and creating American jobs. This resolution calls on American inge-nuity, innovation, and exceptionalism, also citing that it is a conservative principle to protect, conserve, and be good stewards of our environment. No matter what side of the aisle you are on, we all have a significant re-sponsibility to protect our environ-ment from avoidable damage. I ask my colleagues to join in this commitment and support this important resolution.

minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced a resolution of inquiry requesting that the President and At-torney General provide the House with any evidence in their possession relat-ing to President Trump’s claims that President Obama illegally ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower, a task not welcomed but necessitated by the President’s seemingly baseless accusa-tions that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump Tower during the Presidential campaign. These accusa-tions should be taken literally and se-riously. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have seen absolutely no evidence that supports the President’s claims. President Trump and the De-partment of Justice have a responsi-bility to completely clarify the Presi-dent’s statement on Twitter. If the White House and Department of Justice are unable to produce this evidence, as I suspect will be the case, the President owes the American peo-ple a thorough and immediate expla-nation and apology.

LET’S TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the VA Account-ability First Act. This legislation pro-vides the VA’s Secretary with in-creased ability to remove, demote, or suspend any VA employee for poor per-formance or misconduct. Why it takes legislation to enforce common sense is beyond me. Just like in the business world, the VA and its employees must be held accountable for their actions. Three weeks ago, I hosted a veterans townhall in Swainsboro, Georgia. Many of the complaints and concerns shared with me were about wait times. One thing no one has enough of is time, es-pecially our veterans. For far too long, veterans have waited for care at their own expense. This is unacceptable. It is our responsibility to not only take care of, but provide the best pos-sible care to our servicemen and -women. Getting rid of bad and incom-petent actors is a great place to start. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It is truly the least we can do for those who have done so much for us.

WHAT WILL AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT MEAN? (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, the Amer-ican Health Care Act, known as TrumpCare, will cause 24 million more people to go without health insurance over the next decade. As an emergency physician, I know that everyone, even healthy young peo-ple, are vulnerable to car accidents or diseases that require critical care. Whether they have insurance or not, people get sick and get injured. I have never treated a patient who said they were uninsured because they preferred to be uninsured. They simply couldn’t afford it. So what does 24 million more unin-sured people mean? It means more pain, suffering, and shorter life spans for people who go without care. It means more ER visits and a longer wait to see a doctor in the emergency rooms for everyone. It means financial ruin for young families or those ready to retire. It means that hospitals and providers might lay off workers or even go out of business due to rising uncompensated care. It means they will charge more to make ends meet, which will raise pre-miums and out-of-pocket costs for ev-eryone. Everyone will have to pay more. I urge everyone to vote ‘‘no.’’ f 
HOUSE REPUBLICANS FULFILL PROMISE (Mr. WILSON of SOUTH CAROLINA asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, an editorial last week in the Post and Courier of Charleston cites ‘‘GOP health bill a start,’’ which pro-vided accurate insight into how the American Health Care Act is the first step in a three-step approach on how to put patients back in control of health care. The editorial states: ‘‘Any flaws not withstanding, it’s an important step forward for the GOP to put a fully fleshed-out healthcare bill on the table. . . . But there is certainly cause for optimism that a tweaked . . . healthcare bill can at least bandage and begin to cure some of the festering wounds left by ObamaCare. . . . ‘‘Republicans have a chance to make things right. They have a chance to help more Americans afford health care in a sustainable and responsible way. They have the chance to place more healthcare decisions in the hands of patients and doctors and fewer in the hands of government. ‘‘The bill introduced on Tuesday is a first step in the right direction. . . .’’ I appreciate the positive vision of Speaker P
AUL RYAN with President Donald Trump and his team of OMB Di-rector Mick Mulvaney and HHS Sec-retary Tom Price. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism to defeat Islamic extremist terrorists.

DEFEAT TRUMPCARE (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 24 million Americans will lose their health insurance. They will be-come uninsured. We call it TrumpCare, as it should be called. For 7 years, Republicans have said they have a better alternative to the Affordable Care Act. President Trump promised on the campaign trail that Republicans would put forward a plan that would have insurance for every-body which would be far less expensive and far better for the American people. We now know the Congressional Budget Office report says that 24 mil-lion people will lose their health insur-ance, including 7 million who will lose their insurance they currently have through their employers. Older Americans waiting to get on Medicare would be charged five times what they pay now. It reduces the Medicare trust fund, and it cuts 25 per-cent in Medicaid, a program that pro-vides care for children and senior citi-zens. Mr. Speaker, this plan is both heart-less and financially unsound. This re-peal bill does not lower premiums or out-of-pocket costs nor does it expand access to care, and it provides a huge tax cut poorly disguised as a healthcare bill. We need to defeat this bill. f 
THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF CRIMEA (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this week marks 3 years since Russia vio-lated Ukraine’s territorial integrity and illegally stole Crimea. In 2014, the people of Ukraine peace-fully decided to move closer to the Eu-ropean Union and away from the Rus-sian sphere of influence. However, the Napoleon of Siberia would have none of it. Russian troops invaded the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine. Little green men then invaded two more regions in east-ern Ukraine. The Russian invasions have cost 10,000 Ukrainian lives, but Russia has not stopped. Troops are pursuing a slow strategy to take more and more terri-tory in eastern Ukraine. Russia has invaded a sovereign coun-try and taken over its lands. Mr. Speaker, what country is next? The American people must stand with Ukraine and against the tyranny of the Russian bear. It is time to stand up to Putin. He must pay a price for his aggression. Sanctions against and iso-lation of the bear are good places to start. And that is just the way it is.

A CALL FOR HEARINGS TO DETER-MINE ROOT CAUSE OF WAVE OF HATE CRIMES (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2092 March 16, 2017 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-er, over the last few months, we have seen a surge of hate-driven violence, vandalism, and threats against numer-ous communities. As a member of the Oversight Committee, I am calling for hearings to determine the root cause of this wave of hate crimes and how we can combat it. While our government must show its commitment to answering these at-tacks, the American people already have. Desecrations of Jewish ceme-teries were met with waves of volun-teers assisting in their restoration. Mosque burnings were met with con-tributions from Americans of all faiths to help the rebuilding. And when two Indian men in Kansas were shot and one murdered, a Caucasian third man was wounded when he heroically sought to intervene. These actions speak to the resilience of our people, the highest principles of our Nation, and why we are proud to be Americans. America is, indeed, an ex-ceptional nation. I hope Chairman C
HAFFETZ will heed my call and hold hearings on this wave of hate-inspired attacks to help Amer-ica remain exceptional.

b1215 IMPROVING VETERANS’ ACCESS TO CARE (Mrs. ROBY asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House this week is taking action to bring much-needed ac-countability and improvement to the VA. Two and a half years ago, in the wake of the veterans waitlist scandal, Congress rightfully passed legislation giving the VA Secretary greater au-thority to fire senior managers respon-sible for those failures. I was glad to support the bill. In fact, the director of our own scandal-ridden central Ala-bama VA became the first fired under the new law. But, Mr. Speaker, we all know that law did not go far enough. Responsi-bility for failures at the VA doesn’t just lie with senior managers. We need to provide the VA Secretary increased authority to swiftly remove, demote, or suspend any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct. That is why I urge my colleagues to support the VA Accountability First Act. The problems at the VA may have left the front page for now, but the problems are still very present. The work of improving veterans’ access to care is far from over, and I will not stop until it is done. 
f 
WAR IS BEING DECLARED ON THE GREAT LAKES (Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because war is being declared on the Great Lakes. Those of us who live in the Great Lakes region recognize that the current times are anything but useful. The Great Lakes account for 21 per-cent of the world’s freshwater supply and are a major thoroughfare for trans-portation, commerce, trade, as well as recreation and tourism. Critical invest-ments over the last decade have helped clean up and protect these waters, and that work is now in danger. Much is preventable and it must be stopped. President Trump’s budget released today virtually eliminates funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which will cause significant harm to our communities, to jobs, and to our way of life. This jeopardizes our ability to fight back against invasive species that threaten the region’s biodiversity, including the Asian carp. It also im-pacts vital cleanup projects that en-sure our water is safe to drink. And there are those who want to store nu-clear waste in the Great Lakes as well. It is not a partisan issue; it is an Amer-ican issue. f 
RESUSCITATE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support resuscitating our healthcare system. ObamaCare is being crushed under its own weight and the American Health Care Act will deliver a better way for health care. One of the greatest fail-ures of ObamaCare is that it forces Americans into coverage that they do not want and that they cannot afford. Our plan, instead, is designed to em-power patients to access quality, af-fordable, and patient-centered health care. The American Health Care Act will put the free market back into health care, giving Americans the free-dom of choice. Instead of Washington controlling the decisions of patients, we will empower them to make their own choices. Americans deserve to have access to quality, affordable, and patient-cen-tered health care, and this is how we intend to make this a reality. Remem-ber, this is the first phase of this mis-sion to rescue our country’s health care, and I am committed to making sure that it is not the last. Phase two is underway with adminis-trative actions from our friend, Sec-retary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price. Leader M
CCARTHY has begun to lay out additional legislation that we could not include in reconcili-ation. We will waste no time on this and we will begin consideration next week. The battle does not end with the American Health Care Act, but it is a crucial first step to a better tomorrow. f 
CBO ANALYSIS ESPECIALLY BAD NEWS FOR WOMEN (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permis-sion to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today the House Budget Committee passed the Repub-lican healthcare plan. We all know by now that the recent CBO analysis has some very bad news for millions of Americans, but it has some especially bad news for women. The GOP plan makes Planned Parent-hood ineligible for any reimbursement from Medicaid or Medicare for one en-tire year. More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas. Even in my district in New York, women are lined up outside the building and down the block, often waiting for Planned Parenthood services. Yet, the CBO says that if the GOP plan becomes law, more than 15 percent of low-income women in our country will be without any access to health care—no cancer screenings and no tests and treatments for STDs. Women’s lives and well-being should have great-er value than this, but they just don’t seem to count in the cruel math of this merciless law. 
f 
PUT HEALTH CARE BACK IN THE HANDS OF AMERICANS (Mr. RICE of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, 4 percent of the people of South Carolina have individual policies under ObamaCare. I submit to you that if you have a health insurance policy that pays nothing, with a deductible so high that you can’t use it, regardless of the fact that statistics may say you are covered, you are not covered. Sadly, that is what many of my con-stituents back home in South Carolina are dealing with under ObamaCare. I have statement after statement from folks in South Carolina that are being horribly damaged by this law. They are faced with rising premiums, high deductibles, and limited choice. In my State, premiums went up near-ly 30 percent last year. At one time, South Carolina had five different pro-viders. Now there is only one, and they are threatening to pull out. What happens then? By now it is clear that this law is not helping South Carolinians the way it was intended. But what I also want to make clear is Republicans have a plan to fix it. Our plan does a blanket repeal of harmful ObamaCare taxes, like the individual and employer mandates. It preserves patient protections so people won’t be denied for preexisting condi-tions. It gives individuals and families

SKINNY BUDGET (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, this morn-ing, President Trump has released the first budget proposal of his administra-tion. In reading through the budget pro-posal, I am reminded of what President Trump said in the summer when he was speaking to the African-American com-munity in a rally in Philadelphia. He said: What do you have to lose? This is what we have to lose: elimi-nating the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Community De-velopment Block Grant program, whose sole purpose is to combat pov-erty nationwide. This is what we have to lose: cutting funding for Head Start and before- and after-school programs for our kids does not give them a chance to get ahead. This is what we have to lose: strip-ping funding for Medicaid in your new healthcare law that provides critical services for our most vulnerable. This is what we have to lose: all of those cuts do not give our seniors, our children, and our working families a chance to get ahead. Our communities have too much to lose, Mr. President. Our communities need the opportunity to make crucial investments that make our neighbor-hoods stronger block by block. 
f 
WE MUST IMPROVE FOOD ACCESS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, a healthy diet for many Americans may have nothing to do with commitment, but, rather, accessi-bility. Limited access to supermarkets and grocery stores with fresh nutritional food can be a challenge in both rural and urban communities. These are often called food deserts. This is a particular concern for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which intends to provide nutrition to millions of Ameri-cans. According to the USDA, to qualify as a low-access community, at least 500 people and/or at least 33 percent of the population must reside more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large gro-cery store. For rural areas, the dis-tance is more than 10 miles. It is difficult to eat healthy when the easiest store to get to primarily pro-vides packaged and processed food. SNAP recipients may find a local mar-ket convenient, but it often offers high-calorie foods with minimal nutri-tional value. These foods can often be a staple for families with limited re-sources. It is my hope that we can increase access to fresh food for communities throughout the country. Our families deserve no less. I look forward to working with the Agriculture Nutrition Subcommittee to continue to look at the SNAP pro-gram so that it serves those it is in-tended to serve. f 
JANUARY TRADE DEFICIT (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the Com-merce Department just announced that America’s trade deficit for January 2017 was $48.5 billion, the largest monthly deficit since March 2012. That translates into more lost jobs in our country. In the campaign, President Trump criticized our trade deals. He promised to do better for American workers. And now, nearly 2 months into his Presi-dency, what action has he taken to stop the erosion of this deficit and the jobs that go with them? It continues to get worse. What hope can he give to the hun-dreds and hundreds more steelworkers in Lorain, Ohio, who just received pink slips over the weekend due to the per-manent closure of another steel line, due to Chinese imports and predatory trade practice? It is going to put a lot of steel-workers back to work, President Trump said during the campaign and after as he revived the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines. But his talk turned out to be empty and a pipe dream because the pipes have already been purchased from foreign sources. Next month, China’s President, Xi Jinping, will visit President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. President Trump talked tough on China through-out the campaign, but what will he do to reform Chinese trade practices that are resulting in these increasing trade deficits? Mr. Speaker, I hope our President be-gins to keep the long list of campaign promises that he made to working peo-ple across this country, reverses these deficits, and starts increasing good jobs again. 
f 
LET’S FIX AMERICA’S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM (Mr. LOUDERMILK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, whatever possessed someone to think that a faceless, nameless bureaucrat in an ivory tower in Washington, D.C., who has never been to my district, who has never met with the people, think they know more about what is good for the family and the children of my peo-ple than they do? That was a question that was asked of me by a constituent this weekend. What makes you think you know bet-ter what is best for my family and my children than I do? He was referring to the Affordable Care Act. He went on to tell me that he used to have an insurance policy that cost $300 a month that he could use. Today, he is paying $1,600 a month for something he cannot use and he doesn’t want, but by the force of law, he is forced to have. He went on to say: Will you please, please do something now to fix this problem? Another person said: Are you going to be able to get to a reform to fix America’s health care that you like? My answer was no. We are not going to get to something I like, but that is not the issue here. Why? Because America is not ready for what I want. That is true Federalism, that this place has nothing to do with health care. We can’t get there right now because we don’t have the votes, but we can get to something we need. I call upon my brothers and sisters in the House: Let’s fix America’s healthcare system. We have the opportunity to do it now. f 
b1230 COMMEMORATING THE TRANSFER OF THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS FROM DENMARK TO THE UNITED STATES (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, later today, I intend to reintroduce a resolu-tion commemorating the transfer of the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States. In that resolu-tion, it discusses the 1733 slave revolt, the first slave revolt in the Western Hemisphere; the 1848 slave rebellion and emancipation, 17 years before the United States; and, of course, the 1917 transfer of ownership of the Virgin Is-lands from Denmark to the U.S. We also discussed great Virgin Is-landers, such as Alton Adams, Edward Blyden, Camille Pissarro, Judah Ben-jamin, and Roy Innis. What does the transfer mean, and what have been the gains and benefits to the people of the Virgin Islands be-cause of the purchase by the United States? The Americans were able to re-ceive a pristine, geopolitically stra-tegic location in the Caribbean with a people who are loyal to and proud of this country. What has been given to the Virgin Is-landers, a people willing and eager to take on the responsibilities of that citizenship but who, in fact, have moved from a system of serfdom, under Danish rule, to second-class, limited

STOP MILITARIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, for nearly three decades, State and local law enforcement agencies across America have been flooded with sur-plus military-grade weaponry through the Pentagon’s 1033 program. Late last year, law enforcement in North Dakota responded to protesters in Standing Rock in a well-docu-mented, militarized fashion, reminding us of the danger which the use of mili-tary equipment by domestic law en-forcement poses to the civil liberties of Americans. During the elections, President Trump ran on a promise to restore ‘‘law and order.’’ I am deeply concerned that the administration will follow up on that promise by making more mili-tary equipment available to State and local law enforcement agencies. This would further blur the line between the military and civilian police officers and violate a founding principle of our Nation. For this reason, I am, today, reintro-ducing the bipartisan Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act to rein in the Pentagon’s excess property manage-ment program and ensure that our communities are not just safe, but that the civil liberties of ordinary Ameri-cans continue to be protected.

IT IS CRUCIAL TO REPEAL AND REPLACE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. YOHO asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my concern about how crucial it is that we repeal and replace the poorly named Affordable Care Act. We are working towards a better healthcare plan and doing it in a better fashion than the other side did 8 years ago. We are actually going through regular order, allowing the committees of jurisdiction to do their work in pub-lic, and have the text for all to see and debate. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is failing and will collapse on its own. Many more will lose their insurance, and the healthcare system will get drastically worse if we simply leave it in place. The worst thing we can do is nothing. 4.7 million Americans were kicked off their healthcare plans by the ACA. I was one of them. Under the ACA, there has been a 25 percent average increase in premiums for the midlevel plans in 2017 for millions of Americans trapped in the healthcare.gov exchanges. Near-ly one-third of U.S. counties have only one insurer offering an exchange plan. ObamaCare is unsustainable. Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to do its job and replace the failed ObamaCare. We guarantee we will read this bill before we pass it. f

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-mous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the under-lying legislation. Our veterans have paid a high price. Dispatched to foreign lands to fight for our freedom, many returned injured, grief-stricken over lost friends, and torn apart by the violence of war. We owe them our time, our energy, our gratitude, and our protection. That is why we are here on the floor today: to protect the constitutional rights of our heroes and to make sure we are taking care of them like we promised we would. H.R. 1181, the Veterans 2nd Amend-ment Protection Act, ensures that gov-ernment cannot strip our heroes of their constitutional rights without due process. Under current law, if the VA determines that a veteran needs a guardian or fiduciary to help manage their benefits, then that veteran’s name must be sent to the NICS data-base, prohibiting them from purchasing a firearm. The decision to strip any constitu-tional right from anyone, most impor-tantly our veterans who have put their lives on the line to defend our Con-stitution, needs to be made with due process. The VA was never designed to adjudicate the removal of constitu-tional rights. This decision should be made by a judge or judicial authority. Instead of stripping veterans of con-stitutional rights, our VA should be fo-cused on protecting veterans. That is exactly what the other two bills under consideration do. H.R. 1259 gives the Department of Veterans Affairs greater ability to dis-cipline employees for misconduct or poor performance. We entrust our VA employees with the health and well-being of our vet-erans. Most of these employees do a great job, working hard to make sure our heroes are cared for; but, occasion-ally, a VA employee engages in mis-conduct, behavior that can endanger the very lives of our veterans. These men and women sacrificed to serve our Nation. The least we can do is enable them to receive the best care possible at the VA. That is why we need H.R. 1259, to allow the VA, under an expedited process, to fire or suspend or demote employees who are putting our veterans at risk. The legislation also allows the VA to recoup the money paid in bonuses or relocation grants to employees con-victed of a felony. Mr. Speaker, our veterans deserve the best. They deserve the best employ-ees. They deserve the best medical staff. That is what the third bill under consideration, H.R. 1367, will achieve. This legislation improves the VA’s ability to recruit the best medical staff, offering the agency direct hiring authority to fill key positions with critical staffing needs. It also creates a fellowship program to train up VA management for the best performance. It is time to improve the personnel practices at the Veterans Administration. Mr. Speaker, the resolution on the floor today is vital for our Nation’s veterans. Their constitutional rights and their well-being stand in the bal-ance. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman, my friend from Colorado, for yielding me the cus-tomary 30 minutes for debate, and I rise to debate the rule providing for consideration of the three bills related to the Department of Veterans Af-fairs—interestingly, all under one rule. We have been doing two bills under one rule. We are now headed to three. I rec-ommend we just put all of our bills under a rule and save us a lot of time. The first bill under today’s rule, to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the bi-partisanship reflected in this bill is certainly a rarity in this body and, frankly, could have easily come before us under the suspension of the rules. There are nearly 47,000 job vacancies for doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals throughout the Veterans Administration’s healthcare system. The VA is consistently rated as one of the worst Federal agencies in terms of pay and leadership, and since 2009, the number of VA employees resigning or retiring has risen every year. b1245 As of the new year, 547,000 patients were waiting more than 30 days for care at a VA hospital. It is clear that we must act to improve the VA on a holistic level, and this bill is a good start. This legislation establishes staffing, recruitment, and retention programs to enable the VA to build a stronger workforce. However, I am disappointed that the Rules Committee majority did not make in order an amendment that I of-fered to this measure, which would have allowed the Secretary of the VA to fill any existing vacant positions within the Veterans Administration, regardless of whether the position was vacated before or after the reckless hiring freeze imposed by Donald John Trump. I would also note that Representa-tives S
CHRADER and M OULTON offered an amendment that would fully lift the hiring freeze, but the Rules Committee blocked this amendment as well from receiving a vote on the House floor. I remain disheartened at the way the majority continues to operate the busi-ness of the House of Representatives. The bipartisanship this bill enjoys dissipates when we move to another bill wrapped in today’s three-rule measure, and that is H.R. 1181, the Vet-erans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. Before I launch into all of my remarks regarding this, I want to make it very clear that I and most Members of the House of Representatives will do every-thing we can to protect the Second Amendment rights of U.S. citizens and veterans especially. This legislation, however, if enacted, would immediately enable approxi-mately 174,000 veterans currently deemed mentally unfit by the VA to purchase firearms. At its core, this bill assumes that all veterans with mental illness should have unfettered access to guns, regardless of whether they will turn the weapon on themselves or their loved ones, and that any determination otherwise is simply wrong. The broadly reaching bill arbitrarily removes every veteran flagged by the National In-stant Criminal Background Check Sys-tem from its rolls, literally putting tens of thousands of lives at risk. Let’s look at the facts. Under proce-dures currently in place by the VA and the Department of Justice, an indi-vidual who lacks the mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs can be prevented from pur-chasing a gun. This term applies to veterans with severe mental illnesses who require a fiduciary to help manage their VA benefits. If the veteran thinks there was an error or that he or she was unfairly disqualified, the veteran can utilize the same due process and appeals procedures that are available for other VA decisions. Under the current process, which was codified in the 21st Century Cures Act just a few months ago, the veteran is allowed a hearing before the Board of Veterans Appeals and given several op-portunities for judicial review and ap-peal in Federal court. Mr. Speaker, this bill turns this sen-sible and humane approach on its head. It is time that we acknowledge where we are as a country. It is time that we deal with the fact that we are in the midst of a veterans’ suicide epidemic. Twenty veterans kill themselves every day. That is 7,300 of our finest and bravest persons in our society. Two- thirds of these suicides are carried out using firearms. A Department of Veterans Affairs re-port, provided to Congress in 2015, re-vealed that nearly 20,000 veterans diag-nosed with schizophrenia, 15,000 diag-nosed with post-traumatic stress dis-order, and thousands more diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer’s, and seri-ous depression were on the NICS rolls. Under this bill, these individuals and many more would be given immediate

access to guns, putting themselves and others in danger. Even as our Nation suffers shooting after shooting, Congress has not acted. Democrats held a sit-in in this very room in that well in this last Congress to protest the callousness of the House Republican leadership in preventing us from even considering legislation to protect our citizens with reference to guns. Rather than act to address gun violence, we instead considered legisla-tion like this, which will actually lead to more gun violence, Mr. Speaker. The logic and lack of compassion in such an approach absolutely escapes me. Our country has witnessed horrific shootings in the past few years. Dozens of children were murdered at Sandy Hook. Nearly 50 people were killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. One of our very own from this Congress was nearly assassinated while holding a townhall event in 2011. We continue to ignore the ramifications of shootings at Oak Creek, Aurora, Virginia Tech— I could go on and on—Charleston. The list just continues. 32,000 Americans lose their lives every year from gun vi-olence. We have grieved together. And I, along with several of my colleagues, have stopped standing down here in the well for a moment of silence and then going back to our regular business after hundreds of our people are killed throughout this society. We have de-manded change together, and we have been shocked by the paralysis that has gripped this institution when it comes to taking commonsense steps to end our country’s gun violence epidemic. Today, we see in this bill another measure coming out of Republican leadership that sprints toward the goal set by this country’s powerful gun lobby. Listen up, NRA, there are people like me that aspire to have a zero rat-ing by you every year. And it is not just the gun lobbyists, it is gun manu-facturers as well. It may be great for the gun manufacturers’ bottom line and the NRA’s bottom line, but it is terrible for those brave men and women who have served this country so fully, those brave men and women who suffer wounds that may not be visible to the naked eye, but are no less real and worthy of our attention. With each new tragedy that occurs, whether it be a mass shooting or the 20 servicemembers we lose every day to suicide, those who stand in the way of legislation to address our country’s gun violence epidemic are increasingly culpable for its continuation. I am dis-gusted with this morally bankrupt ob-fuscation, and I think the American people are, too. Let me lay down a marker. Of the 435, plus six Members of the House of Representatives and the 100 U.S. Sen-ators, I want to see the first person when this measure goes into effect, if it does, and 174,000 veterans are taken off of the NICS rolls and can access guns, the first one that dies—and I hope we track it—I want everybody to stand up and remember that we had a chance to stop it here. Don’t tell me, if 20 vet-erans are killing themselves every day and if 7,000-plus of them are killing themselves every year—and we won’t even mention domestic violence and the horror that comes from those guns—if we continue this effort, we will allow more deaths along those lines. Before concluding, Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words about the final bill encompassed in this rule, H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability First Act of 2017, and the Republicans’ continued assault on the working people of this country. At its core, this bill is an attack on workers’ rights, plain and simple, and will do more harm than good in our ef-forts to improve care at the Veterans Administration. This legislation would strip the collective bargaining rights of VA workers. It weakens an employee’s right to appeal. It weakens protections for VA workers who speak up against mismanagement and patient harm. Republicans claim they want to help fix our VA system, yet, with this bill, they do that by insulting, under-mining, and attacking the very em-ployees who serve and care for our vet-erans, including the over 120,000 vet-erans who work for the VA. Yesterday, one of our colleagues presented at the Rules Committee a statistic that I didn’t know. Of the 2 million Federal employees in this great Nation of ours, 640,000 of them are veterans. So when we get ready to pare back this govern-ment that somehow or another people have targeted for all sorts of cuts, if you read today’s budget proposal by Donald John Trump, you will see that lots of these veterans will be losing their jobs, in addition to all of the things that we have already discussed. We need to make improvements at the VA. Everybody knows that. That is clear. But singling out VA employees and their protections is counter-productive, to say the least, and only compounds manpower shortages plagu-ing the agency. This legislation will exacerbate re-cruitment problems and impair reten-tion at the agency. It threatens the agency’s ability to build a robust clin-ical workforce by threatening the qual-ity of care that the VA will be able to provide. I don’t know what the pique is by my Republican colleagues with reference to workers in this country. They talk a very good game about protecting work-ers and we are going to bring back jobs and we are going to do all of these things that are going to protect the middle class. I will get a chance to talk about this a little bit more, but I am very proud of the unions in this Nation. They are the unions that people like my father and countless of us who served in the House of Representatives worked in and helped build this Nation. They are the people that our veterans from the Second World War, the Korean conflict, and Vietnam who became union mem-bers and went on to do things for col-lective bargaining that made workers’ rights be better for people in America. And I don’t see tearing them down—let alone in the VA administration—is something that we need to do. Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle know exactly where their priorities lie with this bill, and it is certainly not with improving the quality of care of our veterans, but rather in exploiting yet another oppor-tunity to attack the rights of working men and women across our country. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. My friend from Florida and I were in committee yesterday and heard testi-mony from one of our colleagues that this bill, as it pertains to veterans’ gun rights, is not reactive. It does not go back to those individuals who have been denied their due process rights, who have been denied their Second Amendment rights. This bill is prospective only. It will only affect those who in the future have been denied those rights. And I think it is absolutely important that we understand the Republican Party in the House of Representatives is com-mitted to make sure that those indi-viduals who have been denied their due process rights, their Second Amend-ment rights in the past, we will find a solution. We will help those individ-uals. Right now, we are focused on making sure that others have the ability to a fair, open hearing where they can present their side of the story before they are denied their constitutional rights. My friend and colleague from Florida (Mr. H
ASTINGS ) also talks about the fact that H.R. 1259 will do more harm than good; that somehow disciplining those who are delivering poor services to our veterans is unfair to unions. The truth is that 35 percent of the VA’s workforce is made up of veterans. b1300 But the fact is that veteran employ-ees believe employees that are not meeting acceptable standards for their fellow veterans should be removed, pe-riod, regardless of their service while on Active Duty. Are opponents of removing poor-per-forming employees and those whose misconduct warrant removal saying that a veteran employee who cannot do the job or is guilty of misconduct be kept on the job? On the contrary, veterans know that the strictest accountability standards apply to them during their military service, and millions of hardworking Americans in the private sector do not enjoy anything close to the protections enjoyed by Federal employees. The only employees who need to be concerned with reasonable reform that would be made by this legislation are those who aren’t doing their jobs on be-half of the veterans who they serve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2097 March 16, 2017 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M
AST). Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying this. I was prompted to say this by the remarks from my col-league from Florida just now. I believe that there is absolutely nothing that is common sense about preventing those who defend America from having the opportunity to defend themselves. There is no common sense in that whatsoever. I listened to your emotional remarks here, and I listened as you gave zero specifics on the mental illness that my colleague specifically talked about being worried about. Specifically, what mental illnesses is it that had you concerned? I would encourage you to have the courage to be specific and say exactly what it is that you mean so that there is no confusion. Now, the true intent of my remarks today are to talk about my favorite part of going to the VA, and that is sit-ting next to my fellow veterans when I sit down at one of the clinics at my local VA hospital. Whether it is a ma-rine from Iraq, whether it is a sailor from World War II, a soldier from Viet-nam, an airman from Korea, whenever we sit down next to each other, there is a camaraderie that exists immediately. One of the first things that is said is usually some sort of off-topic joke about the branch that the other person comes from. It is that camaraderie of shared service that unites us in a way that half a century of age can’t divide. I can tell you, we have common experi-ences, and we have common healthcare challenges as well. It is important for veterans to come together and for the VA to establish and maintain expertise in providing for our unique healthcare needs. Unfortu-nately, too many VA facilities have lost their hunger to provide care. They have lost the passion to meet the indi-vidual needs of veterans, and it has be-come way too much of a rarity that a veteran’s needs are truly met when they enter the VA facility. You cobble that together with enough bad experiences from underper-forming employees, and it forces vet-erans to ask: Where else can I go for my care? That is why I am excited to see the House bring forward two bills this week that get at the crux of the mat-ter: authority to hire the best employ-ees and the ability to remove underper-forming employees. Today we will debate the VA Ac-countability First Act. We will provide the VA Secretary the flexibility to ei-ther remove, demote, or suspend an employee for misconduct. It can be very little that is more important to go on at the VA. Tomorrow we will debate H.R. 1367 that will bolster the Secretary’s situa-tional awareness to recruit and retain the very best employees. You know, when a veteran like my-self or my peers goes to the VA, we are not given a choice in our provider. We go there, and they look at a person like me and they say: Your last name is M
AST. We are going to assign you to Alpha clinic. This is your provider, and there is no choice. The veterans deserve nothing less than the kind of care and account-ability that these bills endeavor to pro-vide. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this rule and to bring each of these bills to the floor. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have great respect for my colleague whose district abuts a portion of my district in Florida. I want to make it very clear that it is important to listen to what a person says. My colleague just commented that I did not offer the specifics with reference to persons who suffered some form of mental illness; and he said that, in my passionate re-marks, I failed to provide those spe-cifics. Let me go back and read you my re-marks again. A Department of Vet-erans Affairs report provided to Con-gress in 2015 revealed that nearly 20,000 veterans diagnosed with schizophrenia, 15,000 diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and thousands more di-agnosed with dementia, Alzheimer’s, and serious depression. Is that specific enough for you, or do I need to add additional reasons? Evidently my colleague didn’t hear that. Mr. MAST. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HASTINGS. I yield to the gen-tleman from Florida. Mr. MAST. I appreciate that. When I get to speaking about the specifics of this matter—and you used a very broad, general term, like the term ‘‘post-traumatic stress disorder.’’ That is something that is, unfortunately, layered upon nearly every veteran that exits service today. So to go out there and have this ability to put people into this NICS, who have this sort of label placed upon them, that is exactly the crux of this that I am getting to that is not specific enough. It does not point to what is specifically an issue that anybody is facing. Mr. HASTINGS. Reclaiming my time, is schizophrenia one of those things that isn’t specific enough for you? Mr. MAST. If the gentleman would yield, that is certainly an issue that we can point to. But when you talk about post-traumatic stress and so many other issues that are diagnosed by the Department of Veterans Affairs—— Mr. HASTINGS. Reclaiming my time, that is what you should have said rather than say that I didn’t offer spe-cifics, and I just want to make that very clear to you. I don’t think that people with diag-nosis of schizophrenia, that have been allowed—that their fiduciaries have de-termined that their mental illness al-lows that they should not get a gun, I suggest to you and to anybody that those persons that have a gun—and I made the distinction. You evidently didn’t hear that part either. I made the distinction about the Second Amend-ment and how much I support it and I support veterans, and I support vet-erans’ rights to defend themselves. But I don’t support crazy people having guns, whether they are veterans or not, and it is just that simple. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers of both sides of the aisle are re-minded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. T
AKANO ), the vice chair of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yield-ing me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. In its current form, H.R. 1181 would endanger veterans in crisis and serve as another obstacle to addressing the crisis of veteran suicide. We had hoped to introduce amend-ments which would protect veterans’ rights while ensuring their safety. By bringing this bill to the floor under a closed rule, the majority has prevented us from doing so, from considering other possibilities to come together in a bipartisan fashion. There are changes that could be made to this legislation to ensure that it is good public policy. For instance, we could consider a streamlined ap-peals process that would allow veterans erroneously flagged by the background check system to have their status changed. I do acknowledge the concern of the gentleman from Florida that people with PTSD on this list may have been inappropriately flagged to be on this list, and we could have discussed a streamlined process. We could conduct a study of the VA’s existing practices for submitting records of veterans to the background check system. But rather than subject that whole list to being dismantled and freeing people that should not be free to have weapons—crazy people from having weapons—at the very least, we should understand the impact this change would have on veteran suicide, as Ms. E
STYsuggested when she tried to offer an amendment to the Rules Committee last night to require a study into the number of veterans who have com-mitted suicide by firearm, who should have been prevented from accessing a firearm under current policies. I do wish, Mr. Speaker, to dispute the gentleman from Colorado’s contention that this is only about going forward, that it affects going forward. I main-tain there is considerable concern that this will affect those that exist on the list currently.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2098 March 16, 2017 
These are sensible ideas that I of-fered, that we could have considered in-stead of being forced to vote on the leg-islation we have now. We could come together under unanimity to solve this issue. But under this rule, we are forced to vote only on legislation that would make veterans and their communities less safe. Accordingly, I call on my col-leagues to oppose this rule. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. My friend from Florida talked about the specificity that he used in describ-ing the conditions of these veterans, but that is not what the rule says. What the rule says, Mr. Speaker, is that if someone—if a veteran needs a fiduciary, they will be denied the abil-ity to own, possess, purchase a firearm. It doesn’t say if they are schizophrenic. It doesn’t say if they have PTSD. It doesn’t say if they have depression, and if they have PTSD or depression that is somehow linked to further violent be-havior. It doesn’t say that. What it says is, if you can’t balance your bank account, you can’t have a gun to protect yourself. There is no re-lationship between those two. Now, if the gentleman from Florida would go to the Veterans Administra-tion and talk to them about the need to link that finding of a fiduciary with future violent behavior, we may not be here today. But so many people have been trapped in this overbroad rule that we are going to make sure that those peo-ple that have a fiduciary and are listed by the VA have a due process right to show that they are nonviolent; that they don’t have a propensity to com-mit a crime with a weapon; that they are not a harm to themselves or to oth-ers. And if the VA or an independent judi-cial officer finds that they are, then yes, list them on the NICS report, but give them that due process right. That is where the majority believes this rule created during the Clinton administra-tion and by the Veterans Administra-tion falls. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M
AST). Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I take issue with a term that was thrown around far too loosely twice in just the last couple of minutes by my colleagues from the other side of the aisle here where each of them used the term ‘‘crazy.’’ They used the term ‘‘crazy’’ twice. I take serious issue with that. This is the reality: our servicemem-bers that endeavor onto the battlefield, they face snipers that are targeting them. They face mortars being dropped on their head. They face improvised ex-plosive devices like the ones that took my legs and so many of my friends. There are aviators that fly beyond the lines of our enemy. They face the threat of being shot down or captured. There are marines, there are sailors. And all of us—you know, the reality is we do come home with demons that are associated with a life that is sur-rounded by death. That is certainly the truth. But to say for one moment that that is something that allows the term ‘‘crazy’’ to be layered upon any one of these heroes that goes out there and serves in defense of this country, that goes out there and has the willingness to have their uniform stained with the blood of their friends, I find that to be a disgusting use of that word. I resent the fact that it has been done, Mr. Speaker, and I would respectfully ask that there be an apology made to those that put on the uniform and go out and defend this country on behalf of every single American. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my friend from Colorado to know that I have no additional speakers and I am prepared to close if he is prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, may I in-quire how much time I have remain-ing? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Colorado has 173⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Georgia (Mr. C
OLLINS ). b1315 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I appreciate my colleague from the Rules Committee yielding me time. I can’t be in any more agreement with my friend from Florida just now. We talked about this actually in the Rules Committee yesterday. If you look at the actual language in the rule, it gets down to the fact that you are adjudicated a mental defective. That is language that has to be stopped in this. I know my friend from the Rules Com-mittee, and we serve on Judiciary to-gether, we are going to actually look into this. Because if we really want to start talking about veterans and sui-cide, then we need to start addressing it head-on in real terms and in real ways with the issues that they face and not simply saying that we are going to take a right away. It is amazing to me that we are dis-cussing this issue. What about the other amendments? Well, we are just going to do the Second Amendment. In fact, what is happening right now among many, and for those who need to understand this, many of our VA colleagues who want to go to the Vet-erans Administration, have stopped going. If we want to actually worry about some of this stuff that they are worrying about with their mental health, then we need to take impedi-ments away from them getting help, to let them know that just because they have problems that they can’t process, getting help from the VA is something that should not be predicated on a fidu-ciary or somebody helping them. If they have got real issues, then fol-low the law. Follow the law. Adju-dicate this. Don’t give just simple carte blanche to say: We are going to take this away, and then, oh, by the way, go fix it yourself. I said yesterday in the Rules Com-mittee: I am still in the Air Force. I am an attorney and a chaplain. I served in Iraq. I have delivered these death notifications. I have counseled those who have called saying: I don’t find a reason to live, Chaplain. When we begin to throw around loosely these terms as we did yesterday in committee, when we send letters that say: if you vote for this, then you are actually making it free and easi-er—I think was the wording—to get guns to veterans. This is why this prob-lem breaks down. This is why we use veterans as pawns. If you are against this, vote ‘‘no,’’ but don’t use the cover of saying that you are helping people on suicide. Get to the issues. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. When we understand this, I understand the dis-cussions, and I understand the issues we have here, but not with this. Make your vote. But don’t cloak it. Don’t call it crazy people. Congressman M AST, that ain’t what they are. They are hurting. They need help. If this is an impediment to that, then vote ‘‘yes.’’ If you want to vote ‘‘no,’’ fine, vote ‘‘no.’’ But at least get the issue right. The issue is that the Veterans Affairs is saying: We are going to take your constitutional right away without ad-judication and make you do it on your own because we have an opinion about this that we think could happen be-cause you have got a fiduciary, you can’t do it on your own. When we understand what is really at the heart of this, I would encourage all to say: you know, the veterans, you just overstepped your bounds here. We are going to put this back where it needs to be, and then we are going to get on to the real issues of veterans who are needing help. I know my Florida appreciates that. We have talked about it before. These veterans need help. Our VA needs help. Our hospitals need help. The money and time that are spent to help these folks when they come back—they are not crazy, they are not defective. They are just people who have been through a tough time, and they need a little kindness, compassion, and help. They are not broken. I broke my leg. I stepped on a piece of glass, and I cut my achilles. That is what happened to me. But if my mind—everybody said: Your cast looks interesting. Nobody talks about it, though, if I came home to say: I am depressed. I have an issue. We start backing away. We have got to break that in our country. Mental health has got to be a priority—this— to be against this and claim what we are claiming here on the floor is wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2099 March 16, 2017 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my friend that sits on the Rules Committee, my colleague from Georgia, correctly speaks to this issue and its need to go to the Judici-ary Committee or other committees to ensure that veterans have the appro-priate adjudication. I don’t know where he or my col-league from Florida would place schiz-ophrenia. I am not a mental health ex-pert, but I have spent a good portion of my career here in Congress dealing with issues and trying to address issues of mental health, be it veterans or not. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-vious question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 696, Representative S
CHRADER ’s bill to exempt the Department of Vet-erans Affairs from Donald John Trump’s hiring freeze. As we have al-ready discussed, my amendment to allow the VA Secretary to fill vacant positions, regardless of whether they were vacated before or after the hiring freeze, was blocked last night in the Rules Committee. There are nearly 47,000 vacant posi-tions within the VA, and we should not be limiting the VA’s authority to fill these positions, especially as we con-tinue to work towards reducing patient wait times. On a bipartisan basis, Members of both the House and Senate have re-quested that the VA be exempt from the hiring freeze. Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation to ensure that the VA can recruit and hire quali-fied staff to meet the needs of our vet-erans. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to insert the text of my amend-ment in the R
ECORD , along with extra-neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, we are gathered here, once again, to debate the same old, tired, irresponsible, and morally bank-rupt policies championed by my friends across the aisle, policies that will, while we face a suicide epidemic among those servicemembers who have so bravely served this country, make it easier for them to take their own lives by increasing their access to guns. That may be good policy for the power-ful gun lobby and gun manufacturers, but it is horrendous policy for the American people. We have before us legislation that will gut workers’ rights for VA employ-ees while also making it easier to rep-rimand those who are brave enough to speak out against the ills they see oc-curring at the VA—ills that have and will continue to undermine the quality of service our veterans are able to re-ceive. All of this moral ineptitude is set against the backdrop of a healthcare plan recently put forth by Republicans that will raise the number of uninsured in this country to 24 million in under 10 years. This includes 14 million folks being unceremoniously kicked off of Medicaid and 7 million Americans kicked off of the health insurance plans they receive through their em-ployers. This is a plan that will increase pre-miums for individual policyholders by up to 29 percent. This is a plan that will increase, particularly for older Americans, out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. Mr. Speaker, in the final analysis, this is no plan at all but rather a shameful and cynical massive give-away to the ultrawealthy at the ex-pense of the middle class that will re-sult in hardworking Americans paying far more for far, far less. Mr. Speaker, I have been in this in-stitution 25 years, and I have been on this Earth 80 years. I have seen an awful lot of trauma during that period of time. I served as a State court judge and had the responsibility of Baker Acting—it is called in Florida—people to mental institutions. I have estab-lished fiduciaries for people who were unable to take care of themselves. I worked actively when we had mental health hospitals to keep those mental health hospitals open. I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, so that you can say to the gentleman who asked that I apologize, that I apologize for nothing having to do with any re-marks that I made within the confines of what is allowed in this institution. The simple fact of the matter is I used the term ‘‘crazy,’’ and I had reference to schizophrenia. Now, it may very well be that these are not broken peo-ple, it is that they are brave people who came home with problems. But crazy is crazy, and I would say that until the day I die. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to draw your at-tention and the attention of my col-league from Florida to a letter dated January 26, 2017, from the chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, Rep-resentative R
OE, and the chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, U.S. Senate, Chairman I
SAKSON , to the President in which they asked for var-ious positions to be exempted from the President’s executive order concerning a hiring freeze. The next day, January 27, the Acting Secretary issued a memorandum under the authority of that Presidential memorandum, executive order, grant-ing the chairman’s request and exempt-ing various positions. I would exceed my time limitations, Mr. Speaker, if I were to read all of these. But let me assure you there are dozens and dozens of positions at the Veterans Administration that have been exempted from the President’s hiring freeze. They include social worker, science lab technician, prac-tical nurse, nursing assistant, dieti-cian, nutritionist, occupational thera-pist, on and on and on. And the need for the amendment that the gentleman presents is unnecessary. I would also like to talk very briefly about the gentleman’s argument that somehow those at the Veterans Admin-istration are being harmed, and we are attacking a union in some way rather than trying to deal with real situations and improving the quality of care at the VA. I want to give a few examples of VA employees and just the time that it took to remove people. A VA employee was a willing participant in an armed robbery several years ago, and after a lengthy legal and administrative battle where the employee was supported by the Public Employees Union, the em-ployee was reinstated in their previous position without any discipline. A VA nurse showed up to work in-toxicated and participated in a vet-eran’s surgery while under the influ-ence of alcohol. Although the employee eventually resigned, to date, no other employees were disciplined for allow-ing the employee to participate in the veteran’s surgery. In 2013, a vocational rehab specialist out of the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System crashed a govern-ment car, and a passenger ended up dying. He was later indicted for a DUI. The VA confirmed that the employee was not removed from payroll until January of this year—almost 4 years. In 2014, a VA employee at the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System took a veteran who was a recovering drug addict to a crack house where he purchased illegal drugs for the veteran, as well as purchased a prostitute for him, though the employee was still em-ployed at the VA well over a year later after the incident until they were fi-nally able to remove him. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to stand up now for our veterans. They have performed their duty, and it is time for us to perform for them. Our duty is to take care of them. A ‘‘yes’’ vote restores their Constitu-tional rights and improves their qual-ity of care. I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution, vote ‘‘yes’’ on the un-derlying bill. I thank Chairman R OE and Representative W
ENSTRUP for bringing these bills before us. The material previously referred to by Mr. H
ASTINGS is as follows:

S
EC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 696. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT I
TREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican major-ity’s agenda and allows those with alter-native views the opportunity to offer an al-ternative plan. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question.

VETERANS 2ND AMENDMENT PROTECTION ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 198, I call up the bill (H.R. 1181) to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the conditions under which certain per-sons may be treated as adjudicated mentally incompetent for certain pur-poses, and ask for its immediate con-sideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. S

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and insert extraneous material in the R
ECORD on H.R. 1181. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I recently joined the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs be-cause of its bipartisan history of work-ing together to improve care for our veterans. I stand ready to work with the committee—in particular, with Chairman ROE—and with every Mem-ber of this House to improve and work on the important issues that affect our veterans every day. However, I cannot support this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it. As this House knows all too well, there is a veterans suicide crisis in this country, a crisis that is enabled by the easy access to firearms. Just last week, the Secretary of Veterans’ Affairs, David Shulkin, told the House Com-mittee on Veterans’ Affairs that the issue of veteran suicide is one of his highest priorities, and it needs to be a priority of this House as well. Today, on this day that we have this debate, 20 brave men and women who have worn the uniform in service of this country will take their lives in suicide, and the vast majority of them will use a gun. As folks all over the country who have helped veterans know, the means matter. Research has shown that more than 85 percent of suicide attempts with a firearm are ultimately fatal compared with just 5 percent for all other means. That is why addressing the public health crisis in the veteran community demands a thoughtful and comprehensive approach: to ensure that veterans in crisis do not have easy access to guns and that they get the care that they need and deserve. And yet, today, this House is voting on legislation that completely ignores the crisis that many of our most vul-nerable veterans are facing. Unfortu-nately, this bill was rushed to the floor with no consideration in committee, collaboration, or even time for all of us to understand its full implications. The majority scheduled H.R. 1181 for a vote in committee last week with the bare minimum notice required, even having to move the start time of the markup to comply with the 48-hour notice re-quirement. During last week’s committee mark-up, I raised the concern shared by many who work closely on this issue that H.R. 1181 would end up being ap-plied retroactively. The result of this bill being applied retroactively would mean that, if it should pass, more than 170,000 veterans currently prohibited from owning a firearm would be able to

pass a background check and buy a gun. While the chairman expressed his sin-cere intent and desire that this legisla-tion not be applied retroactively, it is fair to say that reasonable people dis-agree on how this bill would be imple-mented. This honest disagreement, alone, illustrates exactly why this House should be taking its time on a bill that could have such a profound impact on our Nation’s veterans. The fact of the matter is that, should H.R. 1181 be signed into law, it would need to be read together with the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, which requires—requires—Federal agencies to update the records they have previously shared with NICS, meaning, should this bill pass, the VA would be required to remove the 170,000 records they have previously shared with NICS since none of those were ap-proved by a court, nor did they meet the new standard established by this bill. Now, with respect to the text of the bill itself, the Veterans 2nd Amend-ment Protection Act, contrary to its name, would create an end run around the firearms mental health prohibitor that we have attempted to refine and improve since Congress passed the Brady Act nearly 20 years ago and the bipartisan NICS Improvement Amend-ment Act of 2007. Put simply, this bill would make it easier, not harder, for those veterans in crisis to get access to a firearm by es-tablishing a new judicial requirement that is far higher than any other agen-cy’s or department’s implementation of the firearms mental health prohibitor, and, quite frankly, would be imprac-tical, if not impossible, for the VA to actually use. The VA is already strapped for resources, and it is unclear if it has the legal standing to initiate a legal proceeding such as that suggested in the bill. As Members of this House know very well, there has been a fierce debate in this country over the meaning and ex-tent of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. But the question before this House today is not whether an Amer-ican has a right to own a firearm. The Supreme Court has been very clear on this issue, and the controlling law has been settled. However, constitutional rights are not absolute. As the late Justice Scalia wrote in the controlling Supreme Court Heller decision on the Second Amendment, ‘‘the Second Amendment is not unlimited.’’ The question before this House is whether we are going to summarily overturn the VA’s efforts over the last 20 years to help prevent veteran suicide and protect veterans’ families by re-porting the names of veterans with se-rious mental health issues to the Na-tional Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS. Supporters of this legislation argue that the current process used by the VA to share mental health records with NICS is overinclusive and must be thrown out and replaced with a process that ensures veterans’ due process rights. I agree that the current process is overinclusive, and I agree that we must do more to ensure veterans have suffi-cient notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a meaningful opportunity to appeal any decision that may impact their constitutional rights; and I stand ready to work with my colleagues on the committee and in this House to more specifically tailor the application of the firearms background checks law as it applies to veterans, both prospec-tively and retroactively. b1430 But a wholesale elimination of the VA’s long-established practice to help keep firearms out of the hands of vet-erans who are at serious risk of harm-ing themselves or others is dangerous and misguided. To be clear, of the 170,000 veterans currently prohibited from owning a firearm, as of 2015, almost 20,000 of them were diagnosed with schizo-phrenia, over 11,000 with dementia, and over 5,000 with Alzheimer’s. For a vet-eran suffering with a significant men-tal health condition like one of these, access to a firearm is a serious matter. Moreover, just 3 months ago, this Congress passed bipartisan legislation that codified a process for how the VA can make a determination of the men-tal capacity of a veteran before that in-formation is sent to NICS. The 21st Century Cures Act, which passed this House 3 months ago by a vote of 392–26, required a veteran to be provided no-tice of a proposed financial competency determination and given an oppor-tunity to be heard, present evidence, and be represented at a hearing. H.R. 1181 seeks to undo this carefully crafted compromise before we even have a chance to study the impacts of the 21st Century Cures Act or the VA’s existing practices. Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD  a letter signed by 12 veterans, includ-ing retired Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus, whose leadership and support for our military and veterans community is unques-tioned and who believe that this bill could put mentally ill veterans in harm’s way by giving them easy access to firearms.

ELOSI , As dedicated service members and members of the Veterans Coalition for Com-mon Sense, we write to you today to express our grave concerns with legislation being considered by Congress, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. This proposal would put America’s veterans who need our support the most in harm’s way by providing them with easy access to firearms. Instead of passing this irresponsible and dangerous leg-islation, Congress should instead do more to guarantee that all veterans have access to world-class medical and counseling services. We urge you to oppose this bill. Our nation is facing a devastating epi-demic of veteran suicide. The bill you are de-bating comes at a time when an average of 20 veterans commit suicide each day, two- thirds of whom do so by using a firearm. We know that non-deployed veterans are at a 61 percent higher risk of suicide compared to the American civilian population, and de-ployed veterans are at a 41 percent higher risk. Firearms are the most lethal means when it comes to suicide, resulting in death nine out of ten times. When vulnerable vet-erans have access to firearms, they can do harm not only to themselves but also to fam-ily members and loved ones. The impact of these tragedies is felt in communities across our nation. Last week, we were pleased to hear Sec-retary of Veterans Affairs (VA) David Shulkin announce his intent to provide ur-gent mental health care services to veterans with other-than-honorable discharges. This is a step in the right direction. Over 22,000 soldiers in the Army alone have received these bad paper discharges since 2009 due to mental health conditions, and they are among the ones who most need access to comprehensive mental health services. But they are not the only ones. In 2008, President Bush signed a law requiring all federal agencies to submit the names of indi-viduals who are legally prohibited from pos-sessing guns to the National Instant Crimi-nal Background Check System (NICS). Since then, the VA has submitted over 174,000 names of servicemen and women who require a fiduciary to manage their benefits and have been determined through clear and con-vincing evidence to meet the federal stand-ard for gun prohibition. Of these 174,000, 19,000 are individuals that suffer from schizo-phrenia and another 15,000 have severe PTSD. For these individuals, possession of a fire-arm could be fatal. The Veterans 2nd Amend-ment Protection Act would put at risk the safety of these veterans and our commu-nities by changing the standard for gun pro-hibition, so the VA’s determinations would no longer stop a veteran from obtaining a gun. Instead, the names of veterans already in the background check system would be erased, putting them at much greater risk of self-harm. This would be irresponsible, dan-gerous, and life threatening to those who need access to care, not weapons. Just last year, Congress worked to ensure that all veterans have appropriate due proc-ess protections in place through the 21st Century Cures Act. This codified existing practice and guaranteed that individuals who disagree with their final adjudication have the ability to appeal this determina-tion. We appreciate your service to your country in the United States Congress, and look for-ward to working with you to support and protect our men and women in uniform and their communities. In doing so, we urge you to oppose the Veterans 2nd Amendment Pro-tection Act. Thank you for your consider-ation. Sincerely, Admiral Thad Allen, USCG (Ret.); Gen-eral Peter W. Chiarelli, USA (Ret.); General Wesley Clark, USA (Ret.); Gen-eral Michael V. Hayden, USA (Ret.);

EVERYTOWN FOR GUNSAFETY , New York, NY, March 7, 2017. Re Reject H.R. 1181, which would put U.S. veterans in danger. Hon. P
HILROE, Chairman, House Committee on Veterans’ Af-fairs, Washington, DC. Hon. T
IMWALZ, Ranking Member, House Committee on Vet-erans’ Affairs, Washington, DC. D
EARCHAIRMAN ROE AND RANKING MEMBER  W
ALZ: I write to express Everytown for Gun Safety’s strong opposition to H.R. 1181. In the midst of a suicide epidemic among our veterans, this bill would discard hundreds of thousands of mental health records from the background check system and enable Vet-erans Affairs beneficiaries suffering from se-vere mental illness to buy firearms. The stakes could not be higher. Twenty U.S. veterans take their lives each day—a suicide rate more than 20 percent higher than among the civilian population. Two in three of those suicides are carried out with firearms. While suicide in the general popu-lation has decreased since the turn of the century, suicide among veterans has not. H.R. 1181 would repeal the law that blocks VA beneficiaries from possessing or pur-chasing firearms if they have been found mentally incompetent, after receiving due process and the right to a formal hearing. According to the VA, more than 170,000 pro-hibiting records for these beneficiaries are already in the background check system. Under this legislation, those records would no longer lead to a failed background check—and would be removed from the sys-tem entirely. H.R. 1181 would roll back the law that prohibits people with a VA incom-petency finding from purchasing firearms— even though many of these beneficiaries suf-fer from schizophrenia or severe long-term post traumatic stress disorder. The current process works, and it provides veterans with due process. To make an in-competency finding, VA officials must have clear and convincing evidence. The bene-ficiary has an opportunity to request a for-mal hearing and may appeal an adverse deci-sion to a federal judge. Indeed, the 21st Cen-tury Cures Act, passed in 2016 by the Repub-lican Congress and signed into law by Presi-dent Obama, provides new comfort at the statutory level that beneficiaries can present evidence from a mental health professional and be represented by counsel at incom-petency hearings. When it comes to suicide, means matter. When suicide is attempted with a firearm, the chances that a person will actually end his or her life are radically increased. Be-cause firearms are uniquely lethal, up to 90 percent of suicide attempts with guns result in death. In addition, suicide is often an im-pulsive act and 90 percent of people who at-tempt and fail to kill themselves do not end up dying from suicide. Preventing firearm access in these moments of crisis can be the difference between a long life and a tragedy. I urge you to protect our service members and veterans by rejecting H.R. 1181. Sincerely, JOHNFEINBLATT , President. 
NEWTOWN ACTION ALLIANCE , Newtown, CT, March 14, 2017. D
EARMEMBERS OF CONGRESS : We strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 1181—Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, a bill that would immediately remove 174,000 individ-uals deemed ‘‘mentally incompetent’’ by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Sec-retary from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). These in-dividuals who suffer from serious mental ill-nesses like dementia, schizophrenia, and se-vere post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be able to access firearms more easily. With veteran suicide rate increasing by 32.2% from 2001 to 2014, Congress should be closing the background check loopholes rather than weakening our background check system. Please thoroughly review the 2014 veteran suicide statistics from VA’s Fact Sheet on Suicide Prevention to understand why HB 1181 must be opposed to reduce the tragic epidemic of veteran suicides in our nation. https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsh eets/SuicidelPreventionlFactSheetlNew lVAlStatsl070616l1400.pdf ‘‘Veteran Suicide Statistics, 2014 In 2014, an average of 20 Veterans died from suicide each day. 6 of the 20 were users of VA services. In 2014, Veterans accounted for 18% of all deaths from suicide among U.S. adults, while Veterans constituted 8.5% of the US popu-lation. In 2010, Veterans accounted for 22% of all deaths from suicide and 9.7% of the popu-lation. Approximately 66% of all Veteran deaths from suicide were the result of firearm inju-ries. There is continued evidence of high burden of suicide among middle-aged and older adult Veterans. In 2014, approximately 65% of all Veterans who died from suicide were aged 50 years or older. After adjusting for differences in age and gender, risk for suicide was 21% higher among Veterans when compared to U.S. ci-vilian adults. (2014) After adjusting for differences in age, risk for suicide was 18% higher among male Vet-erans when compared to U.S. civilian adult males. (2014) After adjusting for differences in age, risk for suicide was 2.4 times higher among fe-male Veterans when compared to U.S. civil-ian adult females. (2014) Overview of data for the years between 2001–2014 In 2014, there were 41,425 suicides among U.S. adults. Among all U.S. adult deaths from suicide, 18% (7,403) were identified as Veterans of U.S. military service. In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. ci-vilian adults was 15.2 per 100,000. Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S. civilian adults has increased by 23.0%. In 2014, the rate of suicide among all Vet-erans was 35.3 per 100,000. Since 2001, the age- adjusted rate of suicide among U.S. Veterans has increased by 32.2%. In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. ci-vilian adult males was 26.2 per 100,000. Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S. civilian adult males has in-creased by 0.3%. In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. Vet-eran males was 37.0 per 100,000. Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S. Veteran males has increased by 30.5%. In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. ci-vilian adult females was 7.2 per 100,000. Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S. civilian adult females has in-creased by 39.7%. In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. Vet-eran females was 18.9 per 100,000. Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S. Veteran females has increased by 85.2%.’’ Gun suicides and homicides are prevent-able with common sense gun laws. Con-necticut passed the second strongest gun vio-lence prevention laws in America after the Sandy Hook tragedy, without infringing on the Second Amendment rights of gun own-ers. Regrettably, Congress failed to take ac-tion after the Sandy Hook massacre and over 400,000 Americans have been killed or injured by guns since the gunman with severe men-tal illness brutally gunned down 20 innocent children and six educators in five minutes. If it can happen in Sandy Hook then it can happen anywhere. We urge you to adequately represent the 90 percent of Americans who continue to sup-port expanded background checks to keep guns away from individuals who are a danger to themselves or others. We implore you to vote NO to H.R. 1181, fix NICS and pass an expanded background check bill to protect the military service members, our veterans, our families and our communities through-out the United States.

Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the current practice of informa-tion sharing between the VA and NICS is overinclusive and that alternatives should be explored that would more ap-propriately balance veterans’ Second Amendment rights with ensuring that veterans who pose a danger to them-selves or to others do not have access to firearms. This bill, however, was not consid-ered through regular order and no gen-uine attempt was made to work across the aisle or with the VA to craft a real solution that addresses the real crisis of veterans’ suicide in this country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2106 March 16, 2017 
I stand ready to work with the chair-man to address legitimate concerns re-garding the VA process. And in fact, just yesterday, I visited at length with VA Secretary Shulkin on how we can all work together to keep our veterans safe and get them the care and support they and their families need. I cannot support any bill, especially one addressing an issue as important as veterans’ suicide, through this rushed process. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 1181. Our veterans put their lives on the line for this country. We shouldn’t put their lives and their families at risk when they need us most. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. In America, the last time I looked, you are presumed innocent until prov-en guilty. What we have done with these veterans who have served this country, many of them injured in com-bat, is we have said you are guilty and you have to prove you are innocent to be able to own a firearm in your own home. By the way, Mr. Speaker, people who are in a fiduciary status actually sta-tistically have a slightly lower incar-ceration rate than veterans who are not. So to say that they are a danger to themselves or a danger to others is er-roneous. The other thing I would like to say is that the 21st Century Cures Act, Mr. Speaker, has codified basically the VA policy is what it did. It did not change the policy. What we are saying to vet-erans is that if you are an honorably discharged veteran who needs a fidu-ciary for whatever reason, you auto-matically lose a constitutionally guar-anteed right. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. B
OST), an active member of the Veterans Affairs’ Com-mittee. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Veterans 2nd Amend-ment Protection Act. It is unfortunate that under current practices, it doesn’t take a doctor or a judge to determine a veteran is unfit to own a firearm. Not a doctor, not a judge; it just takes the assignment of the fiduciary. Mr. Speaker, the women and men took an oath of office to protect and defend our Constitution—the same as we do in our offices to serve our vet-erans—and to stand in harm’s way. Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the oppo-site of what our legal system should allow. There is no due process. All of a sudden they go to the VA. They are seeking help with maybe other issues that are out there—because they can’t even have a judge or a doctor make that decision, if that is the case—but they do make a decision that they have to have a fiduciary to help them with certain things. It is vitally important that we main-tain the due process. This legislation still allows for dangerous individuals to be denied their firearms, but it leaves the determination to someone with the expertise to understand their case. This is a case where bureaucracy has run amok. We have got to stop it. That is what our job here is to do. Our Second Amendment rights are vitally important. Each amendment and those rights under our Constitu-tion are vitally important. And for those men and women who have served to protect those rights, shouldn’t we make sure that they are protected with due process. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1181. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume to re-spond to the assertion that there is no due process in this act and that the 21st Century Cures Act did not do any-thing to help veterans. The 21st Century Cures Act codified the following due process guaranteed to veterans through the VA. Individ-uals are notified by the VA that a fidu-ciary is recommended and are allowed 30 days to respond with a notification of acceptance or contest, and they are notified of the implications that this would have for being reported to NICS. The veteran then has 60 days to present evidence against the need for a fidu-ciary. And as required by law, the VA relief process allows impacted individ-uals to maintain their fiduciary, but regain gun eligibility removing their names from NICS. These are all al-ready processes in place. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), who is the vice ranking member of the Vet-erans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1181. The epidemic—actually, rather the tragedy—of veterans’ suicide has af-fected families across the country, in-cluding my own. I recall walking home after school at the age of 10 or 11 in the month of November—as you know, Vet-erans Day is in the month of Novem-ber—and hearing the news that my uncle, who lived across the street from us, had taken his own life with a fire-arm. He was a Vietnam veteran, and his memory serves as a personal re-minder about the tragedy of veterans’ suicide. To this day, it continues to plague our communities with our re-cent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of the 20 veterans who die from sui-cide every day, two-thirds of those occur by firearm. Part of stopping this crisis is keeping guns out of the hands of our most vulnerable veterans. Re-moving all individuals determined by the VA to be mentally incompetent from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System will make it easier for a veteran in crisis to ob-tain a firearm. To be clear, there are veterans cur-rently flagged in the background check system who should not be there, and we need to create a fair and streamlined process for veterans to appeal their status. But there is a balance between pro-tecting veterans’ Second Amendment rights and protecting veterans who are a danger to themselves or others. Im-mediately removing restrictions on every individual does not strike the right balance. Instead, it rolls back the bipartisan work we have done through the 21st Century Cures Act, and it en-dangers the lives of veterans who need our help the most. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1181, the Vet-erans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. Our veterans should not lose their right to bear arms and defend them-selves and their families simply be-cause they receive health care from the VA and have someone appointed to help them with their finances. Currently, when a veteran appoints a fiduciary to help them manage their VA benefits, the VA automatically adds the veteran’s name to a list that prevents them from purchasing a fire-arm. It makes no sense to take away a veteran’s constitutionally protected rights simply because someone else is managing their finances. Opponents of this bill argue that dan-gerous or suicidal veterans could have easy access to guns if this VA process is stopped. However, the program does not make any determination on vet-erans’ mental health or the dangers they pose to others. The VA system fo-cuses only on whether veterans receive assistance with their finances. The right to bear arms is too impor-tant to deprive veterans of due process without a judicial determination of whether the veteran poses a threat to themselves or others. Those who defend our Nation, whether or not they use a fiduciary to manage their benefits, are entitled to the right to defend them-selves. I urge my colleagues to support this good bill. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. B
ERA). Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the so-called Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. I agree with the chairman of the full committee that we don’t want to take away Second Amendment rights from our veterans. In fact, our veterans have the skills and understanding of how to handle firearms. I think about this as a doctor, though, who has served vet-erans and who has worked in the VA system. We have an epidemic on our hands right now. Every day, 20 veterans com-mit suicide. That is 20 too many. As someone who has sat in the exam room and listened to these veterans, if there is any evidence or risk of suicidal idea-tions, if there is any risk of that, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2107 March 16, 2017 
don’t want to take doctors out of this process, and that is what I am worried about here. My first job is to do no harm and to do good and help protect these veterans. Two out of three veterans who com-mit suicide do so with a firearm. We have got to prevent this. This is an epi-demic, and it is a national crisis, and we know gun suicides are preventible. When we see those risks, I want to make sure I, as a doctor, have the abil-ity to act and protect that veteran. We need to address this problem like the public health issue that it is. We need to continue to allow doctors to report the risks when they see them. It makes their patients safer, their communities safer, and it is the right thing to do. I would love to work with my col-league, a fellow doctor and the chair-man of the full committee, on making sure we protect our veterans. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. The text of this bill does not remove the names of anyone who is currently on the NICS list. It simply prohibits the VA Secretary from continuing to send the names of beneficiaries who utilize a fiduciary to the NICS list. And there is nothing in the bill that would require the VA Secretary to take any action with respect to those already on the list. Just one other thing, Mr. Speaker, to show you how the VA’s policy is not consistent: just as an example, a vet-eran who is rated at 100 percent dis-abled for PTSD is not automatically given a fiduciary, even though the symptoms required for that rating may include suicidal or homicidal ideation. So they are very inconsistent about how they do this. And of the 915,744 veterans who have a service-connected PTSD condition, only 1.7 percent of them have a fiduciary. Remember, they lose their constitutionally guaranteed right. I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. F
ARENTHOLD ), a hard-working member of this conference. b1445 Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, under current practice, if a veteran or beneficiary is appointed a fiduciary by the VA, they are automatically labeled as mentally defective and added to the FBI’s background check system which prohibits them from purchasing a fire-arm. This rule fails to identify which beneficiaries have a mental illness that make them a danger, instead insti-tuting a blanket ban on anyone who needs help managing their benefits, and it discourages veterans who need help from seeking help. The Veterans 2nd Amendment Pro-tection Act will prohibit the VA from considering a beneficiary just because they are assisted by a fiduciary as mentally defective without due proc-ess. Just because you have trouble managing your finances doesn’t mean you are dangerously mentally ill. This discourages veterans who may need help from seeking help. We owe it to our veterans and to all Americans to protect the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution and en-sure that they are not taken away without due process. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, may I in-quire how much time I have remain-ing? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tlewoman from Connecticut has 14 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Tennessee has 181⁄2minutes re-maining. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. T
HOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and thank her for her leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this piece of legislation. This bill un-dermines our commitment to our vet-erans, it weakens our background check system, and it puts guns in the hands of those who shouldn’t have them. I am a combat veteran and I am a gun owner. I strongly support the Sec-ond Amendment. With responsible gun ownership comes the recognition that not everyone is mentally capable to own a gun. Every day, 20 veterans take their own life, most of those with a firearm, so the VA acted to prevent violence and to comply with the law by keeping guns out of the hands of veterans who are in crisis. These are veterans with very serious diagnoses, including 20,000 veterans diagnosed with schizophrenia, over 11,000 with dementia, and more than 5,000 with Alzheimer’s. Passing this bill would remove their names from our background check system. This is absolute stupidity. The VA has done a good job to keep more than 174,000 veterans with serious mental health problems from getting a gun. They are working hard to save the lives of these veterans. This bill would make it easier for veterans to take their own life. I don’t want to see another veteran become a statistic. Passing this bill puts our veterans at risk. We owe them the best care and support. Sadly, this bill would leave them more vulnerable than ever. This is a dangerous overstep, and I urge every Member to seriously consider the impact this will have on our veterans, their families, and their communities. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, once again, let me state this for the record. The text of this bill does not re-move the names of anyone who is cur-rently on the NICS list, except it pro-hibits the VA Secretary from con-tinuing to send the names of the bene-ficiaries who utilize a fiduciary to the NICS list. I don’t want guns in the hands of anybody who should not own a gun who is mentally unstable, but what we are saying is that a VA rater should be a judge or a magistrate, where you can argue both sides of this in front of them. It shouldn’t be a VA bureaucrat that is doing this. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ), the chair-man of the Agriculture Committee. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, a bill that I have supported for the last several Congresses. The Second Amendment is a con-stitutional right for all of us, but it is especially sacred to the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our Constitution and our way of life. Unfortunately, under cur-rent law, many of our servicemembers who use a fiduciary to help them navi-gate the increasingly complicated De-partment of Veterans Affairs are auto-matically labeled as mentally defec-tive—which, in this politically correct era, is probably not the best way to phrase them—which places them in the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Back-ground Check System. This label wrongly denies these vet-erans their constitutional right to bear arms. The determination for a label of this magnitude should rest with the courts, as this bill ensures, not with a bureaucrat, as the current practice dic-tates. Mr. Speaker, as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle said, they have listed some almost 40,000 people who have a clinical issue who deserve to have a conversation of the 174,000 that are on the list. What about the other 130,000? As the other side has also admitted, it overreaches and is beyond what we should be doing. Their gratuitous offer to negotiate to fix that, they know, of course, that the current practice of just labeling folks by a bureaucrat would remain in place throughout that negotiation process if it were to ever actually occur. All too often, government bureauc-racies fail the very men and women who fought to protect this Nation; however, this bill is an easy fix to en-sure that veterans aren’t further hin-dered by Big Government bureauc-racies. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-zona (Mr. G
ALLEGO ). Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1181. As a combat veteran in the Iraq war, the issues we are debating this afternoon are deeply personal to me. Veteran suicide has reached crisis levels in this country, and our failure to do more to help veterans in des-perate need of mental health care is truly shameful. Unfortunately, Repub-licans have brought forward a bill today that will make this crisis even worse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2108 March 16, 2017 
Here is the plain truth. If we allow people with serious mental illnesses to purchase dangerous weapons, we are putting their lives and the lives of their loved ones at risk. Mr. Speaker, at a time when more veterans are taking their own lives, we should be debating how to get them greater resources and support, not easi-er access to firearms. At least 10—10— esteemed military leaders, including David Petraeus, Michael Hayden, and Stanley McChrystal all agree. Here is what they wrote in a heartfelt letter to Congress: ‘‘Our Nation is facing a devastating epidemic of veteran suicide. The bill you are debating comes at a time when an average of 20 veterans commit sui-cide each day, two-thirds of whom do so by buying a firearm. ‘‘We know that nondeployed veterans are at a 61 percent higher risk of sui-cide compared to the American civilian population, and deployed veterans are at a 41 percent higher risk’’ than the American civilian population. ‘‘When vulnerable veterans have ac-cess to firearms, they can do harm not only to themselves but also to their family members and loved ones. The impact of these tragedies is felt in communities across our Nation. ‘‘The VA has submitted over 174,000 names of servicemen and -women who require a fiduciary to manage their benefits and have been determined through clear and convincing evidence to meet the Federal standard for gun prohibition. ‘‘Of these 174,000, 19,000 are individ-uals that suffer from schizophrenia, and another 15,000 have severe PTSD. ‘‘For these individuals, possession of a firearm could be fatal.’’ They conclude by calling the bill be-fore us today ‘‘irresponsible, dan-gerous, and life threatening to those who need access to care, not weapons,’’ and I couldn’t agree more with that. The question for my Republican friends is a simple one: Do you know more about what is best for our vet-erans than General Hayden? Do you have a better understanding of what would improve their welfare than Gen-eral McChrystal? Do you appreciate their needs more acutely than General Petraeus? If the answer is no, then you should vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill later today. Mr. Speaker, if this legislation is signed into law, more veterans will take their own lives. That is the tragic reality we face. Please side with Gen-eral Petraeus and General McChrystal. Side with your conscience and your values. Side with our veterans. Please vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD  a letter from the Law Center to Pre-vent Gun Violence regarding a sum-mary of the effect of H.R. 1181. LAWCENTER TO  P
REVENT GUNVIOLENCE , March 10, 2017. M
EMORANDUM  To Interested Parties. From Americans for Responsible Solutions. Re Effect of H.R. 1181 (2017): Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. 
SUMMARY  H.R. 1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, would mandate that vet-erans determined to be mentally incom-petent or incapacitated by the Veterans Ad-ministration (VA) shall not be considered to have been ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defec-tive’’ for the purposes of federal firearms law without a finding by a judge or judicial au-thority that the veteran is a danger to self or others. The VA has reported records to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) regarding more than 170,000 beneficiaries who were adjudicated as mentally incompetent under a very different standard. The vast majority of those incom-petency adjudications have been made (1) without a finding of dangerousness and (2) without the involvement of a judge or judi-cial officer. In short, this bill would drastically change the standard under which veteran bene-ficiaries may be considered ‘‘adjudicated’’ for the purposes of federal firearms law, and it provides no express time limitation to en-sure that this new standard would not be ap-plied to VA adjudications that occurred be-fore enactment of this bill. As a result, there is significant concern about how this legisla-tion would affect veterans who have pre-viously been adjudicated as mentally incom-petent by the VA, and who are, as a result, currently considered subject to federal law’s firearm prohibition. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) states that once a federal de-partment or agency is aware that, when the basis under which a record was made avail-able to NICS does not apply, or no longer ap-plies, a federal agency must ‘‘update, cor-rect, modify, or remove the record from any database that the agency maintains and makes available to the Attorney General, in accordance with the rules pertaining to that database; and (ii) notify the Attorney Gen-eral that such basis no longer applies so that the National Instant Criminal Background Check System is kept up to date.’’ A strong argument could be made that, if H.R. 1181 were to become law, most beneficiaries who have been found to be mentally incompetent by the VA could no longer be considered sub-ject to federal law’s firearm prohibition. 
RELEVANT LANGUAGE  The relevant language of the bill states: ‘‘Notwithstanding any determination made by the Secretary under section 5501A of this title, in any case arising out of the adminis-tration by the Secretary of laws and benefits under this title, a person who is mentally in-capacitated, deemed mentally incompetent, or experiencing an extended loss of con-sciousness shall not be considered adju-dicated as a mental defective under sub-section (d)(4) or (g)(4) of section 922 of title 18 without the order or finding of a judge, mag-istrate, or other judicial authority of com-petent jurisdiction that such person is a dan-ger to himself or herself or others.’’ The key phrase is ‘‘in any case arising out of the administration by the Secretary of laws and benefits under this title.’’ This phrase determines the scope of the individ-uals that would be affected by this bill. It is not limited to cases that the Secretary ad-ministers subsequent to the enactment of the bill, but rather is unbounded in time. This language could therefore be interpreted to apply to any case arising out of the ad-ministration of these laws and benefits by the Secretary, regardless of when the case occurred. If the NICS Section of the FBI fol-lows this interpretation, it may remove records of these individuals from NICS. This would have far-reaching impact. Cur-rently, few if any mental incompetency de-terminations by the VA are made by a judge, magistrate, or judicial authority. These de-terminations are made my VA examiners who determine, in the course of processing veterans’ benefits claims, that as a result of as a result of marked subnormal intel-ligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease, a beneficiary ‘‘lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his or her own affairs’’ and requires a fidu-ciary to handle the disbursement of benefits. Because these beneficiaries require a fidu-ciary to handle disbursement of their pay-ments due to mental incompetence, they are considered to ‘‘lack[] the mental capacity to . . . manage [their] own affairs . . . as a re-sult of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease,’’ and are therefore prohibited from possessing a firearm under existing federal law. These incompetency determinations may be appealed to the VA’s administrative Board of Veterans Appeals, and then eventu-ally to federal court, but the federal judges reviewing the case would be reviewing the VA’s finding that the veteran is mentally in-competent, and would have no basis for de-termining whether or not the veteran was ‘‘a danger to himself or herself or others.’’ De-termining whether a person is a danger to self or others is generally outside the pur-view of the Veterans Benefits Administra-tion or cases arising out of the administra-tion of laws regarding veterans’ claims for benefits. If an incompetent beneficiary seeks relief specifically from the NICS firearm prohibi-tion, the VA must determine whether the beneficiary has proven by clear and con-vincing evidence that ‘‘he or she is not likely to act in a manner dangerous to self or oth-ers, and the granting of relief is not contrary to public safety and/or the public interest.’’ Essentially, the VA is tasked in these cases with assessing whether the beneficiary met a substantial burden of proving non-dan-gerousness. This does not involve a finding by a judge, magistrate, or judicial authority. Though veterans may then appeal an action by the VA denying NICS relief to a federal district court judge, that judge would be tasked with reviewing whether the evidence reasonably justified the VA’s determination that the veteran failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that he or she was not dangerous. It is not clear even in these rare cases that a judge upholding the VA’s deter-mination would have occasion to make an af-firmative finding that the person was a dan-ger to self or others. In short, this bill would drastically change the standard under which veteran bene-ficiaries may be considered ‘‘adjudicated’’ for the purposes of federal firearms law, and provides no express time limitation to en-sure that this new standard shall not be ap-plied to previous adjudications by the VA. It could therefore threaten to implicitly re-quire that NICS lose nearly every prohib-iting mental health record it has ever re-ceived from the VA. 
LIMITING AMENDMENT  In order to avoid the loss of these records in NICS, we suggest amending the phrase ‘‘in any case arising out of the administration . . .’’ to refer only to cases arising subse-quent to the enactment of this law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2109 March 16, 2017 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I guess by listening to the debate that is going on, one would assume that someone who has a fiduciary would be a danger to themselves and others, and I think that is completely erroneous to assume that. Let me read you excerpts of a floor statement that Senator B
URRmade in 2009 to show you how this can get off track. And we are going to put sort of a human face on this, just an excerpt from a letter that Jennifer wrote as the wife of Corey. ‘‘Corey served in Iraq. He was a para-medic. He was severely injured by an IED explosion in 2004, which caused se-vere burns, damage to his lungs, and severe traumatic brain injury after shrapnel entered his skull. Corey spent . . . 5 years recovering from his inju-ries. Jennifer reports that he is walk-ing, talking, and enjoying life at home with his two children. ‘‘Now it gets really sad. Because of his head injury, Corey still requires help with certain things. The VA said he needed help managing his disability compensation payments, and they named Jennifer, his spouse, as his fidu-ciary’’—his wife. ‘‘That is where I would like to read you her letter. Again, I quote from the letter: ‘‘‘On May 19, 2009, we had our annual fiduciary meeting with the VA field ex-aminer. At the end of the meeting, our field examiner said he needed to read a statement to us. He read the Brady Bill statement and then stated that Corey can’t own, possess, use, be around, et cetera, any firearms. He then went on to say that anyone in our household can’t own a gun while living in this household. ‘‘‘I asked him about Corey going on adaptive hunting trips and he said he couldn’t. Corey stated that he had a gun that was handed down from his grandfather and that Corey was going to hand it down to his son, and the field examiner told him that he couldn’t have it. He stated to Corey that if he did own a gun or be around a gun that he would be threatened with imprisonment. ‘‘‘The way that that field examiner talked to Corey about this issue was not appropriate. The field examiner said that I could challenge it and hand-ed me a blank sheet of paper with a VA heading. I asked the field examiner for the statement that he read to me, but he said that he had to ask his boss if he could actually provide a copy of that statement. After 2 weeks of me emailing him, I finally got the at-tached papers in the mail. I think the VA is taking this way out of concept, and I would greatly appreciate your support.’ ‘‘Well, in case any of my colleagues think the government would never prosecute someone like Corey for pos-session of a firearm, being around a firearm, I wish to read to my col-leagues excerpts from the VA directive that went out to all VA regional offices on September 29, 2009, on this very issue. ‘‘The directive is meant to inform fi-duciary field examiners of their obliga-tion if they were to witness a violation of the Brady Act. I am going to quote from this VA memorandum to the field examiners. ‘‘‘Field examiners or other VA em-ployees who encounter beneficiaries be-lieved to be in violation of the Brady Act are required to notify the fiduciary activity manager as soon as safely pos-sible. At no time should the employee place him/herself in danger. The fidu-ciary activity manager at the VA re-gional office of jurisdiction must im-mediately report the alleged violation to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,’’’ and here is the number. And that is straight out of their memorandum, Mr. Speaker. We don’t want weapons, no one in this room, and none of my colleagues on the VA Committee, Republican or Democrat, want weapons in the hands of someone that is considered dan-gerous. But we have American heroes that are being denied their Second Amendment right to even keep their grandfather’s gun. I feel that, if you want to go and have your due process rights in front of a court of law or mag-istrate, that is perfectly okay. That is the way our system works. But not a VA rater. They don’t get to do that. And I think, by passing this bill, we will guarantee those rights to our American heroes. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Mary-land (Mr. B
ROWN ). Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-er, I would like to thank my colleague from Connecticut for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-tion to H.R. 1181, which has very little, if anything, to do with protecting vet-erans’ Second Amendment rights as the bill’s title suggests. I am a 30-year veteran of the United States Army. I served in Iraq. I have led soldiers in both combat support and combat service support units in the ac-tive and reserve components. Our servicemen and -women face harsh realities in harsh environments— not just in wartime, but in peacetime as well. Military life, Mr. Speaker, is a hard life during war and in peace. It takes a toll on the body and the mind. The number of military members seek-ing mental and behavioral health serv-ices in the last 16 years, as well as the mental health-related incidences in-volving soldiers and veterans, substan-tiates my point. But our soldiers are resilient, and that is no less true when we take off the uniform. b1500 But for many of our veterans, it might take some extra help, some extra time, to recover from that harsh and sometimes traumatic military ex-perience. As a nation, we must support our vet-erans in recovering from that experi-ence not only by providing the benefits they deserve, but by protecting their right to enjoy the rights that they have defended. But, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1181 misses the mark. When a determination is made that a veteran is mentally in-competent or incapacitated, for what-ever reason, that determination is made to protect them, not to punish or deprive them. When that determina-tion is made, we owe it to our veterans not to put a weapon in their hand, but, rather, to put the full weight of a re-sponsive mental health system at their disposal. We entrusted our soldiers with a weapon while in uniform, so let’s treat our veterans with the same expecta-tions and standards of safety when they take off the uniform. If the unin-tended consequences of the current law, as the bill’s supporters claim, are too broad and disqualified too many of our veterans from responsible gun own-ership, then let’s work together to tackle that issue. However, this bill goes too far and would prohibit the VA Secretary from sharing important information with law enforcement on veterans who might be a danger to themselves or to others. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1181 misses the mark and ignores the responsibility to safeguard and take care of our veterans who have sac-rificed so much to protect our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  three documents, and they are the tes-timony of Brigadier General Xenakis, an op-ed from General Chiarelli, as well as testimony submitted by Jeffrey Swanson.

CENTER  Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Hearing June 24, 2015 H.R. 2001—Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act Thank you to the Committee for this op-portunity to submit testimony regarding H.R. 2001—Veterans 2nd Amendment Protec-tion Act. I am Dr. Stephen Xenakis, retired Brigadier General and Army Medical Corps Officer, with 28 years of active military serv-ice. I am certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in General Psy-chiatry and Child and Adolescent Psychi-atry, and have dedicated my professional ca-reer to providing medical and psychiatric care to our soldiers and veterans and sus-taining the readiness of our fighting force. First and foremost, I am dedicated to im-proving and protecting their health and wellbeing, and therefore urge the committee not to pass H.R. 2001—Veterans 2nd Amend-ment Protection Act (H.R. 2001) in its cur-rent form. Under the current process, if a veteran is determined to be incapable of managing his or her disbursement of funds from the Vet-erans Benefits Administration (VBA), the veteran is assigned a fiduciary, categorized as mentally incompetent, considered ‘‘adju-dicated mental defective,’’ and therefore pro-hibited from purchasing or possessing fire-arms. In its current form, H.R. 2001 would

change the process, stating those who are deemed mentally incompetent by the De-partment of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) would NOT be considered adjudicated mental defec-tive ‘‘without the order or finding of a judge, magistrate, or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction that such person is a danger to himself or herself or others. The result being, individuals who are currently prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms, because of a VBA fiduciary finding, would no longer be prohibited. Though I concur that there is room for im-provement in the VA interpretation of the mentally incompetent determination, H.R. 2001 is misguided in its approach. Yes, there may be individuals who have been swept into the ‘‘adjudicated mental defective’’ category because they need assistance managing their disbursement of VBA funds and for whom firearms access would not pose a risk to themselves or anyone else. However, there are also individuals in this category for whom access to a firearm would indeed be dangerous. Therefore restoring firearms in the sweeping manner to everyone declared mentally incompetent by the VA, as H.R. 2001 would do, would put our veterans, and citizens, in harm’s way. To discuss H.R. 2001 is to discuss this coun-try’s veteran suicide crisis, and to discuss suicide is to discuss access to firearms. The high suicide rate among the veteran popu-lation is devastating; a 2012 report from the VA reported an estimated 22 veterans per day commit suicide. Data shows recent vet-erans who were on active duty during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have a marked increased risk of suicide compared to the general population (41% higher suicide risk among deployed veterans; 61% higher risk among those non-deployed). Access to fire-arms is a significant part of the problem; a study of male veterans found that veterans were more likely than non-veterans to use firearms as a means to suicide. Research shows firearms are the most lethal means to suicide; an estimated 85% of suicide at-tempts using a firearm are fatal, compared to 2% by poisoning or overdose, or 1% by cut-ting. The evidence is strong and paints a grim picture—suicide is a serious public health problem. According to 2013 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death for all age groups. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for those age 25–34, ahead of heart disease, liver disease, or HIV. Over half of the 41,149 suicides in 2013 were by firearm. Our society can mitigate this problem however with smart policies and practices. We should take a page out of the military training manuals. The military trains us to think ‘‘safety first’’ and avoid unnecessary harm and injury. It is our standard practice among military psychiatrists to confront a potentially suicidal soldier and intervene ag-gressively to protect the soldier and the fam-ily. I routinely ask—‘‘do you have weapons, where are they, what can you and your fam-ily do now to keep you and them safe?’’ As such, it is absolutely crucial, that any vet-eran who has been deemed mentally incom-petent by the VBA go through an individual-ized process to restore his or her firearms rights, including an assessment for risk to self and others consistent with best medical practices, to ensure that the veteran would not constitute a danger to the self or others going forward. Such a process is not outlined in H.R. 2001 and, therefore, I urge the com-mittee not to pass the amendment in its cur-rent form. [From The Hill, Mar. 16, 2017] G
IVEOURVETERANS CONSIDERING SUICIDE  H
ELP, NOT A GUN (By Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, retired) As the Army’s vice chief of staff, I spent much of my time working on a crisis most Americans don’t even realize exists. A crisis that on average takes the lives of 20 Amer-ican veterans each day: the devastating epi-demic of veteran suicide. Our brave men and women in uniform risk their lives daily to make America safer. But for many, when they return home, the bat-tles they face are far from over. The stress of repeated deployments, failed relationships, financial challenges, depression and PTSD are among the reasons that every year roughly 7,000 veterans take their own life. Two-thirds of the time they do so by gun. Researchers who study suicides have found that the decision to end one’s life is often spontaneous, and that if accessible, guns are the most lethal and common way one com-mits suicide. For this reason, eliminating easy access to a gun during a mental health crisis can mean the difference between life and death. Knowing this, I am shocked that some in Congress are currently supporting a new piece of misguided and dangerous legislation that would make it easier for veterans who are at risk of facing a mental health crisis to get their hands on a gun. Congress should be working to save lives and to guarantee that all veterans have access to world-class med-ical care and counseling, not making it easi-er for those suffering from the hidden wounds of war to end their lives. We have to do better. And as someone who has spent years working to reform our men-tal health system and to reduce veteran sui-cides, I know we can. Shortly after the tragedy at Virginia Tech, Congress passed, and President Bush signed, bipartisan legislation requiring the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs to send the names of veterans who have clear and convincing evidence of mental incompetency to the Na-tional Instant Criminal Background Checks System. Any person listed within this sys-tem is ineligible to legally purchase firearms from a licensed dealer. The legislation that Congress is currently considering would reverse this law, and would immediately remove more than 174,000 mental health records from the background check system. The records that would be re-moved include veterans who are prohibited from obtaining guns because they are suf-fering from serious mental illnesses like de-mentia, schizophrenia, and long-term severe posttraumatic stress. We know that reducing veteran suicide is a complicated issue that requires comprehen-sive solutions. That said, providing veterans who struggle with mental illness increased access to a gun is not part of that solution. Congress should instead focus on more sup-portive gun-focused legislation like making it easier for family and friends to help their loved ones in crisis. Most states currently lack laws that enable family and friends to contact law enforcement and remove fire-arms from individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others. Gaps like these in our laws help explain why since 1968, more Amer-icans have died from guns in the United States than on battlefields of all the wars in our country’s history. Still, there are some who will mislabel these responsible policies as efforts to strip our veterans of their rights without due process. They could not be more wrong. In fact, there is already a law on the books that ensures any veteran on the prohibited pur-chaser list has a right to a hearing where they can present evidence regarding his or her mental capability. That’s important. The current system works. Last year, I joined former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, her husband, Navy com-bat veteran and retired NASA astronaut Capt. Mark Kelly, and a long list of the na-tion’s most prominent retired military offi-cials to launch the Veterans Coalition for Common Sense. It is a national initiative of distinguished veterans from all branches and ranks of the military who are committed to advancing commonsense solutions to gun vi-olence here at home. While respecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans, our focus is to help keep guns out of the wrong hands, and saves lives. Throughout the course of my nearly four decades of service to our nation, I saw first hand the incredible power of firearms and the dangers they pose when they end up in the hands of people who should not have them. Every day while deployed, our brave men and women in uniform risk their lives to pro-tect our freedom, and when they return, we should protect theirs. Congress has a duty to ensure these heroes’ safety and they can do so through rational and honorable grin safe-ty legislation. Our veterans in crisis need our help, not a gun. T
ESTIMONY SUBMITTED BY JEFFREY SWANSON , P
HD ANDRICHARD BONNIE , LLB Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Hearing, June 24, 2015, H.R. 2001—Veterans 2nd Amendment Pro-tection Act We thank the Committee for this oppor-tunity to submit testimony regarding H.R. 2001: Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 2001) addresses an important con-cern of fairness in a policy that is intended to protect veterans but may infringe their rights without sufficient due process. The policy in question is VA’s current practice of reporting to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) the names of veterans who are assigned a fi-duciary to assist the veteran in managing their benefit funds. What is controversial about this is that VA decides, in a rather opaque administrative procedure, who gets a ‘‘fiduciary’’—and thus, indirectly, who is put into NICS—without assessing whether a fi-nancially-challenged veteran is at risk of harm to self or others. This decision occurs without a hearing before either a judge or other objective, duly authorized administra-tive officer in which the facts of the matter could be presented and challenged. Over the past several years, VA has re-ported the names of about 100,000 ‘‘incom-petent beneficiaries’’ to the NICS—the data-base that licensed gun dealers query to de-termine whether people trying to buy a gun can legally do so. The proposed law, H.R. 2001, would remove these veterans’ names from NICS and would uncouple the loss of gun rights from routine assignment of VA fi-duciaries in the future. Would such changes be good or bad for veterans, or for the pub-lic? Our testimony offers some background information and research evidence to help legislators evaluate VA’s fiduciary/gun-re-striction policy and consider the possible ad-vantages and drawbacks of rescinding it. The Department of Veterans Affairs did not invent the idea of removing gun rights from people found incompetent to manage their money; the policy was apparently initi-ated to implement the 1968 federal Gun Con-trol Act, which banned the possession of fire-arms by certain categories of persons as-sumed to be dangerous, including anyone ‘‘adjudicated as a mental defective.’’ The ar-chaic phrase gives offense to modern ears

and lacks clinical meaning, but the Depart-ment of Justice (DOJ) has defined it specifi-cally to include anyone who ‘‘lacks the men-tal capacity to contract or manage his or her own affairs’’ as determined by some lawful authority. According to current VA proce-dure, military veterans fall under this broad gun-disqualifying definition whenever the VA finds them to be financially incompetent and in need of a third-party ‘‘fiduciary’’ to manage VA benefit funds. VA’s assignment of fiduciaries is made through an administrative process within the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and without the requirement of either a for-mal evaluation of decision-making capacity by a healthcare professional or a genuine op-portunity for a fair hearing for adjudicating the question of financial capacity as defined in the DOJ regulations. These strong due process objections to the VA’s policy are clearly the main concern underlying H.R. 2001. The argument is mainly about proce-dure, and we have serious doubts about whether VA’s current way of assigning fidu-ciaries actually meets the definition of ‘‘ad-judicated as a mental defective’’ under the Gun Control Act. But it is worth asking whether this procedurally flawed policy is also substantively flawed. Is there a public- safety rationale for attaching gun rights to the fiduciary standard? What do we know about the relationship between the ability to manage money and risk of harm to self or others? Is there even a connection? Recent research on post-deployment ad-justment of Iraq and Afghanistan war vet-erans has found a modest statistical correla-tion between a measure of financial decision- making capacity and self-reported suicidality and interpersonal violent behav-ior. In a nationally representative random sample of 1,388 separated veterans and re-servists from the era of our recent wars, par-ticipants were tested on basic money man-agement skills and also queried about vio-lence and suicidal behavior and thoughts. Veterans who scored poorly on financial management abilities were about twice as likely to report serious acts of violence, ar-rest, suicidal behavior, and use of illicit drugs, compared to those with good money management skills. These differences in rel-ative risk associated with financial inca-pacity were statistically significant, even though the majority of veterans with finan-cial incapacity were not violent or suicidal. Other research, on civilians with psychiatric disabilities who were found incompetent to manage their Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, founds that assignment of a family member as a ‘‘representative payee’’ was significantly associated with increased risk of violent acts by the incompetent bene-ficiary against family members. Does the fiduciary gun-restriction policy, as it stands, effectively prevent firearm-re-lated violence and suicide among veterans? The full answer to that question is unknown, but the population impact of the policy is in-herently limited by the very small propor-tion of at-risk individuals that it affects, considering the entire veteran population of approximately 22 million. There are un-doubtedly better and more efficient, effec-tive, comprehensive, and carefully-tailored ways to keep guns out of the hands of dan-gerous people than reporting a relatively small number of putatively financially in-competent veteran beneficiaries to the NICS. But what about the 100,000 veterans who are already in NICS because they were as-signed a fiduciary? What are the implica-tions, for them and their families, of auto-matically restoring their gun rights without any case-by-case review? Unfortunately, there is little information publically avail-able about the population of incompetent veterans who have already been reported to the NICS. However, we do know something about the distribution of psychiatric diag-noses of veterans in NICS, which are typi-cally the diagnoses for which the veterans are receiving VA benefits: approximately 20,000 of the group—1 in 5 of those in NICS— have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic illness, and about half of those have a ‘‘paranoid type’’ of schizophrenia, which is typified by delusions of persecution and threat from others. Do these mental health conditions signifi-cantly elevate the risk of violence and sui-cide and thereby justify legal restrictions on gun access? Sometimes, and it depends. Epi-demiological studies of people with schizo-phrenia in the general community have found that the large majority are not violent towards others, but that the subgroup with acute symptoms of excessive and irrational threat perception—such as believing that others are ‘‘out to get me’’—are significantly more likely to be violent towards others. Also in NICS are about 23,000 veterans di-agnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and about 15,000 (mostly older) veterans suf-fering from dementia with underlying causes ranging from Alzheimer’s disease to trau-matic brain injury research literature would suggest that both of these groups of vet-erans, too, carry some elevated risk of sui-cide or irresponsible behavior with firearms. Still, all of these diagnostic categories func-tion as nonspecific risk factors for gun vio-lence and suicide; there are many more peo-ple with these diagnoses who will not harm anyone than who will. That is because vio-lence and suicide are caused by many inter-acting factors—mental illness being only one—and people with mental illness may carry other risk and protective factors for dangerous behavior. It is just the magnitude of the thing being prevented—death by a gun—that might justify limiting the rights of so many people who would not turn out to be violent in any case. Civil rights advocates and gun violence prevention experts could each find fault with a policy that infringes the constitutional rights of so many while having only modest impact, at best, on gun violence and suicide. Hence, the criticism that animates H.R. 2001: that the VA’s fiduciary/gun policy, without due process, precludes access to firearms by people who have not been shown to pose any particular risk of harming anyone. To make matters seem even more unfair, those ‘‘in-competent beneficiaries’’ reported by VA to the NICS have been subjected to different treatment than similarly-situated civilian counterparts. For instance, incompetent Supplemental Security Income (SSI) bene-ficiaries with ‘‘representative payees’’ as-signed by the Social Security Administra-tion do not similarly lose gun rights. Fur-ther, when states report ‘‘incompetent’’ indi-viduals to NICS, it is because a state court has determined mental incompetency in a formal adjudicatory procedure—one that re-lies on expert clinical testimony and offers due process protections commensurate with the important rights at stake. In the end, what would H.R. 2001 accom-plish from the veteran’s point of view? Main-ly, it would mean that VA’s appointment of a fiduciary to manage one’s VA benefits would no longer be used, by itself, as a predi-cate for denying the veteran the right to purchase and possess a gun. This would re-form the VA’s arguably flawed policy going forward. However, the problem addressed by H.R. 2001 is more complicated in two ways. First, it is necessary for the VA to take ap-propriate steps to facilitate NICS reporting for veterans receiving mental health care in the VA system who are found by a lawful ju-dicial or administrative authority to pose a danger to themselves or others. For example, the VHA could decide to report to NICS all involuntary commitments to VA hospitals; this would fill a gap created by the current inconsistent NICS-reporting practices of state civil courts and public mental health authorities. Second, it is necessary to address the fate of the 100,000 veterans who are already in NICS. Some of these veterans are disquali-fied under other criteria because, for exam-ple, they have been involuntarily committed or convicted of a felony or domestic violence misdemeanor, with corresponding additional records in the NICS. However, should the gun rights of all of the remaining veterans in this group be automatically restored by retroactively invalidating the VA’s past ac-tions? From the limited available data, it seems likely that automatically restoring all of these individuals’ gun rights will pro-vide legal access to firearms for at least some veterans who do, in fact, pose a danger to themselves or others. Therefore, for vet-erans already in the NICS because of a fidu-ciary determination by the VA, perhaps some level of systematic review on the ques-tion of dangerousness, with due process over-seen by a federal court, might provide some needed protection and peace of mind—for the veterans themselves, as well as for their fam-ilies and communities. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I include in the R
ECORD two docu-ments from the VFW and The Amer-ican Legion supporting this legislation. 
VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS

AVID P. R OE, Chairman, House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. D
EARCHAIRMAN ROE: On behalf of the men and women of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) and our Auxil-iary, I am pleased to offer the VFW’s support for H.R. 1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. It is unconscionable to require veterans to choose between the care they have earned and deserve and their constitutional rights. Your legislation would ensure veterans who suffer from mental health conditions no longer have to worry about losing their 2nd amendment rights when seeking potentially lifesaving mental health care. By elevating the threshold for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, this important legislation would help destigmatize mental health and protect vet-erans’ constitutional rights. The VFW commends your leadership on this issue and your commitment to our na-tion’s veterans. We look forward to working with you to ensure the passage of this impor-tant legislation. Sincerely, C
ARLOS U. F UENTES , Director, VFW National Legislative Service.

EAR REPRESENTATIVE ROE: On behalf of our more than 2.2 million members, The American Legion expresses support for HR 1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protec-tion Act.

defective’’ without a magistrate or judicial authority ruling that the beneficiary is a public danger for the purpose of reporting their names to the National Instant Crimi-nal Background Check System (NICS), or any other database intended to identify per-sons who would be excluded from keeping, possessing, or purchasing firearms. Veterans are not required to give up their weapons for the purpose of receiving VA health care for mental health conditions. However, there are concerns that the threat of being placed on a list that might deny vet-erans their Second Amendment rights could act as a deterrent for those who might other-wise seek treatment for their mental health conditions. The American Legion’s concern is that stigmas associated with mental ill-nesses may force veterans to lose their Sec-ond Amendment rights. The American Legion reaffirms its rec-ognition that the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees each law-abiding American citizen the right to keep and bear arms and encourages our na-tion’s lawmakers to recognize the same. The men and women who have fought to protect the Constitution deserve to live under both its laws and rights. In conclusion, The American Legion ap-plauds your leadership in addressing issues that are important to America’s servicemembers, veterans and their families. Sincerely, C
HARLES E. S CHMIDT , National Commander. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I, too, served in the military as a mili-tary doctor in the 2nd United States Infantry Division in Southeast Asia many years ago, so I have seen patients who were mentally ill. One of the things that has bothered me is that we are perpetuating an outdated stereo-type that mentally ill people are prone to violence. Most are not, and perpet-uating this stereotype that they are may result in their being isolated or not seeking treatment. This is unfortu-nate for people who suffer from mental illness and need support and under-standing. I think we do them a great dis-service. My bill would require a court of law rather than a VA rating spe-cialist—that is all we are saying here— to determine whether an individual ac-tually poses a danger to themselves or others before their name gets sent to the FBI and added to the NICS list. A VA employee should not be able to add a veteran’s name to a NICS list before that veteran has been afforded due process. Let me explain how bad it really is. It is outrageous that a criminal has more rights than a veteran when it comes to being placed on the NICS list—at least they aren’t added to the list until they have been convicted by a judge or a jury, Mr. Speaker. We should at least treat our American he-roes that well. Here is another point I would like to make: a veteran that has been rated— listening to the debate to show you how the VA system is not a standard for everyone. A VA veteran rated 100 percent for PTSD does not automati-cally get a fiduciary because they are 100 percent service-connected disabled because of their service even though the symptoms require that, for that rating, it may include suicidal or homi-cidal ideation. All we are saying—and I think, hope-fully, everyone would agree—is that you deserve as an American citizen— and especially an American citizen, Mr. Speaker, who has served this coun-try whether in combat or not, who has served his country in the military— your day in court and at least be heard by a judge and jury. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, may I in-quire how much time I have remain-ing? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky). The gentle-woman has 6
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I note that the chair-man noted the support of some of the veteran service organizations, and I think it is noteworthy that the IAVA, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, has in the past supported this bill. They do not support it this year. They do not because they are so con-cerned about the crisis we are facing, particularly in their members—those who have come back from the wars in the last 10 or 20 years. They are con-cerned about that veteran suicide crisis that we are facing and are concerned that this bill might make that worse. We have heard repeatedly assertions that this would be the only category, that veterans alone would be deprived without adjudication. That is not true. In fact, the law for the firearms prohibitor covers many categories of people who do not have any legal deter-mination: 
Anyone who is an unlawful user or ad-dicted to a controlled substance is prohib-ited, does not require any adjudication. 
The NICS has 23,000 people who are prohibited under the controlled sub-stance addiction and use category. Anyone adjudicated as mentally defec-tive or committed to a mental institu-tion, there are 4.2 million people. There are a wide variety of people who are in that category, again, many without court orders. Those were aliens, those dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, that is 10,000 individ-uals. So it is not unique to veterans. There are other categories as well. But I really think the bottom line is this: we have heard a great deal of agreement that we care about our vet-erans, we want to prevent military sui-cides, and we know that for some of these veterans, it would be dangerous for them to have a firearm. That is pre-cisely why this committee should have had a hearing, so we would have had the opportunity to systematically ad-dress these issues and find a better way forward that recognizes that some vet-erans who need a fiduciary also should not have firearms, and some who need a fiduciary, there is no concern there. But we have been deprived of that op-portunity in committee, to do the work we should be doing in committee, to work together in a bipartisan way to fashion a better way forward. This is way too far. It is an over-reaction to a process that should be fixed, and we are committed to do that. But the alternative we are presented with today will wholesale uproot the 20-year process of the Veterans Admin-istration that would be dangerous and wrong, and we remain committed to working together in committee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Speaker? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman has 10 minutes remaining. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, this proposal is not new. It has been passed out of com-mittee in 2010, 2011, 2013, and this year. It passed the full House, H.R. 2349, in the 112th Congress, which is included in this proposal, by a voice vote. On February 2, the House approved H.J. Res. 40, which nullified the Social Security Administration rule that would have similarly restricted the Second Amendment rights to certain disabled people who require help man-aging their finances. There is no reason that veterans who have fiduciaries should be treated any differently than Social Security beneficiaries who need help managing their finances. Next, Mr. Speaker, veterans who need fiduciaries are not necessarily mentally ill. A veteran may not be able to handle his or her finances due to conditions such as traumatic brain in-jury. Furthermore, The American Le-gion testified in 2015 about a case in which the VA declared a veteran in-competent because he told his doctor he didn’t pay his bills. But, in reality, the veteran didn’t pay his bills be-cause, like a lot of us, of the division of household responsibilities. His wife paid the bills, and he got caught up in that. Then to get out of it is a chore. I wanted to say, once again, I really feel strongly about this because we worked on the 21st Century Cures bill on removing the stigma of mentally ill people that because someone is men-tally ill, they are a danger to them-selves or others. Perpetuating this stereotype, I think, is dangerous. I think it keeps people from coming in and seeking the help that they need. Also, and I have participated in this, Mr. Speaker, at home where we have used hunting trips or fishing trips to help veterans with PTSD get back on their feet and assume—instead of treat-ing it as a disability and saying: We are going to get you well and back on your feet and be a productive member of so-ciety. I am afraid if we stereotype this, we will prevent people from coming in for the very needed help that they so rich-ly have earned and need. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2113 March 16, 2017 
Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I note that 18 of the 26 Members of the House Veterans’ Af-fairs Committee did not serve during a time when there has been a hearing on this bill—18 of us, and that includes me. The evidence that the chairman was referencing from 2015 was from a hearing that never occurred, so there was never an opportunity to discuss that evidence. Again, I think this un-derscores the extent to which we really do need a hearing. I have to say, since 2012, when the Newtown shootings occurred in my dis-trict, the public feels differently about this now, and our veterans numbers have been going up and up. So I think it is high time for us to have a hearing. It has been 5 years. We should be look-ing at this process. The last point I will note: there has been much made of the Constitution today and how outrageous it is. In 20 years since this process has been in place in the VA, I note that no one has ever challenged this successfully in court as a violation of constitutional due process, and I know the love our veterans have for the Constitution, as we do in this Chamber. That tells me that many families, for example, actu-ally are relying on this. So, again, I pledge to the chairman we should be working together in com-mittee to get this process right. This is not the way to do it, not with this bill, not with the questions, and not with-out an opportunity for us to do the things I have referenced. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, as all of us in this in-credible place that we are in, the House of Representatives in the Capitol of the U.S., our hearts go out to everyone, es-pecially the families, of all those touched by that horrible tragedy that was just described. I am willing to work with anyone on the committee or otherwise in a reasonable way to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and people who are dangerous. There is no question we are all willing to do that. But that case did not involve a veteran who had a fiduciary. I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment even if others aren’t. I think we can all agree that veterans should not be denied the same due process rights that all other Americans receive. What this bill does is ensure that veterans do not lose their con-stitutional rights without a judicial hearing. The freedoms granted under the Con-stitution of this great country should apply to all Americans, especially those who have been willing to put their lives at risk to protect those same freedoms. It is wrong for veterans and beneficiaries who use a fiduciary to lose their Second Amendment right without due process. This commonsense bill would ensure that no veteran or beneficiary is de-clared mentally defective simply be-cause a VA rater appoints someone to assist with the management of that person’s financial affairs. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we have heard spirited and passionate remarks here today, but I think it underscores how much we would benefit, the veterans that we serve would benefit, their families, and this Chamber would benefit from our pursuing regular order with this very important topic. So, again, I urge in the strongest possible terms for my colleagues to vote against this bill, to give us the opportunity to get this process right, to safeguard our vet-erans, protect them from military sui-cide, and to preserve their rights in the best possible way. This hastily consid-ered, rushed-through legislation that leaves way too many questions and way too much risk for our veterans I must strongly oppose. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as all of us in this room are, I am personally devastated that our Nation loses 20 of our finest citi-zens to suicide every day. Ending this tragedy is one of the top priorities we have on the Veteran Affairs’ Com-mittee and as a nation. We have and will continue to work with the VA to develop programs that will effectively help identify and treat veterans who may be considering ending their own lives. But denying veterans who have fidu-ciaries their constitutional rights will not end veteran suicide. It is unfair to paint all veterans who may need a fidu-ciary with the same broad stroke and to assume that just because someone needs assistance with their financial affairs, that they may also be violent and a danger or they are contemplating suicide. That is just plain wrong. b1515 It is unfortunate that the arguments advanced by some of the opponents of this bill reinforce the false impression that people who suffer from mental health challenges—and veterans, in particular—are dangerous. There is no evidence that people who suffer from mental illness are more likely to be more violent than people in the general population—just none. I am convinced that perpetuating this outdated and in-correct stereotype makes the situation worse, deterring people from seeking the very health services that they need. It is difficult for some folks to admit they need help. I saw patients like that for years who finally broke down in my office and explained that they were de-pressed or whatever the situation may be. Imagine how much harder it is when people feel that they will be stig-matized or isolated because other peo-ple may fear them? By passing this bill, Congress will send a strong message that people who suffer from mental illness are owed the same respect and have the same con-stitutional rights as every other Amer-ican citizen. Once again, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of our Members to support H.R. 1181, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to H.R. 1181, the ‘‘so-called’’ Veterans 2nd Amendment Protec-tion Act. Mr. Speaker, twenty veterans a day trag-ically take their own lives. Just ONE veteran taking his or her own life is one too many. But twenty every day is an epidemic. It is unconscionable, and unacceptable. With two-thirds of veteran suicides being carried out with firearms, this bill practically pulls the trigger for veterans at risk. H.R. 1181 threatens the safety of our na-tion’s veterans and potentially others; by pro-viding those veterans suffering from mental ill-ness with greater ease in obtaining a firearm. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System is a critical tool in stopping those who want to do harm to themselves or others. If passed, this bill would dangerously alter the protocols for including a veteran in the database when he or she has been assigned a fiduciary. In addition, over one hundred-seventy thou-sand mentally ill veterans would be removed from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Instead of wasting time and energy on senseless budget cuts and harmful bills like H.R. 1181, this Congress should be focused on strengthening protocols so that no veteran struggling with mental illness ever falls through the cracks. Just two months ago, a veteran, Esteban Santiago, suffering from mental illness fell through the cracks and killed five people at my home airport in Fort Lauderdale. The current protocols failed him. We failed him and we should be doing all that we can to make the system strong for those suf-fering—not making the situation worse, as this bill does. This bill does a grave disservice to those men and women who have served us val-iantly. Moreover, it is opposed by military leaders including General Stanley McChrystal and General David Petraeus, who led our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is our obligation to ensure every veteran has the physical and mental health care they both deserve and need, We owe them better than this. Instead, this bill prioritizes putting firearms in the hands of mentally ill veterans who are already at serious risk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.

Pursu-ant to House Resolution 198 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 1259. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. R

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1259) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the removal or demotion of employees of the Department of Vet-erans Affairs based on performance or misconduct, and for other purposes, with Mr. R
OGERS of Kentucky in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. R
OE) and the gentleman from Min-nesota (Mr. W
ALZ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1259, the VA Account-ability First Act of 2017. Mr. Chair, you and many other Mem-bers of this body are well aware that providing true accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs has been a goal of mine and many of my colleagues for years. The House has re-mained committed to this goal and has already passed several iterations of the legislation before us today, yet the challenges remain, which is why we are here once again trying in this Congress to effect real change and reform. To bring real reform, we need to pro-vide Secretary Shulkin with the tools he needs to swiftly and effectively dis-cipline employees who don’t meet the standards our veterans deserve or who fail in their sacred mission to provide world-class health care and benefits to the men and women who have served. My bill would provide a singular ex-pedited procedure for all VA employees to respond and appeal to proposed re-movals, demotions, and suspensions for performance or misconduct or, in the case of title 38 employees, who are healthcare providers, for a question in-volving direct patient care or clinical competence. The prenotification and response process would be required to be com-pleted within 15 business days, and the employee would be entitled to an expe-dited appeal to the Merit Systems Pro-tection Board, where the first step at the administrative judge would be lim-ited to 45 days. Additionally, either party would be able to appeal the ad-ministrative judge’s decision to the full MSPB and would be provided the opportunity for limited judicial review. H.R. 1259 would also ensure that the disciplinary procedures and avenues to appeal set up by this bill are the only avenues in place for title 5 and hybrid title 38 employees to dispute proposed removals, demotions, and suspensions for longer than 14 days. Pure title 38 employees, mainly VA’s physicians and registered nurses, would retain their current internal process, but the timelines for disciplinary action and the appeals process would also be aligned to the timelines for all other VA employees as set up by this bill. This bill would also provide improved protections for whistleblowers; would allow the Secretary to reduce an em-ployee’s Federal pension if they are convicted of a felony that influenced their job at VA; would provide the Sec-retary with the authority to recoup a bonus provided to an employee who en-gaged in misconduct or poor perform-ance prior to receiving the bonus; and would allow the Secretary to recoup any relocation expenses that were au-thorized for a VA employee only through the employee’s ill-gotten means, such as waste, fraud, and mal-feasance. Lastly, it would also provide the Sec-retary with the direct hiring authority that he desperately needs and has been asking for so that we can hire medical center directors and VISN directors in a more expedited manner and fill lead-ership vacancies across VA. Mr. Chair, as I have said, I agree with all of my colleagues that the vast ma-jority of VA employees are hard-working public servants who are dedi-cated to providing quality health care and benefits for veterans. But it is be-yond comprehension that, with as much outright malfeasance that Con-gress, the American public, the media, and our courageous whistleblowers have uncovered at the VA, which has led to the increased scrutiny of the De-partment over the past few years, that we still see far too many instances of VA employees not living up to the standards America expects and not liv-ing up to the standards that our men and women who have served this coun-try deserve. Knowing many of the instances that have happened at the VA are a slap in the face to our veterans, it is unbeliev-able to me that anyone would oppose the bill before us here today. The committee has discovered an in-stance of an employee showing up drunk to work to scrub in for a surgery on a veteran; a VA employee taking a recovering addict to a crack house and buying him drugs and a prostitute; a VA employee participating in an armed robbery; and senior managers retali-ating against whistleblowers, at which point VA then has to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to the whistle-blower in restitution. Not only are all of these acts egre-gious and not only are all of these in-stances factual, they are just the tip of the iceberg; but what causes me to stand before you today is that, in none of these instances, did the VA hold these employees accountable in any reasonable timeframe, if at all. I blame many factors for this, but mainly I blame an antiquated civil service system and a grievance process set up by the union-negotiated collec-tive bargaining agreements that have left VA unwilling to jump through the many hoops to do what is right. Mr. Chair, it is well past time that we not allow the current system to continue, and it is certainly our duty to finally take action and enact mean-ingful changes at VA that put veterans and their families first and foremost. Everything else should come second. That includes the power of the public sector unions. Everyone in government knows that the civil service laws that were once meant to promote the efficiency of government are now obsolete and make it almost impossible to remove a poor- performing employee. Last year, VA’s then-Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson, under President Obama, sat before the Veterans Affairs’ Committee and ad-mitted it was too difficult to fire a sub-standard VA employee. The Government Accountability Of-fice studies the government’s ability to hold low-performing employees ac-countable and found that it took 6 months to a year, on average, and sometimes significantly longer, to fire poor-performing government employ-ees. I have heard the concerns that this bill will hurt the Department’s ability to recruit and retain good employees. I don’t buy this argument, as every VA employee I speak to tells me exactly the opposite. Good employees want to work in an environment where they know everyone can be held accountable for their actions. I believe the current status quo of al-lowing bad employees to continue at

their jobs while receiving a paycheck actually hurts the moral of other em-ployees who are doing the right thing 24 hours a day. This is the same for employees of the Department who are veterans. I know that some have said that this would hurt veterans who are employed at a VA, since they make up a large per-centage of VA employees, as it should be. As a veteran myself, and as my fel-low veterans here today would agree— we don’t sign up to serve, whether in uniform or civilian clothes, because we put our individual employee protec-tions ahead of the mission—the mis-sion always comes first, Mr. Chair; and at the VA, the mission is our veterans. Veterans want to work alongside col-leagues they know are working hard for their fellow men and women they served alongside. I also want to note that, from day one, I have worked with Secretary Shulkin and his team in the drafting of this bill that is before us today. He has endorsed this legislation not because he wants to punish employees or make it harder to recruit quality employees, but because he sees this type of change as desperately needed if he is going to truly reform the Department, as both sides of the aisle want. Secretary Shulkin is someone who garnered the trust and respect of two Presidents of two different parties to serve our veterans, and he was con-firmed by a vote in the Senate of 100– 0. Mr. Chair, I hope that my colleagues would understand that his support and assistance in crafting this bill before us today is because real accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs is a veteran issue, not a political issue. It is time that we align ourselves with our Nation’s veterans and the or-ganizations that represent them. Fif-teen veterans service organizations support the bill before us today: the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Iraq and Afghani-stan Veterans of America, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, Concerned Veterans for America, Student Vet-erans for America, Reserve Officers As-sociation, Fleet Reserve Association, Association of the United States Navy, the Enlisted Association of the Na-tional Guard of the United States, VetsFirst, AMVETS, the Military Offi-cers Association of America, and the United States Army Warrant Officers Association. These are 15 groups that represent millions of veterans and their families. While I am in no way trying to make this a political argument or say that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not care about veterans—they do—but when it comes to this par-ticular issue, accountability at the VA, I do not believe we can avoid the facts: The facts are, when we talk about ac-countability at VA during our VSO hearings with the Senate, Members get an ovation. The facts are that veterans, not just from the headquarters in D.C., but across this country, come up and thank Members for putting veterans’ rights before all else. The facts are the only groups that have staunchly come out and opposed the reform we are trying to make in this bill are the public sector unions. As I said, this should not be a polit-ical discussion and this should not be one side of the aisle trying to out-vet-eran the other side of the aisle. We don’t want to do that. But when you look at the facts, it is clear what our veterans and what the American public want us to do here in this Congress. b1530 We have a package that makes mean-ingful changes to VA’s civil service system while maintaining due process rights, as we should. Today we have the opportunity to make real and lasting changes to a broken system. Today we can decide to stand with our veterans or we can stand with the status quo and the unions that perpetuate the sta-tus quo, which I believe has failed them and the American public for far too long. I hope you all will join me and the 15 veteran organizations that support this legislation and do what is right for vet-erans and pass H.R. 1259. Let’s put ac-countability first so that trans-formative reforms can succeed. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I write concerning H.R. 1259, ‘‘VA Accountability First Act of 2017.’’ As you know, the Committee on Vet-erans’ Affairs received an original referral and the Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform a secondary referral when the bill was introduced on February 28, 2017. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this legislation before the House of Rep-resentatives in an expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will forego action on the bill. The Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing con-sideration of H.R. 1259 at this time we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject mat-ter contained in this or similar legislation. Further, I request your support for the ap-pointment of conferees from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during any House-Senate conference convened on this or related legislation. Finally, I would ask that a copy of our ex-change of letters on this matter be included in the bill report filed by the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, as well as in the Congres-sional Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. Sincerely, J

EARCHAIRMAN CHAFFETZ : In reference to your letter on March 10, 2017 I write to con-firm our mutual understanding regarding H.R. 1259, the ‘‘VA Accountability First Act of 2017.’’ I appreciate the House Committee on Over-sight and Government Reform’s waiver of consideration of provisions under its juris-diction and its subject matter as specified in your letter. I acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to expedite floor consider-ation of H.R. 1259, and does not in any way waive or diminish the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform’s juris-dictional interests over this legislation or similar legislation. Iwill support a request from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for appointment to any House-Senate conference on H.R. 1259. Fi-nally, I will also support your request to in-clude a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the Congressional Record dur-ing floor consideration. Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters. Sincerely, DAVID P. R OEM.D., Chairman. 
Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to H.R. 1259. Let me be clear that I rise in opposition not after serving this Nation in uni-form for 24 years; not after serving on this committee longer than anyone else on the committee; and not with serving honorably with my friend, the chairman, who—I want to be clear, first of all, where the commonality lies around this issue, about 95 percent of it, you are not going to find daylight between us. The idea that anyone would put a special interest ahead of the care of a veteran is not only distasteful, it is wrong to assume that. There are legiti-mate differences on how to get ac-countability in the VA, and we have come to some conclusions that get us pretty close. This piece of legislation— and I do not condemn the committee because this is truly a bipartisan com-mittee, but, for whatever reason, for the first time in the decade-plus that I have served on this committee, we have brought a bill to the floor without a hearing. We held a markup and brought it to the floor. The majority has the right to do as they please. What that deprives us of is the ability to build consensus around issues we know we share. I know the chairman’s heart is providing absolute best care to every single vet-eran. I also know the chairman’s heart is to make sure that every employee who is doing their job is respected the way they are supposed to be. There is not disagreement on that. This piece of legislation, and framing it as a false choice between veterans and the employees, the majority of whom are veterans, in many cases, serving other veterans, is a false choice. The chart that was put up, I be-long to half those organizations. There is also an organization that is on there that differs from the others because it is a 501(c)(4) with the sole purpose of political attack ads on Members of the opposing party. Leave them off the sheet. The other ones I agree with. The others are 501(c)(3)s advocating for vet-erans, but for us to pretend this isn’t a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2116 March 16, 2017 
proxy fight for outside groups on some-thing bigger is disingenuous and moves us away from the place we should have gotten. To show you the comity, my friend from Tennessee gave an impassioned, logical, and, in my opinion, correct as-sessment on the Veterans 2nd Amend-ment, H.R. 1181. I agree with the chair-man on this. I believe we could have built consensus by bringing that through the committee, but it doesn’t change the fact that I think the chair-man eloquently got to the heart of that. I know what the heart of that was because the majority side used the term over two dozen times, ‘‘due proc-ess.’’ It matters. These are veterans working in the VA who should have due process to their Second Amend-ment rights and to their employment rights. It ensures that the working en-vironment attracts and retains the best and brightest. So let’s go through a little bit of what is here. One of the things is, we talk about going back and breaking a sacred pledge. You can disagree what is in the collective bargaining that was done between the administrations, Re-publican and Democrat, and those em-ployees who work there, but to go in and arbitrarily change that from Con-gress, how is that due process? How about in the next bargaining agree-ment you make the case that those things need to be there. I will stand there with you and tell you this: The public sector unions need to give more, because you know what happens if they don’t? They get painted with those ex-amples. I hear some people say there are 350,000 employees in the VA, and they gave five examples of five bad people. You should give those examples. That is unacceptable, horrid, and should never be agreed to. This is a zero sum proposition. If one bad employee gives substandard care, Mr. Chairman, to one veteran, that is a failure, and the ma-jority and the minority are in absolute agreement on that. But here is what I fear. We have had legislation—and I will offer up an amendment to do this—that has bipar-tisan support, that has Senate support. We will see if I am right or wrong on this, but I am almost certain—and it is our responsibility in this House not to message things for those outside groups to run attack ads, it is to get things that actually get through. I am saying today—and I will be the first to come back and tell you I was wrong on this—the process of getting legislation into law to be enacted by the agencies means compromise must be there. I think we come back here in October, this isn’t done yet. Why don’t we give on the 5 percent that is not agreed upon and get the 95 percent right so we can act to enact it? This is going to be the perfect getting in the way of the good, and I would argue the zeal to get it done in the way of due process. I do not question the heart of any of my colleagues to get this right. I do not question—I hope it would not come back to me—the outrage I feel when I hear the story—and I know when the chairman tells me it, it is true—of someone showing up intoxicated trying to provide care to a veteran. How in goodness name is that person not done, not removed, and not moved forward? I will have to tell you this: I have been there on this. I am a public school-teacher. Do you know who hates a bad public schoolteacher the most? A good public schoolteacher. What really an-gers me is when management doesn’t do their dang job, follow the law and remove those people, and give the due process to them. The same thing happens in the VA. Management needs to do their job. We have issued subpoenas for Phoenix, we have issued subpoenas for Philadelphia, we have issued subpoenas for St. Paul of people doing egregious things, not caring for veterans. They should come here, and they should lose their jobs. In some cases, they did. Do you know what they all did have in common? None of them were part of a collective bargaining agreement. They were the management. My fear on this is you have bad managers making bad deci-sions, and if someone speaks up, Mr. Chairman, who is a lower ranking member, their only protection to im-prove the system is by collectively bar-gained grievance processes to make sure their due process is heard. That is all we are asking for. I do not deny there are going to be proxy fights on this. I will not deny that I believe the public sector unions need to be in a partnership with this. I believe we should have had them in a hearing and set those union members down there and asked them: How in God’s name can you justify this? Ask them and say: What would help so that we can do this? I have witnessed this as a public schoolteacher. Beating up on public schoolteachers all the time is not the best way to entice good people to go into public school teaching. I ask peo-ple, whether it be teachers or the vet-erans—go ask your veterans, how many have received quality care at the VA? How many really appreciate that floor nurse who did what he or she was sup-posed to do? How many are grateful that their cardiac surgeon is one of the best in the world and is choosing to make less money to serve there? But I won’t deny this. We have man-agers who are unaccountable. This piece of legislation does not get at the heart of it because the teeth are saved for the rank-and-file members. I agree. I think the gentleman is exactly right. I want to read something. You tell me if this is okay. We had a VA em-ployee who was written up and subse-quently fired because they were prac-ticing medicine without a license. That is outrageous. Outrageous that you would go there and you don’t have the license, and you are practicing medi-cine. That person was fired. If we pass this piece of legislation, they are done and they are not coming back. But there is a little bit different story to this. This was a Navy veteran in Arkansas, and you know what they got it for? Not picking up a scalpel and doing something that a doctor should do, not writing a prescription for an opioid and trying to steal medicine, which does happen. What they did was, they entered the wrong code on a chart, and that got them for practicing medicine without a license. When they went through the ap-proved negotiated grievance process, not only did they find out that this was wrong to this combat Navy veteran trying to serve other veterans who was discharged by a manager, it turns up the lack of management oversight. It was the entire system was flawed and the chart was wrong. So the grievance process not only returned the employee back to their rightful job, it fixed the system guaranteeing better care for veterans going forward. So I don’t disagree. When we try and make it, the big scary thing is, oh, we have unions that don’t care about vet-erans, don’t care about what the care is, and what we need to do is fire those people immediately. Well, you know what? Some of them do need to be fired. But if there is not a process in place—this Navy veteran caring for other veterans was released without due process—we don’t find out about a broken system putting veterans’ care at risk. That is what is at stake here. My point is not to disagree. The chairman has insights into veterans that I think are second to none. The committee works together on this. Once again, when you gain the most votes, you get the majority, and I re-spect that. But I would also say that if we want to build consensus around this, I am going to offer up a piece of legislation that was written by a Re-publican Senator that has the ability to pass, be signed into law, and will get at the heart of this by going after the managers. Mr. Chairman, it is important to me, and I know it is important to my chair-man, a Vietnam veteran himself, it is important to the staff sitting behind, veterans ourselves, that we not allow what has happened in this country to get into the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, to divide us over talking points when our goals are exactly the same. When we have legitimate differences, again, I don’t think it is fair to me, as a veteran and a union member, to put something up that says you are choos-ing sides. I am not choosing sides. We are all in this together. What I disagree with is it is my opinion—and I wish I would have had experts testify to this, employment law people, bring the union folks in there, have us have this debate so that we can say: you know what, these changes are good, these won’t make a difference. I respectfully oppose the way this legislation is written. I respectfully to-tally associate myself with the chair-man on why he wants to do it and why he believes that this is best. I only ask,

take a look at some of the improving amendments that can get us all to the same point, and give us the benefit of the doubt that we are not assuming the worst. And I don’t—as some have said, this is an attempt to bust unions or bust the civil service system. That is the farthest thing from the chairman’s mind. I know that because never, in my experience, has he done anything to disprove that veterans’ care comes first, quality of care at the VA comes first, and accountability must go with that. My concern is, this doesn’t get us there nor does it have a chance to be-come into law. With those things, let’s come back at it, let’s approach it a lit-tle differently, and let’s find the com-mon ground that is there. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. With that impassioned plea, I was asked yesterday on a Facebook page who I might, from the other side of the aisle, like to ride across the country with, and it was my friend T
IMWALZ who I would like to ride with. He very passionately represents veterans very well, and it has been an absolute pleas-ure to work on the committee with him for the last 8 years. Mr. Chair, just a couple things. The bill subjects all career employees to this new formal removal authority, and this would include frontline employees, middle management, even Senior Exec-utive Service employees. Just a couple more things. It provides a unified proc-ess, not a bunch of different ones, for employees to appeal major adverse ac-tions and other actions for title 38 when it pertains to a question involv-ing direct patient care or clinical com-petence. The current grievance procedures can allow an appeal to drag on for almost 350 days, and the House is the only leg-islative body that has passed a true ac-countability bill. I know, having spo-ken with Secretary Shulkin yesterday, he very much wants this piece of legis-lation in his toolbox to help reform the VA, which is desperately needed. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS ), our Conference chair. Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chair, I thank our chairman for his leadership on this important issue. The way that a grateful nation shows its appreciation to those who have served is to make sure that they get the care that they need when the time comes. Every day, veterans contact my office seeking help to address their concerns and help them navigate the VA. b1545 Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, the VA has one job. Its sole mission is to serve our veterans—our heroes. But it is clear that too often this agency has become disconnected from its mission. When a veteran con-tacts the VA, they should have the red carpet rolled out for them and treated like heroes. Instead, they feel like they are a burden. The VA Accountability First Act is one of many needed reforms. And it is common sense, if you are involved in misconduct, you should be demoted, suspended, or fired. You shouldn’t get a pay raise or a bonus. If you are a whis-tleblower, you should be protected. And the Secretary of the VA should have the flexibility to hold staff ac-countable. I thank the chairman and the com-mittee for their work to create a cul-ture of accountability at the VA. With his leadership and with our partners, I am confident that we will see some positive disruption that puts our vet-erans first. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Mary-land (Mr. HOYER ), my good friend, the distinguished minority whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in opposition to this bill, and I adopt many of the premises that my friend, Mr. W
ALZ, adopted. I also adopt the premise of Dr. R
OE, who is a really dear friend of mine, that T
IMWALZis the kind of guy you wouldn’t mind riding across the coun-try with. That is because he is honest, he is knowledgeable, and he is sincere. Frankly, I attribute all of those same characteristics to Dr. R
OE. But, Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposi-tion to this bill. Everybody on this floor agrees that our veterans deserve the best care possible. There is no de-bate about that. All of us in this House are focused on that goal. But this bill does nothing to meet that goal, in my view. This bill is part of—and I do not ascribe it to Dr. R
OE—a significantly long history of a partisan effort to scapegoat Federal civil servants that has been going on for decades, long be-fore Dr. R
OEgot in it or Mr. W ALZgot in it. It is a follow-on to the dangerous hir-ing freeze the Trump administration imposed in January and the repeated attempts over the last several years to extract more and more cuts from Fed-eral employees’ pay and benefits, which contributed over $150 billion in cuts in pay and benefits over the last 6 years. Stripping away the rights of VA em-ployees to work in a nonpartisan, pro-fessional environment will not improve the care our veterans and their fami-lies deserve and expect from the VA medical system. This bill, in my view, would under-mine the collective bargaining rights— I am a very strong supporter of collec-tive bargaining rights—of VA employ-ees serving as doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and others in critical jobs, and disrupt the collaborative relation-ship between VA managers and em-ployees that is essential to a successful workplace environment. Many years ago—almost 100 years ago—we adopted a civil service system. The premise of that system is we ought to have professional employees—not political employees, not political ap-pointees—not subject to change be-cause of the political whims that may be blowing one way or the other. This bill risks demoralizing those who have tirelessly been working to help our vet-erans reintegrate into civilian life in communities across this country. Let me make it clear—and I am sure Dr. ROEis not surprised when I say this—that I agree with Mr. W
ALZ. If there is an employee who is not per-forming well, that employee ought not to be kept on. But this bill removes the process that was negotiated, or could be negotiated, in a collective bar-gaining way. And if, by the way, it takes 300-plus days, then perhaps this legislation could deal with that to shorten it. There are ways this could be dealt with that, in my view, will not undermine the civil service protections that are important not only for the employees, but for the system itself. I have no doubt there are measures that can be adopted to improve VA per-formance and effectively and fairly dis-cipline employees who engage in mis-conduct. We ought not to tolerate that. But this bill does not include them. I have not read Senator I
SAKSON ’s bill, but perhaps that is closer, and I look forward to reviewing it with both the chairman and the ranking member. This bill goes too far, shreds basic due process rights, in my view, and punishes even model employees. And let me say as an aside, when I say it undermines basic due process rights, part of those rights are to have some time to get representation, to thought-fully respond, to have some discovery as to what is going on here, what is being alleged, why is it being alleged, and who is alleging it. This bill evis-cerates that, in some respects. I am proud to represent 62,000 Fed-eral employees in Maryland’s Fifth District, including many who work at the VA’s clinic in Charlotte Hall and in Camp Springs in the neighboring Fourth District. We ought to remem-ber, Mr. Chairman, that when we un-dermine our Federal workforce and our ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest, we undermine our gov-ernment’s ability to serve the Amer-ican people. So this is not just about present employees. It is about those who might consider employment in the future. Mr. Chairman, I hope we don’t make the mistake of, in effect, throwing the baby out with the bath water. Let’s not take away the rights and protections of those who serve us so ably. But, yes, I agree with Dr. R
OEand with Ranking Member W
ALZ. If there are those who are not serving us well, yes, there ought to be a process; it ought to be fair, it ought to provide time in which to respond, not intermi-nable time, so that we can have an agency of which we can be proud and does what we all want—serve our vet-erans in a way that we would expect,

demand, and that we are morally obli-gated to give. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, also during that live Facebook page, I mentioned another person I wouldn’t mind riding across the country with, and it was Mr. H
OYER , just to clarify the R
ECORD . Mr. Chairman, just a couple of clari-fication things. All we have done with this bill is—we haven’t removed due process rights— we have just shortened the time. And to show the concern that I had, I was afraid that if we used 14 or 15 calendar days—let’s say, President’s Day would be on a Monday, which would be a holi-day—that would take a day away. So I said let’s make this first part of this 15 business days. So that is 3 weeks. And then the accelerated review can go on 45 business days, which is 9 weeks. So this is 3 months of time, not a full year. But it simply compresses that time into a 3-month timeframe that this could last. So I think that people have their due process rights protected. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. B
ILI-
RAKIS ), my good friend, vice chair of our committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I have enjoyed working with my chair-man, and, of course, our ranking mem-ber, on behalf of our true American he-roes over the years, and we have got much more good work to do for our he-roes. Mr. Chairman, too often, the VA has failed to hold employees accountable when they do not uphold their duty to care for those who served. The vast majority, as has been said by our chairman, are hardworking and dedicated to our Nation’s heroes. But those bad actors are harmful to vet-erans and the VA’s reputation as a whole. They must be fired. If a VA em-ployee fails in their duty to care for veterans, they should be removed, as I said, from their post swiftly, no matter how senior their position. It is unacceptable that it can take a year, or even longer, to remove, de-mote, or suspend a VA employee. The VA Accountability First Act would re-move those bureaucratic roadblocks and rid the agency of its toxic culture of mediocrity. The bill would also safeguard whis-tleblowers—that is necessary—from re-taliation and protect employees’ due process rights. I am proud to cosponsor the VA Ac-countability First Act, and I strongly urge passage. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. T
AKANO ), my good friend, the vice ranking member of the full Committee on Veterans Affairs. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, Sergeant Major W
ALZ from the State of Minnesota, for yield-ing me time. I also would like to say to the chair-man, we had a wonderful time trav-eling to Afghanistan to pay respect to our troops during Thanksgiving. I don’t have to travel across the country with him, but I did travel halfway around the world with him. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1259. Every Member of Congress supports accountability for employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs—ev-erybody. Building a culture of excel-lence at the VA is critical to providing veterans the care and support they de-serve. However, H.R. 1259 does not further this goal, or improve outcomes at the VA. We are not going to be able to fire our way to better outcomes at the VA. The question posed by the VA Ac-countability First Act is whether ac-countability or workers’ rights are mu-tually exclusive. I, along with many of my colleagues, believe we can respect VA employees—a third of whom are veterans themselves—while also ensur-ing that poor-performing employees are held accountable. This legislation violates workers’ rights in two very specific ways: First, it would erode due process pro-tections by giving employees too little time—just 10 days—to prepare for a disciplinary hearing, and then just 7 days to file an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board. Second, it goes much further than past accountability bills by elimi-nating the use of collectively bar-gained grievance procedures for front-line VA employees. Not only do collec-tively bargained procedures often lead to quicker and simpler solutions, but they also give added protection to po-tential whistleblowers by acting as a check against managers who may re-taliate against an employee who raises an issue. Mr. Chairman, there is no question that we have workforce challenges at the VA, but this bill does not solve them. Instead, it eschews the Senate’s bipartisan accountability legislation in favor of a much more one-sided bill. To my colleagues who voted on VA accountability legislation in the past: This is not the same bill. It goes much further. And I ask you to join me in op-posing it. This is the first time the majority has targeted collective bargaining at the VA in this way. Your vote against this bill today will show that you op-pose this very tactic. If we are serious about providing vet-erans the best care possible, we should focus on removing the Federal hiring freeze, advancing the appeals mod-ernization bill, and other bipartisan ef-forts that will immediately improve veterans’ access to high-quality care and support. Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD a letter from the American Federation of State, County and Mu-nicipal Employees in opposition to this bill, a letter from the American Fed-eration of Government Employees, as well as a letter from the American Fed-eration of Labor and Congress of Indus-trial Organizations. AFSCME, March 15, 2017. H
OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. D
EARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I’m writing to urge you to op-pose H.R. 1259, which would eliminate collec-tive bargaining rights and fundamental due process rights of employees at the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs (VA). The bill makes it easier to fire people for a good reason or a bad reason. By elimi-nating merit-based principles for workers facing a removal, demotion or suspension, the bill makes it easier for management or political appointees to scapegoat employees that advocate strongly for the veteran pa-tients they serve. Basic civil service due process rights are necessary to block corrup-tion, patronage, discrimination, and polit-ical pressure to cover up problems in the de-livery of services to veterans. The bill destroys the right of registered nurses and other front-line VA employees to use a union grievance procedure to effi-ciently and fairly address proposed adverse employment actions. This is union busting. This bill will not help improve the care to veterans from the VA but rather make such care politicized and subject to corrupting and corrosive influences unrelated to qual-ity. Moreover, this bill sets a dangerous precedent that could subsequently harm more than one million additional federal workers in other agencies and occupations, and the public they serve. We urge you to vote against H.R. 1259. Sincerely, S
COTT FREY, Director of Federal Government Affairs.

ALZ: I am writing on behalf of nearly 700,000 federal employees represented by the American Federation of Government Em-ployees, AFL–CIO (AFGE), including 230,000 employees of the Department of Veterans Af-fairs (VA) to urge you to oppose H.R. 1259, a bill introduced by Representative Phil Roe (R–TN) to eliminate collective bargaining rights and significantly cut the due process rights of employees facing a proposed re-moval, demotion, or suspension (adverse ac-tion). H.R. 1259 is a direct assault on the union rights of every VA employee, including more than 120,000 veterans within the VA work-force. This bill will hurt, not fix, the VA. It will reverse the significant improvements made over the past two years, and will make it harder for veterans to get the veteran-cen-tric medical care and benefits on which they rely. In addition to punitive, counterproductive due process attacks recycled from earlier bills, H.R. 1259 breaks new ground by union- busting. The bill destroys the right of every VA front line employee to use union griev-ance procedures to efficiently and fairly ad-dress proposed adverse actions. The griev-ance procedure is not only part of the law but also part of the contract negotiated be-tween labor and management. The only ave-nue that VA front line employees will have left is a rushed management-run appeals process that does not allow good employees enough time to gather the evidence they

need to defend their jobs. For medical profes-sionals facing proposed adverse actions re-lated to professional conduct or competence, the reductions in the timeframe for the agency review process are more severe, even though their cases typically involve complex medical issues. In addition, all front-line employees and managers will have weaker rights to appeal to the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB), their first chance at an independent review. They will only have seven days to ap-peal to the MSPB after they are fired (and off the payroll), and the bill ties the hands of the MSPB Administrative Judge (AJ) with the recycled ‘‘one-size-fits-all’’ prohibition against mitigating the penalty, regardless of the facts of the individual case. When the employee loses at the MSPB (which happens in 80% of cases now), he would have only seven days to prepare an ap-peal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. How does this impact the life of a veteran working in a VA? What if a veteran working in a regional office processing claims is try-ing to do his job in the face of unfair allega-tions of poor performance by a manager who did not want to hire a veteran and did not train him properly before rushing him onto the job? It means that he only has ten days to gather all the evidence he needs to re-spond to a proposed removal and his man-ager only has five days to decide whether to go ahead and fire him. Therefore, 15 days after learning that he may be fired, he has no job and no paycheck. Then he has one week to get his appeal to the MSPB, during which he must hire an attorney if he can af-ford one, where the AJ cannot give him a suspension or demotion even if the judge be-lieves that the facts dictate a less severe punishment than removal. When the MSPB upholds the decision to fire him, he has just one week to prepare his appeal to a federal appeals court (and again, hire an attorney if he can afford one), while he is without a job and without a paycheck. Just last month, Chairman Roe stated that ‘‘the men and women who have fought for our great nation should never have to strug-gle to find a job,’’ but his bill attacks every option that veterans in the VA workforce have to save their jobs in the face of unjusti-fied firings. Chairman Roe has also expressed his inten-tions to reduce mismanagement at the VA, but his bill weakens the critical protections that VA employees need to speak up against mismanagement and patient harm. Every day, employees throughout the VA report concerns to management that directly im-pact patient safety, health care access, proc-essing of disability claims, and many other functions essential to the agency mission. Chairman Roe opposes the hiring freeze be-cause he understands how critical it is for veterans who depend on the VA to have a ‘‘robust clinical workforce.’’ Yet his bill sin-gles out VA employees, including every cli-nician caring for veterans, for worse treat-ment than other federal employees through recoupment of compensation already earned, including pensions, relocation bonuses, and performance bonuses. These provisions are unnecessary and violate due process. There are already ample safeguards in the law against retention of improper relocation and performance bonuses, and the VA has al-ready dismantled the relocation bonus pro-gram that was the subject of abuse allega-tions. In addition, this bill directly con-tradicts private sector law that forbids the recoupment of pensions. Thank you for considering the views of AFGE. If you need more information, please contact Marilyn Park of my staff. Sincerely, J. D

EARCHAIRMAN ROE AND RANKING MEMBER  W
ALZ: On behalf of the AFL–CIO, I urge you to reject the VA Accountability First Act (H.R. 1259), introduced by Chairman David Roe. H.R. 1259 is a thinly veiled effort to de-stroy union rights and shift the blame for management failures at the VA onto the backs of front line employees. The bill severely truncates the appeals process in current law and destroys griev-ance procedures that have been successfully used throughout the federal government to provide stability and protection against arbi-trary treatment, and with it any guarantee that employees will feel safe speaking out against mismanagement or to protect pa-tient safety. Rather than building a culture of trust at the VA, H.R. 1259 would turn back the clock to an era when employees could be fired with the slightest justification and almost no op-portunity to mount an effective defense. Worse, the bill would single out VA employ-ees for harsher treatment than other federal workers, including the recoupment of com-pensation already earned without adequate due process, including pension benefits, and relocation and performance bonuses. The Roe bill reflects the Chairman’s oppo-sition to collective bargaining and the cru-cial role labor organizations play in giving federal workers a voice on the job. For the 120,000 veterans who work at the VA, this bill is not only a slap in the face but a betrayal of the promise that they would be guaran-teed fair treatment if they came to work for the federal government. We urge you to reject H.R. 1259. Sincerely, W
ILLIAM SAMUEL , Director, Government Affairs Department. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, Mr. T
AKANO . ‘‘If you engage in an unethical prac-tice, if you cover up a serious problem, you should be fired. Period. It shouldn’t be that difficult.’’ President Barack Obama, at the Choice Act’s signing in 2014. Dr. Shulkin is not a hard-line person. He received 100 votes, Mr. Chairman, in the Senate. I don’t know that anybody else in this confirmation process has come close to that, but he has had unanimous support. He has asked for this. We worked with his office. He has personally asked that this be passed. That is why we are bringing this bill down here in this form. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. C
OFFMAN ), one of my great friends here in Congress, a fellow classmate. We came in together. We, too, have trav-eled to Afghanistan together to visit our Active Duty military in combat. He, too, is a combat veteran. b1600 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding. Today, as a veteran of both the Army and the United States Marine Corps, I rise on behalf of all those who have called, written, and stopped by my of-fice seeking reform and accountability of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I, along with the chairman and my colleagues on the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, introduced H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability First Act of 2017. Today the House will vote to en-sure the VA can hold its employees ac-countable for their actions and make sure that this agency remains com-mitted and connected to its sole mis-sion of serving our Nation’s veterans. Additionally, this bill would provide improved protections for whistle-blowers to ensure those brave enough to tell Congress and the American peo-ple what is really happening at the VA are protected. After the wait-time scandal in Phoe-nix and the over $1 billion cost overrun at the Aurora VA hospital, it is time that we reform the VA’s culture of cor-ruption and bureaucratic incom-petence. This legislation will help the VA meet our Nation’s obligations to the men and women who have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of our freedom. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, may I in-quire how much time I have remain-ing? The Acting CHAIR (Mr. POEof Texas). The gentleman from Minnesota has 10 minutes remaining. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, you are hearing it here, and these are folks, we work together. This idea of accountability matters deeply to all of us. We know when you are in any business, this business—we have had colleagues of ours in here be arrested for buying cocaine from un-dercover police officers in Washington, D.C. Well, that brings great discredit to every single one of us, but I certainly don’t think it requires all of us, then, to go through the same thing that per-son is going through or deprive us our rights of where we are at. This idea of due process, and what we are asking about, is not something meant to pro-tect a bad employee. In fact, it is just the opposite. It is meant to improve the workforce. My plea on this is—much of this bill, there is agreement on, Mr. T
AKANO was right—it went a step further. Having been a rank-and-file person in a collec-tively bargained unit, my goal was to provide the best quality education so our students could learn—an environ-ment, quality teachers, and all of those things. I am at a loss for the desire to come here and decide that, and again, we say it in passing: Well, I don’t want to de-ride all of those really good employees who are there. I just want to take away their collectively bargained right that was there. Even though we can give example after example, like Robert. He was a

service-connected disabled Navy vet-eran with over a decade of experience at the Veterans Benefits Administra-tion. He was demoted after consist-ently, every single year, receiving highly satisfactory or top-rated per-formance reviews. Robert volunteered to be part of a quality review team to get rid of the backlog, and he had the audacity to tell his manager that there were better ways we could do this. Per-haps all of this overtime pay and con-solidating all of these claims to one place was not in the best interest of that. That manager, on the way out the door, demoted and tried to remove Robert from that position. Now, keep in mind, that same man-ager, all of those years before, had rated him well. Well, maybe something happened. Maybe Robert started doing something wrong. Maybe Robert wasn’t that good an employee. But again, under this piece of legisla-tion, Robert’s collectively bargained right—which he used and grieved it and got back his job, and subsequently, the manager had problems on their per-formance reviews, where it came from. So again, don’t set this up as if ev-erything is wrong. And I would make note of this: We are doing our best to attract the best and brightest to the VA. Nobody is de-fending the bad. But when I hear folks come to the floor and it is nothing but what a horrific place this is, I leave this for you, Mr. Chairman. I also have the privilege of rep-resenting America’s premier medical institution in the Mayo Clinic, and I look at what they do. Folks at Mayo Clinic will tell me some of the finest cardiac surgeons in the world are at the Minneapolis VA. I will also tell you this. If you, in America, go to any hospital—Dr. R
OE can attest to this—the thing that you should probably be most worried about and the thing that kills most people— over 90,000 a year—is hospital-acquired infections. Do you know who does it better and has the lowest rate, better than Mayo Clinic, better than Johns Hopkins? The VA. So somebody among those rank- and-file members who is cleaning the operating rooms and cleaning the equipment is doing so in a manner that is better than any other. What message are we sending them today? If a manager doesn’t do their job and decides they want to fire you, we are going to lump everybody to-gether. I just ask, once again, to my colleagues, to this body, these are things that should have been debated in a hearing. We should have brought in the experts. Here is what I think. I think you would build a broader coalition—be-cause I have to be very honest with you. I think our public sector unions could help us and step up and say: What was the real situation here? How do you respond to this egregious breach of trust? And what do you think would be a better way? I am not saying they would give us a suggestion. I want to be very honest and not disingenuous. They may not answer us. We should have at least asked them: What would you do to make this better? What could speed it up, and what could protect them? We didn’t do that because we didn’t have a hearing, and I think that stops building the consensus. I think it makes it harder to get this. I will tell you this. The bill I keep referencing that was over in the Senate had 45 Senate cosponsors. Good luck getting 45 of them to agree today. It is Thursday, and we did it on an account-ability plea that also had the support of every single one of those groups on there, except one, to support that piece of legislation. So we went a step further. We didn’t have a hearing. We tried to let outside groups frame this as a veterans versus public sector union folks, who were also veterans. That is not what it is. We just need to get it right. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chair, I think my good friend, Mr. WALZ, helps make the point that this person who was aggrieved, it doesn’t have to last so long. You can actually compress this time. As I men-tioned, it is not short; 3 months to get this resolved. But this process we are putting together actually helps that person that has been aggrieved by the supervisor, I would argue. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. D
UNN), a new member of our committee, a vet-eran and physician from Florida. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-port of H.R. 1259, the VA Account-ability First Act of 2017. President Lincoln reminds us of our duty ‘‘to care for him who shall have borne the battle,’’ and, frankly, our government has done a miserable job of it. While a large number of VA employ-ees honorably serve our veterans, that is not always the case. In the real world, if you don’t do your job, you get fired. Yet we have employees at the VA who are guilty of gross misconduct, even major felonies, and they are still on the job. ‘‘Why is this?’’ you ask. Because the process to fire them is too arduous. The VA system that lives up to our veterans’ sacrifices starts with per-sonnel. The VA Accountability First Act is a great first step in addressing poor performance and misconduct at the VA. It will allow Secretary Shulkin to make substantive changes as he works to improve veterans’ care. We need to make the VA work for our veterans instead of our bureau-crats. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, we are not going to find a lot of disagreement. I will tell you what a good first step would be: hire some surgeons. There are openings there. This is our first salvo at trying to fix the VA. We have an appeals bill that every single vet-erans service organization agrees: ap-peals modernization. We have worked that thing through. We have had the language. It is not here. We have a Choice bill that is expiring August 7. We have had a hearing with the VA Secretary, and that is the way it should have been. It is not here today. What we have is a bill that did not go through regular order, a bill that obvi-ously didn’t build a consensus, and this is very unusual to have a bill from the VA Committee. I bet you 90 to 95 per-cent of the time when one hits this floor, it gets 300 to 400 votes up on that board, but this one is not. So, again, if the contention is that Members of this House don’t care if there is a bad employee working there, that is disingenuous and wrong. But if we do believe, putting it in place—and again, the example I gave, the chair-man is right. It took Robert 6 weeks to get all of the information gathered to-gether because the manager who left was holding on to it and had to get the union to force the release of that infor-mation. His 14 days would have come and gone, and that is it. This is why, sometimes, I am not going to defend 400 days. That is ridicu-lous. I am not going to spend—if they are dragging their feet. But this guy got fired by a manager, got demoted down, wanted to get the information. The outgoing manager said, ‘‘It isn’t my problem.’’ The union had to go— and had to go, in this case, almost to court—to get the information back to them so he could present a case that said exactly what was ruled upon: You got fired illegally by a bad manager. I am telling people, if you are angry when things go wrong at the VA, you have got 330 million Americans who are with you. We have subpoenaed them. None of them were collectively bar-gained. The problem is in management and middle management not doing their job. Do your work. You know what would be great is if the management actually did what they are supposed to do and improved bad performance before it gets to a point where it causes problems and you actually improve that employee, which saves us money from having to go out and hire someone else and you have the system working better. But to watch something go wrong, not do your due diligence, not follow the law, then fire someone and then complain that it takes too long to fix it, how about we figure out what really gets, keeps, re-tains, and makes the VA better? There are other places that we could work on. Ninety percent of it, you have got my agreement. I think you are going to see that 10 percent is going to ensure this does not get into law; and that, in itself, is simply wrong because

no one disagrees. We could make this system work better. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I will just point out that I don’t think the VA has a reputation of firing too many people. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. R
UTHER -
FORD ), a new Member, and a very active member of our committee. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for this opportunity. I rise today, Mr. Chairman, in sup-port of H.R. 1259, the VA Account-ability First Act, because our veterans deserve to receive the best care pos-sible, and our VA personnel deserve to work alongside only the best qualified and professional caregivers. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to serve almost 100,000 veterans in northeast Florida, and this important bill will ensure that veterans throughout the Nation get the care and respect that they have earned. In addition, thousands of good and caring VA employees dedicate their lives to serving our veterans in some of their greatest times of need. But it is unfair—unfair—to these many hard-working VA employees when those working alongside of them engage in misconduct and they are not held ac-countable. Mr. Chairman, our veterans deserve better, and our caring, hardworking VA employees deserve better. As has been stated multiple times, this bill does not eliminate employee due process. My colleagues and I in Congress carry a sacred obligation to our veterans, have a sacred obligation to our Nation to improve accountability at our VA. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chair, after the gen-tleman finishes with his speakers, I will close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I would like to inquire as to the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 9 minutes remaining. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. C
HAFFETZ ), the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a fellow classmate. b1615 Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chair, I really appreciate what Chairman R
OEof Ten-nessee is doing. He pours his heart and soul into one of the most important issues and things we can deal with here in Congress and, that is, helping our veterans. Veterans step up and serve in our military. I stand in awe. They do the heavy lifting. They run through the fire. They engage. Then they come home, and we have got to do a better job of taking care of those people who take care of us. The Veterans Administration, just like the rest of Federal Government, has a lot of good people who actually work there, do care, and have big hearts. With a government of more than 2 million people, every once in a while you come across some bad apples. They may be a poor performer, or they may just have their heart in a different place, and we have got to deal with these bad apples. While you have a whole set of people who are actually trying to do the right thing, you are going to run into some people every once in a while who aren’t doing the right thing, and you have to be able to dismiss them. Now, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has jurisdiction on the Federal civilian workforce, and we have worked closely with Chairman ROEof Tennessee to help make this possible. Through the last couple of years that I have been chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we have heard a number of accounts where Federal employees couldn’t be disciplined fast enough. It was obvious what they had done, but they had run into roadblocks in being able to dis-miss people. We heard horror stories from the En-vironmental Protection Agency where there was a sexually harassed intern that lasted for 3 years. It took 5 weeks to process the harasser’s removal pro-ceedings. We heard the Government Account-ability Office come and testify before our committee that it can take 6 months to a year to remove a Federal employee for poor performance. You know what? That isn’t good enough. When you have a bad apple and some-body is misusing the system and they are not performing, they are hurting our veterans. And when they are hurt-ing our veterans, I take that person-ally. Everybody should take that per-sonally. Nobody wants to see that hap-pen. So this bill, H.R. 1259, is a very im-portant bill to accelerate that process. Again, let’s remember that most of the people who work there are good, hard-working, patriotic people who care. But when you do have a bad apple and you do need to get rid of that person, we have to have an expedited removal proceeding. I know this bill does a number of things, but I can tell you, having heard testimony time and time and time again in a variety of Federal agencies, especially the VA, this is a much-need-ed bill. We are going to work as a committee to implement reforms like this govern-mentwide. To put the Veterans Admin-istration first and deal with this first, I think, is the right priority of this Congress. Again, hats off to Chairman R
OEof Tennessee and the committee as a whole for addressing this so aggres-sively and so early in the 115th Con-gress. I urge passage of H.R. 1259. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I would say that I am pleased that the gen-tleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ ) is going to use the Oversight and Govern-ment Reform Committee to provide oversight of this administration. I wel-come it. I have some suggestions for some other oversight of the adminis-tration, and I would be glad to share them. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. B
ANKS ), a new member of our committee who is also in the Re-serves serving our Nation in the mili-tary. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Chair-man, let me first commend the gen-tleman from Tennessee (Mr. R
OE) for his leadership on this issue and so many others on behalf of our veteran population. As a veteran myself of the war in Af-ghanistan, I have a deep commitment to ensuring that my fellow veterans re-ceive the proper care and treatment that they have earned by serving our country. That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the VA Ac-countability First Act. This bipartisan legislation will give Secretary Shulkin the tools that he needs to change the dysfunctional cul-ture of the VA. It has been 3 years since the wait list at VA facilities be-came public, yet too many of our vet-erans deal with VA employees who en-gage in misconduct that could endan-ger their lives. Too often, it takes months or even years to remove those employees. Worse still, sometimes these employees are not removed at all. Most VA em-ployees, though, are hardworking and dedicated people, which makes it that much more unfair when the VA can’t or won’t hold bad employees account-able. We can and must do better, and this bill is a first step in that process. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. The bill would shorten the time it takes to fire a VA employee for misconduct, give the Secretary the discretion to both re-voke bonuses previously paid to em-ployees engaging in misconduct and re-duce pensions of employees found guilty of felonies while on the job, and provide improved protections for whis-tleblowers. These are commonsense proposals supported by many veterans’ groups. This bill is also supported by Secretary Shulkin. It is a no-brainer, and that is why I support it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. L

his leadership on this legislation and also for letting me speak. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability First Act. For years, my colleagues and I have fought hard to hold VA bureaucrats ac-countable. The VA still lacks the abil-ity to take swift action against em-ployees who prevent veterans from get-ting the benefits that they have earned. We should be able to terminate sen-ior executives at failing hospitals that force veterans to languish on secret wait lists. We should not award bo-nuses to poorly performing employees who engage in misconduct, and we shouldn’t provide full retirement bene-fits to convicted criminals whose crime harmed veterans. We can’t stop there. We must go fur-ther to pursue bold reform at the VA. I look forward to working with Chair-man R
OEof Tennessee, Chairwoman M
CMORRIS RODGERS , and others to pass the Caring for Our Heroes in the 21st Century Act, which would finally em-power veterans, including the almost 100,000 in my congressional district in Colorado, to make their own healthcare decisions. Let’s pass H.R. 1259 today. It is a good piece of legislation. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 1 minute remain-ing. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chair, I am glad we got an opportunity to debate this, which is what we should do. There is no disagreement that we need to hold folks accountable. We need to get the best people at the VA. We need to com-mit to improving the VA the best we can. My respect and admiration for the chairman is as it has always been, the highest it can be. I know his heart and his intellect is aimed at that. We have some legitimate differences on this. I don’t believe they are so big they can’t be overcome. I do believe we should try and keep this away from the partisan-ship that so often engulfs this House. My commitment to Chairman R
OEof Tennessee is to do the best I can to continue to try and improve upon these. We have a lot more work to do that will be happening together to im-prove the care of our veterans. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, to go along with what Sergeant Major W
ALZ said, it is truly a privilege to work with him on these issues. His heart is in the right place. He truly cares about veterans. I believe this bill, though, does do what needs to be done. Secretary Shulkin—approved 100–0 in the Sen-ate—believes that he needs this tool to be able to reform the VA. I think it is imperative that we, as legislators, pro-vide him the tools when we say we de-mand accountability at the VA. Once again, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 1259. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-eral debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5- minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amend-ment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a sub-stitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–7. That amend-ment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the na-ture of a substitute is as follows: H.R. 1259 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

ESSIONS of the Rules Committee for making this amendment in order. I have voiced my concern with the reg-ular order. I think it is important to note that we are given the opportunity here to offer amendments in good faith, and I am grateful for that. This amendment to H.R. 1259 would replace sections 3 and 9 of the under-lying bill with bipartisan legislation from the Veterans First Act that was first introduced by Senator ISAKSON  last Congress. This is a piece of legisla-tion I have been talking about. It is supported from both sides of the aisle, as well as those veterans service organizations, with the exception of one, that was shown earlier. If we hope to reach any compromise with the Senate on accountability, I believe this amendment could be made in order, be voted on, debated, and passed into it. The amendment specifically targets senior executives. It has been the sen-ior executives, not the frontline em-ployees, who we have subpoenaed be-fore our committee, and who the VA has failed to hold accountable. Like H.R. 1259, it provides an expe-dited process for the VA Secretary to hold senior executives and VA employ-ees accountable. For a senior executive employee, the employee would get 10 business days’ notice. The employee subject to an ad-verse action would be able to grieve the action through an internal grievance process that would take no longer than 21 days. The employee would also be permitted to appeal an adverse action to court. It would also require the VA Secretary to develop a performance management system for SES employ-ees. Do your job. Have the management do their job. For VA employees, the employee would be removed from misconduct or poor performance that took place with-in the previous 2 years before the pro-posed removal. The employee would get 10 business days’ notice. The em-ployee would get 10 business days to re-spond to the charges. The VA Sec-retary would be required to provide the employee a decision in a reasonable pe-riod of time, and the employee would have 10 days to appeal the decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board. This takes a little time. The Merit Systems Protection Board would have 90 days to issue a decision. During that time, the employee would receive no pay and no benefits. My amendment would also leave in place sections 4 through 8 of H.R. 1259 because I agree employees convicted of felonies connected to their jobs should not receive pensions, and poor-per-forming employees should not receive bonuses. No disagreement. Most importantly, my amendment provides a fair process that protects whistleblowers. By allowing our front-line employees to use arbitration and grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements, these frontline employees remain protected from bad managers who want to retaliate against them for speaking out when something is wrong. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2127 March 16, 2017 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I appreciate the spirit in which this amendment is proposed by the gen-tleman from Minnesota (Mr. W
ALZ), but I must oppose it at this time. The amendment would dramatically weaken the current accountability lan-guage for non-SES employees to the point that it would not be a meaningful improvement to or departure from cur-rent law. Just as a point of clarifica-tion, the Senate never did move the Veterans First Act. b1630 The amendment includes many of the archaic and unnecessary civil service rules that currently hamper true re-form and accountability at the Depart-ment. And unlike H.R. 1259, which would require the entire internal and first level of external appeals process to be completed within 67 days, the Walz amendment would allow for the process to take at least 120 days, and this period could expand indefinitely. Additionally, the standard used in this agreement for removing or demot-ing employees for performance is not a meaningful departure from current law, and I fear it won’t make any true changes that are desperately needed at VA. On the collective bargaining piece, I understand the ranking member’s con-cern, but the last thing I want to do is create a giant loophole that makes it harder to discipline bad employees. Just looking at one of VA’s master contracts with employee unions, AFGE, which is the largest union at VA, one can see that the grievance pro-cedures that he wishes to keep in place to dispute discipline can extend to al-most 350 days, and this timeline can be easily extended. With the Walz amendment, we would be creating a giant loophole where the Secretary would have one expedited process in place, while the long and ad-ministratively burdensome grievance process remains in place for nearly 285,000 employees at the Department, or 76 percent of the VA’s workforce. Clearly, covering only 24 percent of the VA workforce under an expedited authority is not what I want to do, nor do I expect veterans and taxpayers or the Secretary want to do. Additionally, when the committee first began working on accountability issues at VA, they were told by the largest Federal Government union, AFGE general counsel, that the union would never support any legislation that changes the status quo. Based on AFGE’s strong support for language identical to the Walz amend-ment last Congress, I think the mes-sage is clear. If Congress adopts this language, we would not be protecting taxpayers or veterans, and we would be supporting the corrupt status quo that fails VA employees and veterans daily. In the end, the question is very clear: Do we want to stand with veterans and taxpayers to provide the Secretary with the appropriate tools he has asked for to hold these employees account-able? Or do we want to give in to spe-cial interests groups to support the status quo? Once again, I urge all Members to op-pose the Walz amendment and support the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, the choice is not as easy as that. Do you want to stand with Robert, the good employee who was fired by a bad manager who used the process to get their job back, or do we want to just hurry it? It is better to get it right than get it done. And I will point out, AFGE, the union you keep hearing about, Mr. Chairman, does not endorse my amend-ment. They do not endorse my amend-ment, nor do I care about that. What I do believe is that this amend-ment has the opportunity to improve upon on a bill that we 90 percent agree upon, taking out the piece that is going to make it difficult and not im-prove care for our veterans. And I guess the thing that I would hope mat-ters, I believe—and we will come back here and see. We will see. That is the good part about this place. If this piece of legislation is passed by October, by Halloween, we should have this bill through and it should be done, and we should be seeing changes. If we don’t, perhaps we do this exer-cise again, through regular order, tak-ing some of these suggestions that make it possible to get it done. I encourage my colleagues to support this change that makes sure we can get accountability. Let’s agree where we know we agree. It is not picking one over the other. It is deciding how you give due process, encouraging good em-ployees to have the rights that they have earned to improve that care and workplace while at the same time re-moving those that don’t. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I am just looking at the AFGE website, and it does have support for the Vet-erans First Act here on the website; so that is true. Mr. WALZ. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. ROE of Tennessee. I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. WALZ. This is not the Veterans First Act. It is pieces from the Vet-erans First Act, but changes. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time. Basically, the accountability provi-sions are the same. I, once again, urge all Members to oppose the Walz amend-ment and support the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Minnesota (Mr. W
ALZ). The question was taken; and the Act-ing Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-ceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota will be postponed. The Chair understands that amend-ment No. 3 will not be offered. AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MS . KUSTER OF  
NEW HAMPSHIRE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part A of House Report 115–39. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 8, line 20, insert ‘‘or section 733(c) of this title’’ after ‘‘title 5’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. K
USTER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle-woman from New Hampshire. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, today I speak on behalf of my amendment, Kuster amendment No. 4. I firmly believe that my amend-ment will improve accountability at the Veterans Administration. One of my concerns with the bill be-fore us is that it will inadvertently hurt whistleblowers through retalia-tion and other discriminatory prac-tices. Whistleblowers are vital for our mission to ensure accountability at the VA. As the ranking member of the Over-sight and Investigations Sub-committee, I know that whistleblowers provide the VA and our committee with information of misconduct before it goes too far or before those respon-sible can deflect blame or otherwise hide incriminating details. We must ensure that these folks are protected in any bill that seeks to streamline the VA’s ability to release employees. I appreciate the inclusion of whistle-blower protections within section 3 of the bill. We understand the importance of protecting whistleblowers, and my amendment would improve upon this language. Last year’s MILCON-VA appropria-tions bill included what is now section 733 of title 38. This title clarifies and further specifies prohibited personnel actions as they relate to VA whistle-blowers. For example, section 733 ex-plicitly prohibits the denial of an oth-erwise meritorious promotion because that employee filed a whistleblower complaint. The bill currently only ref-erences more generic protections found within title 5. Section 733 was added because of con-cerns that title 5 was not specific enough to the issues that face the VA. This amendment will ensure that an employee is protected if they help the GAO or the VA Office of Inspector Gen-eral in any investigations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2128 March 16, 2017 
This language is bipartisan in nature, and my amendment is supported by the Project on Government Oversight, an independent nonprofit that seeks to improve accountability. My amendment aligns with the spirit of this bill. It protects those who virtuously serve our Nation’s veterans, and punishes those who do wrong by them. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment, Kuster No. 4, because it is common sense and the right thing to do. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to rise in op-position, although I am not opposed. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, the amendment would allow a whistleblower who is alleging prohibited personnel practices, as de-fined in title 38, from being disciplined under the bill until the whistleblower complaint is resolved. The committee has always favored strengthening protections for whistle-blowers. My bill already protects whis-tleblowers, but I am not opposed to Ms. K
USTER ’s amendment and suggested changes, and I appreciate her offering it. The bill has my full support. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I have learned one thing in 4 years: quit while I am ahead. Mr. Chairman, I have nothing further to add, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. K
USTER ). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair under-stands that amendment No. 5 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . TAYLOR  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part A of House Report 115–39. Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 9, after line 19, insert the following: ‘‘(i) S
EMI-ANNUAL REPORT ON TRANSFERRED  E
MPLOYEES .—The Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives semi- annual reports on senior executive employ-ees who are transferred within the Depart-ment. Each such report shall include, for each such senior executive employee trans-ferred during the period covered by the re-port, the reason for the transfer and any costs associated with the transfer.’’. Page 9, line 20, strike ‘‘(i)’’ and insert ‘‘(j)’’. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. T
AYLOR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to the VA Ac-countability First Act. This amend-ment would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit a semi-an-nual report to Congress on the reasons and costs of the transfer of any senior executive employees within the De-partment. Mr. Chairman, in my district and the surrounding area, we have the fastest- growing veterans’ population in the Nation, specifically, with women vet-erans, Operation Enduring Freedom veterans, and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans. I am honored to serve in the district that has the largest population of Active Duty and veterans in the country. Our own VA center, where I person-ally receive care, was previously rated as a one-star facility, the lowest rating available; this, by the VA’s own rating system. Now, I am pleased to say the center has made strides and progress in many areas. However, the director in charge during the time of poor per-formance was simply moved to another facility to be a director there. We have to do better. We will do better. The VA Accountability First Act of 2017 is a wonderful and great start. This amendment will contribute to more transparency, accountability, and oversight. We must continually and consistently hold the VA accountable for underperformance. Our veterans are sacred and deserve the same commit-ment to high standards they upheld as servicemembers. We should never defend mediocrity at the VA; rather, strive for better serv-ice, care, and excellence. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment and, in fact, I am enthusiastically supportive of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-tion, the gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing this for-ward. This amendment addresses an issue that we dealt with in our com-mittee last Congress, where senior ex-ecutives are transferred to different po-sitions around the country, receive pay increases and relocation incentives. We subpoenaed two senior executives. In fact, the first subpoenas ever issued out of the VA Committee, I asked for them to get there; and they were backed by Mr. R
OE, backed by our chairman and ranking member. And to refresh people’s minds, these were folks that took positions of lesser power, used their positions to negotiate to get there, and then, in some cases, took $129,000 moving expenses. You cannot find anyone more out-raged than me. And I will tell you, be-cause it was not done correctly, and we didn’t focus on this, I still work with some of those very same people. They have their jobs back. Now, the debate that the gentleman may have heard earlier is we don’t dis-agree at all that we should get rid of these people. This amendment will focus on the right things, that is what we have been making the case of. So I applaud the gentleman. I am glad he is here. His military service is greatly appreciated. The statistics he gave on veterans shows that he will be there. I support this amendment, and I certainly believe that my colleagues should all support it. It is this type of work that improves upon a bill, as I say, once again, 90 per-cent of what is in this bill is in abso-lute agreement. This just makes the bill better. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ten-nessee (Mr. ROE). b1645 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. T
AYLOR for his service to our country and to our Na-tion. I am appreciative of him and his staff for working with us on the amendment. The amendment has, as chair, my full support. Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, I just want to state I thank the gentleman, and I thank the gentleman on the other side, as well, for his support. I think this is the right thing to do for transparency and for accountability for our veterans in the VA. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Virginia (Mr. T

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. T
ENNEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle-woman from New York. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 1259, which would require the VA to submit a re-port to Congress at the end of each fis-cal year listing the bonuses that were awarded to senior-level executives. In 2015, VA employees received more than $177 million in bonuses, which was 24 percent more than they received in 2014. The average bonus for a senior ex-ecutive was $10,000. I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans admirably each day. In my own dis-trict, I have spoken with veterans who are grateful for the compassionate care that they receive from local VA clinics throughout upstate New York. VA em-ployees should be fairly compensated for their work and awarded for their achievement. It is also clear to me that there is more work to be done. Just this month, an audit of several VA facilities in North Carolina and Virginia revealed that wait times continue to be mis-represented and that nearly 14,000 vet-erans were denied access to timely care. The audit also found that vet-erans were waiting an average of 26 days to see mental health specialists, while the VA falsely reported average wait times of 6 days. In light of this in-formation, the American people are right to wonder who at the VA may be receiving a bonus this year. My amendment adds a simple report-ing requirement to the bill that will streamline oversight of bonuses at the VA by requiring the agency to proactively provide information to Congress that details the amount of each bonus awarded to senior execu-tives as well as the job titles of the in-dividuals and the location of their em-ployment. Given the patterns of mis-management at the VA, the American people deserve to know how bonuses are being awarded at the agency. This bill increases transparency over the bonus process without placing any undue burdens on the agency. I would encourage my colleagues to support it, and I thank the committee for the opportunity to offer this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-tion, the gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, once again, I am not only not opposed, I am enthusiastically supportive of the gen-tlewoman’s commonsense, absolutely important piece of legislation. It im-proves upon the bill. I am glad we had a rule that brought it here, something we have worked on in our committee. I will make note of this. The gentlewoman is absolutely right. The people we just talked about in the last amendment received bonuses also, but the bulk of this bill also deals with kitchen staff, janitorial staff, and rank-and-file members on the floor that we are working to go after their agreed-upon grievance process to keep their jobs. So this amendment is abso-lutely something that will get total ap-proval from certainly, I believe, all Members of the House. This should be in the bill and will be in the bill. This is how bills get better, address real issues, and take on the issue of ac-countability in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Chairman, I would encourage all my colleagues to support the gentle-woman. We have more work, as the gentlewoman said in this, but this is how it is done to get it right. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), who is the chairman. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, this would require the Secretary to re-port to Congress each year any per-formance awards or bonuses provided to Senior Executive Service employees at the VA. This is an excellent amend-ment from the gentlewoman from New York and will provide additional need-ed transparency at the Department where taxpayer money is being spent, especially when being spent on bonuses for the most senior individuals at VA. This amendment has my full support. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tlewoman from New York (Ms. T
ENNEY ). The amendment was agreed to.

(2) W HISTLEBLOWER .—The term ‘‘whistle-blower’’ has the meaning given such term in section 323(g) of title 38, United States Code, as added by section 101. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. K
USTER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle-woman from New Hampshire. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on my second amendment to H.R. 1259, Kuster amendment No. 8. I am concerned that an unintended consequence of the bill before us would be retaliation against whistleblowers at the VA. After my 4 years on the House Vet-erans’ Affairs Committee and my time as ranking member of its Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I know that whistleblower protections are a bipartisan issue for our committee, and I know that this Congress recognizes the incredible importance of whistle-blowers at the VA. Whistleblowers provided many de-tails that made Congress and the pub-lic aware of the Phoenix scandal. They provided valuable information in un-covering the Aurora construction deba-cle. Whistleblowers save lives and save taxpayer money. Unfortunately, whis-tleblowers are sometimes targeted for retaliation by their supervisors. My amendment seeks to address this. My amendment requires supervisors to detail their efforts to correct poor performance and misconduct, efforts that come before the procedures out-lined by this bill. It requires super-visors to detail the efforts they have made to improve their work environ-ment and ensure that employees of their team uphold the primary mission of the VA: to serve and to honor our Nation’s veterans. The amendment will also improve training of supervisors to ensure they are equipped to be leaders that improve employee performance and the quality of care at the VA. More importantly, this enhanced training will include in-struction on the rights of whistle-blowers and how to address concerns or complaints raised by them. These provisions could help to pro-tect those whistleblowers who are ac-tually experiencing retaliation because it would provide evidence of the past actions a supervisor has taken to ad-dress alleged misconduct, and it will highlight leadership shortfalls that could implicate attempted actions taken against an employee. Together, these provisions will proactively improve the culture of management at the VA so it reflects the virtue and quality that Congress has strived to achieve for so many years. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment, Kuster No. 8. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, Ms. K
USTER ’s amend-ment would require VA supervisors to develop performance plans for employ-ees which would, as a part of the plan, measure steps taken to address poor performance but also improve training for VA supervisors—an excellent sug-gestion. I agree that all VA employees, espe-cially our managers, should be held to high standards and should have as much training provided them as is available. Ms. K
USTER ’s amendment has my full support. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I have no further comment other than to thank Dr. R
OEfor his support. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, this is an excellent amendment, and I urge support. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. K
USTER ). The amendment was agreed to.

(7) Any recommendations by the Inspector General, based on the information described in paragraphs (1) through (6), to improve the authority to make such suspensions and re-movals. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman from California (Mr. T
AKANO ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, my amendment in the nature of a substitute would strike the text of H.R. 1259 and insert a new provi-sion allowing the Secretary to suspend, without pay, any VA employee whose performance or misconduct threatens public health or safety, including the health and safety of veterans. It would give the Secretary the authority to re-move a suspended employee after an investigation and review if the Sec-retary determines removal is in the in-terests of public health and safety. Both parties share the desire to pro-tect veterans from mistreatment or harm, especially when they are seeking medical care at a VA facility, but the language in my amendment would be more likely to achieve the majority’s stated outcome of removing VA em-ployees whose misconduct harms vet-erans. We have voted on similar account-ability bills before, but I want to point out that this bill goes much further in the wrong direction. While in the past we have had disagreements on proce-dure and the amount of time an em-ployee is given to file an appeal, for the very first time, this version of the ac-countability bill is attempting to un-dermine VA employees’ collective bar-gaining rights. Buried in this bill is a new provision that would take away the rights of frontline VA employees to use collec-tively bargained agreements for set-tling grievances. This has not been a part of past negotiations, and the vote that Members take on the underlying bill should not be based solely on their votes on previous accountability bills. Collectively bargained grievance set-tlement procedures often lead to quicker and simpler solutions, and they give added protection to potential whistleblowers. When these basic pro-tections are undermined, we give too much power to managers whose goal may be to retaliate against someone who called out a mistake. The bill, as it is currently being of-fered, does not provide enough time for an employee to get their case together to file an appeal. It undermines collec-tive bargaining agreements negotiated in good faith between management and employees. It doesn’t do enough to pro-tect whistleblowers. My amendment addresses our shared goal to create accountability at the VA. It would ensure that the Secretary has the authority to immediately sus-pend any VA employee whose behavior threatens the health and safety of vet-erans, and that the suspended em-ployee does not accrue pay while the investigation is being carried out. I hope that Members will join me and vote in favor of my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I appreciate Mr. T
AKANO ’s—who is a very hardworking member of the com-mittee—attempt to insert what he thinks is an appropriate balance of due process and accountability, but the substitute language misses the bar of what we are trying to accomplish. It would strike the entire bill and in-sert new language only allowing the Secretary to remove someone if they present a threat to health or safety. This is a nearly unobtainable, if not an immeasurable, bar to reach. This unde-fined standard makes it almost impos-sible for the Secretary to remove any employee. It would create a confusing process that only allows someone to be removed after they are suspended first and the Secretary conducts an inves-tigation into the individual. It would allow for employees to be on indefinite suspension for months, if not years, awaiting the Secretary’s final decision, which is not fair to veterans and the employee or good-performing employees and taxpayers. The em-ployee deserves a quick opportunity to present their case, and, if exonerated, get back to doing their job. Unlike my bill, this would only pro-vide backpay to someone if their re-moval is overturned on appeal if they are a whistleblower. My bill would re-quire any individual whose disciplinary action is overturned on appeal to re-ceive any backpay for that period. b1700 This amendment does nothing to pro-vide the Secretary with the authority to recoup bonuses or relocation ex-penses from individuals who receive taxpayer-funded money through ill- gotten means such as fraud, waste, or abuse, nor does it allow the Secretary to recoup a portion of a Federal pen-sion of someone convicted of a felony that influenced their VA job. It would ensure that the current inef-fective civil service rules would con-tinue to hamper any change to the cor-rosive and unaccountable culture at the VA, and would also, more than likely, not apply to some of the em-ployees associated with the VA’s egre-gious scandals, including the bloated Denver, Colorado, construction project; data management at the Philadelphia regional office; FY 2015 $2.5 billion shortfall cost overruns at the Orlando VA Medical Center; allegations of inap-propriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of $6 billion; and many others. These are the types of employees that our constituents and veterans ex-pect to be held accountable, but this amendment would not cover. In the end, the facts are clear: our veterans and the American taxpayer support the reform in H.R. 1259, and not the status quo, which is supported by public sector unions. I encourage all Members to oppose the Takano amendment and support the underlying bill. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the underlying bill and sup-port my amendment. I would assert that my amendment would apply to many of the employees in the scandals who were cited by our esteemed chairman. I want to remind the body that sev-eral Republican speakers this after-noon repeated a phrase that the vast majority of employees at the VA are doing a good job. My amendment really does address those few employees who really do pose a threat to veterans’ safety or health. I would also say that I want to re-mind also the chairman and inform the body that we heard testimony from the bipartisan Commission on Care estab-lished through the Choice Act. They were charged with the responsibility of reviewing VA health care. One of the co-chairs was appointed by a Republican—I believe the Senate ma-jority leader—and the other by the White House. They both reported back that we cannot create excellence at the VA through enhancing the firing proc-ess. They were astounded that more ef-fort and resources have not been in-vested in the personnel function of the VA to better train our managers in progressive discipline and to do the kind of documentation that really will bring about effective accountability. By the way, both of these co-chairs led, and do still, large, private sector healthcare organizations. They pushed back on a suggestion that we needed to enhance our dismissal process, our ac-countability process.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR  
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote). There is 1 minute remaining. b1733 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. O
LSON ) having assumed the chair, Mr. P
OEof Texas, Acting Chair of the Com-mittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Com-mittee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1259) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the removal or demotion of employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs based on performance or misconduct, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 198, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is or-dered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment re-ported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amend-ment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. P
OE of Texas). Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. KIHUEN. I am opposed in its cur-rent form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recom-mit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Kihuen moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1259 to the Committee on Veterans’ Af-fairs with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the fol-lowing amendments: Page 8, line 19, insert ‘‘or an individual who makes a whistleblower disclosure to the central whistleblower office, including anon-ymous whistleblower disclosures made through a toll-free telephone number or Internet website’’ after ‘‘Special Counsel’’. Add at the end the following new section: 
SEC. 10. TREATMENT OF VETERANS, MEMBERS OF UNIFORMED SERVICES, AND WHISTLEBLOWERS. 
The amendments made by sections 3 and 9 of this Act shall not apply to any individual who is— (1) preference eligible under section 2108(3) of title 5, United States Code; (2) a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service (as such term is defined in section 4303(16) of title 38, United States Code); or (3) seeking corrective action (or on behalf of whom corrective action is sought) from the Office of Special Counsel based on an al-leged prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b) of title 5, United States Code.

Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Nevada is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to com-mittee. If adopted, the bill will imme-diately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we have the moral responsibility for providing for the men and women who have served our country. One of my highest prior-ities in Congress is ensuring that our veterans receive the care and benefit they have earned. It has been almost 3 years since a whistleblower shocked the Nation by disclosing 1,400 veterans languish with-out care at the Phoenix VA. Since then, many others have come forward to report excessive wait times, sub-standard care, and dirty facilities in VA hospitals all across the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2134 March 16, 2017 
The issues we have seen at different VA hospitals have been completely dis-graceful. However, what is even more shocking is that many of these whistle-blowers have reported some sort of re-taliation from hospital directors or the VA’s Office of Inspector General, even though Federal law specifically pro-hibits harassment or retaliation of Federal employees who bring wrong-doing to light. The recent reports about VA employ-ees facing retaliation is disheartening and it is unacceptable. We need to pro-tect these employees who are trying to ensure that the VA is transparent and accountable to all of our veterans. Mr. Speaker, my amendment is very simple and commonsense. It merely builds upon existing language in the bill seeking to protect whistleblowers. Under the bill, a whistleblower can still be fired during the expedited pro-cedure with limited recourse. This amendment would close that loophole. This amendment would also cover those who come forward to a central whistleblower office instead of just a special counsel. And, as my colleagues have noted nu-merous times on the floor today, one- third of our VA employees are vet-erans. This amendment also works to protect them from unjust firings with-out due process. We should never tolerate fraud, waste, or abuse on our Federal agen-cies. This is especially true when it comes to caring for our Nation’s vet-erans. The brave men and women who have put their lives on the line should be provided with the best quality of care, and it is imperative that the whistleblowers who have stood up to protect our veterans should be fully protected from retaliation. We should provide whistleblowers with the confidence to step up and help make a change. Helping improve our veterans’ health care is dependent in part on the encouragement and protec-tion of whistleblowers within the VA. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I say this. No one in this body wants to vote on a bill that may give potential whistle-blowers doubt about coming forward. Let’s give them the assurance they de-serve by voting for this motion to re-commit, which will strengthen the whistleblower protection language in the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for my amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to re-commit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker: ‘‘If you engage in an unethical prac-tice, if you cover up a serious problem, you should be fired. Period. It shouldn’t be that difficult’’—Barack Obama at the Veterans Choice Act signing in August of 2014. That is who said that. Yesterday, I had breakfast with the Secretary of the VA. We know that ac-countability and the VA needs reform. The first thing he said to me when he was there was he needs this account-ability act to better manage the VA. What does this bill do, in a nutshell, very quickly? It simply shortens the process instead of taking as much as a year or longer to terminate someone. And we have had people in egregious things they have done. The Phoenix VA issue was mentioned. It took 2 years to get rid of anybody out there. The Secretary says he needs these authorities. It maintains the due proc-ess rights of the employees, which is important. It simply shortens the length of time for as much as a year for some people. The VA said it would take 6 months to a year to fire a govern-ment employee—or longer. It also has accentuated whistleblower protections, allows the Secretary to re-coup bonuses from people who have gotten them illegally. It allows the Secretary to hire peo-ple. We have many VA facilities out there that do not have CEOs at this time. Mr. Speaker, I would recommend that we oppose the MTR, and I would strongly encourage my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, in a bipartisan way, to support the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks and to insert any extraneous material into the R
ECORD  on H.R. 1367. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Y
ODER ). Is there objection to the re-quest of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to House Resolution 198 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 1367. The Chair appoints the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. B
UDD) to pre-side over the Committee of the Whole. b1811 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1367) to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, with Mr. B
UDD in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. W
ENSTRUP ) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. W
ALZ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1367, to improve the au-thority of the Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit and retain employ-ees. VA’s mission of honoring and serving our Nation’s veterans is second to none in the Federal Government, and a high- quality, high-performing workforce is key to VA’s ability to successfully exe-cute on that mission. H.R. 1367 contains a number of provi-sions that would strengthen VA’s abil-ity to identify staffing shortages, re-cruit employees to fill vacant posi-tions, quickly onboard new hires, and retain high-performing workers across the country. It also contains provisions that would improve leadership and ac-countability throughout VA and in-crease the number of veterans in the Federal workforce. To assist VA in identifying and ad-dressing local staffing deficiencies, this bill would modify the annual deter-mination of staffing shortages to in-clude five clinical occupations and five nonclinical occupations for each VA medical center. Staffing needs can vary significantly from facility to facility, even within the same State, and create a variety of delays, backlogs, and other challenges for veterans. This provision would allow VA to use this existing reporting tool, which dates back to the 2014 Choice Act, to target a total of 10 occupations at each VA medical center and use VA’s exist-ing direct hire authority to expedi-tiously address shortages for those oc-cupations. To increase leadership development opportunities for emerging leaders and encourage the dissemination of best practices between and among VA and private sector, the bill would establish an executive management program to allow eligible VA and private sector employees the opportunity to take 1- year fellowship positions in either comparable private sector entities or VA, respectively. This idea was brought to us by a veteran partici-pating in the joint Veterans of Foreign Wars-Student Veterans of America leg-islative fellowship program and would mirror a successful fellowship model used by the White House and the State Department. To increase accountability for senior VA decisionmakers, the bill would re-quire annual performance plans for VA political appointees, similar to the an-nual performance plans that are re-quired for Senior Executive Service employees. b1815 Like SES employees, political ap-pointees perform at the very highest levels and play critical roles in setting and achieving high profile policies and priorities. It is only appropriate that they too be held accountable for their performance. To incentivize the hiring of veterans across the Federal Government, the bill would change the service require-ment for reservists and guardsmen to be eligible for veterans’ preference from 180 days of consecutive Active- Duty service to 180 days of cumulative Active-Duty service, and expand those considered preference eligible to in-clude all retired servicemembers. Veterans gain a variety of skills dur-ing their time in uniform and are often

uniquely suited to Federal employ-ment. In recognition of this, some form of veterans’ preference has been in place since the Civil War. By modern-izing this important benefit today, we can bring needed skill sets to the Fed-eral workforce and promote employ-ment opportunities for veterans, a win- win if there ever was one. To encourage former VA employees who left VA service to gain relevant education or experience and then re-turn to the VA, the bill would allow the VA to noncompetitively reappoint a former employee to a position not more than 1 grade higher than their former position. I believe we must do everything pos-sible to encourage former employees to come back and work at the VA and re-ward them for furthering themselves and using their new skills to benefit veterans. In order to be eligible for reappoint-ment under this authority, the former employee must have voluntarily, with-in the prior 2 years, maintained a satis-factory performance record while at the VA, and retained any necessary licensures or credentials. To assist the VA in identifying and prioritizing vacancies, the bill would require the VA to establish a recruit-ing database listing each vacant posi-tion that the VA determines is critical to the VA’s mission, is difficult to fill, or both. Also, the bill would authorize and en-courage the VA to track qualified ap-plicants for vacant positions and use the recruiting database and the quali-fied applicant pool to quickly fill va-cancies that have gone unfilled for a prolonged time. To ensure the VA human resources professionals have a thorough under-standing of the VA’s unique hiring au-thorities, the bill would require Vet-erans Health Administration HR em-ployees to receive regular, ongoing training. The VA healthcare system benefits from direct hiring authorities for clin-ical personnel under title 38, United States Code. However, these hiring au-thorities are unique to the VA and can be complex and difficult for HR em-ployees to understand and work with, which increases the likelihood that those authorities go underused and HR professionals experience burnout. This provision would support those professionals in their important work while ensuring that veterans benefit as much as possible from the special hir-ing authorities that Congress has granted the VA in statute. To encourage highly skilled employ-ees wishing to advance in their career at the VA without taking on a manage-ment role, this bill would require the VA to establish a promotional track for technical experts that does not re-quire transition to a managerial posi-tion. This is a commonsense provision that would increase the VA’s ability to retain employees in highly technical positions who want to remain at the VA and continue moving forward in their careers, but are either uninter-ested in or ill-suited to becoming a manager. To increase the understanding of the VA’s succession planning efforts, the bill would require the Government Ac-countability Office to conduct a study on succession planning at each VA medical facility, as well as within the Veterans Benefits Administration and the National Cemetery Administration. Earlier this week, the VA confirmed that 80 percent of current Veterans In-tegrated Service Network directors and 25 percent of current VA Medical Cen-ter directors are eligible to retire. Last year, the VA testified that it can take more than 6 months and multiple re-announcements to fill these important positions in both rural and major met-ropolitan areas. Effective succession planning is crit-ical to ensuring stable leadership and to identifying and developing emerging leaders who are ready, willing, and able to step up when existing directors or other managers retire or depart. I look forward to reviewing the results of GAO’s work to see what further im-provements can be made in this area. To improve recruitment and reten-tion of younger employees, the bill would require the VA to allow for ex-cepted service appointments leading to conversion to career or career-condi-tional employment for students and re-cent graduates. VA’s existing workforce is aging and, as I mentioned just a moment ago, in-creasingly retirement-eligible. Unfor-tunately, the VA has historically per-formed poorly in comparison to other Federal agencies when it comes to hir-ing younger employees, which could put the VA’s future at risk. I am hope-ful that this provision will increase the VA’s ability to build a pipeline of young talent. Finally, to increase the VA’s under-standing of why departing employees choose to leave the VA and, in turn, how the VA could improve in order to retain other employees, this bill would require the VA to develop and deploy a standardized, anonymous exit survey process. The VA has an existing survey process but it is underutilized, with just 30 percent of all clinical employees completing it prior to their departure over the last 5 years, according to a GAO report issued last year. Factors that contribute to employees voluntarily leaving VA service cannot be addressed unless they are identified, and this provision would help us do that. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the fu-ture of the VA, our Nation’s second largest bureaucracy, depends on the VA’s ability to effectively and effi-ciently recruit and retain highly quali-fied and motivated employees in towns and cities across this country. In an in-creasingly competitive market with an increasingly retirement-eligible work-force, the stakes are simply too high for the VA to continue to struggle to hire the employees it needs. While more remains to be done to simplify and shorten the VA’s hiring process and strengthen the VA’s ability to bring the very best professionals on-board to serve our veterans, H.R. 1367 is the first step to ensuring a sufficient VA workforce is available to veterans for generations to come. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2138 March 16, 2017 
Thank you for your attention and assist-ance in this matter. Sincerely, Sincerely, D
AVID P. R OE, M.D., Chairman. 
Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-port of H.R. 1367. I would like to thank the gentleman from Ohio, first of all, as an incredibly important Member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Com-mittee, a doctor himself and, as impor-tant, a colonel in the United States Army and the United States Army Re-serve. An incredible insight into the very issues we are addressing and, I think, bringing this bill right now, we had a very good debate on fixing the VA, moving them in the right direc-tion. And this piece of legislation is in-credibly spot-on about another piece of that accountability. Dr. W
ENSTRUP ’s bill will help the VA better understand its staffing short-ages, and I think this is important. We all say 45,000 openings or whatever; it is important for us to know, do we need to hire all 45,000 of those; which ones are critical; which ones can be done faster. So that piece is common sense. It develops an executive management fellowship program that will allow the VA to send its leaders to the private sector to learn best practices and vice versa; again, incredibly smart, wel-come change. It will allow the VA to develop tech-nical advancements, so employees who are in a specific field can advance in title and salary, without moving to a management role. Quality hiring, training, and reten-tion starts with a good HR department. This legislation will provide critical re-search into best HR practice and then provide the training to VA HR man-agers. These provisions, along with other hiring authorities, will help the VA get the right people in the door. Currently, as the gentleman said, the process is slow, cumbersome, and, quite honestly, I think it just burns people out before they get there. And these are really dedicated folks who want to serve. I have a gentleman I have become ac-quainted with who is a nationally re-nowned cardiac surgeon who left a very lucrative private practice to go to the VA after his son was wounded in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghani-stan, and chose to do his part by going back into the VA system. He mentioned how cumbersome it was. He mentioned some of the bureau-cratic troubles that he had, and all he wanted to do was bring an incredible skill set to serve those who served us; and Mr. W
ENSTRUP ’s bill does exactly that. I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and ask that consider-ation in support of the amendments be brought forward, be considered. Each of these amendments will improve on a really good piece of legislation, im-prove the Secretary’s ability to re-cruit, train, and retain a quality work-force. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to take a second here to thank the ranking member for his hard work and putting forth many of the ideas that are in this bill and working with us, and thank him for his service to our country in the military and the high rank that he achieved, and bring-ing those experiences to us. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ ). Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank, certainly, Dr. W
ENSTRUP , for bringing forward this bill, and also the ranking member here for good bipartisan work. 1978 was a good year. I was playing soccer at the AYSO as a young, 11- year-old kid. It was also a good year because that was the last time the civil service had a total revamp of its sys-tem. It has been that long since civil service has had this type of reform, and we are looking, on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, to take what is being done here in a good, bipartisan way, and try to institute some of these good best practices into the broader Federal Government. The current hiring process is far too long and far too complex. We want to ensure the Federal Government re-mains a competitive employment op-tion. We also want to make sure, par-ticularly at the VA, that the depart-ment has the necessary data to make smart hiring decisions and ensure im-portant positions are filled. This bill will allow technical experts to earn promotions without having to necessarily go into the management track, which is very important. For some of the skill sets, you don’t have to be in management if you are pro-viding a skill that is so imperative to making sure we take care of our vet-erans. The bill also allows for a fast-tracked reemployment of former VA employees who have a proven record of success at the agency. We get some people trained up, maybe they go and do something else, we ought to give the people prior-ities in coming back as well, to make sure that we have the most qualified Federal workers who are taking care of the people who have taken care of us. They did the heavy lifting for this country, and they deserve better, and we can do better by them. A big part of that would be passing this bill, H.R. 1367. So, again, I want to thank Mr. W
ENSTRUP for his leadership. I am glad this is moving forward, and I stand in support of the bill. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, before I yield to the gentleman from Florida, I would like to point out, as a new Mem-ber bringing new vitality and new blood to this, how encouraging it is, both to me and, I would hope, to his constituents. Seeking out ways to serve veterans, coming to try and work on legislation in a bipartisan manner speaks volumes for his commitment. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, we send our servicemen and -women overseas in harm’s way to protect our country be-cause we know that freedom isn’t free. So it is fundamental, as we, with such vigor, ask them to go to the battle-field, that we protect them when they are off the battlefield. And it is funda-mental that, when they return, they have a world-class hospital system. Now, today we begin consideration of H.R. 1367, which is exciting because it is a bipartisan bill to improve the VA’s authority to hire, train, and retain physicians and other critical staff in the Veterans Health Administration. Over the last 5 years, we have seen more than 2 million veterans enroll in the VA healthcare system, and we be-lieve—both parties believe that noth-ing should stand in the way of any vet-eran having confidence in and access to care and benefits they earned and de-serve. I represent the central Florida area, and we are so honored to have a brand new Orlando VA, in a high-growth area, and the need is great. I was also hon-ored to be able to have an office right across the street from the VA hospital that we just opened up last week, to be in proximity and to help our veterans. But I can tell you, having met with some of our veterans already, we are looking at 3- to 6-month waits, even in a new facility. A gentleman, who I will refer to as Mr. Smith so that I don’t divulge his personal information, came to me yes-terday, and he had issues with a podia-trist. He was not able to see them over the next couple of weeks. And in his goat farm in my district, he is unable to pursue his gainful employment, and we are trying to get him in over the next 2 weeks, but it could be 3 to 4 weeks. So we need to stand together to re-store trust and accountability and fill these positions. And so I applaud both parties, and I am excited for the Vet-erans’ Affairs Committee to take this bold action to recruit and retain the most talented workforce, which is well- needed to provide quality and timely medical care for our Nation’s veterans, for those in central Florida, Florida, and beyond. b1830 Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chair, before I re-serve the balance of my time, I would like to point out to the gentleman from Florida that he has a podiatrist right here in Dr. W
ENSTRUP , so we can just solve the problem as we stand. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. P
OLIQUIN ), who has been a very vocal supporter of our veterans every step of the way. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chair, I would like to point out for the R

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2139 March 16, 2017 
both Mr. W ALZand Mr. W ENSTRUP are both veterans, and we are so grateful for their service to our country in so many different ways. Mr. Chair, it was our first com-mander-in-chief, George Washington, who said, and I paraphrase, that we can never expect young men and women to rise to the occasion to fight for our country and for our freedom unless we take care of those who have already sacrificed on the battlefield. So the wonderful thing about serving on the Committee for Veterans Affairs, Mr. Chair, is that it is completely bipar-tisan. This is all about our veterans. We just love them in the State of Maine— 66,000 veterans strong in our Second District of Maine, Mr. Chair. We have one of the highest percentages of our population that are veterans in the country, and we are very, very proud of that. I must say that, in my dealings with Togus—which is, by the way, Mr. Chair, the first military hospital in the country. It is about 150 years old now. They set up to take care of our Civil War veterans about 150 years ago. In any event, in talking with the folks at Togus, they made it very clear to me, Mr. Chair, that one of their big-gest problems they have, and it is on-going, is: How do we hire quickly and retain the best quality doctors, nurses, and medical technicians to care for our heroes? That is why I am so excited and grateful for this opportunity to vote for H.R. 1367, because it helps solve one of these problems. It removes red tape in the hiring process. It streamlines the hiring process. The Veterans Administration has about 360,000 employees, so it is a very large organization. When that happens, of course, you need to deal with admin-istrative burdens and red tape and what have you. So I am encouraging all of my fellow colleagues here, Republicans and Democrats, to make sure they vote for this bill, H.R. 1367, because our best fought for us, Mr. Chair, our best fought for us. It is time that our best take care of those who fought for us. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers and will be prepared to close after the gentleman is done. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chair, once again, I encourage all Members to sup-port H.R. 1367, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chair, I can’t thank the gentleman enough—smart legisla-tion combining many good ideas, will-ingness to incorporate those best prac-tices, and then, I think, forcing VA to start moving in that direction. This is an example, I think, of where the VA is at. And while we may dis-agree, and you saw a little bit of it today, it is not because there is any disagreement on what the final out-come is. Dr. W ENSTRUP ’s bill is smart. It will improve care; it will get good people in the VA; it will retain them; and it will improve HR practices to make sure that happens. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill and some of the amendments that will work to improve upon a very good piece of legislation. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general de-bate has expired. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. P
OLIQUIN ) having assumed the chair, Mr. B
UDD, Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1367) to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the Department of Vet-erans Affairs, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF LOUISE HOPKINS UNDERWOOD (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy of Louise Hopkins Underwood, a west Texas icon who passed away Tuesday, March 7, at the age of 97. Mrs. Underwood was known as a charismatic woman with a sharp sense of humor. A woman loved by all, she was gracious, she was generous, and she was inspirational. Mrs. Underwood was the mother of six and a pioneer in her quest to pro-mote a passion for the arts and a stronger sense of community on the south plains. Our region, which has a rich history better known for farming and ranch-ing, is now also known for the arts, thanks to Mrs. Underwood. Ecclesiastes 7:1 says: 
A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth. 
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood. Thank you for your fragrant life and for leav-ing a legacy of a brighter, more color-ful west Texas. God bless the Underwood family. 
f 
CONDEMNING HEALTHCARE BILL (Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the healthcare bill that is currently mak-ing its way through the House. It is an attack on seniors that will raise New Jersey taxes, and I refuse to sit idly by. First, it includes a premium senior tax that would make older Americans pay five times more for their health care. Second, the plan before Congress takes aim at long-term care to support the elderly and disabled and could ulti-mately throw seniors out of nursing homes. Three out of five nursing home residents in New Jersey rely on Med-icaid to access long-term care. Finally, it is not only seniors who would be hurt. This bill is a new tax on all New Jersey residents. It cuts Med-icaid and leaves the State holding the bag for other States, and it puts addi-tional costs on New Jersey to confront healthcare challenges like the opioid crisis sweeping our State. We need a bipartisan fix to the Af-fordable Care Act. This plan does just the opposite. I am ready to sit at the table with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to come up with a real fix. f 
BILLIONAIRE’S BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. B
UDD). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentle-woman from Washington (Ms. J
AYAPAL ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks and include extra-neous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentle-woman from Washington? There was no objection. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, this evening I rise to speak on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I believe some of my colleagues will be joining me, to talk about the budget that has just been released by this President. I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, that while it is being called a skinny budg-et, we call it the billionaire’s budget. It is the same misguided, rambling, unfocused, bloated giveaway to rich and corporate interests that has been offered for years. My belief is that a budget is a state-ment of our values. This budget en-sures that the rich get richer at the cost of working people, the environ-ment, and the future of our country. Funding has been axed for nearly 20 agencies, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to the National Endowment for the Arts and the Na-tional Endowment for the Humanities. In addition to elimination of these im-portant agencies, the billionaire’s budget guts funding for several other important agencies. You can see here by this chart from The Washington Post exactly what is happening: the Environmental Protec-tion Agency chopped by 31 percent; the State Department cut by 29 percent; Agriculture cut by 21 percent, the Labor Department by 21 percent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2140 March 16, 2017 
And the cuts go on through every sin-gle agency of critical importance to the American people: Department of Health and Human Services, Com-merce, Education, Housing and Urban Development at a time when we have a tremendous housing crisis in this coun-try. Transportation, from a President who said that he was going to invest in our infrastructure, yet here you see that the Transportation budget has a 13 percent cut. Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the cost of security for the Trump Tower is $183 million a year. The budget for the National Endowment for the Arts is $148 million a year. There are some other cuts that we could do if we were that concerned, but let’s talk about housing. Housing ac-cess and affordability is squarely on the chopping block in this billionaire’s budget. With a $4.3 billion cut, HUD will lose its Community Development Block Grant program. Now, some people don’t know exactly what the Community De-velopment Block Grant program does; and, in fact, it sounded like Director Mulvaney didn’t know that either when he was asked about a critical pro-gram that is funded through this Com-munity Development Block Grant pro-gram, and that is funding for Meals on Wheels. There are communities across this country that fund their Meals on Wheels program, which is funding for meals for the elderly who cannot get to somewhere where they can get a meal, and so we take them a meal. That is Meals on Wheels, an incredibly bipar-tisan, beloved program. Unfortunately, that would go away because the CDBG program would be cut; and, therefore, the Meals on Wheels program would be cut. These programs are an integral part of building up our communities, both through affordable housing as well as through some of these critical pro-grams that go as wraparound services to affordable housing. The city of Seattle, which I rep-resent, is currently in a state of emer-gency due to its housing crisis. Right now, there are around 3,000 people ex-periencing homelessness in the city and nearly 10,000 in the surrounding areas—veterans, families, LGBTQ youth. This is unacceptable. Access to stable housing is absolutely critical to mak-ing sure that members of our commu-nity are safe and able to access the services they need to get back on track and live full lives. Let’s talk about Health and Human Services. The Department of Health and Human Services is facing an 18 per-cent cut to its funding, which could have devastating—and I am talking about life and death—consequences here, absolutely devastating impacts. It would decrease the funding for the National Institutes of Health, for can-cer and medical research, critical pro-grams that help us to figure out how we save lives in this country and actu-ally are part of the innovation that the United States offers. Gutting this fund-ing would put us at a grave disadvan-tage, and it would put people’s lives at risk. Transportation, another critical area that this President promised that he was going to invest in. He was going to make sure we were bringing forward jobs, that we were investing in our in-frastructure, our crumbling roads and bridges, making sure that we are in-vesting in critical transit and transpor-tation projects. But in this budget, the Transportation budget is facing a 13 percent cut. That is nearly half a bil-lion dollars from the TIGER grant pro-gram, which has allowed our country to carry out critical infrastructure im-provement projects not just in one kind of a city, not just in urban areas, but urban and rural areas alike. The billionaire’s budget would also cut funding to all new fully funded grant agreements, including some real-ly important projects in cities across the country. In Seattle, our critical streetcar project would be cut; and light rail ex-pansion, which we have been working on for years, the State has invested in a bipartisan way—when I was in the State senate, we actually passed a $15 billion transportation infrastructure package because we knew that we had to deal with the transportation infra-structure needs of business, of our com-munities across the State and the in-flux of people into our State. b1845 We agreed in a bipartisan way that this was something we needed to do. Part of that agreement included being able to fund the next phase of light-rail across our region. Our Sound Transit CEO, Peter Rogoff, calls this budget a ‘‘body blow.’’ I couldn’t agree with him more. We are looking at potentially a $7.7 bil-lion cut to Sound Transit. These are major transportation projects for our cities. They would cre-ate jobs, which is what this President said that he wanted to do, is create jobs. But by gutting these funds and gutting investment in transportation infrastructure, we will be stopping the very projects that are going to create those jobs and help our cities and rural areas make the necessary upgrades that they need to thrive. Mr. Speaker, one of the worst areas that is hit in this budget is the envi-ronment. This billionaire’s budget is an all-out assault on our environment and efforts to fund research and curb cli-mate change. President Trump has found ways to wreak havoc on our efforts to protect our planet by, in this budget, cutting climate research and protection funds to multiple departments. This isn’t just the Environmental Protection Agency, but we are talking also about NASA space exploration and many other areas that ensure that we pre-serve this planet for the next genera-tion. I have got a 20-year-old, Mr. Speaker, and when I was running for Congress, he said to me: Mom, you have got to work on climate change. It is one of the most important issues facing my generation. You are the stewards of our lands. If you don’t take care of this planet, then we won’t have anything left and my children won’t have any-thing left. This is my 20-year-old son telling me this. Mr. Speaker, I promised him I would do everything I can for his gen-eration and future generations to pro-tect our planet. Unfortunately, one of the biggest cuts in this budget is to the Environ-mental Protection Agency. This is a 32 percent cut to the Environmental Pro-tection Agency. This decimates all of our work on climate change, all of the research that we need to do so we know how to protect our climate, all of the work on environmental justice pro-grams, which is really essential when you think about who is taking the bur-den of climate change. It is our low-in-come communities, communities of color, and other vulnerable and marginalized communities. I have always believed that we should rename the EPA. Environmental Pro-tection Agency makes it sound like it is something off in the distance, like it is about something out there. But, in fact, what the Environmental Protec-tion Agency does is monitor our water so that we have clean water to drink and use. It monitors our air so that we have clean air to breathe and we don’t have asthma and other respiratory dis-eases that come with air that is so pol-luted that we can’t even survive in it. It ensures that we are protecting human health. We could rename the EPA the Agen-cy for Clean Water, Clean Air, and Human Health, and I think that that would cover a lot of what the EPA does. The EPA’s cut is going to result in 3,200 lost jobs. That is 20 percent of the department. Research programs would be discontinued both domestically and around the world, and programs like the Clean Power Plan and numerous restoration projects, including a crit-ical restoration project in the Puget Sound, the Puget Sound Restoration, would lose 93 percent of its funding. This is true of the Great Lakes region. There are places in Republican and Democratic districts across this coun-try that are going to suffer and see en-vironmental protection being rapidly undone. President Trump has made it pain-fully clear that he and his administra-tion are enemies not only of the envi-ronment, but of the science that tells us that yes, we must address climate change because it is real and it is man-made.

where we are as a country and what we must do in order to protect our envi-ronment. Let me talk about education for a second. With the appointment of Betsy DeVos to the Department of Education, President Trump has signaled that his administration has every intention of doing whatever they can to privatize our education system. The billionaire’s budget takes the first steps in that process. It increases charter school funding by $168 million and it adds $250 million to create a new, private school choice program. It cuts $3.7 billion in grants that go toward after-school programs, aid programs, and important teacher training. This budget would decimate Head Start. Head Start is a program that has been shown to be successful. When you invest early in kids’ education and you make sure that you give them that early support, it definitely has an im-pact in diminishing and breaking that school-to-prison pipeline. These are investments that save us money in the long run. Not only are they the most humane thing to do and the right thing to do, but they are ac-tually cost-effective programs that stop us from having to spend millions of dollars down the line when people can’t get a great public education. We should be investing in our public education program and making sure that we are helping kids to go all the way from early learning to higher edu-cation. That is the foundation of a great country, when we are educating and investing in our students to have that kind of a great education. Mr. Speaker, I see that my colleague from the Progressive Caucus is here. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. R
ASKIN ), the wonderful Represent-ative from that State, because I know he has got somewhere to go right after this. I invite him to come up here, and I thank him for his leadership on all issues constitutional and otherwise. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, we are so proud of the leadership Congresswoman J
AYAPAL is showing in both Wash-ington State and Washington, D.C., in resisting these terrible cuts to the do-mestic budget of the people of the United States, in showing leadership, also especially in defending American values when it comes to immigration and affording a refuge to people fleeing political and religious repression all over the world. She is a true leader and we are very proud of her. I am grateful that she is sharing a couple of minutes with me tonight to talk about the astonishing news of the day, which is the most dra-matic and draconian budget cuts of-fered perhaps in our lifetime to the do-mestic budget of the United States. It is going to take us many days— many weeks, indeed—to fully analyze what exactly will be axed with these budget proposals, but I wanted to start with a little exchange that took place today with Mick Mulvaney, who is leading the budget effort for the Presi-dent. He had a press conference and he was asked about the implications of these billions of dollars of cuts to Meals on Wheels. He was asked about one spe-cific program, and he had no problem basically casting Meals on Wheels to the curbside, saying: ‘‘It’s just not showing any results.’’ Which is why the Trump administration apparently feels good about slashing the domestic budg-et, including the community develop-ment block grants which help support Meals on Wheels across the country. Well, let’s just take this one tiny lit-tle example, then. Meals on Wheels ac-tually serves 2.4 million Americans be-tween the ages of 60 and 100. These are people who, for reasons of illness or physical infirmity or simply poverty, cannot go grocery shopping for them-selves or prepare meals for themselves. Why don’t we take a moment to praise the people at Meals on Wheels who actually do something construc-tive and patriotic for their country. They bring food to older people who might otherwise go without. You might say: Well, that is just kind of mushy-headed and soft-hearted. We are in the age of the budget ax. We need to destroy these domestic pro-grams that are a terrible burden on the taxpayers. Check out a 2013 review of studies on the issue of home-delivered meal pro-grams like Meals on Wheels. The study says that these programs ‘‘signifi-cantly improve diet quality, increase nutrient intake, and reduce food inse-curity and nutritional risk among par-ticipants. Other beneficial outcomes include increased socialization oppor-tunities, improvement in dietary ad-herence, and higher quality of life.’’ Well, maybe you don’t care about any of those things. Maybe you just consider about the bottom line. Consider this finding. These pro-grams are aligned with the Federal cost-containment policy to rebalance long-term care away from nursing homes to home and community-based services by helping older adults main-tain independence and remain in their homes and communities as their health and functioning decline. You see, for Mr. Mulvaney and Presi-dent Trump and the Cabinet of billion-aires and CEOs and ethically chal-lenged Russian-influenced corporate ti-tans, they don’t care about how the program is actually working right here in American communities. They don’t care about facts. We know they have contempt for facts, which is why they give us their alternative facts. They don’t care about studies and books because we know the Presi-dent is their leader and he doesn’t read books. They definitely don’t care about the elderly people who can’t make it to the grocery store or who can’t afford nutri-tious meals on their own. These are the same people, after all, that they pro-pose to throw to the curb on Medicaid, with their proposal released last week in the cloak of darkness to repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid and replace it with a monstrosity of a program which even their own Mem-bers can’t support. Under their plan, 14 million would lose their healthcare in-surance. Millions of elderly people would lose their insurance. Now, with this mean-spirited little proposal to take a relative crumb away from the community development block grant and from Meals on Wheels, they would deprive a lot of people even of a wholesome dinner delivered to their home. Why do they want to slash all of these programs across the board: the EPA, the State Department, the Agri-culture Department, the Labor Depart-ment, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Commerce De-partment, the Education Department, HUD, Transportation, Interior, and so on? Why? Well, the President has announced he wants to take $54 billion out of that slice of the pie for nondefense discre-tionary spending, which accounts for only 16 percent of the overall budget, and put that $54 billion directly into the Pentagon. Just to repeat, they want to take $54 billion out of the domestic budget, non-defense discretionary spending, and put it into the Pentagon for a military buildup. But for what? The world’s second largest military power is Russia. We outspend them 10 to 1. We are a giant and they are a dwarf. Vladimir Putin, in any event, is Don-ald Trump’s best friend, his BFF, his bosom buddy. The Trump-Putin rela-tionship may be the President’s most successful long-term relationship, at least politically speaking. All that money that goes to the Pen-tagon, why? What is it for? Is it pos-sible that Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump are thinking about a war drive? The President has tweeted about World War III in a very cavalier and flippant way. It is disturbing. Nobody really knows. But one thing we do know is that all of that money that goes over to the Pentagon, if history is any record, will be available for the belt-way bandits, the inside players with political influence and the mega cor-porations to go and make a buck off of the American taxpayer. We will strip it from the EPA, and we will strip it from the Department of State, and we will strip it from edu-cation and we will put it in the Pen-tagon, and that is where we know a lot of people are going to get rich. b1900 They are going from Meals on Wheels to deals on wheels. That is the name of the game. No more Meals on Wheels. It is all about deals on wheels. You have got to know the President, you have got to know the inside players in the

billionaire Cabinet, and then you can make some money. Who are they going to sacrifice for this operation announced this week? Well, it would take us all night to go through all of the domestic programs and projects that the American people depend on that are going to be sliced and diced because of this budget pro-posal, at least if it goes through. But let’s start with the National In-stitutes of Health, the NIH. The admin-istration proposes to cut nearly $6 bil-lion from the NIH—$5.8 billion they want to get rid of. Now, what is the NIH, which happens to be in my congressional district in Rockville—and I am so proud of that— where we have got doctors and nurses and researchers and scientists who are working every day as part of the insti-tutional world leader in biomedical re-search? This is an entity that supports hun-dreds of thousands of jobs. These cuts would devastate the NIH and their abil-ity to research lifesaving cures and treatments for diseases. What kinds of diseases are being treated there? I am not going to be able to go through all of them because there are hundreds of them that are being re-searched, where treatments are being developed, where patients are being seen, where progress is being made. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Agent Orange and dioxin, aging, alco-holism, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, ano-rexia, anthrax, antimicrobial resist-ance, anxiety disorders, aphasia, ar-thritis, assistive technology, asthma, attention deficit disorder, autism, autoimmune disease. That is just the A’s. Let’s keep going a little bit. Batten disease, biodefense, bioengineering, biotechnology, bipolar disorder, brain cancer, brain disorders, breast cancer, cancer, cannabinoid research, cardio-vascular, cerebral palsy, cervical can-cer, child abuse and neglect research, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, child-hood leukemia, chronic fatigue syn-drome, chronic liver disease and cir-rhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, climate change, climate-re-lated exposures and conditions, colorectal cancer, and on and on. That is just the A’s, the B’s, and the C’s. They want to cut $6 billion from the NIH, which is working to cure, address, study, and manage the diseases and the sicknesses that our people are dealing with; and just cavalierly they say they want to slash it so they can pour all of this money over to the military side for a reason unknown. When they came down with their ex-ecutive orders, which have now been struck down by multiple Federal Dis-trict Courts as unconstitutional, as a violation of the Establishment Clause, as a violation likely of due process and equal protection and so on, what they cited was 9/11 multiple times. They cited 9/11. The odd thing, though, was that the three source countries for the 9/11 hijackers—Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates—were left off their executive orders, even right up until today. Why? Some people say it is because Donald Trump has extensive business dealings with corporations and governments in those three countries. Nobody really knows. But they developed those or-ders, which the GOP proudly once called the Muslim ban, in response al-legedly to 9/11. Even if you could blame an entire people for the acts of indi-vidual terrorists, they didn’t do it. They turned to some other countries because that didn’t interfere with the President’s business interests. So we have got this huge military buildup and we have got the siphoning away of tens of billions of dollars of the American people’s hard-earned money away from medical research and dis-eases and environmental protection all into the Pentagon. For what reason, nobody knows, and they haven’t told us. What a dangerous moment this is in the life of the American Republic. What a perilous time this is for a na-tion built on the principle that that great Republican President Abraham Lincoln called government of the peo-ple, by the people, and for the people. Their budget proposal is a job killer. It is going to kill hundreds of thou-sands of jobs. It devastates and ruins the search for cures, the progress we are making in diseases like cystic fi-brosis and diabetes. Diseases that af-flict hundreds of thousands, millions of our people, they are just going to pull the plug on that. They are ransacking our children’s education. They are hollowing out the rural communities. They are making urban life far more dangerous. They are weakening our leadership overseas. And, of course, be-cause they don’t believe in climate change, they are undermining our abil-ity to respond to the great peril that faces us as a people. Just like the proposal to trash the Affordable Care Act cannot go through this body because there must be a ma-jority of responsible Members of this body who will not accept that terrible proposal that will throw 24 million of our people off their insurance, this body also cannot accept this terrible budget. It must have arrived here DOA. If a foreign government, a rival to America, an enemy of America, had come up with this budget, we would re-gard it as an act of aggression against the American people. You could view it as a declaration of war against the prosperity, the health, and the welfare of our own people. But, alas, it didn’t come from abroad. At least it was ad-dressed that it came from the White House. It appears to have come from the administration, yet it threatens our way of life. I would urge all of my colleagues to very carefully study this budget pro-posal over the next week or two and make clear that these are not the pri-orities of the American people, make clear that these are not the values of the American people, and this is not the future of the American people. We must continue to make progress. That means we must reject the Trump budg-et. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative R
ASKIN for his con-sistent brilliance and leadership. I so appreciate it. It has been a tremendous honor to serve with him here. I want to talk about another area that we haven’t covered yet, which is the State and development programs budget. This is essentially our efforts around diplomacy and development around the world. This would be in-credibly hard hit. The prime target is the United Nations. Climate change initiatives at the United Nations would lose all of their funding. The govern-ment would cut back its regular con-tribution to the U.N. and pay no more than 25 percent of the cost of U.N. peacekeeping operations. The budget would hit all of the multilateral devel-opment banks, like the World Bank, which would be trimmed by $650 mil-lion over 3 years, and cultural pro-grams like the East-West Center in Honolulu. Today a number of Republican col-leagues talked about how misguided this cut was, and it made me very hopeful, to be honest. Representatives H
ALROGERS and T EDYOHOboth agree that this cut is absolutely misguided. Several retired three- and four-star generals wrote a letter to Congress ex-pressing their deep concern over these serious budget cuts that are being made to the State Department because they know that diplomacy goes hand in hand with any kind of defense that has to be put out there. You have got to have the two together. Here is what they said: ‘‘The State Department, USAID, Millennium Challenge Corpora-tion, Peace Corps and other develop-ment agencies are critical to pre-venting conflict and reducing the need to put our men and women in uniform in harm’s way.’’ In 2013, General Mattis himself said that if more funding for development wasn’t provided, he would have to buy more bullets. Development programs are inextricably linked with our na-tional security, and this President should not be cutting these funds if he wants to bolster national security. If he wants to bolster national security, then we should be investing more of our dollars into diplomacy and devel-opment as two of the other legs of a three-legged stool. Unfortunately, he is going in the opposite direction. Our aid and development efforts have to be well-rounded and holistic. I know this because I have worked in inter-national development before all over the world. I have worked along the bor-ders of Laos and Cambodia, in Thai-land. I have worked across south Asia. I have worked in Latin America. I know and I understand that our rela-tionships and our ability to build

strong multilateral coalitions and to invest in the stability of countries as war is happening there is absolutely es-sential to preserving peace. The generals wrote: ‘‘We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises our nation faces do not have military solutions alone—from con-fronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle East and north Afri-ca to preventing pandemics like Ebola. . . .’’ This 29 percent cut is absolutely un-acceptable and will not keep us safe. The billionaire’s budget doesn’t just cut funding for these programs, though. It also increases spending, and not for the benefit of our communities. This administration is calling for $3 billion to detain more immigrants, de-port more people, and build a bigger border wall. The staggering increase to detain an unprecedented 45,700 men and women is unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, 167 men and women have died in detention since October 2003. The organization that I used to work at put out a human rights abuses report about the detention center con-trolled by the GEO corporation, private detention center way back in 2005 or 2006. We looked at all of the human rights abuses that were happening not only in that detention center, but we did research on what was happening around the country. Among the 35 death reviews in this recent report that came out that have been released through Freedom of In-formation Act requests, substandard medical care contributed to at least 15 deaths. And even when government in-vestigations concluded that a facility violated government detention stand-ards, the government fails to hold these private facilities accountable and make sure that changes are made to address deficiencies that lead to the loss of human life. Instead of spending $3 billion on im-migration enforcement and detention, here is what we could do with that money: We could create 45,000 new mid-dle class jobs. We could build 184 new elementary schools. We could hire about 55,000 new kindergarten and ele-mentary schoolteachers. We could pro-vide close to 337,000 Head Start slots for young kids. We could pay for nearly 311,000 people to attend a 4-year college per year. We could help States protect and save up to 12,000 at-risk wildlife and plant species in the United States every year for the next 2.3 years. By the way, we could also provide nearly 2.1 million households with solar en-ergy. We could weatherize over 460,000 homes nationwide, saving the average household about $283 a year. And we could provide 10 million lifesaving HIV/ AIDS treatments. Mr. Speaker, this budget is about profit over safety, privatization over public good. It is about war over peace and diplomacy. And it is about incar-ceration over rehabilitation. It is fun-damentally about billionaires and lob-byists over the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

b1915 RECOGNIZING VICTOR MARX The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. G
ALLAGHER ). Under the Speaker’s an-nounced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. F
RANKS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-ignee of the majority leader. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speak-er, Mr. Victor Marx is a man dedicated to spreading the great truth that even in the face of hate and violence, the love of God can heal even the most wounded among us. Victor’s full life story has been chronicled in the book ‘‘The Victor Marx Story’’ and in a film by the same name. Victor’s animating, faith-motivated, moral imperative to help the suffering has fueled the mission of All Things Possible to free children from abuse and the effects of its trauma. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to commend Victor Marx and All Things Possible Min-istries for the work they do to reach out and embrace traumatized individ-uals across the world. In 2015, All Things Possible launched high-risk missions to bring hope to those suffering abuse at the hands of evil in the Middle East. Victor and his team, including Dave Eubank of Free the Oppressed, visited Iraq to help over 300 young women and children who were previously held captive or trau-matized by the violence of ISIS. In an effort to provide children with tangible comfort, ATP launched the Lions and Lambs project. More than 11,000 little boys and girls have re-ceived stuffed animals that play cul-tural songs and prayers in a language native to their region. These signs of huggable hope remind them that they are not forgotten by the outside world. In 2016, Victor and his team initiated efforts to find persecuted Christian families in northern Iraq and move them to safe havens in neighboring countries. To date, ATP has relocated more than 40 individuals specifically targeted by ISIS for elimination, giv-ing them hope for a safer, better life, and restoring their faith in the human spirit. Last year, ATP launched the third option with the goal of offering con-crete alternatives to those vulnerable to ISIS recruitment. ATP unites with moderate leaders of the Islamic faith to pursue this goal. Recognizing Victor as a man of the book, a key leader of the Sunni Endowment is now working with ATP to craft a common narrative designed to prevent men of military age from being assimilated into ISIS. Mr. Speaker, the prophet Isaiah said: The wolf also shall lie down with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. Victor Marx and All Things Possible Ministries have brought this powerful ministry to life in a very touching way. It should encourage all of us to relent-lessly pursue that day when the light of hope will fall across all of the lonely faces of God’s children all over this world and to that time when future generations, of those whom Jesus called the least of these our brothers and sisters, will be able to walk in the sunlight of liberty for as long as man-kind inherits the Earth. Mr. Speaker, I commend Victor Marx and All Things Possible, and I thank them for trying to make a better world. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

DISMANTLING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B
LU-
MENAUER ) for 30 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this has been a fascinating 2 weeks here on Capitol Hill. We have had, last week, all night sessions in our Ways and Means Committee and on the En-ergy and Commerce Committee dealing with the Republican plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. At times, Mr. Speaker, it is really hard to process all of the claims and counterclaims that are going on. I feel occasionally like I am in an alternative universe, and it is not just because we were up until 4:30 in the morning debating this. People have lost track of how we got to this point—what was happening ear-lier, what has been the benefit and ac-complishment of the Affordable Care Act, and what is going to happen mov-ing forward were we to adopt a really disastrous proposal advanced by my Republican friends. Twenty-five years ago, I was in a dif-ferent role as Portland’s commissioner of public works. And one of the ele-ments in my portfolio for several years was to deal with personnel and benefits and health care. I am fully aware of trying to deal with our 6,000 employees to provide them with affordable health care that the city, as the employer, could afford, and that wasn’t too bur-densome on our employees. We were caught in a situation with rapidly esca-lating costs, inflation for medical care twice the rate of the ordinary infla-tion; we were having problems with employers maintaining coverage in an affordable fashion; and the individual market was, frankly, very chaotic and troublesome. I have with me here a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation from March of 2009. They talked about these chal-lenges—how the United States healthcare spending had risen from 1970 from 7.2 percent of the gross domestic product to where they projected that it was going to cost us by 2018, next year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2144 March 16, 2017 
It would be $4.3 trillion, $13,100 per resi-dent, and account for over 20 percent of the gross domestic product. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that, as a result of the unprecedented reforms that were incorporated in the Affordable Care Act, we were able to deal with this problem. We began 10 years ago, when Democrats gained con-trol of Congress, working on expansion of the CHIP program, children’s health, and it was one of the first actions signed into law by President Obama when he assumed office and we weren’t facing a veto from the Bush adminis-tration. We have been working for over 3 years trying to lay the foundation for moving forward with a comprehensive approach for healthcare reform. And it should be noted, for all of the hyper-bole about socialized medicine and gov-ernment dictating outcomes and tak-ing control away from the American people, that is the furthest thing from the truth. In fact, the program that was devel-oped by President Obama and the Democrats, with no help from Repub-licans, was actually a middle ground. It relied upon the private insurance that most Americans had through work, and be able to expand that coverage, to be able to improve the quality of care, to be able to rein in medical inflation, to be able to deal with some of the most needy of us, and to be able to have a healthcare system that performed bet-ter. The simple fact is we spend about twice as much as any other developed country in the world. And our out-comes, on average, are worse than what happens in those countries that my friends on the other side of the aisle derided—Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany. As a practical mat-ter, those people get sick less often, they get well faster, they live longer, and they do so for a fraction of what we pay. So what we did, through a very ex-tensive process—multiple public hear-ings, meetings, seminars, position pa-pers that were generated from a wide variety of areas—was to assemble a program to deal with that. One of the elements that drew the scorn of my Re-publican friends, and, in fact, is part of their repeal that is one of the center-pieces, is to repeal the mandate that people have health care. It is ironic that that has become a target from Republicans because the mandate came from Republican alter-natives to HillaryCare in the Clinton administration. In fact, 19 Republican Senators, including Senator G
RASSLEY  and Senator H
ATCH , supported a healthcare mandate to be able to ex-pand and stabilize the health insurance market. Well, what we have done through those 2 years that it was enacted, March 23, 2010—we are approaching the seventh anniversary—it went live in the fall and was fully in effect in 2014. So in the 3 years that the Affordable Care Act has been in place, it has had remarkable achievements. You recall I mentioned what the studies showed that we were facing with rapidly escalating healthcare costs, where it was estimated that we would be having over 20 percent of the gross domestic product, we would be approaching over $13,100 per resident. Well, that didn’t happen. Despite the dire predictions of the Republican op-position, healthcare costs did not sky-rocket. In fact, we anticipate now that in-stead of being over $13,000 per resident, it is under $10,000 after a couple years of operation of the Affordable Care Act. Not over 20 percent of the gross domes-tic product, but 18 percent. We have found that these are the lowest rates of medical inflation since we have been keeping track. The Affordable Care Act, by any stretch of the imagination, has been a success. We have seen coverage expand dramatically to the lowest rate of un-insured in the United States in our his-tory while we have contained costs. That success is all the more remark-able because there has been a concerted effort on the part of the Republicans, from the moment they seized control of the House in 2011, to make it worse. Bear in mind, the Republicans at-tacked the Affordable Care Act in court, on the floor of the House, and in terms of trying to muddy the waters on the State level. The Supreme Court challenge to the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act failed. The Su-preme Court decided that the Afford-able Care Act was constitutional and would remain. But the Supreme Court made a dev-astating decision that allowed indi-vidual States to opt out of Medicaid ex-pansion. That was part of the program that was so important to be able to ex-tend care on a cost-effective basis to some of the lowest income people in the country. Thirty-one States did. Nineteen States refused to do so. That undercut the coverage, made huge problems, created situations where there were people in the Republican- controlled States that refused to ex-tend Medicaid, despite the fact that the Federal Government was paying for it, that we had people who were too poor to qualify for assistance. Shocking, embarrassing, and to the detriment of those States, they had much worse out-comes. But it is ironic that some of the peo-ple who started attacking the Congres-sional Budget Office projections about the impact of the Republican plan pointed to the calculation on the part of the CBO that they underestimated the number of people who would be un-insured. b1930 Well, that was precisely because there was no expectation that States would not expand Medicare, and if that unfortunate decision hadn’t been made, we would, in fact, have seen them hit their target numbers. Despite the claims of outrage on the Republican side that there would be employers dropping coverage for their employees en masse, we found that, in the main, employers retained coverage. Now, this is not the case going forward with the Republican proposal. I think there was a reason why my Republican friends insisted on jam-ming this through the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Com-merce Committee before we had a chance for the scorekeeper, the CBO, to give the results of their analysis: be-cause they knew how bad it would look. The CBO anticipates that there will be 14 million more uninsured Ameri-cans, including 2 million who will lose coverage provided by their employer because of the way their alternative tax credit for health insurance would be structured. In my State, it is esti-mated that as many as 465,000 Orego-nians could lose coverage. The unin-sured rate will triple in our State. One of the areas that has been most successful with the Affordable Care Act has been for older Americans. They benefit from the protections against discrimination, and they are going to see a return to much higher premiums and higher costs. The Republican plan would take the requirement that seniors pay no more than three times the rate of insurance for premiums for younger people, that will be five times greater. And instead of the subsidy that is based on income, there will just be a flat subsidy across the board. This means, in practice, that older Americans are going to face steeply higher premiums, and they are going to pay far more out-of-pocket be-cause of the less generous subsidy. One example that ought to get, I think, everybody’s attention: In 2026, a 64-year-old with an income of about $26,500 would pay $14,600 for their health insurance as opposed to $1,700 today, an increase of almost $13,000. Now, there are winners and losers under the Republican approach. The healthy, young people will catch a break, but older Americans will pay a lot more at precisely the time when they need health insurance. Now, our Speaker appeared to be con-fused when he was describing the dif-ference between the Republican ap-proach and the Affordable Care Act, when he talked about how all of these people are being subsidized by the ma-jority, who aren’t sick. As many com-mentators rushed to point out to the Speaker, that is what insurance is about. Many people pay some to sub-sidize those who suffer loss. You pay a couple of hundred dollars a year for auto insurance so that, when you have a $10,000 loss, that is picked up by the people who don’t suffer a loss but paid the premiums nonetheless. Think about what the Republicans have put in place. They are doubling down on what the Trump administra-tion has done trying to discredit the ef-ficacy of the program, casting it in

doubt. The administration has already stopped enforcing the mandate. The IRS is supposed to check and en-force to make sure that people sign up for the ACA and everybody is part of the insurance pool, just like States have mandatory auto insurance. You are not allowed to run the risk of harming your fellow motorists by not having insurance. That is widely ac-cepted and understood that it is nec-essary to have the system work right. Now the Republicans are increasing the damage that Trump has imposed, unilaterally, by not enforcing the man-date. They are going to repeal the man-date. In place of the mandate, they are going to have a 30 percent surcharge in case people drop coverage and decide to reenter the insurance pool. Well, think about that for a moment. The people who are young, healthy, who feel invincible and don’t have healthcare problems now are very like-ly not to get insurance at all. They fig-ure that when they get sick, they can go ahead, pay the 30 percent premium. If they find out they have got cancer, some serious disease, then they can sign up later. It is designed to desta-bilize the insurance system that we have. By the same token, we are looking at the other end of the spectrum where the people who are lower income, older, and sick are going to pay a dispropor-tionate burden. That is why the CBO determined, in their analysis, that in 2026, actually, there will be a drop in terms of insurance premiums, in terms of the cost. They will start to go down. They will go down because older Amer-icans will be unable to afford the pre-mium. They will drop the coverage. It is not that they don’t need health care. It is not that they are going to somehow avoid becoming sick or hav-ing accidents, but they are not going to have insurance coverage. That means the care that many of them are going to experience will be what we were fighting against before the Affordable Care Act. It will be in the emergency room. It will be when it is too late. It is not in a clinic before things get worse. It is after the fact, and it is in a setting that is not nearly as effec-tive. Mr. Speaker, it is really dis-appointing that part of the assault is on the Medicaid program itself. Med-icaid is this program that provides care to the elderly, disabled, pregnant women, children, poor people. It is part of the bedrock safety net of this coun-try. Republicans were against the ex-pansion of Medicaid and making the qualifications to have Medicaid be more generous. Under the Affordable Care Act, it is 138 percent of poverty, so lower and middle-income families are able to ac-cess this care. Prior to that, there were widely varying requirements across the country, and many of the States, par-ticularly in the South, the States that declined to expand Medicaid, were fac-ing really onerous restrictions—$10,000, $12,000, $7,000 family income—making it very, very hard and for only the most desperately poor to qualify for it. Now, the Republican plan will elimi-nate the Medicaid expansion in its cur-rent form. It would cap Medicaid fund-ing, and, ultimately, we are going to watch, reverting to what we had be-fore—in effect, de facto rationing. In Oregon, the Republican plan would shift $2.5 billion back to the States over the next 6 years. States are going to be left with impossible decisions: re-ducing benefits, cutting people off of Medicaid. This is what has happened histori-cally when people ran into difficult fi-nancial times in the States. They didn’t raise taxes to make sure that the poor were provided coverage; they cut back coverage even more. Sadly, under the Republican plan, 14 million Americans would lose Medicaid coverage by 2026, and it would start having its impact in less than 3 years. The policy would also severely set back efforts to combat opioid addiction and improve mental health treatment. In my community, as I visit health centers, find out what is going on in clinics, in local government, officials that deal with the homeless, the drug addicted, the mentally ill, we found that they are using the opportunity to enroll people in Medicaid to give them proper care and not put that burden on local governments that they simply can’t cope with. The Republican plan would prevent that. We won’t be able to have people most in need provided with the mental health, the addiction services, the health care that they need. The Republican plan would put 2.8 million people with substance dis-orders, including over 200,000—about 220,000 is the estimate that I have seen—with opioid disorders, at risk of losing their coverage, including the coverage of addiction treatment, con-tinuing the tragic cycle that we see played out in our streets across the country, but particularly in Appa-lachia. Some of the areas that actually were most opposed to the Affordable Care Act have received the greatest benefit. In a time of concern about budget deficits, repealing the Affordable Care taxes—which we approved in the Ways and Means Committee in the middle of the night last week—would create an immediate windfall tax cut for the highest American taxpayers. The Af-fordable Care Act was a balanced plan that actually reduced the deficit while it improved healthcare outcomes across the country. This approach is going to provide— for example, the top 400 earners would see an average tax break of about $7 million a year, and people who are mil-lionaires will be receiving tax cuts averaging $57,000 apiece; but, as it plays out, we will find taxes would raise significantly on about 7 million low- and moderate-income families. Mr. Speaker, it also puts in jeopardy Medicare coverage for 57 million Amer-icans by cutting the Medicare trust fund resources. Because of the total impact of what we have done with the Affordable Care Act, we have watched the Medicare trust fund have its life extended 2 years. The Republican tax proposal will cut $170 billion from the Medicare trust fund, moving it closer to being insolvent. It is fascinating. Donald Trump promised not to touch Medicare or Medicaid. This plan violates both those promises. And as I had mentioned, the Trump promise that everybody would be covered under the Republican plan rings false. That is simply not the case. Mr. Speaker, it was interesting, in the course of our deliberations, we re-ceived correspondence from the Amer-ican Association of Retired Persons. They represent 38 million members in all 50 States, in the District of Colum-bia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Is-lands. It has a proven track record of being nonpartisan, a nationwide orga-nization that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities for older Americans. They have a wide range of issues for which they have championed and gained notoriety; but, most significantly, we have watched them be involved with healthcare deci-sions, and they have been proven non-partisan. In fact, I took issue with them when we were dealing with the Medicare part D prescription drug pro-gram in 2004. b1945 It was unfortunate, I thought, that they kind of threw their weight to an inadequate program that was not paid for, that added to the deficit, and didn’t do anything to fight to reduce prescription drug costs. But they made the judgment that this was the best they could do for the people they rep-resented, and they didn’t hesitate for a moment to work with Republicans to be able to enact that. They wrote on March 7 to the chairs of our Energy and Commerce Com-mittee and our Ways and Means Com-mittee to express their opposition to the American Health Care Act. They did so because it would weaken Medi-care’s fiscal sustainability. They said it would dramatically increase the healthcare cost for Americans age 50 to 64 and put at risk the health care of millions of children and adults with disabilities and poor seniors who de-pend on Medicaid programs for long- term services, supports, and other ben-efits. They have long fought to protect Medicare, and they pointed out in their correspondence that the 2016 Medicare trustee report said that the Medicare part A trust fund is solvent until 2028. This is 11 years longer than the projec-tion immediately before the Affordable Care Act. Because of the changes in the Affordable Care Act, we gained sol-vency, 11 years longer. Now, they have serious concerns about the Health Care Act that re-pealed provisions that strengthen the

fiscal outlook, specifically the repeal of the .9 percent payroll tax on higher income workers. According to their analysis, this provision would hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish Medicare’s ability to pay for services in the future. Think about it, Mr. Speaker, we are dramatically increasing the number of uninsured Americans. We are going to give them more expensive insurance of a lower quality. They will have higher deductibles and copays. At the same time, we are jeopardizing the future of Medicare, which so many American seniors rely upon. They pointed out that about 6.1 mil-lion Americans age 50 to 64 purchase their insurance in the nongroup mar-ket, and that over half of them were el-igible to receive subsidies for health in-surance coverage. They note the sig-nificant reduction in the number of un-insured since passage of the ACA, with the number of people in that age brack-et dropping by half. Yet, according to CBO, what is going to happen if the Republican plan is en-acted, that that number is going to go back up again, it is going to be unaffordable for a number of seniors, and they are going to be paying a much higher cost. Mr. Speaker, it is troubling that we are having a debate where we really have tried to discredit independent sources, where we have had no hearing dealing with the legislation that is rushing toward the House floor. It is ironic that there was debate and discussion criticizing Democrats for the 3 years we spent developing the framework for moving the legislation forward. And after 6 years of my Re-publican friends being in power in the House, chipping away, undermining the Affordable Care Act, trying to make it worse, discrediting it, and voting over 60 times to repeal it, they do not have a plan in place to replace it. Now, this is the best we can come up with. It is a program that is widely dis-credited. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a constituent of mine who was recently awarded one of the highest honors in his in-dustry. Mr. Carl Swope, owner of Swope Toy-ota located in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, in my Congressional District, was named the 2017 TIME Dealer of the Year. The TIME Dealer of the Year award is one of the automobile in-dustry’s most prestigious and highly coveted honors. After graduating from Indiana University, Mr. Swope began working at his father’s car deal-erships. In 1986, Mr. Swope purchased his first dealership, a single store with 50 employ-ees. Today, Mr. Swope oversees six dealer-ships representing nine brands in Elizabeth-town and Radcliff, Kentucky, and employing over 300 associates. Mr. Swope is an active participant in the Elizabethtown community. He currently serves as a member of the Hardin County Chamber of Commerce, the Knox Regional Develop-ment Board, the Lincoln Heritage Council for the Boy Scouts of America, the Elizabethtown Tourism Commission, the Elizabethtown Air-port Board, and the Hardin Memorial Health Foundation Board. He also established a local affiliate for Habitat for Humanity and remains an active part of the organization. On behalf of all the constituents of Ken-tucky’s 2nd Congressional District, I congratu-late Mr. Carl Swope on being named the 2017 TIME Dealer of the Year. I wish him and the Swope family all the best.

RECOGNIZING ENDOMETRIOSIS AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, March is Endometriosis Awareness Month, where we recognize the impact this disease has on the quality of life for women throughout our coun-try. The lack of awareness about endo-metriosis creates an environment that delays treatment and grows the cost of care. This condition, in which the tissue that forms the lining of the uterus is found in areas out-side the endometrium, causes severe pain in the body. Endometriosis occurs in about one in ten women of reproductive age, and is most often diagnosed in women in their 30s or 40s. This disease can be treated with medication, surgery, or sometimes both. Roughly five million women in the United States suffer with endometriosis, costing an estimated $119 billion annually. It can take more than nine years, from the onset of symp-toms and visits to specialists, for women to re-ceive a diagnosis of endometriosis; and women with endometriosis are 1.35 times more likely to need surgery or stenting to open blocked arteries. The general lack of awareness about this disease can contribute to the unnecessary suf-fering of patients and the rising public costs of this disorder. We must help to bring aware-ness of endometriosis in order to foster the

HONORING ROTARY DISTRICT 7150 OF CENTRAL NEW YORK 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Rotary District 7150 of Central New York as it hosts Rotary International President- Elect Ian Riseley of Australia. This weekend, Rotary International Presi-dent-Elect Riseley will address incoming club presidents at the Multi-District President-Elect Training Seminar and People of Action Dinner in my district in Syracuse, New York. I am proud to see local members of Rotary District 7150 of Central New York honored during this, the centennial of the Rotary International Foundation. Rotary International is home to more than 35,000 clubs worldwide, including 43 clubs in District 7150 of Central New York. The Ro-tary’s mission of ‘‘service above self’’ is exem-plified in our local Rotary Clubs’ work assisting veterans in need, recognizing the hard work and success of high school students, restoring our prized parks and waterways, and partnering with local food pantries to reduce hunger throughout the 24th District. With over 1,200 Rotary members locally, Central New York is a better place because of the work these individuals do for our commu-nity. I applaud the members of Rotary District 7150 of Central New York for their service, fel-lowship, and passion.

JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Missouri Whitewater Cham-pionships celebrating their 50th year March 17 through 19, 2017. The races are held at the Millstream Gardens Conservation Area of the Saint Francis River near Fredericktown, Mis-souri. The Championships continue a tradition begun in 1968, when the first Saint Francis River Whitewater Slalom Race was held. Since then, the event has expanded its scope and attracts beginners and seasoned competi-tors from other states and countries. Even Olympic-class paddlers have used this race as training preparation for future Olympic Games. The event first begun by the Meramec River Canoe Club is now hosted by the Missouri Whitewater Association. It comes together as 100 volunteers set up the race course, provide safety, judge, time, and score the participants while hundreds of spectators cheer. For providing sportsmen with the thrill of competition on the Saint Francis River for half a century and enhancing tourism for Madison and surrounding counties through its annual Whitewater Championships, I am happy to congratulate the Missouri Whitewater Associa-tion today before the United States House of Representatives.

HONORING THE LIFE OF NILS MICHAEL DECKER 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and career of Mr. Nils Michael ‘‘Mike’’ Decker of Fresno. Mike Decker passed away on Tuesday, February 14, 2017 in Fres-no, California. Mike was a wonderful, kind man and a dedi-cated educator. Mike was born in Mt. Clemens, Michigan. His career in education began at St Alphonso’s School in Fresno, California followed by Orange Center School in Fresno. Mike then served 25 years as Principal and Superintendent at Laton Unified School District in Fresno County. In addition, Mike also served on my State Assembly Staff as District Director. In addition to his friends and family, Mike was adored by his students. Mike positively in-fluenced the lives of thousands of children with this commitment to education and he helped many young people reach for the stars. Nils Michael Decker is survived by his wife of 52 years, Diana Decker, his son, Timothy J. Decker, his son, Scott A. Decker and his wife, Maria and his daughter, Katherine Decker. He is also survived by his grandchildren, Michael Hill, Jadyn Garrett, Nicholas Decker and his great granddaughter, Neelia Grace Hill. Mike’s sister, Margo Bellman and his broth-er Gordon Decker both of Michigan also sur-vive him. I ask my colleagues to join me today in hon-oring the life and career of Nils Michael Deck-er, a hero to his family, a wonderful role model for educators and exemplary father, grand-father, great grandfather and friend. f

We have seen a sharp increase in racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, homophobia and other forms of discrimination across the world over the last year. Human rights violations emanating from racial prejudice and discrimi-nation have negatively impacted people of Af-rican descent around the world, resulting in ra-cial bias and disparities in education, employ-ment, health, housing, justice, and other sec-tors. We must act now to reverse these dis-turbing trends. The International Decade for People of African Descent provides an oppor-tunity to not only draw attention to these in-equities, but to also join efforts with countries around the globe to develop and implement national strategies honoring the vast contribu-tions of people of African descent and to com-bat continuing issues of prejudice and dis-crimination such as those currently gripping our nation. To aid these efforts, I have introduced the African Descent Affairs Act. The Act seeks to improve the situation of people of African de-scent around the world by establishing within our State Department a Global Office of Afri-can Descent Affairs to establish global foreign policy and assistance strategies for people of African descent; creating a ‘‘Fund’’ to support antidiscrimination and empowerment efforts by African descent led civil society organizations; and requiring Annual State Department Human Rights Reports to include a section on discrimination faced by people of African de-scent. I believe that U.S. foreign policy strate-gies such as these have improved the situa-tion of vulnerable groups internationally and would greatly assist in responding to increas-ing levels of prejudice and discrimination faced by people of African descent around the globe. The State Department has already launched many successful initiatives that have aided vulnerable populations, such as the Office of Global Women’s Issues, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, the Spe-cial Advisor for International Disability Rights, the Special Representative to Muslim Commu-nities, and the LGBT Global Equality Fund. Implementing a Global Office of African De-scent Affairs will continue this tradition and fa-cilitate the full and equal participation of peo-ple of African descent in society, promote knowledge of and respect for the diverse herit-age, culture and contributions of people of Af-rican descent, and strengthen and implement legal frameworks that combat racial discrimi-nation. Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my col-leagues will embrace the challenge of com-bating prejudice and discrimination across the

IN RECOGNITION OF THE BARNS AT HAMILTON STATION VINE-YARDS 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and commend my constituents, Andrew and Maryann Fialdini, and their win-ery, the Barns at Hamilton Station Vineyards, on receiving the Governor’s Cup in the 2017 Governor’s Cup Wine Competition. This win not only speaks to the hard work, entrepre-neurship and expertise of Andrew and Maryann, but also the growing and trans-forming Loudoun County wine industry. Since opening 8 years ago, their hard work has certainly come to fruition. Andrew, Maryann, and the vineyard’s Wine Maker, Mi-chael Shaps, have worked diligently to produce local, yet authentic-tasting, French- style wines on their eleven acre vineyard lo-cated in Hamilton, Virginia. And this year, two of their wines, the 2014 Meritage and 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon, were named gold medal-ists in the Governor’s Cup Wine Competition. The judges of this year’s competition re-viewed 494 bottles from 102 different wineries, and only 23 bottles were named gold medal-ists. Impressively of those 23 bottles, Andrew and Maryann’s 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon was named the best wine and awarded the Gov-ernor’s Cup—a recognition that a Loudoun winery has never before received in the 37 years of this stringent and prestigious competi-tion. Risk-taking small businesses have always been the life blood of the Loudoun County economy and our national economy and entre-preneurial families like the Fialdini’s have been leaders in fostering strong, local economies that will continue to thrive and grow for years to come. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Andrew and Maryann Fialdini and Michael Shaps for their successful small business and their special awards at the 2017 Governor’s Cup Wine Competition. I also wish them and their family the best in all of their fu-ture endeavors. HONORING THE SERVICE OF CHARLES HUNNICUTT HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Charles Hunnicutt for his out-standing work and to congratulate him on his retirement after 45 years of dedicated public service. Charles began his career with the United States Air Force, honorably serving his coun-try from June 1972 to June 1976. He was then hired to work for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a Criminal Investigations and Collec-tions Officer from 1976 to 1987. In 1988, Charles joined the Fresno County Department of Social Services and remained there until 2005. That same year, he was of-fered the position as Fresno County Veterans Service Officer. In 2010, Charles was asked to also serve as the Madera County Veterans Service Officer. Charles has remained with both counties and has served Fresno County Veterans and Madera County Veterans with great passion and honor. It is with great pleasure that I applaud Charles Hunnicutt for his many years of tire-less work on behalf of veterans and our com-munity. His ongoing dedication to public serv-ice is extremely commendable. Mr. Speaker, it should be noted that in addi-tion to his countless gifts to veterans and our community, Charles has been a true champion for my constituents where he serves on my 16th District Veterans Advisory Board and has assisted my staff with service academy nomi-nations. In my office, a majority of our con-stituent casework involves assisting veterans. These are sensitive cases that can sometimes take a great deal of time to resolve. Charles is someone that my staff and I can always count on to work together on behalf of vet-erans. I have personally worked with Charles for over 13 years in my capacity as a Member of Congress and I can proudly call him my friend. In his capacity as Veterans Service Officer, Charles is always available to discuss cases and work together on issues of concern. I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the commitment, dedication and success of Charles Hunnicutt and wish him well as he embarks on new endeavors.

BRAIN AWARENESS WEEK 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this week commemorates Brain Awareness Week, which presents an important opportunity to educate lawmakers, students, and the broader public about brain science, and its many impacts and benefits. This is critical when you consider that brain disorders and diseases affect the lives of nearly 100 million Americans—from Alz-heimer’s to ALS to mental illness. Neurological and neurodegenerative dis-orders are among the leading causes of dis-ability in the United States and around the world—greater than heart disease and cancer put together. As society ages, this number will increase exponentially as will the cost to the healthcare system and to the economy. Yet, the underlying causes of most neurological diseases remain unknown. Neuroscience is the next great frontier. Re-search and work being done in this field needs to be front and center in both the private world and Congress. The bipartisan Congressional Neuroscience Caucus’ mission is to build awareness of the intrinsic role brain research plays in under-standing ourselves and our society. As the Co-Founder and Co-Chair, I am committed to working on these important issues and hope my colleagues will join our efforts as members of the Congressional Neuroscience Caucus. f 
MR. JOSEPH ROBERGE 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Joseph Philip Roberge. Immediately fol-lowing his graduation from High School in 1942, Joseph enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps and became a Navigator on a B–17 bomber with the 398th Bomb Group located at Nuthampstead Air Base in England. Joseph flew 35 missions over Europe, in-cluding being part of air support at Omaha Beach on D–Day. Throughout his time in serv-ice, he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, European Theater of Operations Ribbon, two Bronze Stars, and Air Medal with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters. Our country owes a debt of gratitude to Jo-seph for his selfless actions taken to protect his homeland. It is important we honor these types of individuals as best we can and I hope that many will follow in his footsteps and give back to our country as graciously as he did. People like him are a rare breed and they help make not only our country, but our world a much safer and better place.

May the lives of those killed during the Vietnam War never be forgotten.

HONORING THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENTS OF MR. JIM PARDINI 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend, Jim Pardini of Pardini’s Banquet and Catering for being awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Central California Restaurant Association—Fresno Chapter. For the past thirty-six years, Pardini’s Banquet and Catering has dedicated their fa-cility to providing the utmost exquisite food service to all in the community. Jim is a pillar in the Central Valley, known not only for his success as a restaurateur, but also for his generous and giving spirit. Jim was born to Albert and Mary Jane Pardini in Santa Cruz, California. The Pardinis would make Fresno their home in 1952. Jim graduated from San Joaquin Memorial High School in 1964 and went on to earn his Bach-elor’s degree in Social Science from Fresno State in 1968. Following in the hard working footsteps of his father, Jim carried on the fam-ily restaurant business started in 1948 by Al. By 1981, Jim and his wife Marie opened Pardini’s Banquet and Catering and went on to acquire a Rubio’s and four Tony Roma res-taurants. Over time, Pardini’s Catering has be-come the well-respected caterer of the Big Fresno Fair, the Fresno Convention Center and Fresno State’s Bulldog Stadium. To further his statewide impact in the res-taurant industry, Jim helped to create the res-taurant Political Action Committee. Then, as the president of the California Restaurant As-sociation, he aided in developing the Grass-roots Program. Jim’s accomplishments created new ways for restaurant owners to truly con-nect with law makers in California. In addition to his impact on the restaurant industry, Jim has dedicated his time to philan-thropy work within the community. He is a longtime supporter of the Big Brothers Big Sis-ters Program and the Boys and Girls Club. In addition, he was presented with the honor of the Humanitarian of the Year Award from the Muscular Dystrophy Association. With his many accomplishments thus far, Jim’s suc-cess was fittingly recognized when he was in-ducted into the California Restaurant Associa-tion Foundation Hall of Fame. Through relent-less hard work and dedication, Jim Pardini continues to leave a substantial mark in the restaurant industry and within our community. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the lifelong achievements of Jim Pardini. I congratulate Mr. Pardini for this great achievement and ask that you join me in wishing him and his family continued success. f 
IN HONOR OF GARY SCHNIEDERS 
HON. ROD BLUM 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable teacher and citizen from Waterloo, Iowa. Mr. Gary Schnieders has taught History, Social Studies, and Economics at Waterloo Columbus Catholic High School for 39 years. Over those 39 years, Mr. Schnieders has made an enormous impact on the lives of his students and members of the community. Mr. Schnieders’s devotion goes beyond the classroom with his annual trip to the hallowed ground of Europe’s battlefields. This trip is no European vacation. Students walk the trench-es of the Western Front and explore battle-fields with a twelve-mile hike one day and twenty-mile bike ride another day. Prior to their departure, students are given reading as-signments and must complete a 20-page essay. While in Europe, the students have nightly homework assignments. This annual trip is highly anticipated and one that many Waterloo Columbus students work toward their entire high school career. The itinerary also includes visits to several American cemeteries and memorials honoring our fallen heroes, and a wreath-laying cere-mony at the Meuse-Argonne American Ceme-tery. On the final day, the students visit the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial where they clean the grave markers, plant an American flag, and lay a rose on the grave of every Iowan. At the end of the day, students lay their final wreath of the trip at Normandy as Taps sounds in the background. Upon their return to Iowa, the students give presentations to their families, fellow students, and residents of Waterloo and Cedar Falls, with a special invitation extended to the local Veteran community. Over the past 39 years, Mr. Schnieders has shown his students what cannot be taught in a classroom—the meaning of sacrifice and love of country. Today, we honor his devotion that extends far beyond the classroom and helps to ensure the preservation of American values for generations to come.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Robert Andeweg of Urbandale, Iowa, for being named the 2017 Forty under 40 Alumnus of the Year. Since 2000, Business Record has under-taken an exhaustive annual review to identify a standout group of young leaders in the Greater Des Moines Area that are making an impact in their communities and their careers. Each year, forty up-and-coming community and business leaders under 40 years of age are selected for this prestigious honor based on a combined criteria of community involve-ment and success in their chosen career field. Robert was a member of the 2002 class and has not only continued being an active mem-ber of his community but he has expanded upon it since being honored in 2002. Robert is known for being a leader within his community, which is why in 2005 he was elected Mayor of the City of Urbandale. He has been committed to overseeing the eco-nomic growth and development of Des Moines’ largest suburb. When Robert isn’t busy leading his community, he works as a lawyer at Nyemaster Goode P.C. He also works to improve his community by dedicating his time and serving on the Greater Des Moines Partnership Board, the Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Bravo Greater Des Moines Board and the Metropolitan Advisory Council. Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to rep-resent leaders like Robert in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I rec-ognize and applaud him for utilizing his talents to better both his community and the great state of Iowa.

After earning bachelor’s and master’s de-grees from Central Michigan University, French served as a public policy and environ-mental consultant before settling in Ishpeming and beginning his career with American Trans-mission Co. (ATC), a high-voltage electric transmission system company. As the external affairs manager for ATC, French contributes to Marquette County’s development by stream-lining and enhancing access to affordable electricity for hundreds of communities across Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. Having been with ATC for 16 years now, French is responsible for developing, coordinating, and managing re-lationships between ATC and the Michigan- based customers and stakeholders who make ATC’s work possible. French participates in numerous community development organizations and remains de-voted to improving American infrastructure and the quality of life in the Upper Peninsula. His commitment to economic development is ex-emplified through his service with Marquette County’s Economic Development Corp., Dick-inson Economic Development Alliance, and Operation Action U.P., where he works to identify and address regional opportunities that advance economic development in our state’s most rural areas. French also understands the importance of learning the skills needed to succeed in today’s economy. In conjunction with the Midwest Skills Development Center Advisory Board and NICE Community Schools, he has provided the guidance to equip the next generation of great leaders with the skills they need to succeed. French’s com-mitment to his profession, community, and neighbors has been essential to his success, and I am confident that he will continue to in-spire others in the community to take an ac-tive role in improving the quality of life in the Upper Peninsula. Mr. Speaker, French’s accomplishments in service to the Upper Peninsula cannot be un-derstated, and his family and community can take pride in knowing that Northern Michigan is a better place thanks to his work. On behalf of Michigan’s First Congressional District, I congratulate Mr. Brett French and wish him well as he continues to make a difference in the lives of others.

Chris certainly fits that mold. His tireless dedication to educational ex-cellence has given rise to a new culture of stu-dent growth and success in the Central Deca-tur Community School District. Prior to Chris’s arrival, the school district had a difficult time retaining high-quality teach-ers for extended periods of time, which con-tributed to lower student achievement. Since taking over, Chris has made Central Decatur a destination for some of Iowa’s best teachers. His innovative programs have helped turn the school district around and for the first time in years they are seeing student tests scores grow in a number of key areas. Chris’ ability to empower teachers in his district has brought about a new level of success for not only his teachers, but the students as well. Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to rep-resent leaders like Chris in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I rec-ognize and applaud him for utilizing his talents to better his students, teachers, community and the great state of Iowa. I ask that my col-leagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives join me in congratulating Chris on receiving this outstanding recognition and wishing him nothing but continued success. f

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and commemorate the remarkable life of Carmen Delgado Votaw, one of my con-stituents who passed away on February 18, 2017 at the age of 82. Ms. Votaw was a civil and human rights giant and passionate partici-pant in the global women’s rights activist com-munity. Ms. Votaw, who was born in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, spent her career acting upon a vision of empowerment and inclusion for all women, especially in Latin America. She was a born community organizer, using immense tact, intellect, and grace to educate and en-lighten others in order to open up cultural and political avenues for the advancement of women. Due to her years of work and advo-cacy in Latin America, she is credited with an increase in the number of countries that have signed the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women; a greater number of women in political and appointed offices; improved access to technology for rural women; and a higher literacy rate among women and girls. Ms. Votaw received on multiple occasions presidential appointments in recognition of her outstanding abilities, including being appointed as Deputy Chair to the National Advisory Committee for Women. She served as Chief of Staff to Jaime Fuster of Puerto Rico in the House of Representatives, marking the first time a Hispanic woman had held that title. She was a founding member and President of the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women and a board member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Ms. Votaw traveled around the globe to promote her agenda of civil and human rights. She visited 70 coun-tries to participate in and speak at women’s rights forums, including five United Nations World Conferences on Women. She is a pub-lished author, most notably having written the biographies of other distinguished Puerto Rican woman. Among the organizations that have honored Ms. Votaw for her contributions to women’s rights are the U.S. Marshals Service, the Instituto de Puerto Rico of New York, the Na-tional Institute for Women of Color, Hispanic USA Magazine, Federally Employed Women (FEW), and the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women. She has received the Hispanic Heritage Award for Education, a Civil Rights Award from NASA, MANA’s Las Primeras Award, the National Cuban American Wom-en’s Association Award, and the National Council of Hispanic Women’s Outstanding Achievement Award. She was inducted into the Maryland Women’s Hall of Fame. Even with her chock-full schedule of global engagement and leadership, Ms. Votaw was deeply devoted to her family and to her role as a grandmother. Please join me in extending condolences to her family and expressing gratitude for her life of dedication to helping all people find their voices. She made tangible contributions to the civil and human rights movements, the effects of which will be felt for generations to come. f 
COMMEMORATING THE 20TH ANNI-VERSARY OF CAMP FIRE’S ABSO-LUTELY INCREDIBLE KID DAY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 16, 2017 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 20th year of Camp Fire’s Absolutely Incredible Kid Day, which observed the third Thursday in March and is devoted to sending uplifting messages to the youth in their lives. Founded in 1910, by Luther Gulick, M.D., and his wife, Charlotte Gulick, Camp Fire is a leading national youth development organiza-tion that guides ‘‘young people on their jour-ney to self-discovery.’’ As founder and Co-Chair of the Congres-sional Children’s caucus, I understand the im-portance of encouraging and supporting our youth to grow and thrive in this world. Camp Fire’s Absolutely Incredible Kid Day honors our nation’s youth by asking adults to write letters of encouragement and inspiration to the incredible kids in their lives. This is a simple and impactful way to let the youth know how much people care and sup-port them. There are numerous ways for adults to par-ticipate in this call to action including using so-cial media to tag, tweet, post, and write letters of love and support to kids. The campaign has received the critical ac-claim of child and family care experts, award winning authors, noted psychologists, and adults and kids everywhere, including Dr. Ste-phen R. Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families; Tipper Gore, who is a leading child advocate; and the famous As-tronaut, the late U.S. Senator John Glenn. Celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Jim Carrey, and Cindy Crawford have also given their support to Absolutely Incredible Kid Day. In Houston, Texas we know that it truly takes an entire community to raise a child. Houston has a distinct history of uplifting the youth in our community so they can excel in any area they choose. A few examples of Houstonians who have benefited from community support are: the en-tertaining Beyonce´Knowles Carter; the hilar-ious Jim Parsons, from the Big Bang Theory;
