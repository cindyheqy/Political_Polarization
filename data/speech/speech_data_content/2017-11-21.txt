Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, Los Angeles has lost a great leader, a champion for accessible, affordable housing and a true community vi-sionary: David Surmier Cunningham, Jr. Dave Cunningham made major contributions to our city, including serving on the Los Angeles City Council with distinction, honor and dignity from 1973 to 1986, succeeding Tom Bradley when he became Mayor. Dave Cunningham and Tom Bradley would remain close allies throughout their lives. Among the first African American elected leaders in the city, Mr. Cunningham rep-resented a district that included Koreatown, the Latino neighborhood of Pico-Union, the heavily Jewish district of Fairfax, and the ma-jority African American community of West Adams. I was proud to be a constituent, and later to represent many of the same diverse communities that he served. Mr. Cunningham had a remarkable and widely varied career. He served in the U.S. Air Force as a cartographer until 1960, the same year he says he was bitten by the political bug, when he attended the historic Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles and saw John Kennedy win the nomination for presi-dent. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in econom-ics and political science at the University of California, Riverside in 1962, and then was selected for a Coro Foundation Public Affairs internship with Assemblyman Charles Warren. The next year he moved to the private sector and spent three years in Lagos, Nigeria as West Africa regional manager for the Dukane Corporation. On return to the U.S., he managed commu-nity relations for Hughes Aircraft for a year be-fore forming a government consulting partner-ship in 1968 that would be his focus for the next five years, along with earning a Master’s degree in Urban Studies from Occidental Col-lege. In 1973 he won the responsibility of rep-resenting Los Angeles’ 10th City Council Dis-trict. As a City Councilmember, Mr. Cunningham took on pressing issues from opposing drilling in Santa Monica Bay to leading a campaign to divest the city’s holdings in apartheid-era South Africa. He is perhaps best known for his fierce advocacy for improving the education of African American students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and for pioneering poli-cies that significantly increased affordable housing in the city, including for seniors and citizens returning after incarceration. He chaired the committee focused on hous-ing and community development, and he called on federal housing officials to put thou-sands of boarded-up homes owned by the government back into use. He also used his committee role to encourage minority hiring at investment banks that sought work with the city. In the early 1980s, he was a key ally in Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky’s crusade to shut down the Los Angeles Police Department’s in-famous Public Disorder Intelligence Division, which kept files on civil rights organizations and other activist and civic groups. After his city council service, he continued his housing focus, both in the private sector as an investment banker, and through a leader-ship position with the Community Housing Eq-uity Corporation. Mr. Cunningham cultivated strong relationships with constituents, in par-ticular asking his Chief of Staff M
AXINE  W
ATERS and aide Geneva Cox to work with the women of the district to develop leadership skills and harness the considerable energy and creativity of those women to improve the lives of people living in the district. The 10th Council District Women’s Steering Committee continues its service to this day. In 1988 he formed the government relations consulting firm, Dave Cunningham and Asso-ciates, that would be his focus for the next three decades, serving clients from small en-trepreneurs and giant corporations like Hertz. His devotion to service later in his life included his role as state president of the Black Amer-ican Public Affairs Committee (BAPAC), con-tinuing his advocacy for equity, civil rights, economic development and community em-powerment. A man for all seasons, Mr. Cunningham was an accomplished jazz musician who played bass in a band, and he even appeared in a Chris Rock movie. My thoughts are with Mr. Cunningham’s son, my friend Judge David S. Cunningham, III, and the rest of his loving family and friends. To those of us who were fortunate enough to cross Dave’s path, he offered guid-ance, wisdom and insight. He will be sorely missed.

TRIBUTE TO KIEU-CHINH 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kieu-Chinh, a legendary Viet-namese-American actress and a philan-thropist, who has contributed six decades of her life to the motion picture industry world-wide, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, China, India, Australia, Canada, and Hollywood. Kieu-Chinh was born in 1937 in Hanoi, North Vietnam. She moved to the South Viet-nam as a refugee in her own motherland at the age of 17, and started her acting career at the age of 19. Since then, she has appeared in over 100 movies and television shows in-cluding ‘‘M.A.S.H’’ and ‘‘The Joy Luck Club.’’ Throughout her acting career, she has re-ceived numerous accolades and awards: Best Actress Award of South Vietnam—Arts and Cinema Prize (1969), Best Leading Actress at the Asian Film Festival in Taipei (1973), Emmy Award for her documentary—‘‘Kieu- Chinh: A Journey Home’’ produced by FOX Television (1996), Special Acting Award at the Cinema Delle Donne Film Festival in Italy (2003), and Lifetime Achievement Awards at the Vietnamese International Film Festival (2003), at the San Diego Film Festival (2006) and at the San Francisco Movie Festival-Fes-tival of Globe (2015). In addition to her acting success, she was honored as ‘‘Refugee of the Year’’ by the United States Congress in 1990 and was in-vited to be the first Vietnamese woman to speak at the 10th Anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall Groundbreaking Anni-versary in Washington, D.C. in 1992. In 1993, together with Lewis Puller—an American veteran and Terry Anderson—a journalist, Kieu-Chinh co-founded the Vietnam Children’s Fund (VCF). Since its establish-ment, the VCF has built 51 schools in Vietnam to provide safe and high-quality education for more than 30,000 students annually. In the same year, she became a lecturer for the Greater Talent Network, Inc. in New York and has made multiple appearances at different conventions, academic conferences, and uni-versities around the country for over two dec-ades. On the 60th Anniversary of Kieu-Chinh Cin-ema, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Kieu-Chinh and her invaluable contributions to the motion picture industry and the commu-nities worldwide. f 
HONORING MICHAEL ‘‘MIKE’’ FISHER 
HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Mr. M
CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of one of the finest and most dedicated members of the Office of Emer-gency Management: Michael ‘‘Mike’’ Fisher of Bastrop, Texas. He was one of the most re-spected individuals in not only Bastrop Coun-ty, but throughout our great state. For 11 years, Mike served as Deputy Direc-tor of Emergency Management for Bastrop County. He was considered a ‘‘man of vision and an innovator of Emergency Management.’’ He had an uncanny ability to foresee the fu-ture of disasters and stay ahead of the diverse emergencies in our state and Bastrop County. These skills enabled him to succeed on many levels within his position. Mike managed the emergency response for our local disasters, including the 2009 Wilder-ness Ridge Fire and the Hidden Pines Fire of October 2015, as well as coordinated the county’s response to the major flooding events we’ve experienced in more recent years.

His leadership, knowledge, and dedication to the challenges he was given were so exten-sive that he was often sought out to help sur-rounding counties and jurisdictions. Mike was always looking to help others. To his friends and colleagues, Mike was known as a trusted counselor, a good listener, and a peacemaker. Yet, when he spoke, all listened. Above all, his most important accomplish-ment was his family. To Mike’s wife, Bonnie, his entire family, and the good people of Bastrop County, you have the gratitude of the nation and we join you in mourning the loss of this great public servant.

RECOGNIZING ST. PAUL’S EPIS-COPAL CHURCH OF WATERLOO, NY 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize St. Paul’s Episcopal Church on its bi-centennial, and to congratulate its clergy, staff, and members, as they celebrate this remark-able milestone. St. Paul’s was incorporated on November 17, 1817, in Waterloo, New York, and has ministered to the spiritual and physical needs of its surrounding community without ceasing in the two-hundred years since. From its inception, St. Paul’s has practiced the traditional Christian values of inclusion, hospitality, caring for the poor and others who are struggling. St. Paul’s also strives to pro-vide a welcoming environment for all individ-uals, regardless of where they are in their re-spective faith journeys. I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-nizing St. Paul’s Episcopal Church as it cele-brates two centuries of spiritual ministry and service to the community of Waterloo, New York.

OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take some time today to honor one of my con-stituents, Mr. Victor de los Santos, for his im-mense dedication to serving Santa Ana’s youth. Mr. Santos is a music educator who was first hired as the Santa Ana High School Band Director in 2007. In his time there, Mr. Santos has worked tirelessly to expand the breadth of the program as well as increase enrollment from 80 to 170 students. Mr. Santos has created a safe harbor for students who are from broken homes and high crime neighborhoods. He works to create a positive environment for his students and for some, he has been the only father figure they have known. Two years ago, he became fos-ter father to a student who would have other-wise gone to a group home. Now that student has graduated from Santa Ana High School and is attending Santa Ana City College to one day become a teacher too. I am pleased to say that Mr. Santos has been nominated, along with 24 other semifinalists from across the country, for the Grammy Music Educator Award, which will be presented next year. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Santos is an example to us of the value of investing in education of the arts. I am honored to congratulate Mr. Santos for his nomination, and thank him for the posi-tive impact he has made on the Santa Ana community.

HONORING MIRIAM STEINBERG 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional member of the Scarsdale community, Miriam Steinberg, for her tireless dedication and selflessness to the Coachman Family Center Shelter. Miriam has donated over $50,000 worth of food and sup-plies for the homeless and deserves a great deal of recognition for her efforts. A lifetime resident of Scarsdale, Miriam is the President of Our Coupon Cares, a non- profit committed to providing supplies to homeless shelters through clipping coupons. Miriam’s monthly visits to the shelter have led her to be one of the largest individual donors in the area. Each month, Miriam brings 15 grocery bags filled with cereal, snacks, juice, body wash, notebooks, board game and other supplies, totaling over 700 grocery bags since she became President. Currently, she is pre-paring for the Thanksgiving holiday and hopes to provide those with a memorable holiday. Miriam’s altruism is a model for others to look upon, Mr. Speaker, she has given so much back to her community and her efforts have been beyond exemplary. I want to con-gratulate Miriam on all she has done and thank her for her remarkable work.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the distinguished career of Commander Pat Slack of the Snohomish Re-gional Drug & Gang Task Force, who will be retiring at the end of this year. Commander Slack is an army veteran who received the Bronze Star for his service in Vietnam. Following his service, he spent 25 years with the Snohomish County Sheriff’s of-fice and five years as a Deputy Chief with the Everett Police Department. In 2000, he became the Commander of the Snohomish Regional Drug & Gang Task Force, which has become the largest of its kind in the state under his leadership. The task force targets drug trafficking organizations and street gangs involved in drug activity to reduce availability and trafficking of drugs in the state and county. This is with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life in our com-munities. Commander Slack was instrumental in start-ing the drug take back program in Snohomish County and he has been a member of a num-ber of national and local teams and organiza-tions focused on drugs and public health. I would like to recognize Commander Slack for his excellent leadership and his commit-ment to fighting the opioid epidemic in my dis-trict.

HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of David Carr, a firefighter in the Brasher-Winthrop Volunteer Fire Department who died in the line of duty on November 4, 2017. David dedicated his life to serving others.

David was also a member of the Tri-Town Volunteer Rescue Squad for 17 years, and served as chief for four years. In 2016, he was recognized for responding to the most calls of any EMT in his department. David was known by his colleagues as a trust-ed mentor and dedicated volunteer to the Tri- Town Community. I would like to offer my deepest condo-lences to David’s family and friends, particu-larly his wife, Lisa. David was an exemplary member of the community and his countless sacrifices made on behalf of the 21st District will not be forgotten. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF JOSEPHINE R. (ARENA) DRISCOLL 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Josephine R. (Arena) Driscoll, a resident of Rockland, Massachusetts, who is celebrating her 100th birthday. Josephine was born on November 27, 1917 to Harry L. and Rose (Galbo) Arena, who emi-grated from Italy through Ellis Island. Growing up she was very active in her community as the captain of her drill and bowling teams and in the Holy Family Church in Rockland. In 1939 she won an award for her poem at the World’s Fair Anthology of Verse. Josephine also spent time traveling across the country and to Mexico with her parents. As a young woman Josephine worked in the Commonwealth Shoe Factory in Whitman. After the factory closed, Josephine, who did not have the opportunity to finish high school, went back and earned her degree. She then worked in the Electro Signal Lab in Rockland, the town where she lives to this day. In 1957 she married Charles A. Driscoll, a U.S. Navy veteran from World War II. Con-tinuing her love for travel, she made many cross-country road trips with her husband until he passed away in 1968. Josephine continued to be involved in her community and is a life-long member of the Republican Town Com-mittee. Today Josephine lives with her niece Rosemarie and her husband Edward, a vet-eran of the U.S. Navy. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Josephine R. Driscoll on this joyous occasion of her 100th birthday. I ask that my colleagues join me in wishing her many more years of health and happiness. f 
HONORING FIRST LIEUTENANT JOHN H. LIEKHUS 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take some time today to honor the memory of First Lieutenant John H. Liekhus of Anaheim, for his immense dedication to serving our country. A member of Anaheim High’s 1934 grad-uating class, First Lt. Liekhus was a flyer with the 323rd Bombardment Squadron, the 91st Bombardment Group and Eighth Air Force. On November 2, 1944, First Lt. Liekhus and his crew were on a bombing mission to Merseburg, Germany when their plane was hit by a flak. When he realized his plane was going down, First Lt. Liekhus ordered his nine- member crew to bail. Three survived and be-came prisoners of war, the navigator died, and First Lt. Liekhus and the others were declared missing in action. It was his great nephew, Dr. Michael Cushing, who led the search for an-swers about his great uncle’s plane crash. First Lt. Liekhus was 29 years old at the time of his death, but his body was not recovered to be returned home until 73 years after his death. Dr. Cushing, and First Lt. Liekhus’ last living sister, Trudy, were finally able to receive answers. First Lt. John H. Liekhus embodied the self-lessness and courage of servicemembers. He paid the ultimate price by putting the lives of his crew before his own, and his efforts to-wards the mission to bomb Merseburg oil re-fineries were instrumental in ending Hitler’s reign. Mr. Speaker, First Lt. Liekhus is an example to us all of us of the incredible sacrifice of our servicemembers. I am honored to recognize First Lt. Liekhus for going above and beyond for American freedom and thank him for his service.
