Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the most fundamental right in our country is voting. The Pew Charitable Trust recently did a study on registration and voting in each State. I am sad to say that my State of Tennessee came out pretty bad. We were 40th in the number of people registered in our State. About 78 percent of the people were registered to vote. In turnout, we were last. Only 28.5 percent of the people in Tennessee voted. This was based on the 2014 elections. The 2018 elections will determine a lot about who sits in this House, who sits in the Senate, and, eventually, who sits on the Supreme Court. It is imperative that everybody register to vote so that they can vote in the November elections, not just in Tennessee, but everywhere in the country, and that everyone turn out to vote so the voting totals are a fair representation of the people, all the people, if we are going to have a House and a Senate that is representative of America. What occurred in Helsinki and what was brought out with the indictments by Special Counsel Mueller show how much the Russians think of our election system, that they got involved in a cyber attack on our country to defeat a candidate. We should care as much about our electoral system as the Russians. We should care more about it. The fact that more than 20 percent of the citizens in my State do not register and do not vote is appalling. With the continued threat to the electoral system in 2018, it is so important that we at least make it difficult for the Russians to have an impact. That means that each and every citizen needs to register, register others as their civic duty, vote as their civic duty, and make their voices heard. Otherwise, this room will not represent ‘‘America the Beautiful.’’ f 
WORKFARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few words this morning about the work that we have been doing here in the House to add workfare requirements to the food stamp program. President Ronald Reagan once stated: ‘‘The Federal Government declared war on poverty, and poverty won.’’ That is as true today as it was when President Reagan said it. Over the last five decades, Congress has spent more than $22 trillion of taxpayers’ money on government welfare programs. The result: 50 years later, the poverty rate stands unchanged. If anyone ever needed more proof that more government isn’t the solution to every problem, here is the proof. If you were to measure success solely on how much taxpayer money the government spends to solve a problem, 
then the government’s war on poverty has been wildly successful. After all, we now have 13 Federal agencies running more than 80 government welfare programs. But if we judge success based on how many people have been able to rise out of poverty to take care of themselves and their families, these government programs have failed. So what have we learned after spending $22 trillion? It is simple: Workfare helps people stand on their own two feet. It helps people get off the welfare treadmill. For example, before Congress reformed Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, also known as TANF, to incorporate a strict work requirement, there were 4.9 million families on the welfare rolls. Now, thanks to workfare reforms, we have seen 3.3 million families rise out of welfare dependence. That is a success. b1015 In 2014, when Maine began enforcing workfare for ablebodied adults without dependents who are receiving food stamps, the Maine caseload decreased by 80 percent within months. The simple requirement that able bodied adults without dependents should work in order to receive welfare benefits, paired with job search assistance and training opportunities, works. It gets people out of welfare and into the workforce. We have learned that it makes a profound difference in people’s lives when they understand that welfare is not meant to be a handout but, actually, a hand up. Now, we need to apply these lessons about the benefits of workfare to more government welfare programs like food stamps and housing. That is especially important today because, with the economy growing, thanks to tax reform, job openings recently hit a record high of 6.6 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By taking a stand for workfare requirements, we now have an opportunity to move millions of Americans from reliance on welfare to work and financial independence. I commend the House for passing a farm bill that includes a strong workfare requirement for ablebodied adults without dependents. We have opened the door to welfare reforms that will help put people on the road to selfreliance, and I encourage my colleagues to build on this foundation and continue to stand up for workfare instead of welfare. 
BIZARRE BEHAVIOR The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, a year ago, I was on a congressional trip with the Judiciary Committee into the Balkan region. A number of the countries there, living in the shadow of Russia and, also, the aggression of the Serbian allies of the Russians were very concerned about their security and their future. Russia has, obviously, invaded Crimea, is supporting rebels in Ukraine, and is deeply involved in Syria to support the dictator there. Now, in this last week, our President went to Europe, and he went to a meeting of our closest allies and NATO, which these countries on the periphery of Russia feel is critical to their defense. And he seems to—or did—deliberately so dissent and insult our two longest and strongest allies in NATO: Germany and England. He seemed to be facilitating the Russian agenda there: Let’s weaken NATO. Let’s cause dissent in Europe. But that couldn’t be. He is the President of the United States. Of course he wouldn’t be doing that. No. He was just being a businessman and trying to extract bigger payments out of them. He didn’t mean to weaken or threaten the future of the alliance. Then yesterday, in a sort of very bizarre moment, he meets alone with a professional KGB agentdictator of Russia, Vladimir Putin. We don’t know what went on in that room. Maybe they watched videotapes. I don’t know. But the President came out again and, this time, directly attacked the United States of America. How could this be? He said that he does not believe that our intelligence agencies—his handpicked head of the DNI, Dan Coats, told him the Russians had interfered and proved to him the Russians had interfered in our election. He said that once about a year ago. But then he comes out with Vladimir Putin and says: Well, I asked him about it. He says they didn’t do it. You know, there’s two sides to this. We did it. They did it. Who knows. Whatever. It doesn’t matter. Our basic institutions, our democracy, has been attacked by Russia, and Dan Coats says they are going to do it again in this election year. What can explain this bizarre behavior on the part of the President of the United States? I couldn’t figure it out, so I went to my bookshelf and I said: Hmm, I’ll look around my bookshelf. Maybe I’ll find something. I found two books. It is my recommended reading list to explain President Trump and some of what is going on in America today. The first would be ‘‘The Manchurian Candidate.’’ The second would be the dystopian novel, George Orwell’s ‘‘1984.’’ Read them and weep. f 
THE 12TH WOMAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Meghan is a fourthgeneration Texas A&M Aggie. Her decision to attend the prestigious school was never a question in her mind. It was an amazing experience, until it wasn’t. One morning, while serving as a tutor in the athletic department, a member of the Fighting Aggies football team twice her size exposed himself to her not 2 feet away, making sexual advances toward Meghan and becoming aggressive. Terrified and shocked, she abruptly left the room, trying to remain calm as he followed her. Unbeknownst to Meghan, her assailant had done the same thing to another tutor just hours before. Mr. Speaker, Meghan feels she did not get justice against her attacker. Instead, she tells me, she was failed by a university that was not totally committed to protecting victims. Meghan was scared of the upcoming process, scared to go back to work, terrified she might run into this individual again. Before the hearing, the university claimed she did not need a lawyer; the assailant wasn’t facing any criminal charges. So she didn’t hire a lawyer. But she received no notice that her assailant had hired a lawyer. Months later, Meghan’s assailant was found not responsible for exposing himself to both tutors, with the panel stating it appeared he had a skin condition and simply couldn’t control himself. The response she received was nothing short of appalling. The school said: Sorry, Meghan, that you were offended, but there is nothing else we can do. So she appealed the case. She still believed in the university and that the university would provide some justice for her. At the appeals hearing, she was informed that the charge against her attacker had been downgraded from sexual exploitation to sexual harassment; therefore, she was removed from the remainder of the hearing. Doesn’t that seem odd, Mr. Speaker? Also, no one from the university title IX office ever contacted her. She never received any information regarding what sanctions her assailant received, if any. Of course, Mr. Speaker, her assailant was allowed back onto the football team. Meghan felt abandoned by the university, and she thought the accused was protected due to his special status. As a former judge, I agree with Meghan that universities must put the safety and care of sexual assault victims first, make it a priority. Together with CAROLYN MALONEY and J ACKIE  SPEIER , we have introduced several pieces of bipartisan legislation to end sexual assault on campuses. First, the Bipartisan Campus Accountability and Safety Act, introduced by Congresswoman CAROLYN  MALONEY , does many things, including establishing a mandatory victim advocate on campus and ensuring assault situations like Meghan’s do not occur. Second, the HALT Campus Sexual Violence Act, which will be introduced this week by Congresswoman JACKIE  SPEIER and me, makes sure that the universities do not shirk their legal responsibilities when responding to sexual assault crimes. 
Texas A&M is not alone in this fight to provide a voice for victims. According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, each year one in five women will be assaulted while in college. That is a staggering statistic. Mr. Speaker, Meghan said it best: ‘‘A&M has a chance to be fearless on every front and to be fearless in the face of such horrible things that are happening to victims.’’ I applaud Meghan for having the courage to come forward and publicly tell her story to the world. Other victims who have been suffering in silence have been inspired to come forward and rally the cause, forming an organization called the 12th Woman, a group of determined women dedicated to stopping sexual assault on our university campuses. This is not a question of loyalty and pride in Texas A&M. It is a call to action. The 12th Woman is relentless in bringing change to the way universities address sexual assault not just at A&M, but across the United States. Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to listen to Meghan and her band of sisters and do what is necessary to make sure our universities are safe from sexual assault on campus. And that is just the way it is. 
WE HAVE TO ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, once again, I rise because I love my country. I am proud to say that I am an American. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I believe that, when democracy is at risk and the Republic is on the line, you have to take a stand. I rise today because to be silent could be concluded as being acquiescent. To be silent can be said to be complicit. To be silent, according to Dr. King, at some point can be said to be seen as betrayal. I rise because I love my country. Because I love my country, I will not allow myself to be driven by polls. I thank God that the great freedom fighters, the great wrongrighters were not driven by polls. If Dr. King, Rosa Parks, the great freedom fighters, had been driven by polls, I wouldn’t be standing here today. They drove the polls. They didn’t adjust to the polls. They had the polls, the people who gave their thoughts, to adjust to righteousness. So I rise today to speak truth to power, not driven by polls, not driven by political expediency. I rise today to let the world know that our country is better than what we saw in Helsinki. I rise today to say to my colleagues: We have to act. Yes, we can talk about all of the atrocities imposed upon our society by this President, but that is not enough. At some point, we have to act, and more and more people are starting to say what that action is. More and more of the people who present the news and give commentary are starting to say what that action is. It is unfortunate that we haven’t gotten to the point where we are going to act not withstanding the polls, we are going to act notwithstanding political expediency, we are going to act because there is a moral imperative to remove a President from office who puts democracy at risk and the Republic on the line. There is a moral imperative for us to take a stand. And we can do all of the things that can lead up to what the Framers of the Constitution afforded us. We can do many things, but Article II, section 4 of the Constitution was created for a time such as this and a President such as Trump. Mr. Speaker, there is a solution to a President who puts himself above his country. The Framers of the Constitution knew that we would have this moment in time, and they gave us the solution. We but only have to have the courage, the intestinal fortitude, to stand up for our country and impeach this President. The time has come. No more political expediency. No more driven by the polls. Stand for our country on a moral imperative. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f 
INFLUENCING ELECTIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, last year CNN reported that the U.S. had interfered or attempted to influence presidential elections in other countries at least 81 times. This is probably a very conservative estimate. This report came from a study by Professor Dov H. Levin of Carnegie Mellon University and apparently was just the tip of the iceberg. His study covered just years up to 2000, and these activities may have increased since that time. Professor Levin defined an intervention as ‘‘a costly act which is designed to determine the election results in favor of one of the two sides.’’ He said these acts were carried out in secret twothirds of the time and included ‘‘funding the election campaigns of specific parties, disseminating misinformation or propaganda, training locals of only one side in various campaigning or public announcements on threats in favor of or against a candidate, and providing or withdrawing foreign aid.’’ He reported that in 59 percent of these cases the side that received assistance came to power. In a December 21, 2016, article, the Los Angeles Times said: ‘‘The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries.’’ b1030 The newspaper reported, that ‘‘the CIA has accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 Presidential election by hacking into Democratic and Republican computer networks and selectively releasing emails.’’ But the Times added: ‘‘But critics might point out that the U.S. has done similar things.’’ I am not criticizing our government’s activities in this regard. Some of it has been good, designed to fight communism and promote freedom around the world. However, some of it has probably been wasteful, and, at times, has increased hatred for the U.S. We are involved, in many ways, in almost every country around the world through our State Department, Agency for International Development, the CIA, the Defense Department, and just about every Federal department and agency. Most countries take an active interest and involvement in U.S. Presidential elections through their citizens and former citizens who now live in this country. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  this article from the Los Angeles Times. 
[From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 21, 2016] THEU.S. I SNOSTRANGER TO INTERFERING IN  
THEELECTIONS OF OTHER COUNTRIES  (By Nina Agrawal) Update: President Obama on Thursday slapped Russia with new penalties for meddling in the U.S. presidential election, kicking out dozens of suspected spies and imposing banking restrictions on five people and four organizations the administration says were involved. The CIA has accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 presidential election by hacking into Democratic and Republican computer networks and selectively releasing emails. But critics might point out the U.S. has done similar things. The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries—it’s done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University. That number doesn’t include military coups and regime change efforts following the election of candidates the U.S. didn’t like, notably those in Iran, Guatemala and Chile. Nor does it include general assistance with the electoral process, such as election monitoring. Levin defines intervention as ‘‘a costly act which is designed to determine the election results [in favor of] one of the two sides.’’ These acts, carried out in secret twothirds of the time, include funding the election campaigns of specific parties, disseminating misinformation or propaganda, training locals of only one side in various campaigning or getoutthevote techniques, helping one side design their campaign materials, making public pronouncements or threats in favor of or against a candidate, and providing or withdrawing foreign aid. In 59 percent of these cases, the side that received assistance came to power, although Levin estimates the average effect of ‘‘partisan electoral interventions’’ to be only about a 3 percent increase in vote share. The U.S. hasn’t been the only one trying to interfere in other countries’ elections, according to Levin’s data. Russia attempted to 
sway 36 foreign elections from the end of World War II to the turn of the century— meaning that, in total, at least one of the two great powers of the 20th century intervened in about 1 of every 9 competitive, nationallevel executive elections in that time period. Italy’s 1948 general election is an early example of a race where U.S. actions probably influenced the outcome. ‘‘We threw everything, including the kitchen sink’’ at helping the Christian Democrats beat the Communists in Italy, said Levin, including covertly delivering ‘‘bags of money’’ to cover campaign expenses, sending experts to help run the campaign, subsidizing ‘‘pork’’ projects like land reclamation, and threatening publicly to end U.S. aid to Italy if the Communists were elected. Levin said that U.S. intervention probably played an important role in preventing a Communist Party victory, not just in 1948, but in seven subsequent Italian elections. Throughout the Cold War, U.S. involvement in foreign elections was mainly motivated by the goal of containing communism, said Thomas Carothers, a foreign policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ‘‘The U.S. didn’t want to see leftwing governments elected, and so it did engage fairly often in trying to influence elections in other countries,’’ Carothers said. This approach carried over into the immediate postSoviet period. In the 1990 Nicaragua elections, the CIA leaked damaging information on alleged corruption by the Marxist Sandinistas to German newspapers, according to Levin. The opposition used those reports against the Sandinista candidate, Daniel Ortega. He lost to opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro. In Czechoslovakia that same year, the U.S. provided training and campaign funding to Vaclav Havel’s party and its Slovak affiliate as they planned for the country’s first democratic election after its transition away from communism. ‘‘The thinking was that we wanted to make sure communism was dead and buried,’’ said Levin. Even after that, the U.S. continued trying to influence elections in its favor. In Haiti after the 1986 overthrow of dictator and U.S. ally JeanClaude ‘‘Baby Doc’’ Duvalier, the CIA sought to support particular candidates and undermine Jean Bertrande Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest and proponent of liberation theology. The New York Times reported in the 1990s that the CIA had on its payroll members of the military junta that would ultimately unseat Aristide after he was democratically elected in a landslide over Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official and finance minister favored by the U.S. The U.S. also attempted to sway Russian elections. In 1996, with the presidency of Boris Yeltsin and the Russian economy flailing, President Clinton endorsed a $10.2billion loan from the International Monetary Fund linked to privatization, trade liberalization and other measures that would move Russia toward a capitalist economy. Yeltsin used the loan to bolster his popular support, telling voters that only he had the reformist credentials to secure such loans, according to media reports at the time. He used the money, in part, for social spending before the election, including payment of back wages and pensions. In the Middle East, the U.S. has aimed to bolster candidates who could further the IsraeliPalestinian peace process. In 1996, seeking to fulfill the legacy of assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the peace accords the U.S. brokered, Clinton openly supported Shimon Peres, convening a peace summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheik to boost his popular support and inviting him to a meeting at the White House a month before the election. ‘‘We were persuaded that if [Likud candidate Benjamin] Netanyahu were elected, the peace process would be closed for the season,’’ said Aaron David Miller, who worked at the State Department at the time. In 1999, in a more subtle effort to sway the election, top Clinton strategists, including James Carville, were sent to advise Labor candidate Ehud Barak in the election against Netanyahu. In Yugoslavia, the U.S. and NATO had long sought to cut off Serbian nationalist and Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic from the international system through economic sanctions and military action. In 2000, the U.S. spent millions of dollars in aid for political parties, campaign costs and independent media. Funding and broadcast equipment provided to the media arms of the opposition were a decisive factor in electing opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica as Yugoslav president, according to Levin. ‘‘If it wouldn’t have been for overt intervention . . . Milosevic would have been very likely to have won another term,’’ he said. 
Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, there is greater turnover in elective offices today than ever before. And in my 30 years in Congress, I have now served with almost 1,500 other Members. Almost all have been good, kind men and women. But one of the best, one of the kindest is my friend, JIMJORDAN . Now, Congressman JORDAN has been attacked with one of the dirtiest, most lowdown political hit jobs that I have ever seen. He has been accused of knowing about, but failing to report, sexual abuse that occurred 25 to 30 years ago. This alleged abuse was done not by Mr. JORDAN but by another man, a team doctor, who has been dead for 13 years. And this abuse was not done to little boys or girls. It was supposedly done to grown adult men, Ohio State wrestlers, none of whom reported it at the time. The timing is so suspicious coming out now when Mr. JORDAN may be seeking a leadership post. He is supposed to have known about this because of lockerroom banter. All the coaches and many of his players have defended Mr. JORDAN , calling him one of the most honest men they know. Surely, Mr. Speaker, even though politics of hatred is prevalent today, surely we are not going to stoop to convicting people based on locker room banter or gossip. 
WATER SUPPLY IN THE VALLEY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I draw attention to the human right to have water to sustain ourselves. Benjamin Franklin once said about this precious resource, water, that ‘‘When the well’s dry, we know the worth of water.’’ In the San Joaquin Valley, I can tell you we know the worth of water. It is the lifeblood of our Valley communities and our agricultural economy. We like to say, Where water flows, food grows. The Valley is one of the most advanced agricultural regions in the world. We produce over 250 crops that provide over 50 percent of the United States’ fruits and vegetables on America’s dinner table every night. The bounty of nature of food that we produce is coaxed out of the ground by some of the hardest working people you will ever meet, farmers and farmworkers, and it relies on a clean and reliable water resource. And America’s food supply, make no mistake about it, is a national security issue. I have spent decades working for commonsense short and longterm solutions to address California’s broken water system. When I served in the California legislature, I carried multiple bonds that were passed that provided over $2 billion for crucial water projects. While in Congress, I have advanced legislation that have improved water supplies and funding for projects in many different ways: The North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program, which helps irrigate over 44,000 acres in western Merced and Stanislaus Counties with local and recycled water, and the San LuisDelta Mendota Intertie project, which brings up to over 35,000 acrefeet of water annually to most of our rural Valley communities to advance efforts that are so important, that make a difference. In addition, that doesn’t include the success of the WIIN Act, bipartisan legislation which I helped lead through 4 years of tough negotiations. It became law in 2016. The WIIN Act creates more flexibility to move water based on real time water realities and provides authorization for $563 million in Federal funds for water projects, like expanding Shasta Reservoir, like raising San Luis Reservoir, and like creating Temperance Flat. Just this month, legislation I introduced to allow local water districts to improve the efficiency of dams passed the House. I call on the Senate to move this bill to the President’s desk. In the Valley, this would allow the Merced Irrigation District to advance a project to raise the spillway at New Exchequer Dam. This would increase the supply of water, over 56,000 acre feet of water—much needed. However, it seems like every time we are able increase our drought resilience, State or Federal regulators decide that they need to take more water from the Valley. It is wrong and it is unfair. The most recent attempt to repurpose the Valley water supplies came earlier this month by the California State Water Board. Staff released the final draft of a plan that is simply unacceptable. And I must say, it is pretty easy to reallocate water when it is not your water supply. That is what the State board did. The plan, if adopted, will effectively double the amount of water that must 
remain in the San Joaquin River tributaries. This will force thousands of acres of farmland out of production, ravaging communities across the Valley, and weakening America’s food security and its supply. The board staff claims these changes are necessary to prevent total collapse of the fisheries in the Delta. But this plan will not save fish, sadly. It does not address the other problems that faces the fisheries; namely, rising water temperatures, lack of food, habitat, and increased predators, none of which have anything to do with the water flows. This plan is in direct conflict with another California law that mandates we must use our groundwater more sustainably, which must be done. We must come into balance. However, it is impossible to use groundwater sustainably when we must pump groundwater to replace the surplus water that is being taken away. These actions are in conflict. It doesn’t make any sense. Our agricultural economy is showing tremendous innovation, growing twice as much food on a fraction of the water that we used to receive. But we have reached the tipping point—a point where the taking of the resource outstrips our ability to innovate. Without water, we cannot feed America or maintain our quality of life, our sustenance. Our Valley and our Nation need longterm solutions that provides for reliable sources of safe drinking water, water for agricultural industries, as well as for our cities. We, in the Valley, the San Joaquin Valley will continue to fight for the water we need to grow America’s food. Because, in the Valley, we know the worth of water. We know it when the well runs dry, as Benjamin Franklin said. So, in conclusion, we must work together in California to fix our broken water system for the longterm benefits of America’s food supply. 
LANSDALE MURAL ARTS PROGRAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a program in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that brings together members of our community to celebrate artistic expression and economic opportunity. The Lansdale Mural Arts Program seeks to beautify areas in Lansdale by painting murals on buildings in need of rehabilitation. By improving the aesthetics of many of these beloved community landmarks, the Lansdale Mural Arts Program hopes to enhance the economic and social value of the services and goods that the building’s tenants provide. Started in 2013, the Lansdale Mural Arts Program has painted the walls of local businesses: Chantilly Floral, Wes Carver Electric, The Underground at Round Guys Brewing Company, and perhaps the most profound, an American flag mural at the Lansdale VFW Post. Currently, the program is looking to continue its work on the American Legion Post 206 building, and I applaud the Lansdale Mural Arts Program for their work, especially organizers Margie Booz and Ellen Foulke for their thoughtfulness and dedication to our community. RECOGNIZING THE ANN SILVERMAN COMMUNITY  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a nonprofit organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that serves to protect the health and dignity of residents across our community. The Ann Silverman Community Health Clinic in Doylestown provides medical and dental care, along with social services to lowincome and impoverished individuals at no cost. Offering these critical services will not be possible without the tireless efforts of a highly skilled staff and volunteer doctors and nurses. These dedicated professionals deserve our recognition, and, recently, Dr. Kieran Cody of Bucks County Orthopedic Specialists was named Volunteer Physician of the Year for his services to the clinic and his patients over the past 10 years. Throughout his tenure, Dr. Cody has performed countless surgeries and MRI services, following in the footsteps of his father, Dr. Kevin Cody, who has spent 19 years volunteering at the clinic. I thank Drs. Kieran and Kevin Cody for their service, and I extend my gratitude to the Ann Silverman Community Health Clinic executive director, Sally FabianOresic for her leadership. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize two members of our community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who will be continuing their service to the Jewish faith at Shir Ami Congregation in Newtown. Charles Briskin and Rachel Kohlbrenner both joined Shir Ami as rabbi and cantor, respectively. Rabbi Briskin, who for the past 10 years has led Temple Beth El in San Pedro, California, was ordained in 2001 and studied at the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion. Cantor Kohlbrenner previously served as cantor for the Central SynagogueBeth Emeth in Rockville Centre, New York, and studied at the Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music of Hebrew Union College. I welcome Rabbi Charles Briskin and Cantor Rachel Kohlbrenner to our community and wish them all the best as they embark on the newest chapters of their career. And I thank their predecessors, Rabbi Joel Simon and Cantor Emeritus Mark Elson for their service and spiritual wisdom that they have blessed our community with for so long. f 
HONORING CORPORAL JOSEPH MACIEL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BARRAGA ´N) for 5 minutes. Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Corporal Joseph Maciel, who was killed July 7 from injuries sustained while in Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. Corporal Maciel was only 20 years old and is remembered by those who loved him for his infectious smile and love for his country. According to his father Jose, Corporal Maciel knew in high school that he wanted to serve his country. And when he enlisted in the Army, he made his family proud. Corporal Maciel was a beloved member of our community, admired by his family and those he served alongside. He gave his life for freedom, and we are forever indebted to his service and to him. I extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of Corporal Joseph Maciel’s friends and family in South Gate, California, in my district, and I thank him for his service and his family for their sacrifice. 
Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, for the last year, in my congressional district, California’s 44th District, which includes the communities of Compton, Watts, South Gate, and the Port of Los Angeles, we have been fighting to make sure we have access to clean air and to clean water. We learned several months ago that there is something called chromium6 in the air, which is a deadly chemical that causes respiratory problems and can lead to cancer. Now, who oversees to make sure that these polluters are cracked down on and that we make sure that polluters are held accountable? The EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. This week this House is expected to consider FY 2019—fiscal year 2019, the InteriorEnvironment appropriations bill as part of a twobill minibus. Now, this Republican bill puts the health and safety of American people at risk. What does it do? It is going to cut the Environmental Protection Agency by $100 million. You heard me right. They are going to cut funding for the EPA. This is the agency that oversees at making sure that polluters are held accountable. That, my friends, will put the American people in jeopardy, and those polluters that are going around, across the country and polluting things, like chromium6 that is killing our kids and our seniors and causing asthma and respiratory problems, it is going to make it easier for them to pollute. 
b1045 What else does it do? It slashes clean water grant programs by $300 million. In my community in Compton, California, we recently had a brown water crisis. It is still going on. There is brown water coming out of the faucets. We don’t have to think too far back as to what happened in Flint, Michigan. To think that we are having a vote this week that is going to cut $300 million—money that is used to invest in America’s water infrastructure—is appalling. When I heard about it this week, I thought it was important that the American people know about it. This is what should be on the front page of the newspapers. This is what the media should be reporting on, what is happening in this Congress and how the American people are put at risk when such cuts are happening to the very agencies that are put there to protect us, so that we ensure that we have clean air and clean water. As somebody who serves as the chair of two environmental task forces here in Congress, we cannot allow this to continue to happen without raising our voices, calling our elected officials, calling our offices, and speaking out about what the American people want. And this is one: Clean air and clean water is a basic right that everybody is entitled to. I believe this bill is going to take us backward. It is going to hurt us. And it really hurts our ability to make sure that we continue to look at things like climate change. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this, and I urge the American people to have their voices heard. 
POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, there are moments in history that require the deliberate and thoughtful response of the most powerful body in the world, the United States Congress, this House and the other House. While Americans are preparing for recreation and fellowship with family members during this period of summer, when schoolchildren are out, as others are dealing with the excruciating heat, others dealing with the impact of climate change, gun violence, the need for putting back in the terrible cuts of the Republican budget on Medicare and Medicaid, and a number of other issues dealing with their communities and neighborhoods, and, I would say, frankly, keeping their children safe and recognizing the values of this Nation that include not snatching children away from family members, I get that and I understand the responsibility of this Congress to pass laws, to work together to ensure that the beauty of what America stands for, her values and her opportunities for so many others, is heard. But I also think it is important because, as I have traveled in the last 24 hours, I saw Americans concerned about their Nation and wanting to be able to understand what transpired in Helsinki yesterday, Monday, July 16. As many have said, Republicans and Democrats, it was a disgraceful display of unpatriotic behavior. The tragedy of it is that it came from the Commander in Chief of this Nation. As I read the Constitution, it says that executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States, and he shall hold his office for a period of time. His powers under section 2 include that the President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of several States, when called into actual service. And, as well, it indicates that he shall appoint ambassadors. That is translated into the President’s responsibilities over the intelligence communities and many aspects of our defense. Also, the power of the President articulates the foreign policy of this Nation. Yesterday, the display that was shown was that the foreign policy, and the patriotism, and the stature, and the leadership, and the Constitution of the United States became a footstool to a despot by the name of President Putin. No one is against engagement, diplomacy, or resolving conflict, but President Putin stands very proudly as ex KGB to have poisoned his own citizens, to have shot journalists, to have shot down an airplane over Ukraine with 300 innocent family members, children, and others, and, as well, has taken over a land of another country. So here we stand with this picture to the world. As well, when posed a question of, who do you believe, the Commander in Chief, to the absolute dismay of those of us who have lived through 9/11 here in Congress, and who saw the loss of life in conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, were amazed that the sacred aspect of our work, and that is voting, was determined by the intelligence community of this Nation, that Russia invaded in our 2016 election and literally stole the election, and will continue to do so today, as emphasized by the Director of National Intelligence, Director Coats, and the intelligence community. A report given by the Mueller investigation indicted 12 intelligence agents of Russia—not of any other country, not civilians, but intelligence agents, military—who had direct orders from President Putin. You would think that the President of the United States would forcefully say to the President: Stop it and stop it now. That is a patriot. That is one who has the powers of the Presidency under Article II, section 2. Yet this is what came about. President Trump was asked by a reporter: ‘‘You first. Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016.’’ It is amazing how my time goes because I am talking about the President. But, in any event, let me conclude by saying that this document reports that the President said that he stands with Putin over the United States of America. Congress must demand the transcripts. We must have congressional hearings, Mr. Speaker. This is a serious matter. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Strengthen the constitutional commitments of the Members of this people’s House in their work today. Guide and sustain them in Your wisdom and inspire all, especially those in leadership, with the insights needed to assist our Nation at this time. Bless all who are responsible for the security and safety of our Nation in today’s world. Grant them a surfeit of courage and resolve to execute their responsibilities with integrity and faithfulness. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. KILMER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, in 1961, in the face of a challenge from the Soviets, President Kennedy visited the University of Washington and said we are neither ‘‘warmongers nor appeasers. Neither hard nor soft. We are Americans, determined to defend the frontiers of freedom.’’ He pointed out the university’s motto is: ‘‘Let there be light,’’ and asked: ‘‘What more can be said today, regarding all the dark and tangled problems we face, than: Let there be light.’’ It is the unanimous view of the United States intelligence community that Russia used social media to influence our elections in 2016. After yesterday, Americans from all viewpoints called on Congress to stand up for our interests to protect our elections from Russian influence. I offered the Honest Ads Act as an amendment to the bill we are voting on today. This bipartisan bill simply establishes the same disclosure requirements for online ads that currently apply to political ads on television and radio. So today, Congress had the chance to stand up to Russia and pass the Honest Ads Act, but like the President a day ago, this body failed to act. Mr. Speaker, Congress has a duty to defend the frontiers of freedom. So, let there be light. Let’s pass the Honest Ads Act and shine a light on the darkest corners of our election systems so that Russia can never again use our news feeds to influence our elections. f 
INVESTING IN AMERICAN WORKERS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I recently introduced the Skills Investment Act of 2018 with Congressman DEREK KILMER to allow American workers to invest in their own futures. This bill would create lifelong learning accounts workers could use to pay for skillsbased education, careerrelated learning, and professional development. In an everchanging economy, I know that such accounts would be put to good use. As cochair of the bipartisan House Career and Technical Education Caucus, I fully support expanding access to skillsbased educational opportunities and professional development. The tax treatment of these savings accounts would be similar to a health savings account. Midcareer workers could contribute up to $4,000 tax free each year, with a maximum contribution limit of $10,000. Employers would receive a 25 percent tax credit for contributions to a worker’s account. Workers of all ages can use the account at any time to learn skills to make them more competitive as the economy changes. This bill is a commonsense approach to investing in the American worker. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor it today. 
SURRENDERING OUR VALUES (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, like many Americans, yesterday I watched and was dumbfounded by the words and the actions of the President of the United States as he betrayed our principles and our national interests on the world stage. Never before have we seen a President of the United States so quickly surrender our longstanding values and our national security interests to an adversary like Vladimir Putin. The President’s pathetic performance was an embarrassment for the United States. Just last week, of course, his own Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence agents for the very act that he denied ever took place. When he had a chance to take sides between American interests and the American intelligence community, he wrapped his arms around Vladimir Putin, a KGB spy with a history of jamming his opponents and killing journalists. This is outrageous. f 
NORTH KOREA BRUTALIZES ITS PEOPLE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, North Korea’s nuclear program is perhaps the greatest threat to U.S. national security, but we must never forget the horrendous plight of the North Korean people. Little Kim and his dynasty are guilty of some of the worst human rights abuses in human history. Freedom of religion and freedom of speech do not exist in North Korea. Christians are routinely arrested, tortured, imprisoned, and executed, their families sent to prison camps for ‘‘guilt by association.’’ Reports estimate that almost 130,000 political prisoners are suffering brutal conditions in highly secret work camps around North Korea. Systematic murder, torture, rape, forced abortions, starvation, and overwork are leading to countless deaths every day, and the Kim regime is giving no signs of relenting. Despite any nuclear agreement, we must make it clear that the United States will never waiver in its support for basic human dignity of the North Korean people. And that is just the way it is. 
TRADE ADJUSTMENT AUTHORITY (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s trade war is spiraling out of control and American workers and businesses are paying the price. Back home in Illinois, already more than $3.8 billion in exports have been targeted for retaliation. I have heard from numerous working companies hurting from this misguided approach. They are struggling with new, high costs and are now less able or less likely to hire or expand. 
Today, I am introducing legislation to help American businesses affected by the Trump tariffs. Trade Adjustment Assistance was created in 1962 to help U.S. workers and U.S. firms adapt to competition caused by changing trade policies. My bill would expand the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms to add reduced exports resulting from retaliatory tariffs as a qualifying factor for the TAA program. I also enthusiastically support similar legislation by my Democratic colleagues being introduced this week to provide similar assistance to impacted workers and farmers. President Trump needs to end this damaging trade war. Until he does, we need to provide relief to the businesses and workers who are adversely stuck with the consequences. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
RECOGNIZING JOHN COMERFORD OF BLACKBURN COLLEGE (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank my friend, John Comerford, for his years of service and leadership as president of Blackburn College in Carlinville, Illinois. In his nearly 5 years as Blackburn’s president, John provided tremendous leadership and helped implement innovative policies with tuition assistance and providing students with valuable work experience. Under his leadership, Blackburn College has steadily grown its enrollment, renovated several buildings on campus, and implemented policies that provide local students with access to college. Under Blackburn’s Macoupin Promise program, which was created last year, high school students in Macoupin County can attend Blackburn College for free if they meet the college’s academic standards, participate in the work program, and their household income falls below a set threshold. Beginning this month, John will be moving to Otterbein University in Ohio, where he will serve as president. I wish John nothing but the best in the future and thank him for his leadership, feedback, and, most of all, his friendship. 
BUILDING A NEW BUFFALO (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, at the foot of Main Street in Buffalo lies the DL&W Terminal, a centuryold, vacant historic landmark along the Buffalo River that once served as a bustling stop for passengers traveling by both ship and rail. A plan by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority will transform this piece of western New York history into a destination that serves a Buffalo of today and tomorrow, creating a multimodal center for people traveling by rail, automobile, bikes, and boats. The DL&W Terminal is a project under consideration for a Federal grant through the United States Department of Transportation’s Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development, otherwise known as the BUILD program. I stand today in support of the NFTA’s grant application for the DL&W Terminal, which serves as a national model for financing of infrastructure investments delivering significant economic impact. Surrounded by Canalside, the Cobblestone District, downtown Buffalo, and the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, development of the DL&W represents a transformative project building on the economic renaissance of the new Buffalo. f 
TAX REFORM FEEDBACK (Mr. NORMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share that in 6 short months, tax reform has transformed lives and businesses in South Carolina. I recently sent out two postcard surveys to over 50,000 of my constituents asking them how tax reform has affected them. I have received great feedback, with over 70 percent saying they saw increased pay or benefits. One example I received in the Fifth District is from the Mattox family, a selfemployed couple in Clover. They said that, due to their tax cuts this year, they are going to finally be able to buy new equipment for their business. The Mattox family also believes these tax cuts should remain permanent for all middle class families because of the benefits they personally see occurring in their community. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, South Carolinians are now seeing opportunities and confidence coming back to their families and small businesses. 
TRUMP BLAMES AMERICA FIRST (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to respectfully call upon our Republican colleagues to stand up for America by standing up against and rejecting President Donald Trump’s surrender to murderous dictator Vladimir Putin. Putin may well have elected Trump, but Putin is against us all, Democrats and Republicans alike, and he is against our cherished democracy. Without his congressional Republican enablers, Trump cannot continue to coddle the Russians at the very time that his Director of National Intelligence, lifelong Republican Dan Coats, is warning that we are under sustained Russian attack. In his embarrassing, fawning praise of Putin, Trump expresses no concern for Putin’s military shooting down a civilian airliner four years ago today; Putin’s agents poisoning his enemies and jailing his opponents; Putin’s invasions of Ukraine and Georgia; and Putin’s interference and attacks on our elections, as certified by U.S. intelligence agencies. Don’t await your retirement to stand up and address the truth of Trump’s betrayal of our country. f 
b1215 PROTECTING FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, with access to millions of Americans’ personal information, the IRS is one of the most powerful agencies in Washington. Unsurprisingly, the agency has failed to secure that information from abuse. That is why I was pleased to see the Treasury Department announce it will no longer require certain taxexempt organizations to file personally identifiable information about their donors as part of their annual returns. While the House has taken steps to limit schedule B disclosures of the tax exempt organizations, the latest announcement from the IRS will exempt some 45,000 nonprofits from the reporting rule, including conservative organizations, but also unions and social welfare groups. Today, one’s political views can spark passion, hatred, even refusal of service at a restaurant. In an extreme case, your life may be threatened at baseball practice. Regardless of political affiliation, Americans should feel comfortable donating to a cause or candidate of their choice without living in fear of reprisal. I applaud the administration’s recent action and encourage this Congress to join their effort and defend the First Amendment rights of every American. 
PROTECT PENSION PLANS (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, last week in Columbus, Ohio, thousands of American retirees gathered to demand Congress act. Pension plans for more than 1 million retirees and union workers are in danger of collapse if something is not done soon. More than 60,000 Ohio workers alone could be impacted, and millions across our Nation face cuts in their earned retirement benefits. Retirees traveled from as far as Utah to Columbus as the Select Committee 
on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans held a field hearing to hear from retirees and employers. Their jobs ranged from coal miners to truck drivers to candymakers. As Perry Rapier from Pennsylvania said at the rally: ‘‘We’ve worked and sweat and toiled into this position, and we’ve earned that pension; and now to know that somebody that’s sitting behind a desk is willing to take that from us, we’re going to stand up and fight for that.’’ Retirement security is an American value. Workers’ pensions must be protected. Congress must find a solution to their earned pensions and give security to the retirement years of millions of hardworking Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge this Congress to act before this Congress ends. 
RULE OF LAW (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, countries that were part of the old Soviet Union are now growing democracies, but they face ongoing interference from the new Soviet Union, Russia. The country of Georgia is one such country. Georgia and those nations that were behind the Iron Curtain are now working to improve their democracies. A strong economy allows these countries to grow and stand on their own. That is why Georgia and others seeking real freedom must work harder on the international stage to keep American and Western money flowing. This money goes away if the rule of law is not followed. It is simple: Follow the rule of law; prosperity follows. Don’t follow the rule of law; poverty follows. This simple act will make our world more free. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF KURT VON TILLOW (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Kurt von Tillow. Kurt attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1. Kurt enjoyed owning his own trucking company in northern California. He would often go to concerts and was happy to be going to the Route 91 festival with a number of his relatives. Kurt and his wife loved to take golfing trips to Scotland and Ireland, and they loved to boat. He was fun, friendly, and liked to enjoy good beer. Kurt is remembered as being very patriotic and a big family man. I would like to extend my condolences to Kurt von Tillow’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieves with you. EXPRESSING AGREEMENT WITH STATEMENT OF Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, my question was: How do I get it cleared now that I am on the floor? Can I ask the Republicans if they would agree to it? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The clearance comes from the leaderships and the committees. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. RES. 996, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 996 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of H.R. 6147, the Department of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019, which also includes the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2019. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us is the third installment of the House’s effort to pass all 12 appropriations bills on the floor for fiscal year 2019. We have previously passed appropriations bills covering Energy and Water, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Defense. Today we turn to the work of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittees on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies and Financial Services and General Government. Once the House finishes its work for the week, we will have passed 6 of the 12 appropriations bills across the floor. Overall, the package covers $58.65 billion in spending. Of those funds, $35.25 billion are allocated to the Interior bill and $23.4 billion to the Financial Services bill, which is equal to the enacted level for fiscal year 2018 for both of these bills. The package represents many months of work by the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Speaker, as I have so often said when discussing appropriations bills, today’s package represents the most fundamental duty of Congress, to fund the government and keep it open each year to continue to provide our constituents with the services they need and deserve. But, importantly, this package also fulfills an additional duty of Congress to the American people: its fiscally prudent stewardship of the taxpayers’ hardearned money and to ensure that we appropriately prioritize where and how to spend taxpayer dollars in the most efficient manner. Mr. Speaker, the Interior and Environment Appropriations bill funds critical programs at the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other crucial areas. Among the areas of greatest importance, the bill includes $3.9 billion for the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service to fight wildfires. It includes $500 million for payments in lieu of taxes to help local governments, and it provides $2.6 billion for the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund. b1230 It funds the National Park Service at $3.25 billion, an increase of $53 million over fiscal year 2018. Of great import, not only to my home State of Oklahoma but to Native Americans all across the country, the bill honors our treaties and trust agreements by providing $5.9 billion for the Indian Health Service and $3.1 billion for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Education. The bill also fulfills an additional commitment to the American people by including provisions to rein in the runaway regulatory agendas of parts of the Federal Government. It reduces the EPA’s regulatory programs by $228 million. It also fully repeals the economically damaging waters of the United States rule and includes various prohibitions preventing the EPA from overregulating agricultural operations and exempting livestock producers from EPA greenhouse gas requirements. The Financial Services and General Government portion of this bill provides $23.4 billion across several important accounts. It provides $7.7 billion for the operation of the Federal court system. The bill also provides funding to help combat the opioid crisis, including $415 million for the Office of National Drug Control Policy, including $280 million for highintensity drug trafficking areas and $118 million for other Federal drug control programs. It encourages responsible spending at the Internal Revenue Service by appropriating $11.6 billion for IRS activities, an increase of $186 million over fiscal year 2018, and continues stringent oversight and protections of taxpayer dollars that have been included in recent years. The bill provides $1.66 billion for the Securities and Exchange Commission and will help grow the economy by providing $737 million, or full funding, in capital to various Small Business Administration loan programs. Perhaps most importantly, this bill includes provisions that will finally bring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under congressional oversight. Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, when the CFPB was created in the original DoddFrank Act, the new agency was allowed to operate without congressional oversight because it did not receive appropriations. Consequently, since its inception, unelected bureaucrats at the CFPB have been allowed to operate entirely without congressional supervision. Today’s bill will remedy that and will ensure that the CFPB falls under congressional authority, oversight, and supervision once and for all. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. The package before us represents a fulfillment of our most important responsibility as Members of Congress and provides appropriate funding in two divisions: Interior and Environment, and Financial Services and General Government. I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their months of work in making this bill a reality and cheer their efforts on moving forward to completion of the fiscal year 2019 appropriations process. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, the measures included here aren’t just bad, they are dangerous. Take the Interior Appropriations bill. It would put the health and safety of Americans at risk by slashing funding to address climate change and enforce environmental safeguards. The EPA, the agency tasked with fighting carbon emissions, is cut by $100 million. That is especially ironic since the majority was completely unwilling to rein in the wasteful spending by its former Administrator, Scott Pruitt. This is someone who spent $43,000 on a soundproof phone booth, but the majority was silent. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is cut by $65 million. That is after Republicans cut it by a third in the last fiscal year. As many of my colleagues know, I have been a champion of the LWCF, especially the stateside grant program where States provide a 50 percent match to grants that create more recreational and green open spaces in our districts. The people in communities in nearly every congressional district in the country have benefitted from these grants. We should be increasing, not cutting, LWCF. There is even language in the bill that would repeal a rule designed to protect our wetlands and waterways. State revolving funds were cut by $300 million, a $150 million cut to clean drinking water and a $150 million cut to clean water projects like water treatment and sewage programs. Mr. Speaker, the American people rely on Congress to make sure that the 
water they drink is clean. What is going on with this bill? As always, Republicans have again attached several poison pill provisions that undermine the health and safety of our communities and the environment. Every year—every year—provisions like these weigh down this bill. Mr. Speaker, when will my Republican friends realize that harmful provisions like this are why the bill has to become law? I am especially outraged to see what the majority has done with the Financial Services Appropriations bill, especially after what we saw on Friday. That is when some of our worst fears were confirmed. As part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced charges against 12 Russian military intelligence officers. They were accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee, hacking Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign, and hacking the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The website of a State electoral board was also hacked. Voter information was stolen. Even the vendor of voting equipment was targeted for a cyber attack. And those individuals involved in administering elections were also targeted. These charges are proof that our Nation, that our very democracy, is under attack. No troops were sent into combat. Not a single gun was fired. Instead, an adversary turned the internet into a battlefield. That is the new face of warfare in the 21st century. Although the methods were different, this Congress should be responding the way we always have, by putting partisanship aside and putting our country first by doing whatever it takes to ensure we are not left vulnerable again. But, Mr. Speaker, how is this majority responding? By using the Financial Services Appropriations bill to zero out funding for grants that help protect our election systems from cyber hacking. That is a cut of $380 million compared to what Congress enacted in fiscal year 2018. The wolf is at the door, and my Republican colleagues are inviting it inside for dinner. This is insane. The President tweeted, shortly after the election: ‘‘Unless you catch ‘hackers’ in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking.’’ Well, Mr. Speaker, it may be hard, but it is not impossible, because we now have a 29page indictment from President Trump’s own Justice Department providing the roadmap. The indictment goes into extraordinary detail outlining how Russia successfully hacked into our election systems, how candidates and committees were successfully targeted—not by China or somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds, as the President suggested, but by Russia, by Vladimir Putin. It is mindboggling that even after this indictment, after Russia’s meddling was laid bare, the President did not stand up to Putin. He held a summit with him instead. He even told CBS News, in an interview before his sit down, that he ‘‘hadn’t thought’’ about raising the issue with Putin during their talk. It gets worse, Mr. Speaker. British investigators believe that current and former agents of the same Russian military intelligence service accused of disrupting our 2016 elections are also likely responsible for the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England, earlier this year. Sadly, it is no surprise that the President didn’t stand up to Putin. He never does. When President Trump was asked whether he was a friend or a foe, he recently called Putin a competitor instead, like this was all some kind of real estate deal. A President who calls the free press, journalists in the United States, ‘‘the enemy of the American people’’ time and time again is unwilling to call the leader of Russia a foe or even an adversary. It is disturbing. What kind of hold does Vladimir Putin have on this President, Mr. Speaker? So much so that the President basically blamed the United States for much of the tensions between the two countries. The President even deflected when asked whether he trusts the American intelligence community or Putin. The President may be satisfied by what he called Putin’s strong and powerful denial of election interference, but I am not, Mr. Speaker. I am disgusted. It is clear that an effort to defend our democracy will have to be led by Congress, because it is not coming from the White House. But we are not leading when we make it easier for an adversary like Russia to attack us again. That is retreating. I remember learning about the separation of powers in school, how the legislative branch is a separate but equal branch of government. The Founders designed it that way so we could provide a check on a President. Mr. Speaker, when are the Republicans in Congress going to provide a check on President Trump? He is cozying up to Putin instead of holding him accountable for hacking our election. As Senator SCHUMER suggested, we should be increasing sanctions on the Russians. The Republican majority should be joining us, demanding the President’s national security team that accompanied him to Helsinki testify before Congress, detailing what they know. It is past time that Republicans end their attacks on the Department of Justice, on the FBI, and on the special counsel. Already, 32 people and three companies have been either indicted or pleaded guilty under Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. Now, we will see where else it leads, but there is already evidence of clear wrongdoing. He should be able to finish his work without any interference. The majority should move a bill from Representative NADLER to the floor immediately, so we can protect the special counsel’s investigation from the whims of this President. President Trump has shown he is willing to fire his FBI Director. Mr. Speaker, are the Republicans really going to stand by and make it possible for him to fire Robert Mueller, too? This majority must also demand the President insist that the 12 Russians named in Friday’s indictment are sent to the United States to stand trial. The President should have already done this when he met with Putin, but, apparently, it was an afterthought. Maybe he was too busy admiring the strongman to stand up for his country’s interests. I wish I were optimistic that Republicans would take these commonsense steps to protect our country, but I am not, not after what we saw in the Rules Committee last night. The majority failed to make in order an amendment by Representative QUIGLEY . It was germane. But they failed to make in order his amendment that would provide $380 million to help States protect election systems from cyber hacking. This funding should not have been zeroed out in the first place. Do my Republican friends see what is happening? Is anybody paying attention over there? Russia meddled in our election, and your response is to zero out funding for an election security assistance program. Then, when we pointed it out and tried to put the money back, you blocked the amendment. You won’t even allow us to debate the program. That is the smallest step that they could have taken. Instead, we can’t even have a debate on the floor. Apparently, the Republicans are afraid of having a fair fight about protecting our democracy, and it is indefensible. If the President isn’t willing to do more to prevent Putin from doing it again, then this Congress has an obligation to act, not gut the accounts that provide for election security. We can start standing up by voting against this rule and the underlying legislation. It doesn’t do nearly enough to protect our Nation against hostile foreign powers hellbent on attacking our democracy. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and then I will turn and yield time to my friend from Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I just want to quickly respond to my friend’s concern about the Election Assistance Commission funds. As I am sure he is aware, that was the last installment last year, this fiscal year, of a $365 billion authorization that was actually done back in 2002. Currently, 39 percent of those funds for this year are still available to the 
States. Actually, 19 States have yet to submit any sort of request, and the legislation itself has not been reauthorized. If the authorizing people reauthorize it, I am sure we will revisit this matter. It also worth noting that anything added will be available only from October 1, and the election is 5 weeks after that. So the idea that we are going to do something in that period of time, I think, is a bit of a red herring. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS), my good friend from the Seventh District. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying legislation that provides funding for programs vital to the environmental and economic health of my home State of Ohio and the entire Great Lakes region. This appropriations bill includes full funding, $300 million, for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. b1245 The GLRI is an important program focusing on critical environmental restoration projects, such as improving water quality, fighting invasive species, and repairing native habitats for wildlife. The Great Lakes region supports over $200 billion in economic activity and is the world’s largest source of fresh water. Restoring and preserving the Great Lakes is good for our environment and good for the thousands of Ohioans whose livelihoods depend on a clean Lake Erie. Additionally, the bill repeals the burdensome Obamaera waters of the United States rule, a bureaucratic overreach that expands EPA jurisdiction beyond congressional intent and in contradiction of court rulings. When the Obama administration announced this rule, I heard from farmers, ranchers, local and State governments, homeowners, and private property rights advocates. All agreed the Obama administration went too far, creating confusion and uncertainty about what would and would not fall under EPA jurisdiction. By repealing the flawed 2015 WOTUS rule, we are committing to work with State environmental agencies as partners in protecting our Nation’s natural resources, rather than as adversaries. Finally, this appropriations bill maintains funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, a valuable tool for State and local agencies to finance projects to ensure our municipalities have access to clean and affordable water. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and passage of the legislation to keep the Great Lakes healthy and continue to improve our Nation’s water quality. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to my good friend from Oklahoma who I think said that 39 percent of the funds are still left in the Election Assistance Commission account. Well, we still have 5 months left in this year, and does anybody here really believe that these attacks are going to stop? And shouldn’t we have money in the pipeline? Shouldn’t we be prepared not just for this election, but for the election after that? This is about protecting our democracy, and I don’t understand why this is controversial. But no matter what you think about Mr. QUIGLEY ’s amendment, it was germane. It was relevant to this bill. It should have been brought up, and we should debate it. All we are asking for is a fair fight. We are deeply concerned about what is happening to our country, and we are especially concerned in the aftermath of President Trump’s disastrous meeting with Vladimir Putin. Mr. Speaker, now is the time for Congress to stand unified with the unanimous assessment of our intelligence community. I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question. If we do, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative ENGEL ’s resolution, H. Res. 999, which follows word for word yesterday’s statement by Speaker RYAN affirming Russia’s attacks on our democracy. This is the second time today that I am going to give my Republican friends a chance to go on the Record and agree with the words of the Republican Speaker of the House, PAUL RYAN. Defending our democracy shouldn’t be controversial. Agreeing with the Republican Speaker that ‘‘the United States must be focused on holding Russia accountable’’ should not be controversial. I would say to my friends, take yes for an answer. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) to discuss our proposal. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding to me, and I want to strongly identify with his remarks. Mr. Speaker, I led the Foreign Affairs Committee Democrats last week urging President Trump to cancel his meeting with Vladimir Putin because I knew this was going to turn out badly, but, frankly, I didn’t know how bad it would be. It turns out President Trump embarrassed himself and disgraced our Nation. Standing on foreign soil, the President of the United States questioned America’s intelligence community; he attacked America’s law enforcement with bizarre conspiracy theories; he lobbed petty political insults; and he did it all while standing next to America’s chief rival, Vladimir Putin. When faced headon with the question, ‘‘Who do you believe?’’ President Trump sided with Putin and affirmed Putin’s brazen lies. This is the tyrant who directed attacks on America’s democracy in an effort to elect Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. And, as Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said, these attacks are still ongoing. As we all know, Putin is a ruthless leader who seeks to tear down our alliances, undermine Western unity, and destroy democracy. With the eyes of the world on them, it is plain that the President of the United States is now Putin’s willing accomplice, Putin’s poodle. It is outrageous; it is disgusting; it is dangerous; and it has been met with near universal condemnation. Here is what Speaker RYANsaid just yesterday, and I agree with the Speaker: 
There is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy here and around the world. The President needs to understand that Russia is not our ally. There is no moral equivalency between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals, and that Russia must be held accountable. 
That is what our Republican Speaker said, and I agree with him. I have introduced this resolution so that the entire House can go on record agreeing with the Speaker, affirming that we stand with the Speaker. I deeply regret that a member of the Speaker’s own party just blocked the House from speaking with one voice and taking up this resolution by unanimous consent. We must reject the President’s capitulation to Putin; we must stand up for American leadership on the global stage; and we must demand that this administration treat Russia like the enemy it is. How can you treat Putin better than U.S. intelligence? It just boggles my mind. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for the immediate consideration of the resolution I have just introduced, which is H. Res. 999. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would advise that all time has been yielded for the purpose of debate only. Does the gentleman from Oklahoma yield for purposes of this unanimous consent request? Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I am reiterating my earlier announcement that all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only, and I will not yield for any other purpose. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma does not yield; therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to defeat the previous question. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, Federal administrative law judges, commonly known as ALJs, decide over 1 million cases a year, covering everything from appeals of Social Security Disability and Medicare claims to disputes over black lung benefits and securities law violations. These are cases that can touch virtually all of our constituents. On July 10, President Trump issued an executive order that will undermine the quality and independence of ALJs and the impartiality of the decisions they render. It does so by changing the hiring standards for judges. The current standards guarantee that ALJs are fully qualified to serve. The executive order will replace those standards with a far more lenient system that would allow ALJs to be hired based on ideology or cronyism rather than experience and competence. This executive order, titled, ‘‘Exempting Administrative Law Judges from the Competitive Service’’ will open the door for the politicization of a profession that plays a defining role in the lives of millions of American families. Representatives ELIJAH CUMMINGS , DAVID CICILLINE , JOHN LARSON , and I filed an amendment to defund the executive order and preserve the impartiality, independence, and competence of administrative law judges. Unfortunately, the majority on the Rules Committee has refused to allow Members of Congress to vote on or even debate our amendment. The longstanding hiring standards for ALJs were designed to guarantee the legitimacy of their decisions. ALJs were required to have 7 years of trial level experience as an attorney and successfully complete a sixpart examination. To insulate judicial decisionmaking from agency political pressure, the examination was conducted by the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which maintained a list of the highest scoring applicants from which agencies can then select their candidates. All of that was jettisoned by the President’s executive order, which removes ALJs from the competitive service. Now the only requirements are that an ALJ must be a lawyer in good standing. This executive order is strongly opposed by a broad spectrum of organizations. The Federal Administrative Law Judge Conference, a nonpartisan, voluntary professional association, warns, ‘‘now, any agency that wants to hire an ALJ needs no approval from OPM and can hire any attorney regardless of skill or experience. The new appointment process will not afford members of the public the due process and fair hearings they deserve. Instead, it will give agency insiders and political loyalists a job for which they may not be qualified but for which they will feel indebted.’’ The Association of Administrative Law Judges, which represents over 1,600 ALJs at the Social Security Administration, states that the President’s order ‘‘will politicize our courts, lead to cronyism, and replace independent and impartial adjudicators with those who do the bidding of political appointees.’’ The American Association for Justice writes: ‘‘It is important for all cases overseen by ALJs to have a neutral ALJ handling the case, not someone who may be beholden to a particular political party, hostile to a particular agency or program, or otherwise politically motivated in their decisionmaking.’’ The American Bar Association writes: ‘‘By giving agency heads sole discretion to hire ALJs who will be making determinations affirming or overturning decisions rendered by that agency, the executive order has the potential to politicize the appointment process and interfere with the decisional independence of ALJs.’’ The American Bar Association says further that: ‘‘Nothing less than the integrity of the administrative judiciary is at issue here. That is why it is critical that Members of Congress have an opportunity to participate in the debate and help formulate a solution. The first step is to halt implementation of the executive order.’’ Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the letters from those four organizations. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR JUSTICE , July 13, 2018. Hon. MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMEMBER OF CONGRESS : The American Association for Justice strongly opposes the Trump Administration’s recent executive order regarding the hiring and role of federal Administrative Law Judges (ALJs). An impartial judiciary is central to the strength of our justice system, and ALJs should not be involved in the political process. The ALJ executive order threatens the American people’s right to a neutral arbiter and right to due process. It is vital that ALJs be independent and impartial. This executive order eliminates the process of selecting ALJs based on their qualifications, and instead allows these positions to be filled by political appointees without any meritbased procedure. Administrative proceedings should continue to be overseen and adjudicated by ALJs who are qualified, such as attorneys with at least seven years of litigation experience and who are vetted by the Office of Personnel Management, as was the prior process. The appointment of ALJs with no experience, who can gain appointment solely due to their financial contributions or other political incentives so long as they possess a bar license, could result in unfair, biased rulings for millions of Americans. The executive order will have a devastating effect on a vast array of cases, including cases before the Social Security Administration, Department of Labor, National Labor Relations Board, and Department of Health and Human Services. There are about 2,000 ALJs that decide over a million cases each year. Approximately 1,600 of those ALJs hear Social Security disability cases and render almost 700,000 decisions each year at the hearing level. It is important for all cases overseen by ALJs to have a neutral ALJ handling the case, not someone who may be beholden to a particular political party, hostile to a particular agency or program, or otherwise politically motivated in their decisionmaking. AAJ is especially concerned about bias against claimants seeking Social Security disability benefits. We urge you to oppose this executive order and to support Amendment #55, sponsored by Reps. Scott (VA), Cummings, Cicilline and Larson (CT), to Division B of Rules Committee Print 115–81 (H.R. 6147). We greatly appreciate your support in protecting the American people’s right to due process. Sincerely, LINDA LIPSEN , CEO, American Association for Justice. 
[News Release From the Association of Administrative Law Judges, July 12, 2018] STATEMENT BY HON. MARILYN ZAHM, PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ADMINISTRA TIVE LAWJUDGES (AALJ) ONWHITE HOUSE  EXECUTIVE ORDER ON ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES  President Trump’s executive order this week regarding the hiring and role of federal administrative law judges should concern anyone who has a Social Security Card. This is an assault on due process for the American people who have a right to a neutral arbiter. Currently, 1,600 of the roughly 2,000 federal ALJs hear Social Security disability cases. The president’s order calls for replacing the current merit system used to hire judges with a courtpacking plan that will allow agency heads to hand pick judges who hear cases at the Social Security Administration and dozens of other federal agencies. This change will politicize our courts, lead to cronyism and replace independent and impartial adjudicators with those who do the bidding of political appointees. This is a decision that should be reversed. If allowed to go forward it would be the equivalent of placing a thumb on the scale of justice. 
AMERICAN BARASSOCIATION , Chicago, IL, July 16, 2018. Hon. PETESESSIONS , Committee on Rules, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. JAMES MCGOVERN , Committee on Rules, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SESSIONS AND RANKING  MEMBER MCGOVERN : On behalf of the American Bar Association and its over 400,000 members nationwide, I write to urge you to support consideration of Representative Scott’s proposed amendment to Division B of Rules Committee Print 115–81 during floor consideration of H.R. 6147. The amendment would prohibit the use of funds by the Office of Personnel Management or any other executive branch agency for the development, promulgation, modification, or implementation of the July 10, 2018, Executive Order Excepting Administrative Law Judges from Competitive Service. The Executive Order (EO) is an illconsidered and legally vulnerable response to the Supreme Court ruling in Lucia et al. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, which held that SEC Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) are considered ‘‘inferior officers of the United States’’ and therefore require appointment consistent with the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution. The EO, which eliminates the nationwide, uniform, competitive selection exam process 
and weakens existing qualifications standards, gives each agency head the unfettered authority to hire ALJs based on criteria established by the agency. In fact, the EO specifically states that it gives agencies greater discretion to assess critical qualities, including the applicant’s ‘‘ability to meet the particular needs of the agency,’’ which are, of course, left entirely to the agency to define. There is no doubt that changes to the current selection and appointment process for ALJs are required by Lucia, but we believe that those changes should be instituted after there has been an opportunity for Congress and the public to engage in an open and deliberative process that considers possible options for curing the constitutional defects in the current process. We hope this includes an examination of ways to assure that safeguards remain in place that respect the unique adjudicative role of ALJs and retain public confidence in the system. If adopted, the Scott amendment, by halting implementation of the EO, would allow congressional and public engagement on this important issue. A fair and impartial administrative judiciary is indispensable to our system of justice. Vast numbers of Americans are involved in administrative adjudicative proceedings every day, and the decisions rendered by ALJs in these proceedings often affect their lives in profound ways. By giving agency heads sole discretion to hire ALJs who will be making determinations affirming or overturning decisions rendered by that agency, the EO has the potential to politicize the appointment process and interfere with the decisional independence of ALJs. Nothing less than the integrity of the administrative judiciary is at issue here. That is why it is critical that Members of Congress have an opportunity to participate in the debate and help formulate a solution. The first step is to halt implementation of the EO. We therefore urge you to allow the House to vote on the Scott amendment when it deliberates on H.R. 6147. Sincerely, HILARIE BASS, President. 
[From the Federal Administrative Law Judges Conference, July 11, 2018] EXECUTIVE ORDER ON ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES LOWERS STANDARDS AND REDUCES  INDEPENDENCE  WASHINGTON , DC.—On July 10, 2018, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order eliminating the competitive process to select nonpartisan Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) based on qualifications demonstrated through courtroom experience and an examination process. These positions may now be filled by inexperienced political appointees. Nearly two thousand ALJs decide over a million cases each year. Americans are far more likely during their lifetime to encounter a federal ALJ than any other type of judge. Since 1947, administrative proceedings, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), have been objectively overseen by presidents from both political parties without partisan interference. In enacting the APA, Congress ensured that agency judges must be both highly qualified and independent from political influence. Until yesterday, federal agencies hired ALJ candidates with 7 years of litigation experience. Candidates were ranked based on their scores on a sixpart examination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Now, any agency that wants to hire an ALJ needs no approval from OPM and can hire any attorney regardless of skill or experience. The new appointment process will not afford members of the public the due process and fair hearings they deserve. Instead, it will give agency insiders and political loyalists a job for which they may not be qualified but for which they will feel indebted. As judges, we are disappointed that a merit selection system that produced nonpartisan judges for seven decades was eliminated by the stroke of a pen. We call for presidential reconsideration or Congressional intervention to restore the ALJ merit selection system. The Federal Administrative Law Judges Conference (FALJC), established in 1947, is a nonpartisan voluntary professional association for federal ALJs. FALJC is dedicated to improving the administrative judicial process, presenting educational programs, and ensuring due process and judicial independence in administrative proceedings. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, by refusing to allow this amendment to come to the floor, the majority has denied Members the opportunity to have an important debate on this issue. Rather than avoiding the issue, the majority should be standing up for a just and impartial review process. Rather than refusing a vote on this amendment, the majority should be joining us in holding the administration to account. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed by the majority’s opposition to consider this issue that affects so many constituents across the country. I, therefore, urge Members to oppose the rule. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the majority has filled the Financial Services Appropriations bill with antiHome Rule riders that meddle in local D.C. affairs. Not one or two provisions, which would be bad enough, but five. One would prohibit D.C. from using its own funding to carry out Initiative 77, which eliminates the tipped minimum wage. That is an initiative, by the way, that passed recently with 56 percent of the vote. Last night in the Rules Committee, the Republicans even made in order the Palmer amendment. This would prevent the District from implementing its local individual responsibility requirement. If passed, this amendment would increase health insurance premiums and cause residents to lose access to affordable coverage options. Mr. Speaker, why are the Republicans continuing to interfere in local D.C. government? Where are the small government conservatives? Where is the Freedom Caucus? They should be outraged by this meddling. Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES  NORTON filed amendments to strike these riders and spoke in the Rules Committee last night. She asked a pretty simple question: Don’t my Republican friends have their own districts to worry about? Her amendments complied with the rules of the House, yet they were blocked from getting a vote on the floor. We can’t even debate them here. The majority is afraid of a fair fight. We are long past the point of breaking the record for being the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of America. This is more of the same for the most closed Congress in history, but that doesn’t make it right, Mr. Speaker. When will the Republicans finally say, ‘‘Enough’’? So enough with the meddling in D.C. affairs, enough with overriding the will of local residents, and enough with the restrictive amendment process. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ). b1300 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the ranking member for his very cogent remarks that go to the principle of the matter before the House today. I have to say, I come to the well of the House in outrage against the attack on the District of Columbia by the Republican House. In 1973—that is 45 years ago—Congress passed the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which created the locally elected government. Understand that after the Civil War, it is Republicans who first gave the District of Columbia the right to have its own home rule, a tradition that this Republican majority has repudiated. According to the Home Rule Act, a central purpose of the act was, and I am quoting, ‘‘to relieve Congress of the burden of legislating upon essentially local District matters.’’ President Nixon, who signed the bill, affirmed that purpose himself when he wrote—and I am going to quote President Nixon: ‘‘One of the major goals of this administration is to place responsibility for local functions under local control and to provide local governments with the authority and resources they need to serve their communities effectively. The measure I signed today represents a significant step in achieving this goal in the city of Washington. It will give the people of the District of Columbia the right to elect their own city officials and to govern themselves in local affairs. ‘‘As the Nation approaches the 200th anniversary of its founding, it is particularly appropriate to ensure those persons who live in the Capital City the rights and privileges which have long been enjoyed by most of their countrymen. But the measure I signed today does more than create machinery for the election of local officials. It also broadens and strengthens the structure of city government to enable it to deal more effectively with its responsibility.’’ Signed, Richard Nixon. How do we square those words and the bipartisan Home Rule Act with a fiscal year 2019 appropriation bill which is the most significant abuse of congressional power over the District 
of Columbia since Republicans took control of the House in 2011? This bill repeals two D.C. laws and prohibits the city from spending its local funds, consisting only of local taxes raised in the city by local citizens, not a cent of it raised from this House, to either carry out or enact three laws. I filed amendments to strike all five of these undemocratic riders. Even though my amendments complied with the House rules, the Rules Committee did not make any of them in order, afraid, apparently, of debate on this matter before the people of the United States. Adding insult to injury, the Rules Committee piled on by making in order two additional antiHome Rule riders. If this bill stands, there will be a record seven antiHome Rule riders in it. Some of these riders come back every year, and yet we have been able to get them off every year in conference. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POLIQUIN ). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia an additional 1 minute. Ms. NORTON. This Republican majority endlessly touts their support of local affairs—a lie, as long as that principle stops at the District of Columbia border, and Republicans interfere with the spending and laws of a local jurisdiction not their own. Pardon me for being angry, but I remind my colleagues that the 700,000 American citizens who live in the District of Columbia pay the highest Federal taxes per capita in the United States and have fought and died in every war since the Revolutionary War; yet they have no voting representation on this House floor, even on their own appropriation, and no representation in the Senate at all. These riders amount to bullying that takes unfair advantage of the District of Columbia. No wonder we are making headway on our D.C. statehood bill, but it should not take statehood. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia an additional 30 seconds. Ms. NORTON. It should not take statehood for any district to be treated with respect and fairness. We have been successful in cleaning up the D.C. appropriation in the past, and we will be successful again. The people of the District of Columbia will not let you get away with bullying them after they have paid their Federal taxes the way every Member of this House has. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how many more speakers the gentleman has on his side. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close whenever my friend is. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left to close. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, when Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein announced the charges against 12 Russian military officers on Friday, he said: ‘‘We need to work together to hold the perpetrators accountable, and we need to keep moving forward to preserve our values, protect against future interference, and defend America.’’ Well, Republicans and Democrats working together need to come together to defend this country. That shouldn’t be controversial. It should be common sense, and it should be above partisanship. But we have a President who probably tunes out anything the Deputy Attorney General says because President Trump is too busy attacking the special counsel investigation on a near daily basis. He calls it a witch hunt and even worse, and that is despite the fact that the Justice Department has issued more than 100 criminal counts against more than 30 people and three companies. Numerous associates of the President have pled guilty, and his former campaign chairman is sitting in jail today. Or maybe more accurately, Mr. Speaker, the President attacks Robert Mueller’s investigation because of that fact, because the special counsel could be closing in on even more possible wrongdoing. Where there is smoke there is usually fire, and there is at least a lot of smoke so far. So, given the President’s action, we need, as a Congress, to step it up. We need to hold Russia accountable and prevent this kind of hacking from ever happening again because the President, who is unwilling to say even publicly that he trusts the American intelligence community over Vladimir Putin, will not. Mr. Speaker, I am asking my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can go on record as disagreeing and condemning what the President did in Helsinki, which was such a betrayal of our values. And what we are asking to do is to vote to endorse the Speaker of the House, the Republican Speaker of the House’s words. I mean, quite frankly, we should have a resolution of disapproval on the floor, or maybe even a censure, given what the President did. But we are saying let’s come together in a bipartisan way, and let’s make a statement that we disagree with what the President did, what his behavior was. So vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question, and vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Let me make a couple of comments in response to my friend. It was the last President, not this President, who told Russian leaders that he would be more flexible after an election. It was the last President, not this President, who said Russia was not a geopolitical threat and chastised Mitt Romney when he raised it in the campaign. And it was the last President, not this President, who drew a red line and then refused to enforce it. If you actually look at the RECORD , it is this administration and this party that, frankly, has begun to restore America’s defenses after years of neglect by the last administration. That is not good news for Russia. It is this administration that has also encouraged and cajoled some of our allies to increase their defense level up to the levels that they, themselves, had committed to. It was this President that twice enforced red lines in Syria. It was this Congress that administered everincreasing penalties on Russian sanctions. So I think if you look at the actions, the actions are pretty impressive. But I want to actually get back to the matter at hand, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule. Today’s bill represents the next step toward fulfilling our primary obligation as Members of Congress: funding the Government of the United States. Although not perfect, the bill before us today will lead to the completion of the House’s work on two more appropriations bills. We will provide funding for important government activities like fighting forest fires, funding the Indian Health Service, enforcing tax and securities laws, and funding our national parks; and we will ensure that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is no longer allowed to operate without congressional oversight. While I look forward to completing our work and passing all 12 appropriations bills, this legislation represents an important step along the way to fulfilling that goal. I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their work. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to 
offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the question on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, which the Chair will put de novo. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. ELECTING A MEMBER TO CERTAIN STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House Republican Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 1000 Resolved, That the following named Member be, and is hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the House of Representatives: COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT  REFORM : Mr. Cloud. COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE , SPACE , AND TECHNOLOGY : Mr. Cloud. 
Mrs. M CMORRIS RODGERS (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be considered as read. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Washington? There was no objection. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 717) to promote pro bono legal services as a critical way in which to empower survivors of domestic violence, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 717 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent Act of 2018’’ or the ‘‘POWER Act’’. 
The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall use existing funds to carry out the requirements of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 717, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to be voting on S. 717, the Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent Act of 2018, otherwise known as the POWER Act. The POWER Act directs that each year the chief judge in each judicial district across the country hold at least one event in partnership with domestic violence service providers or volunteer lawyer projects to promote pro bono legal services for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Lawyers play a critical role in combating domestic violence. Not only do government prosecutors enforce criminal laws, but in the civil realm, lawyers may provide legal representation in matters such as civil protection order applications which ultimately help keep victims safe from their abusers. While victims are able to apply for these orders pro se, as this bill makes clear, legal representation increases the possibility of successfully obtaining a protective order against an attacker, which prevents further mental and physical injury to a victim and his or her family. One study has found that 83 percent of victims represented by an attorney were able to obtain a protective order, whereas only 32 percent of victims without an attorney were able to do so. Federal courts already promote many pro bono programs in their judicial districts and have access to local attorneys who may be able to volunteer to work with domestic violence victims. This bill not only requires a public event in each Federal judicial district for every year during a 4year period, it also requires an additional public event to be held every 2 years during the 4year period in districts that contain Tribes or Tribal organizations that specifically focus on encouraging pro bono legal services for Indian or Alaska Native victims of domestic violence. I would like to thank Senator SULLIVAN from Alaska for introducing this bill and shepherding it through the Senate. And I would like to thank Mr. KENNEDY from the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts for introducing this bill in the House. This is an extremely important issue, and I hope it will make a real difference in increasing legal services to victims. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the POWER Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 717, the Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent Act of 2018, or the POWER Act as, as amended. It seeks to promote pro bono legal services as a way to empower survivors of domestic violence. We all know that domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking affect the people of every single one of our communities in profound ways. Alas, the demand for legal services to assist victims who find themselves in a domestic violence situation far exceeds the availability of free or lowcost legal services, and yet research consistently shows, as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee just pointed out, that if you have got a lawyer, then you are significantly better equipped to prevent future domestic violence than if you don’t have a lawyer. In fact, those victims who have a lawyer are three times more likely to be able to prevent future violence than those who are without a lawyer. So this measure is consistent with the spirit and the goals of the legal profession. The American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct encourage attorneys to bridge the gap in representation by providing free legal services to people who are unable to pay them, and this is an especially 
vulnerable and often destitute population. One bar jurisdiction that has stepped up in a very profound way to meet this professional standard and challenge is the District of Columbia Bar which has an extraordinary and successful project created by Karen Barker Marcou and Kathleen Buhle Biden which is called the DC Volunteer Lawyers Project. They just celebrated their 10th anniversary. They have 2,100 lawyers who have signed up pro bono to offer their assistance to victims of domestic violence, stalking, date rape, and so on. They serve more than 1,000 clients every single year. They were just given an award by the D.C. Bar for the work that they have put together solely through the volunteer efforts of lawyers in the District of Columbia Bar. So this legislation would modestly and simply direct the chief judge in each Federal judicial district to organize at least one public event annually for the next 4 years to promote pro bono legal services to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in the districts in which the court serves its jurisdiction. In the case of districts containing an Indian Tribe or Tribal organization, chief judges in partnership with the Tribes would have to lead at least one public event promoting such pro bono legal services during each 2year period. People who have experienced and survived these types of violence deserve and will benefit from all the information and assistance that can be provided in such public events. Too often survivors simply don’t know what resources are out there and are available to help them. S. 717 will help survivors of domestic violence vindicate their rights and protect themselves from future assaults which are still a scourge on the land. I support this legislation. Obviously, there is a lot more we can do. Congress should work to allocate resources to the recruitment, training, and placement of pro bono attorneys through the myriad of already existing bar association programs like the one in the District of Columbia. Of course, Congress should work to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act which provides an indispensable array of programs that help address domestic violence and sexual assault. We should not let the authorization for these important protections lapse. All of these efforts are important, and the measure before us today will support a comprehensive response to these types of crimes. I support this bill, and I commend my colleague, Representative JOEKENNEDY , for his leadership in authoring the House companion to the Senate bill. I want to thank the chairman for his leadership, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this legislation so we may bring it one step closer to enactment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ), who is the Republican Conference chair. Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the POWER Act. Survivors of sexual and domestic violence must know that they have a place to turn where they can step out of the shadows of abuse to find hope. To provide that hope, the POWER Act will bring more tools and resources to communities so that survivors can find access to legal services that they need. It will also encourage lawyers across the country to get involved in these cases, and it will help people break free from the dangerous cycle of abuse. No one should ever have to live in fear of being intimidated from seeking justice. The first step is making sure they courageously know where they can safely go for help. Today, to build on our work to make our communities safer, I urge my colleagues to join me in sending the POWER Act to the President’s desk to become law. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ), who is my friend and colleague. Representative JOEKENNEDY is not only a distinguished champion of the rights of women and a foe of domestic violence, but he is a former prosecutor who spent a lot of time in Massachusetts prosecuting domestic violence cases. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. RASKIN , for his kind words and for his leadership on this bill and legislation in bringing it to this point and for all of his efforts in combating domestic violence as well. I also want to thank my colleagues, in particular Congressman YOUNG ; Congresswoman MCMORRIS RODGERS , the Republican Conference Chair; Congresswoman TULSI GABBARD ; Congresswoman BROOKS ; as well as the chairman, Mr. GOODLATTE , for his leadership in making sure that this bill comes to the floor today; as well as Senator SULLIVAN from Alaska who is the original author of this legislation and has been working with me on this for the past several years. I am grateful for his leadership as well. Mr. Speaker, I remember far too many times in a courtroom as a State level prosecutor the challenges of bringing domestic violence cases to trial. I remember to this day talking to victims and seeing perhaps a paragraph in a police report and something that didn’t quite seem right; doing an interview with the victim and peeling back layer after layer after layer of isolation and of control, and of the creation of a state of dependence and of perpetual fear. b1400 I remember getting ready to try a case one day. The victim came in with her daughter. The victim had a black eye. She sat next to her husband, the defendant, throughout the entire morning of the case. She blamed the black eye on a newborn child who was sleeping in her bed. I remember watching countless efforts for a restraining order as the attorney badgered a victim, and watching a victim get so disenchanted with our court system that she said she would never come back. Standing in a courtroom, Mr. Speaker, with those survivors, you start to see our justice system through their eyes. It is, at times, an endless and impossible maze where abuse and injustice is relived and replicated on every single occasion. That is why we as a Congress must ensure that no survivor is ever forced to stand alone before a judge, because we know and the data well proves that, oftentimes, these cases can be a matter of life and death. It is, in fact, the most predictable form of homicide we have in our Nation. We know how prevalent and pervasive it is. Nearly 8 million women are raped, assaulted, or stalked every year by a current or former intimate partner. We know that lowincome women and men are at higher risk of domestic violence and rape. We know that more than 80 percent of survivors with access to a lawyer successfully obtain restraining orders, while those who stand alone obtain one less than onethird of the time. Mr. Speaker, passing the POWER Act will begin to restore our sacred promise of an equal justice system. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ), the dean of the House who has been a real champion in combating domestic violence. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kindness in recognizing me, but also for bringing up this bill. I also thank Mr. KENNEDY  for his support. This is Senator SULLIVAN ’s bill, although I had a companion bill on the House side. What has been said here prior to me is really what we are addressing. Domestic violence is a terror on our society. No one is immune to it, be they rich or poor, whatever race or ethnic group you may belong to. It cuts across the aisle. Unfortunately, far too many Alaskans have firsthand experience in this reality. In 2015, a survey of Alaskan victims found that, out of every 100 adult women, 40 experienced intimate partner violence, 33 experienced sexual violence, and one in three adult women in Alaska have been a victim of stalking in their lifetime. Not only must we do more to prevent this epidemic from growing, we must also do more to help the survivors, and that is what the POWER Act does. It allows the victims to have pro bono 
legal representation from the legal profession to take and present their cases. I believe this bill is well and long overdue. If I can refer to what Mr. KENNEDY  said, I have a little experience myself. A dear friend of mine, who was a friend of my late wife, used to get beat up by her husband because he was drinking all the time. My wife asked: Why don’t you just hit him? She said: Well, I couldn’t do that. Violence begets violence. Well, my wife at that time was very young, and she said: Well, I wouldn’t put up with it. About 2 weeks later, there was a knock on our door and my wife answered. She opened the door and our friend said: I did it. She said: What did you do? The woman said: My husband beat me up. He passed out, and I hit him with a frying pan when he was asleep. I wouldn’t suggest that solution, but she had no other recourse, no way to be represented legally to go to the courts. I am saying this should be passed. To have representation in the courtroom is a good piece of legislation. Again, I thank Mr. GOODLATTE for bringing this bill to the floor, Mr. SULLIVAN , and all those people involved with it. It is long overdue. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Domestic violence is a reign of terror for people who are caught up in it. Historically, of course, domestic violence was bolstered by a compliant or indifferent, sexist criminal justice system and laws that were inadequate to the task. Even today, in many parts of the world, from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia to India, women are still subject to domestic violence and to indifferent and hostile treatment from their legal systems. But in America, we have advanced far beyond that. Still, there is a lot more we can do to address the problems of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. One thing we know we can do is to get lawyers for women when they have been attacked. The information and the assistance that they will get from the lawyers will help them get out of a desperate situation. The information and assistance that we provide under this legislation in public events will indeed advance the power of survivors to get out of domestic violence, dating violence, or a stalking reign of terror. We support enactment of this legislation as well as the additional efforts we have mentioned to provide counsel for survivors, to promote their ability to access the resources of our criminal justice system. We look forward to working with Chairman GOODLATTE and other colleagues on the other side of the aisle for rapid passage of this important, bipartisan measure and further legislative efforts that will strengthen the position of people who are victims of domestic violence. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this is a very good bill. I thank the Senator from Alaska, Mr. SULLIVAN , for working with me and my staff. On the minority side as well, I thank Congressman KENNEDY , Mr. RASKIN , and the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. This is truly a bipartisan effort to help educate people who are the victims of domestic violence about better ways that they can protect themselves and avail themselves of good representation in court. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WESTERMAN ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 717, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EXPRESSING SENSE OF THE HOUSE THAT THE NATION FACES A MORE COMPLEX AND GRAVE SET OF THREATS THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 995) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Nation now faces a more complex and grave set of threats than at any time since the end of World War II, and that the lack of full, ontime funding related to defense activities puts servicemen and servicewomen at risk, harms national security, and aids the adversaries of the United States. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on the resolution under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Wyoming? There was no objection. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my resolution, H. Res. 995, which expresses this House’s commitment to providing the full, ontime funding our men and women in uniform need to defend our Nation. This week and next, Mr. Speaker, we will be spending time on this floor discussing the devastating impacts nine 
consecutive continuing resolutions have had on our military’s readiness and on our ability to deter and defend against our adversaries. Despite the fact that this House has consistently, and normally in a bipartisan fashion, completed our work on time, we have repeatedly seen partisan politics, particularly in the Senate, prevent the Congress from delivering a funding bill to the President’s desk on time. In fact, since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, the House has never failed to pass a Defense Appropriations bill on time. Just a few weeks ago, we passed H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019, with an overwhelmingly bipartisan 359–49 vote. Today’s resolution, Mr. Speaker, expresses the sense of this House that failing to provide full, ontime, stable funding increases the risk to our servicemembers and aids our adversaries. The resolution expresses our commitment to ending the funding uncertainty our military faces and urges the Senate to similarly complete its work so we can provide the ontime funding our armed services require. Mr. Speaker, we must stop forcing our men and women in uniform and their families to pay the price for our dysfunction. Today, Mr. Speaker, we will consider three resolutions. H. Res. 995, which I have introduced, acknowledges the unprecedented global threat environment we face and the negative impact these continuing resolutions have had on our military’s ability to confront this environment and deter and, if necessary, defeat our enemies. We will also consider H. Res. 994, offered by my colleague and fellow member of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. GALLAGHER from Wisconsin. Mr. GALLAGHER is a marine with two deployments to Al Anbar province in Iraq. His resolution details the negative impact of CRs and funding instability on the readiness of the U.S Marine Corps. Finally, Mr. Speaker, we will consider H. Res. 998, offered by Mr. WITTMAN of Virginia, chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. WITTMAN ’s resolution lays out the damage that the CRs and unpredictable funding have done to the United States Navy. Next week, Mr. Speaker, we will consider resolutions addressing the impact of unstable funding on the United States Air Force and the United States Army. We know, Mr. Speaker, that not every Member of this body is on one of the defenserelated committees, but we also know that every Member of this body is committed to the security of our Nation. I take the opportunity today, along with my colleagues, to lay out in detail the threats we face and the impacts our actions in this House can have on our military’s ability to keep us safe. Reflecting on the challenges facing our Armed Forces, Secretary Mattis put it this way: ‘‘As hard as the last 16 years have been on our military, no enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of the U.S. military than the combined impact of the Budget Control Act’s defense spending cuts, worsened by us operating 9 out of the last 10 years under continuing resolutions.’’ Secretary Mattis went on to explain the consequences of Congress’ failure to provide reliable, ontime, sufficient funding: ‘‘Ships will not receive the required maintenance to put to sea; the ships already at sea will be extended outside of port; aircraft will remain on the ground, their pilots not at the sharpest edge; and eventually ammunition, training, and manpower will not be sufficient to deter war.’’ Not sufficient to defer war, Mr. Speaker. No experience, Mr. Speaker, has had a greater impact on me during my time as a Member of this body than having the Secretary of Defense testify in front of us as members of the Armed Services Committee and say that congressional abrogation of our constitutional duty to fund our military is putting our servicemembers at greater risk. While our military has suffered under this burden of continuing resolutions and dangerous policies of our previous administration, our adversaries have been making steady gains. Never before in recent history have we seen the gap between our capabilities and those of our adversaries widen at such a breathtaking pace—and not in our favor, Mr. Speaker. China is pursuing an aggressive strategy to overtake our military and economic advantage globally. They are developing technologies that are specifically targeted to diminish our ability to project our force. They are developing weapons systems against which we may not be able to defend. b1415 They have utilized deficiencies in our current CFIUS process to attempt to acquire critical U.S. technology. Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE have made significant efforts to embed themselves in the United States, putting our telecommunications networks and, potentially, our defense supply chain at risk. Militarily, economically, in cyberspace, in space, on land, in air, and at sea, the Chinese have made clear their objective is to achieve global preeminence, which means they must attempt to displace us. The Russians continue to modernize their nuclear arsenal, as they violate their commitments to us under the INF Treaty. They, too, are developing advanced and threatening weapons systems and attempting to exercise their hegemonic ambitions across Europe. They have violated the borders and sovereignty of their neighbors. In the words of the National Defense Strategy, they are making efforts ‘‘to shatter the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and use emerging technologies to discredit and subvert democratic processes in Georgia, Crimea, and eastern Ukraine.’’ They have attempted to subvert our own democratic processes, as we saw in last week’s indictment of 12 members of the GRU, Russian military intelligence. We have seen in Russia and China a return to great power competition, and 8 years of Obamaera policies facilitated these developments. At the same time, we continue to face significant threats from rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea. The Iranians benefited tremendously from the payments they received from the Obama administration, over $1.5 billion, when they entered into the Obama nuclear deal. This deal paved the way for a nucleararmed Iran with no real verification provisions, no complete disclosure of their past activity, no cessation of their enrichment activity, and it lifted restrictions on their ballistic missile program. President Trump was right to withdraw from this disastrous deal, but we are still living with the consequences of an emboldened Iran, enriched with U.S. taxpayer dollars and a pathway to a nuclear weapon. Their support for terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah has grown, while they continue to pose an existential threat to the State of Israel. The North Koreans, similarly, continue to pose a serious threat, Mr. Speaker, with an arsenal of nuclear weapons, an ongoing ballistic missile program, and continued pursuit of biological and chemical weapons. Despite recent success on the battlefield against ISIS, radical Islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat to our Nation. We have got troops deployed today, Mr. Speaker, around the globe in the fight against terrorism. As we face all of these threats, we are also living through an era of increasingly rapid technological development. The very nature of warfare is changing. The ability and the agility required to successfully respond to these threats requires funding sufficiency and certainty. Mr. Speaker, that certainty simply cannot be provided through continuous continuing resolutions. In the face of all these threats, Mr. Speaker, we in this body must resolve not to add to the risk our troops are facing. We must resolve to fulfill our constitutional duty and provide sufficient, ontime, reliable funding. It took many years for the readiness, manpower, and training crises we face to develop. We in this House and in the Senate must be part of the solution today and for many days and years into the future. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to read something that the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral John Richardson, said before the House Armed 
Services Committee last year in a hearing about the damage of continuing resolutions: ‘‘I have a hard time believing,’’ he said, ‘‘that I am sitting before you now to discuss the potential that we might take steps to make our sailors’ missions more difficult, to give our adversaries more advantage. . . . ‘’ Think about that, Mr. Speaker. That is what this debate is about. That is what this resolution is about. Insufficient, unreliable funding gives our adversaries an advantage. We must not be part of that any longer. We must resolve to get our work done on time, in the House and in the Senate, and to fulfill our constitutional obligation. We must, in this Congress, Mr. Speaker, be worthy of the sacrifices our men and women in uniform make for us every day. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, to begin with, the resolution that is presented before us is 100 percent accurate, and I completely agree with it. We have had uncertain funding for going on almost 8 years now for the Department of Defense. It has been a series of continuing resolutions, two government shutdowns, multiple threatened government shutdowns, and an unbelievable amount of uncertainty. From one month to the next, the Pentagon does not know how much money they have to spend. That uncertainty, without a doubt, has undermined our ability to provide an adequate national security for this country. So I agree with the maker of this motion that budget certainty would help enormously in terms of preparing our national security—well, preparing the men and women in our Armed Forces to face the threats that are in front of us. Beyond that, there was a lot said in the opening remarks there that I don’t quite agree with. Also, it is really important to sort of understand the context. Why are we in this situation? Why do we have budget uncertainty year after year? I don’t agree that it is simple incompetence or Congress just isn’t feeling like doing its job. We have deepseated differences of opinion about where to spend our money, and also, we have no fiscal policy as a country. Well, that is not true, actually. Our fiscal policy is really rather clear. We want a balanced budget; we want tax cuts; and we don’t want to cut spending. Everything you need to know about why we have this problem can be contained in three votes that the United States House of Representatives took over the course of about a 4month period. As I tell you about these three votes, I want you to know that 134 Republican Members of Congress voted for all three of these things. Number one, a roughly $2 trillion tax cut. Number two, a budget deal that increased spending by $500 billion. Some of that was for defense; a lot of it wasn’t. Then, in the ultimate irony, a week later, those 134 Members of Congress, Republican Members of Congress, voted for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. They want to cut taxes by $2 trillion; they want to increase spending by $500 billion; and they want a balanced budget. And, oh, by the way, we are roughly $22 trillion in debt and running up a deficit that is projected to go up over $1 trillion going forward. That is not a responsible fiscal policy. Now, I serve on the Armed Services Committee with all of my colleagues who are here today, and I hear the same things that Congresswoman CHENEY hears about how our military is suffering under the uncertainty. The readiness crisis is 100 percent real. It is getting better as we have gotten some funding the last couple years, but it is still a major challenge. But the reason for all of that is because of decisions that are made on the front end. You can’t cut taxes by $2 trillion— after, by the way, over the course of the 15 years prior, we had already cut them by multiple trillion dollars—and then stand up and say DOD doesn’t have enough money. You cut revenue and then complained that you don’t have enough revenue. It doesn’t really make sense. The second point that I would make is it is not just the Department of Defense that is suffering under budget uncertainty. There are a whole bunch of different examples. I won’t go into all of them, but the entire discretionary budget suffers under this uncertainty. And one big chunk of the discretionary budget is infrastructure, the bridges and roads and airports and a whole bunch of other things that basically enable our economy to function, which generates revenue and helps pay for things like national security. Also, we have got bridges collapsing all over the country. There are, literally, United States citizens who have died as a result of our lack of investment in infrastructure. So it is not just the Department of Defense. If we are going to address the uncertainty, if we are going to address the problems with dealing with our national security strategy, we have to address fiscal policy. For going on 8 years now, we have been having this conversation in the Armed Services Committee, and most times my Republican colleagues sternly rebuke me for raising issues that are supposedly not directly related to the Armed Services, saying: We are the Armed Services Committee. We are not here to talk about the debt or the deficit or infrastructure or any of that other stuff. Well, it all goes together, and what we as a congressional body have to do is come up with a plan that actually makes sense, that actually there is money for. If we do that, then we can have the stability for the Department of Defense. Now, I will tell you, if we are $22 trillion in debt—and the deficit is projected to be pretty close to $1 trillion this year and quickly north of $1 trillion going forward—we are going to have to deal with that problem or there is not going to be as much money as we’d like for defense or infrastructure or education—or anything, for that matter. So we have to address the fiscal irresponsibility of our budgeting process across the very long period of time, and certainly we can’t keep cutting taxes. Now, as far as what does that National Security Strategy look like, as was described, we face an incredibly complex threat environment. I agree with that. I don’t agree that getting rid of the Iran nuclear deal so that Iran can pursue nuclear weapons with absolutely no inhibition whatsoever is a step forward in the right direction, nor do I agree that sitting down with Kim Jongun and agreeing, basically, to back off of a whole bunch of things and getting nothing in return—I know that, in the President’s mind, North Korea is denuclearized, but they are not. They haven’t taken a single, solitary step in that direction. Lastly, the final point I want to make is the complex threat environment that we face is extraordinarily difficult. I will tell you one thing of which I am 100 percent confident. There is no way that, on our own, the United States of America can confront that threat environment. We need allies. We need friends. We need countries that are willing to work with us to meet the national security threats that we face, which is why the trip that the President just took is so troubling. He spent the first part of it telling our allies, basically—sorry, I can’t say that on the floor—just saying that he didn’t need them, insulting them over and over and over again, allies that we are really going to need to meet the threats not just from Russia, but China, the terrorism threat that was described. Our NATO allies are going to be crucially important to that, and the President, at one point, said he’s not even sure why we are in NATO, insulted the EU and insulted all of our allies, and then turned right around and sided with Vladimir Putin against our intelligence communities, against our Justice Department, on the subject of Russian interference in our election. So, in a complex threat environment, you don’t want to make it easier for a country like Russia that threatens us and make it more difficult for countries ranging from Canada to Germany to Great Britain, who actually want to work with us, to meet that threat environment. So, on that point, we need more allies, and we certainly don’t need to take the side of a dictator who 
is threatening our country over our own intelligence agencies. That is not in the best interest of national security. Overall, we have to have a fiscal policy. We can have the argument about the defense budget all we want, but if we keep cutting taxes and have no policy whatsoever to get our budget even close to under control, we are not going to have the money to spend on our national security needs or other things. Now, I will close it out with this. General Mattis, Secretary Mattis, likes to say, ‘‘We can afford survival.’’ That is a nice phrase. Unfortunately, it is a little bit unclear on what it means because, what do you have to spend to survive? By and large, DOD doesn’t engage in that sort of blackandwhite way of looking at it: We spend this money, we survive; we don’t spend this money, we die. What they do, and what they’ve said over and over again, is they manage risk: If we don’t spend the money here, that increases the risk by this amount. I think that is a better way of looking at it. It is not a matter of whether or not we can afford survival, because we don’t know exactly what China is going to do or Russia or any of these other folks are going to do or how we are going to manage it. It is a matter of managing risk. It is very true that, if we continue to have an uncertain defense budget— heck, I would submit, if we continue to have an uncertain fiscal policy and an uncertain infrastructure budget, we are increasing the risk of our country’s ability not so much to survive but to prosper and live in a peaceful world. So this resolution is fine. It is horribly insufficient to actually give us the certainty and predictability in our budget that we need. To get there, we need to honestly address the fiscal challenges that our Nation faces and come up with a coherent fiscal policy that takes into account all the needs of our country in a balanced and coherent way so that we manage those risks in the best way possible and in the best interests of the American people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and just want to say I enjoy very much the opportunity to serve with my colleague, Mr. SMITH, on the Armed Services Committee, and I appreciate his support for this important resolution. b1430 We disagree on several points. I know that Mr. SMITH knows that the defense budget is not what is driving the debt in this country. I don’t disagree that we need a fiscal policy and that we have got to address our fiscal concerns, but it is also the case that we have the votes, that we have the ability, as we have done in this House and as they could do in the Senate. We saw, in the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Defense Appropriations bill passed out 30–1. So it is a bipartisan bill that we ought to pass. We passed it across this floor. We ought to pass it across the Senate floor. We ought to get it to the President’s desk so that he can sign it, instead of being in a situation where we are holding it hostage to a whole range of other issues and concerns. Mr. SMITH and I do have big disagreements. You know, to talk about somehow that the tax cuts are impacting the Defense budget ignores the history of the fact that the Defense budget was being strangled when Barack Obama was in office. And as far as I know, nobody is accusing President Obama of cutting taxes too much. So the challenge that our military is facing and the challenge of reliable sufficient funding isn’t directly tied to tax policy. I think what we have got to do is decouple these things. If we don’t get the funding for the military right, as Mr. SMITH said—you know, Secretary Mattis has said we can afford survival. Another way to say that is if we don’t get this right, nothing else we do will matter. And the situation is so serious and so significant that if we let ourselves one more time go down the path of holding this funding hostage to other concerns and other issues, basically holding our men and women in uniform hostage, I would submit that we are not doing our job, and we are not fulfilling our constitutional obligation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ), my colleague from the Rules Committee and from the Armed Services Committee. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 995. As many of us have stood on this floor and said, We have planes that can’t fly, ships that can’t sail, and troops that can’t deploy. Under the Obama administration, we saw an alarming trend where we allowed our Armed Forces to be hollowed out, and we allowed a critical readiness crisis to develop. Over the last 2 years, members of the House Armed Services Committee and others have fought tirelessly to ensure our military gets the level of funding they need, not only to fix our current readiness crisis but also to build up our force to a size to match the current threat environment, which is the most complex one we have faced since World War II. While I am proud of the work we have done so far to raise the top line Defense number, there is another critical piece to the puzzle. Continuing resolutions are just as detrimental to our national security as the Budget Control Act caps. Every day we don’t pass the Defense Appropriations bill, we are denying resources to our servicemembers and making it harder for them to do their job. Continuing resolutions and budgetary uncertainty also end up costing the taxpayers more money. The Secretary of the Navy has said that the Department of Navy alone wasted $4 billion since 2011 because of continuing resolutions. That is $4 billion of real money that could have been used to fund more ships, more planes, or more maintenance. Under a continuing resolution, the Department of Defense and the services are not allowed to enter into any new contracts. Every year we have delayed the timelines of scheduled maintenance availabilities and procurement schedules. All of these things are crucial to maintain deployment rotation and ensure the U.S. presence is felt around the world. Compare this to your personal finances. For half the year you are able only to pay your current expenses, like car payments and utilities. You know you will get money later in the year for new things you want to buy or invest in; however, you don’t know how much you will get or whether you will get it. Does that sound frustrating and ineffective? We have the world’s greatest military. Yet, we are hamstringing them with an irresponsible funding cycle. Let me put this in very blunt terms. The inability of Congress to pass government funding bills on time has endangered the health, safety, and lives of our servicemembers. Just look at the aviation accidents and recent collisions of Navy ships. These incidents can be blamed, at least in part, on the readiness crisis. As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility here. We are not the ones on the front lines and deployed around the world, but we play an integral role: getting those servicemembers their funding on time. In a time where we face great power competition with Russia and China, radical Islamic extremism in the Middle East, and Iran and North Korea, there is no shortage of national security priorities. Here, in the House, we have passed our Defense funding bill on time yet again, but we need our colleagues in the Senate to follow suit. I know it is a priority for my Alabama colleague, Senate Appropriations Chairman RICHARDSHELBY , to get our military funded, so I hope we can do our job responsibly and on time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, let’s not let petty political games get in the way of funding our Nation’s military, protecting our servicemembers, and ensuring the safety and security of the American people. Let’s pass this resolution and demonstrate our strong commitment to passing a Defense funding bill before the end of the fiscal year. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just a couple of quick points. The Department of Defense budget is 18 percent of the overall Federal budget, and you would be a pretty bad businessperson if you looked at your books and said that a thing that takes 18 percent of the budget has nothing do with the deficit. It all adds up piece by piece. It absolutely is a big part of what contributes to us having a deficit and a debt, so we cannot ignore what we spend on Defense and how it impacts everything else. Now, you can make that policy decision that, you know, defense is just so much more important than infrastructure or healthcare or education or Social Security or Medicare or whatever, but to say that it doesn’t impact the debt and the deficit is not, well, fiscally accurate. And second, as far as tax cuts are concerned, yes, President Obama cut taxes repeatedly and by way, way too much and contributed to this problem. Most notably was in 2012 with the permanent extension of all of the Bush tax cuts. So, we did that, and then with the stimulus package back in 2009, there was about a $400 billion tax cut. We have repeatedly, in this Congress—and I didn’t vote for any of that. We have repeatedly in this Congress prioritized tax cuts over the men and women who serve in the military. That is what I find so ironic. We hear all these complaints about how we are underfunding the military, the complaints about readiness, and what the gentleman from Alabama said, when he talked about the impact that this is having on the men and women who serve, he is absolutely right. The continuing resolutions are devastating to the way we try to function within the Department of Defense. I will again submit that they are also devastating to every other aspect of our discretionary budget, and that should not be ignored. But to cut taxes by trillions upon trillions of dollars and then look up and say, Gosh, how come we don’t have enough revenue to fund our defense is hypocritical. All I am asking is: Make a choice. If, in fact, we need to spend the amount of money on DOD that you are all saying we are, then let’s raise the revenue and pay for it, okay. That is fine. That is a choice. But to both say, we are going to give away massive tax cuts primarily to the wealthiest people in this country, who, by the way, have been doing quite well for quite some time, and then come up and say, Gosh, it is just so irresponsible that we are not funding defense, that is not consistent and it is not a fiscal policy. And, again, I will come back to the fact that this is all very well and good. I mean, what all these resolutions are saying is if we could just pass the Defense Appropriations bill, then everything would be fine. We have a $4 trillion plus budget. We have multiple layers of problems here. If we do not address the underlying fiscal issues that we are facing that I have described, then the men and women who serve in our military will face the brutal uncertainty that is very accurately described by my Republican colleagues over and over and over again. We have to address the underlying issue, not just come out and make empty statements about how we want to support our men and women in the military after putting in place a budget and a tax policy that makes it next to impossible to do that. We have to deal with the issue up front so that we are in a position to actually provide what my colleagues have said we need to provide. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate very much my colleague’s support for this important resolution. I look forward to having his support as we go forward on these resolutions that lay out very clearly how important it is to fund our men and women in uniform. He and I have very serious and significant disagreements over tax policy. I believe—I know that the private sector is the engine of growth in this economy; that tax cuts, in fact, generate economic growth, and economic growth generates revenue; that if you really want to deal with the debt in this Nation, then you have got to generate additional revenue. The way to do that is not by taxing people more. It is by letting people keep more of what they earn so they in fact can reinvest so we can see the kind of economic growth we need. But I would say my colleague’s focus on that issue today points out the problem that we have been facing. We face a number of critically important challenges in this body and in the United States Senate, but we have got to ensure that we don’t hold our men and women in uniform hostage while we deal with those other issues. We are, today, not at a time when we have got an international environment that is one in which we can feel safe in our predominance, in which we can feel safe in our ability to continue to project our power. We are in one where the threat to us is growing, and it is significant. When you have got servicemen and women, when you have got service chiefs, when you have got the Secretary of Defense telling us things like: our adversaries have weapons systems we might not be able to defend against, that policies and budget processes and votes that are undertaken in this body are increasing the risk to our men and women in uniform, those are things we have got to pay attention to. And I would say we have an obligation to pay attention to those things that is higher than any other obligation that we have. We have to commit, Mr. Speaker, to fulfilling that constitutional obligation to providing full and on time funding for our troops. And, Mr. Speaker, I would like to close today with something that General Dunford said in his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee earlier this year. He said: ‘‘The Joint Force must continue to receive sufficient, sustained, and predictable funding for the foreseeable future to restore our competitive advantage and ensure we never send our sons and daughters into a fair fight.’’ Every single time we have to deploy our forces, Mr. Speaker, we must ensure that they have everything they need to prevail. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution. I urge a continued focus on completing the Defense funding process on time and getting the bill to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 995. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EXPRESSING SENSE OF THE HOUSE THAT THE UNITED STATES NAVY’S TOTAL READINESS REMAINS IN A PERILOUS STATE Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 998) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States Navy’s total readiness remains in a perilous state due to high operational demands, increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and deferred maintenance all while the Navy is asked to do more with less as financial support for critical areas waned in the era of sequestration and without consistent Congressional funding. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 998 Whereas Navy readiness could further deteriorate in areas such as training, ship construction, ship repair, and deployability if Congress does not provide stable funding for the Department of Defense; Whereas the USS Fitzgerald, a United States Navy destroyer, collided with a container ship while transiting through Sagami Bay near Japan on June 17, 2017, resulting in the deaths of seven sailors and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage; Whereas the United States Navy’s investigation of the USS Fitzgerald collision concluded that the event was ‘‘avoidable’’ and that numerous failures included failure to plan for safety, failure to adhere to sound navigation practice, failure to execute basic watch standing practices, failure to properly use available navigation tools, and failure to respond deliberately and effectively when in extremis; 
Whereas the USS John S. McCain, a United States Navy destroyer, collided with an oil tanker while transiting through the Straits of Singapore on August 21, 2017, resulting in the deaths of 10 sailors and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage; Whereas the United States Navy’s investigation of the USS John S. McCain collision concluded that the crew suffered from a ‘‘lack of preparation, ineffective command and control, and deficiencies in training and preparations for navigation’’; Whereas the Navy the Nation Needs, the United States Navy’s plan for building and sustaining a lethal, resilient force through balanced investments across readiness, capability, and capacity, explicitly states a need for 355 Battle Force ships, yet the Navy’s 30 year shipbuilding plan peaks at only 342 Battle Force ships in 2039 before a predicted decline; Whereas an efficient and supported industrial base will be vital to building and maintaining a 355 ship Navy; Whereas over the previous 5 decades, 14 defenserelated newconstruction shipyards have closed, 3 have left the defense industry, and only 1 new shipyard has opened; Whereas stable and predictable funding allows for Navy leaders to properly forecast their missions and adhere to the Optimized Fleet Response Plan while also enabling industry partners to prepare for ship repair work at the most competitive prices to the United States Government; Whereas China’s shipbuilding industry, according to a Naval War College professor, is poised to make the People’s Liberation Army Navy the world’s second largest navy by 2020, and, if current trends continue, a combat fleet that in overall order of battle is quantitatively on par with that of the United States Navy by 2030; Whereas China continues to develop forward operating bases on manmade islands in the South China Sea and, by doing so, consolidate its control over the strategic corridor between the Indian and Pacific Oceans through which 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on the resolution under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Wyoming? There was no objection. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN), who is on the Armed Services Committee, to discuss his resolution. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking the gentlewoman from Wyoming for all of her efforts, as well as all of my colleagues for their continued effort to do everything possible to assure the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act and the Defense Appropriations bill prior to the end of the fiscal year. That is key. We have heard testimony about how money is wasted and uncertainty has led us to where we are today. Without that, we must do everything we can to assure passage of both of those bills. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 998, which expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States Navy’s total readiness remains in a perilous state due to high operational demands, increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and deferred maintenance all while the Navy is asked to do more with less as financial support for critical areas waned in the era of sequestration and without consistent congressional funding. We have heard that laid out. We agree on both sides that this has created the uncertainty that creates the situation we found ourselves in today. I think it is important to define what the term ‘‘Navy total readiness’’ truly means. The Navy conducted an independent Strategic Readiness Review composed of retired Navy admirals, as well as current senior civilian executives in the aftermath of the tragic USS Fitzgerald and USS McCain collisions. This Strategic Readiness Review identified institutional deficiencies that have developed over a long period of time resulting in a weaker Navy. Factors that contribute to total Navy readiness include: the total number of assets—we know them as ships— manning and training, that is, in particular, personnel, in how well they perform their jobs; equipping and maintaining, that means providing sailors gear and maintaining ships; command and control, which means establishing clear lines of leadership and funding; and operations, which is the tempo at which our men and women in uniform execute their missions. b1445 If one or all of these total readiness factors are lacking, the Navy will suffer. Unfortunately, that is the situation we find ourselves in today. But we didn’t arrive here by accident. I believe we have a tendency to respond to the crisis of the day rather than prepare for longterm strategic problems with corresponding solutions. Make no mistake about it, our adversaries are looking in the long term. Don’t think for a moment that China isn’t watching what we are doing and planning for where they will be not next week, not next month, not next year, but 10 years down the road, 20 years down the road, or a century down the road. The same with Russia, North Korea, and Iran. We need to do the same. After the Cold War and the Reagan administration came to an end, our Navy rapidly decreased in size. In the next few decades, funding levels became smaller and smaller. Tough cuts were made. The surface warfare community decreased their level of training, weakening the skills of their officers and reducing their capacity to effectively and safely perform their jobs as ship drivers and warfighters. Ships retired without replacements. Then, a nationwide financial crisis brought upon a shortsighted decision for sequestration, further crippling the Navy’s ability to take care of itself. Meanwhile, threats to the United States and operational tempo have not decreased. This created a situation where the Navy was overworked with too few resources. But our men and women in uniform never complain and never say they can’t accomplish their mission. They have the kind of resolve in doing the things this Nation asks them to do that this Congress should have in our commitment to providing them the resources necessary for them to continue the great job that we ask of them. But at a certain point, we all know we can’t continue to operate this way. Things begin to break down when they aren’t given the resources necessary. When their ships aren’t properly maintained, when training doesn’t take place at scheduled intervals to make sure they maintain that expertise that we need of them, sailors get stressed. When there are simply too many jobs to do and not enough time for people to do them, mistakes happen, costly mistakes. We won’t be able to reverse this trend immediately, but we can continue to make targeted, strategic investments in assets, training, and manpower to improve the Navy’s readiness. I am proud of the work that Congress has done in recent years, in particular, this year’s National Defense Authorization Act. The Housepassed NDAA adds a total of 13 battle force ships to the Navy’s inventory, makes critical investments in ship maintenance accounts to take care of the ships we already have, and takes strong action in regard to surface warfare officer training and command and control structures within the Navy. In consultation with our Senate counterparts, I am confident that we will deliver a bill that supports the Navy’s rebuilding efforts and the drive and the objective of a 355ship Navy. We cannot be complacent. Yes, we have the best Navy in the world, but we can be better. Our sailors and marines are the best on the face of the Earth, and they do a spectacular job, folks. But until they can walk on water, 
which someday they may be able to do, until they can walk on water, then we must continue to build them ships. It is imperative that this Congress supports the United States Navy financially and authoritatively in a manner that allows for reassuring our allies, maintaining global presence, and defeating adversaries when necessary. We must give our sailors and our marines the tools they need to succeed in an atmosphere and an environment that is even more challenging than it has ever been in the era of great power competition where we know that our allies are committing to not just countering the United States, but defeating the United States strategically. We must do nothing less than fully support our NavyMarine Corps team, giving them what they need not just for today, not just for next year, not just for within our purview of what this Congress has to do, but for years to come, for decades to come, and for centuries to come. For it is only with that, that we will be able to counter what our adversaries are doing every second of every day, and that is finding ways to defeat the United States strategically. We must do nothing less than the same. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s motion. It is part of the same discussion we had on the previous resolution, and I, as I said, completely agree. The lack of certainty on the continuing resolutions has negatively impacted the Department of Defense and our readiness. There is absolutely no question about it. The only thing I would debate today is: What is the best way to address that problem? How do we honestly get at it? These resolutions would suggest that if we simply fund defense and ignore everything else, then we will be fine. I think the way we got into this mess is instructive, and it is also going to be helpful in terms of how we get out of this mess going forward. It is worth noting, at the end of this, we talked a little bit about tax cuts and how one thing doesn’t have to do with the other. Tax cuts do not increase revenue. If they did, we would have the easiest job in the world. Also, a tax rate of zero would generate the most revenue for the United States Government. Obviously, that is not true. Now, it is true that tax policy, depending on how it is structured, can be more encouraging to investment. But we have never had lower tax rates on the Federal level than we have right now. After all of the Bush tax cuts, as I mentioned the tax cuts under President Obama, and now the tax cuts under President Trump, all of that has added up to a massive decrease in our revenue, and that is part of the equation. When President Bush put the tax cuts in place in 2001, for three consecutive fiscal years after that, we had a real dollar decrease in the amount of revenue that the Federal Government took in. Now, I also understand that taxes are always a burden on the people who have to pay them. If we are running government well, we are going to try to keep those taxes as low as is humanly possible. But if we are going to meet the needs of government, we have to raise revenue. What we have heard today is a very, very compelling case for how, over the course of the last decade, we haven’t met the needs of readiness within the Department of Defense. So, again, I simply urge us to make a choice here. If we want to cover these costs, then let’s raise the revenue and pay for it, and not pretend with this fantasy that somehow cutting the amount of revenue you take in is going to increase the amount of revenue you are going to take in. It doesn’t work that way, and it certainly doesn’t work in the current economic environment. The second thing I would say is, while national security is critically important, it is not the only thing we do that is important. And that is the other thing that worries me about this debate. We massively slash revenue so we have less money to play around with, then we make the case for why we need to massively increase our defense budget, and everything else that the Federal Government does just sort of drifts away as an afterthought. There are a lot of examples of this. I used infrastructure in the previous debate, and I will use a different example this time, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It is not in my district, but it is just across the street from my district in Seattle, Washington. It is doing incredible work right now on cancer. They are literally this close to, in some cases, curing it. They have come up with a new way for dealing with blood cancers—taking the white blood cells out of the body, reenergizing them, and putting them back in—that has achieved truly miraculous results. Fred Hutch gets an overwhelming amount of their funding from the National Institutes of Health, from the Federal Government. The budget that President Trump originally proposed last year would have cut funding for Fred Hutch by 75 percent. So while we are caring about national security, I think we also have to care about, well, curing cancer. It is not irrelevant. It actually saves lives and makes a difference. Lastly, I do, as I said earlier, worry about a view of the world that says, basically, the entire world is out to get us and we have to spend as much money as is humanly possible here in the United States to defend ourselves. We face threats. There is no question about that. We need a National Security Strategy and a national security budget to meet those threats. But in order to really create a safer and more prosperous world, we need to build alliances so that we are threatened by fewer people and so that we have more friends who will help us deter those who do threaten us. This is a point that Ms. CHENEY made that I completely agree with. Deterrence is incredibly important. In a place like North Korea, will Kim Jungun attack South Korea? Or will Iran attack? If they feel like they face a credible deterrent, they won’t, and the U.S. needs to be part of that. But our allies need to be part of that as well. Here, Russia is a great example. If Russia feels that NATO is weak, they will be emboldened. We already are seeing what they are doing in Ukraine. Estonia, Latvia, and other countries in Eastern Europe feel threatened by Russia. They need to know that the United States stands with our allies in Europe in order to deter that aggression and stop the war before it happens. That does not all fall on the United States defense budget. It falls on us having friends and allies who can back up our credible deterrence. Lastly, I just close by saying that we certainly face the threats we face. It is worth noting that we still, in the United States, spend way more money every year on defense than any of our adversaries, than any other country in the world. So it is not just a matter of money; it is a matter of having a smart strategy and spending that money well. I am pleased that—knock on wood— this is supposed to be the first year in forever that the Department of Defense will actually have a full audit of where they spend their money. But making sure the money that is spent is spent efficiently and effectively is also part of having an adequate national security budget. So I worry that, basically, we say, look, all we have to do is spend as much money as the Pentagon wants and everything will be fine. I think it is a lot more complicated question than that. Again, it comes back to having a sound fiscal policy and a sound national security policy. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my colleague, Mr. SMITH, is worried about a lot of things that really just aren’t the case over here on this side of the aisle. I agree with Mr. SMITH that weakness is provocative. We certainly need look no further than the Obama administration to see what happens when the United States is weak, to see what happens when the United States abandons its longstanding allies in the Middle East, including Israel, in order to provide funding and a pathway to nuclear weapons for the Iranians. We see what happened again and again and again. We saw what happened when the Obama administration, President Obama, decided to pull troops out of 
Iraq based on a timeline that he established in Washington, D.C., with no regard to the facts on the ground. We saw what happened. What happened was the rise of ISIS. So the problem that we have is, in order to deter, we have to make sure people understand that we are strong. We have lived through 8 years in the previous administration of apologies and weakness, and President Trump is turning that around. President Trump is making clear that people understand that no longer will that be the case, and that we, in fact, are going to be a Nation that stands up for what we believe in. I think it is also very educational, Mr. Speaker, to think about this debate we are having here today, this discussion, and to think about what it sounds like to men and women who are serving overseas and to their family members. What we are supposed to be discussing here and debating here is a resolution that expresses a sense of this body that the United States Navy has been hurt extensively by the lack of predictable funding. Instead, what we are getting is a lot of discussion and conversation about a whole bunch of other things that I am more than happy to debate. Mr. SMITH and I clearly have very different opinions about the economy and about what you have to do to generate economic growth in this economy. But that is not this resolution. I think we have the opportunity here, on a bipartisan basis, once and for all, to show that we are in a position where we are going to provide the kind of support that our men and women in uniform need. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting, and I agree, that the fundamental point is that we need to make sure that we adequately provide for, in this case, what the resolution is focused on, the Navy and the Marine Corps. As I have agreed throughout, adequate readiness for them is incredibly important. The CRs and the budget fiasco that we have had have not provided that. b1500 What I am trying to do is, rather than just an empty resolution that says, gosh, it would be great if we actually looked after you, to talk about the policy steps that are going to be necessary to actually do that. So I think that is an incredibly important part of this debate. Now, we can have every resolution all day long saying we want to cure cancer, we want to bring peace to the world. That is great. But what are the steps that are going to be necessary, in this case, to get to the point where the Navy and Marine Corps has the adequate funds that they need, or at least has predictability for what they are going to be able to do, because we have been having these discussions about how, gosh, we ought to do this, and then we don’t. I am trying to explain to the people who serve in the military and everybody else exactly why we don’t; instead of just giving them empty promises saying we would really like to help you, it just seems like year after year, somehow we don’t. We don’t, for all of the reasons that I have listed in terms of fiscal policy going forward. The other thing that I would like to point out is, Obama is no longer President. Donald Trump is President. And it seems to me like the one thing the Republican Party would want to do, they would love to have Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to kick around for, like, ever. But you are actually in charge now; so why don’t you be responsible for the policies that we have right now. And I just, I couldn’t believe that I heard the Representative from Wyoming say that America is now projecting strength. If there was ever an example of the President of the United States projecting the most embarrassing, abject weakness I have ever seen than what President Trump just did with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, I can’t think of it. And quite frankly, a number of Republican commentators that I have seen talk over the last 24 hours can’t think of it either. So I know it is incredibly comforting, from a policy perspective, to blame everything, absolutely everything, that has gone wrong in the world on President Obama, but he is not in charge anymore. Donald Trump is in charge. The Republican Party is in charge of the House and the Senate, and it is time to focus on policies that are going to move us forward and advance our interests; and not just feel comfort in the fact that we can sort of rewrite history and blame President Obama for absolutely everything that has gone wrong. It is a big, complicated, and difficult world for President Trump. It was for President Obama. We need to work together. We need to find ways to confront the challenges we face in a thoughtful way. Simply blaming the past president for absolutely everything isn’t going to get us there. So, again, let me just conclude by saying I completely agree. The issue that needs to be addressed is to make sure that we have adequate readiness for all of the men and women who serve in the military. We are only talking about the Navy and Marine Corps. As I think the gentlewoman said, we are going to talk about the Air Force and the Army next week. I think we should talk about all of them at the same time, because it is all equally important. But to get there, we need to have a strategy that is actually sustainable, instead of one that is based on hope. And to my mind, that is the worst thing that we can do to the men and women who serve in the military is say we want you to do all of this, and we don’t really have the funds to do it, so you are going to have to figure it out as you go. It would be far, far better to say, look, here is, realistically, where our budget is at. Here is, realistically, what we can do. Give them that task, and then they will be trained and equipped to do it, instead of being asked to do more than we are willing to provide money for. And it is one thing if this was just 1 year. It is one thing if we had a surplus. But we don’t. We have the budget environment that we have. So if we are going to get to the point where we adequately address readiness and address the issues that are being raised, then we need to be realistic about what we can do and, like I said, not keep blaming past administrations for things; actually try to implement policy right now that is going to make sure that we have the strongest national security policy we can, and that, again, the men and women who serve in the military, at a minimum, are trained and equipped to do the missions that we are asking them to do; that we don’t ask them to do missions that go beyond the funds that we provide for them. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. These resolutions do lay out the steps necessary. These resolutions make clear that the House has done its business, has done its work; we need the Senate to do its work, and we need to get these bills to the President’s desk. As I recall, Mr. Speaker, the only person that had hope as a policy was Barack Obama, and my colleague is right, that he is no longer—President Obama is no longer in the Oval Office. However, the damage that his policies did are so devastating and so longlasting that we are having to dig out from under it. That is why we are here today. We are here today because not only have continuing resolutions hurt the Department of Defense, the policies of the last 8 years have created a situation, geopolitically and militarily, where the work that we have got to do to undo those very illguided policies is significant and requires the kind of funding that we are talking about. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN ) to close. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming, again, for all of her efforts today to highlight this important issue about the commitment this Nation has to make to our military to make sure we rebuild this lost readiness, and H. Res. 998 is purely simply about that. Are we willing to state our commitment to our sailors and Marines about what we must do as a Nation to provide the resources that they need to do the job that we ask them to do? 
Are we willing to send a message to them that says, we are committed to standing by them for everything that has to happen to provide certainty to them so they know what their future holds? Are we willing to send a message to our adversaries to say that this Nation is committed to rebuild our Navy and Marine Corps team to make sure that they are a force to be reckoned with anytime an adversary of ours may think of acting badly around the world; that that Navy and Marine Corps team will be there. That is what this resolution is about. It is also sending a message to every one of our constituents; is this Congress committed to the right policies to making the commitment of resources to make sure that our Navy and Marine Corps team has what they need? That is another important part of this message. And will we, as a nation, assure that in the longterm we are committed to countering what our adversaries are doing? And we see that. We see that in scores. Whether it is something like submarines, where we are on path, by 2029, to be down to 42 total attack submarines, the most requested asset in the entire United States inventory. We are down to 42 submarines in 2029. China, by 2020, will have 70 submarines, total attack submarines and ballistic missile submarines, building five to six per year, so that by 2029, when we are at 42 submarines, attack submarines, and on the way to rebuilding Ohioclass submarines, the Chinese could be as high as 124 submarines. Now, quantity has a quality all of its own. This resolution today says, are we going to make the commitment to make sure that we can counter those adversaries? Are we going to be able to tell our children and our grandchildren that when we had the chance we made the commitment? We made the commitment to our sailors, to our Marines, and as we will next week, to our soldiers and our airmen, and subsequently our Coast Guardsmen, to make sure that they have what they need, that this Nation makes the commitment to assure that we have the future of our Nation’s defense well in hand. That is what today is about. I ask my colleagues to join me to make sure that we are willing to make this simple commitment. While it may be in words, those words will speak volumes to our sailors, to our Marines, to our citizens, and to our adversaries, that this Nation has an unshakable resolve to make sure that we have what we need to counter the threats abroad, and to counter anybody that thinks of threatening the United States, or our friends, or our allies, or would want to act badly. Today’s resolution is all about that, not just for today, but for decades to come. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BARTON ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 998. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EXPRESSING SENSE OF THE HOUSE THAT THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS BUDGETARY UNCERTAINTY ERODES MILITARY READINESS Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 994) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States Marine Corps faces significant readiness challenges and that budgetary uncertainty impedes the Corps’ ability to meet ongoing and unexpected national security threats, putting United States national security at risk. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on the resolution under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Wyoming? There was no objection. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLA GHER ), my colleague on the Armed Services Committee, to discuss his resolution. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend from Wyoming for yielding the time but, more importantly, for her leadership in this effort to highlight the devastating impacts when we fail to provide full, ontime, and robust funding to our military. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 994, which would recognize the significant readiness challenges facing the United States Marine Corps, and warn that budgetary uncertainty is undermining the ability of our Marines to do their vital work day 
in and day out in defense of this Nation. Since fiscal year 2010, the Active Duty Marine Corps has shrunk by 8 percent. Thanks to the work of this House, that figure is finally trending in the other direction, but there is still much more work to be done, all of which requires stable, robust, and on time funding. Seven years after the Budget Control Act we are still digging out from holes we dug ourselves. In hearing after hearing, we have heard military leaders make clear that they will face increased risk due to continuing resolutions and years of accumulated defense cuts. It can be all too easy to wave off these warnings. After all, our military and Marine Corps, in particular, has a ‘‘cando spirit’’ that is second to none. But increased risk isn’t just an abstract notion. It can have very real consequences. The more than 60 Marines who have perished in marine aviation accidents since 2011 are a tragic reminder of what increased risk looks like in practice. The new national security and national defense strategies marked sea changes in American security policy. With the new guidance that great power competition, and not terrorism, is the primary challenge to American national security policy. There is still much work to be done to ensure that the Marine Corps, along with the rest of the military, is best positioned to compete for the longterm. From contested entry to dispersed operations from austere locations to contingency response, the Marine Corps is facing great challenges and opportunities. The obstacles are many as increasingly capable adversaries are forcing the Marine Corps to reconsider longheld assumptions about amphibious landings and its ability to operate close to shore. In the face of these challenges, the Corps will have to do what it does best, innovate, and come up with new solutions to execute timeless missions. Ultimately, however, I am optimistic; not just because I was privileged to serve 7 years in the Marine Corps, and I know the quality of the men and women who continue to serve, but because of many other factors, including the simple geography of the IndoPacific, which is tailormade for the United States Marine Corps. As former adversaries learned on the islands of Guadalcanal, New Guinea, and Tarawa, the absolute last place on Earth you want to be is between a Marine and his objective. In the long run however, the only thing that can stop the Marine Corps is this body’s failure to do its job. If we fail to provide ontime, adequate, or predictable funding, we will undermine our Marine Corps’ ability to get the job done. This resolution takes a small step to recognize these challenges and commit to doing better. We owe our beloved Marine Corps nothing less. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we have had the broader debate, so let me just say very quickly I agree with the resolution brought forward by Congressman GALLAGHER ; that the budget uncertainty definitely impacts readiness and impacts the ability of Marines, in fact, the entire Department of Defense to fight adequately. I do believe, as I have said earlier, that we need to get at the underlying fiscal issues that have created that, taking us all the way back to the Budget Control Act and why it was passed in 2011 in the first place. We need to get at a fiscal policy in this country so that we can adequately and predictably fund, certainly the Department of Defense, certainly the Marine Corps, but I would say the entire Federal budget in a way that puts us in a much stronger position as a country. Mr. Speaker, I support the resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1515 Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking both my colleagues, Mr. WITTMAN from Virginia, Mr. G ALLA GHER from Wisconsin, and all of the folks on the Armed Services Committee, Chairman THORNBERRY , Ranking Member SMITH, as well as the folks on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, led by Chairwoman KAY GRANGER , for their tremendous work on these crucially important issues. I think that, again, Mr. SMITH has highlighted, really, the crux of this issue, and the crux of this issue is whether or not we as a body are going to recognize that we have the ability here and what we do here will determine whether or not we provide the support and the resources our troops need or whether we increase the risk they face. When we are facing a situation where we have had more servicemembers die in training accidents than in combat in the last year, that is an unacceptable and indefensible situation. Mr. Speaker, on this particular resolution, I want to thank my colleague from Wisconsin for introducing this resolution. As a marine, he understands better than most how what we do in this body impacts our men and women in uniform. H. Res. 994 highlights the vast readiness impacts we have seen in the Marine Corps over the past 9 years of continuing resolutions, sequestration, and overall budget dysfunction. We do not want to be in a position, Mr. Speaker, where the Marines are forced to continue to use aging or outdated equipment, or they don’t have the funds necessary to receive the training they require to undo this readiness crisis, or they don’t have the flexibility they need to respond to the fact that we have got an absolutely changing world of warfare. They need agility to do that, and that requires funds from this body. As my colleagues have said, we have made great progress. Over the past year, we have increased the defense spending caps for fiscal year 2018 and 2019, and we have agreed to fund the Department of Defense at $700 billion for fiscal year 2018. Mr. Speaker, we have got to get that done now for fiscal year 2019. The readiness crisis was not created in a single year, and it will take many years of effort to be able to address it. The bill that we considered in the House just a few weeks ago passed with over 300 bipartisan votes. I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that we can now, today, commit all of ourselves as a body and urge our colleagues on the other side of this building to ensure that the work that we do is worthy of the men and women in uniform who protect all of us, to ensure that we stay on track to get this bill passed by the Senate and to the President’s desk before the end of the fiscal year. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ) to close. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I quite agree with the sentiment expressed by my colleague, Mr. SMITH, that we do need to look at the overall budget picture. I think what has changed in that picture over time has been the amount of the budget consumed by mandatory spending, which is a very difficult problem. I concede that it is going to require men and women of good faith on both sides of the aisle to come together and have, if nothing else, an honest debate. The argument was also made that we spend more on defense than a large number of our competitors and our allies, combined, in many cases. I hear that a lot. That is true. It is also not that helpful of a statistic, as it ignores both the size of our economy, the relative size of our economy, as well as the unique nature of our global commitments. A more useful matrix of perhaps what we are spending as a percentage of GDP, we are still spending below the postWorld War II average on defense as a percentage of GDP. For example, during the 1950s, 8 years of peace and prosperity, we were spending closer to 10 percent of our GDP on defense. So I just think we need to be careful when we throw around different terms like this. And I welcome that debate. It is one we definitely need to have. I just would close by saying our Marines put their lives on the line on a daily basis. When we go to war, we cannot guarantee that everyone will come home safely, and the Marines know that. They gladly put their lives on the line. They take the risk, and they ride to the sound of the guns regardless. But I do think that we need to look at what we have the power to affect, and what we have the power to affect 
here as Members of Congress, regardless, actually, of who is in the White House, what we have the obligation to affect is to guarantee that we will never send our servicemembers into an unfair fight, that we will provide them with the training, the equipment, and the numbers they need to run up the score on the enemy with decisive and overwhelming force. Mr. Speaker, that is what this resolution is about, and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 994. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
JOBS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE ACT OF 2018 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 488) to increase the threshold for disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to compensatory benefit plans, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 488 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The amendment made by this title shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. TITLE IV—FAIR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL EXPERTS 
DEFINED .—For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘appropriate Federal banking agency’ has the meaning given that term under section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.’’. TITLE VIII—EXCHANGE REGULATORY IMPROVEMENT 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘International Insurance Standards Act of 2018’’. 
In developing international insurance standards pursuant to section 1403, and throughout the negotiations of such standards, parties representing the Federal Government shall, on matters related to insurance, closely consult, coordinate with, and seek to include in such meetings State insurance commissioners or, at the option of the State insurance commissioners, designees of the insurance commissioners acting at their direction. 
This title and the amendments made by this title shall not apply to any forum or negotiations related to a trade agreement. 
AND CFTC .—The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may each issue regulations requiring financial companies with respect to which they are the primary financial regulatory agency to conduct periodic analyses of the financial condition, including available liquidity, of such companies under adverse economic conditions.’’. TITLE XVI—NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR COMBATING THE FINANCING OF TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS 
Notwithstanding any effective date set forth in the rule issued by the National Credit Union Administration titled ‘‘RiskBased Capital’’ (published at 80 Fed. Reg. 66626 (October 29, 2015)), such final rule shall take effect on January 1, 2021. TITLE XVIII—OPTIONS MARKETS STABILITY

In 
making such revision, the Commission shall consider whether such alternative methods should include a threshold based on the number of nonclerical employees of the business or organization. TITLE XXIX—ENHANCING MULTICLASS SHARE DISCLOSURES 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, two things that are vital to the American economy: number one, 3 percent economic growth, and number two, competing with China. Three percent economic growth, Mr. Speaker, is so important because, when you look at the history of America, if you look at jobs that are created, if you look at increasing incomes, if you look at decreasing unemployment, this happens in our 3 percentplus growth years, and that is why it is so great that America is once again seeing 3 percentplus economic growth. But, Mr. Speaker, can we keep it? There are some alarming trends that we have to arrest, and that is that, unfortunately, entrepreneurship, that is, launching new businesses, recently hit a generational low. Companies that are going public—and 90 percent of the jobs that a company creates happen after they go public, IPOs, initial public offerings—they have been in a decline, a 20year decline, and they have reached a new low. If we look at what China is trying to do with their 2025 program, Mr. Speaker, and dominate the world in high tech and then we turn around and we see that China has over a third of the world’s IPOs, America—our decline is now down to 11 percent—has got to change. So thus, today, we are taking up the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act, also known as the JOBS Act 3.0. What we are trying to do, Mr. Speaker, number one, we are doing it on a bipartisan basis, but we are trying to ensure that our entrepreneurs at least don’t face the challenge of having the capital they need to launch their companies, because, Mr. Speaker, when we have more small businesses that are launching new enterprises and going public and staying public, these are the Amazons and the Googles and the Microsofts of the future. So, again, Members on both sides of the aisle have come together because, historically, capital formation has been a bipartisan issue here. We have come together, Democrat and Republican, to make sure that these small 
am very grateful was included, which is title 31. Title 31 would call for a study around one of the biggest expenses that young companies that are about to go public face. That is the cost of going public, the cost that is charged in the form of a growth spread and other costs associated with the act of going public. We want our companies trading on the public markets. It is a good source of capital. It is a good opportunity, in many instances, for investors and retail investors, in particular, to participate. Growth spreads in this country—that is, the fee for going public—have been remarkably constant over decades at 7 percent. That is a lot of money. For a $200 million IPO, which is not an atypical size, that is $14 million. That substantially exceeds the estimates that people make about what compliance with regulation costs. I have seen estimates for the cost of compliance between $1 million and $3 million a year. In a $200 million IPO, $14 million is a huge amount of money at a very sensitive moment in a company’s lifecycle. This study would simply look at it to see if there are things that we could do to make this market more efficient, perhaps achieve better pricing, perhaps make it easier and less costly for more companies to access the public markets. I stand in support of this bill, and urge its passage. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), the chair of our Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, and I thank the chairman for his leadership. If America wants to compete in the 21st century economy, then we need 21st century capital formation rules. b1545 Currently, many of the securities regulations governing startups and investors arise from 1930sera statutes. Because of this outdated legal architecture, the number of business startups is at a 40year low, and the number of companies going public is the lowest it has been in 20 years. The result is fewer highpaying jobs, less retirement security, slower capital formation, and weaker economic growth. Fortunately, the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act modernizes our regulation of capital markets, enabling greater access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Coupled with historic tax cuts and major banking reform that was enacted into law earlier this year, this JOBS bill represents the next step in robust economic growth that will boost wages, unleash startup enterprises, and finance the future of American small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee and a leading Democratic cosponsor on several of the bills in this package. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member WATERS for yielding. I want to begin by recognizing the good work of the ranking member and the chairman and their staffs in compiling this capital formation package. I want to compliment the legislative skill shown by the ranking member and her staff in securing minority bills in this package, which I recognize involved a lot of give and take. We are a long ways from where this Chamber was a little over 13 months ago when we voted in a very partisan manner on the Financial CHOICE Act. I am proud to support this package which contains a number of priorities which I supported in committee and on the floor. I worked on two of these bills with my colleagues, Congressmen HILLand HULTGREN . While I know that there are many others who contributed to this package, I want to thank in particular Katelynn Bradley, Katy Strohmaier, and Lisa Peto of the ranking member’s staff for helping draft these amendments that led to unanimous support for these two bills in committee. First, the Options Markets Stability Act would direct the banking regulators to write rules to provide far more accurate circulations of counterparty credit risk for options and derivatives. Under the current exposure method used today, banks that centrally clear trades today on behalf of their clients must hold capital against the total notional value of any positions without regard for the way hedges offset risk. This bill directs the regulators to implement a framework that incentivizes central clearing of options and derivatives, which is a major part of our response in the DoddFrank bill that has provided financial stability for the last 8 years. The second bill is the Cooperate With Law Enforcement Agencies and Watch Act. This bill creates a safe harbor for financial institutions and money service businesses from the Bank Secrecy Act so long as they have a letter from law enforcement asking for a specific account to be kept open. Law enforcement agencies often send these letters so that they can follow the money and obtain crucial evidence in investigations. This bill will encourage bank cooperation with these letters which are otherwise optional because it eliminates a situation of technical noncompliance. Other provisions in this package will improve transparency in markets which drives investor demand from around the world. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Illinois an additional 20 seconds. Mr. FOSTER. Other provisions in this bill will simply make our capital markets work better. I applaud the bipartisanship of the ranking member and the chairman, and I look forward to further improvements in the regulatory landscape as our markets evolve. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ), who is the vicechairman of our Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment Subcommittee. Mr. HULTGREN is the lead sponsor of two provisions of the bill, H.R. 5749, the Options Market Stability Act, and H.R. 6319, the Expanding Investment in Small Businesses Act. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman HENSARLING  and Ranking Member WATERS for their hard work in crafting this bipartisan package of bills. If enacted, this muchneeded legislation will deliver American small businesses and entrepreneurs improved access to capital, which we all know is the foundation for driving job creation and economic growth. I am pleased that two of my bills, which are very important to a number of stakeholders in Illinois, were included in this package. The Options Markets Stability Act will help maintain options for investors and support their ability to manage risk in volatile markets. The Expanding Investment in Small Businesses Act requires the SEC to study and provide a recommendation to Congress regarding the current limit on percentage of voting shares a diversified company may hold in a single issuer, which is currently discouraging funds from investing in small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this jobcreating legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 10
1⁄4minutes remaining. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Will the Speaker please check the minutes again? We have calculated differently, and we think I have 9 minutes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has reviewed the time, and the Chair states that the Chair’s announcement is correct. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I am sorry. What is the Chair saying about the time that I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 7
1⁄4minutes remaining. Ms. MAXINE WATER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee and the leading author of a bill in this package. 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018. This is a true bipartisan compromise, and I thank Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS for their leadership and willingness to work across the aisle. Mr. Speaker, every day I hear from Arizonans who are sick and tired of the dysfunction in Washington. Arizonans want Congress focused on job creation and national security, which is why this package includes three bills I helped introduce that create goodpaying jobs and fight drug cartels that threaten the safety of our border communities. First, I introduced the Fostering Innovation Act to deliver regulatory relief to cuttingedge biotech companies like HTG Molecular Diagnostics in Tucson that are hiring Arizonans into goodpaying jobs. Our bill cuts red tape to ensure HTG and other innovative biotech companies can expand their highwage workforces and develop lifesaving medical breakthroughs. I am also a cosponsor of the HALOS Act to help turn good Arizona ideas into successful Arizona startups. ASU’s SkySong Innovation Center is a startup incubator that helps these ideas and visions turn into companies and careers, and the HALOS Act cuts red tape to help Arizona startups access the capital they need to thrive. That means more goodpaying jobs all over our State. To protect Arizonans from violent drug cartels, I am an original cosponsor of the National Strategy to Combat the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. This bill requires the administration to take a tough but smart step to combat drug and human trafficking, cybercrime, money laundering, and other issues that these criminals bring to our communities. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to work with anyone willing to get things done and deliver for Arizona. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ), who is the chairman of our Housing and Insurance Subcommittee. Mr. DUFFY is the sponsor of a provision of this bill, H.R. 4537, the International Insurance Standards Act. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his great bipartisan work on this package in S. 488, as well as the ranking member, Ms. WATERS , for her bipartisanship. This is a package that takes the finer work, not just over the last 2 years, but work over the last 4 to 6 years of Chairman HENSARLING ’s leadership, puts them together where we have had Democrat, Republican, House, and Senate agreement on into a package that can hopefully make our markets and our economy work better. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for including in this package our international insurance standards bill. This is a bill that was on the floor last week. It passed with a unanimous vote, which was fantastic. What we are trying to do is basically make sure that we maintain in international agreements our State based model of insurance, that that doesn’t get undermined. If we are going to undermine Statebased insurance, it should come through this institution and not through an international agreement. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee who helped ensure that this bill cracks down on the use of digital currency in human trafficking. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan package brought to the floor today under the leadership of Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS . It is not every day the American people get to see bipartisanship in action, so it is important for Members today to highlight it when it does occur because it really should be the rule of the people’s House, not the exception. Technology and finance evolves by the hour in today’s world, and this bipartisan package will update our laws to better adapt to that reality while also encouraging the American entrepreneur to innovate and solve the problems of tomorrow. As a businesswoman, I understand that this package will help create the businesses of tomorrow and at the same time enhance transparency in today’s public markets while simultaneously combating the scourge of human trafficking. I am proud to have worked with my colleague from the other side of the aisle, Mr. ROYCE , to include language in this bill that requires the administration to more closely examine and create solutions for Congress to consider how human traffickers use emerging technologies and virtual currencies to launder money through the global banking system in hope of slowing the fastest growing crime in the world. My home State of Ohio ranks fourth in the country for human trafficking cases according to our State Attorney General’s office. Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member again for allowing me the opportunity to push my bill. Working together is the only way we can end this inhumane practice. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER ), who is the vicechairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the House amendment to the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act. This bill that was cosponsored with my good friend, KEITH ELLISON from Minnesota, is part of 32 combined bills. Our bill, the Credit Accuracy and Inclusion Act, will allow 100 million Americans to gain better access to credit. That is what this bill is all about. Just think about it: an individual now can take their rent payment, their car payment, and their utility payment and use that to apply toward increasing their better credit application to the credit reporting agencies. Mr. Speaker, I commend this bill. This is important for our economy, and it is important for the American people to be able to go out in the market and acquire what they need to acquire in homes and cars to build their own wealth. So I thank the leadership, I thank Mr. HENSARLING , and I thank Ms. WATERS for her leadership in this bill, and I commend them for this bipartisan effort. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER ), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee and author of one of the bills in this package. Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act. This important bipartisan package includes my Senior Security Act which seeks to protect seniors from financial scammers and help them save for retirement. I am committed to helping seniors keep their hardearned money for retirement so they can afford to stay in New Jersey and enjoy their lives and times with their kids and grandkids. We need to protect Social Security and Medicare, cut taxes, and cut costs for our seniors. We need to do so by working with both sides of the aisle, with Democrats and Republicans. For decades, the Greatest Generation has supported their families and communities, making America the greatest country in the world. Now we need to commit to fighting for them by stopping financial predators from scamming seniors out of their savings. Older Americans are criminally defrauded of $13 billion annually, in most cases by friends, family members, or caregivers. With more than 10,000 Americans turning 65 every day through 2030, we can’t afford this any longer. The Senior Security Act will identify problems that seniors face while saving, making recommendations to Congress to help seniors save their hard earned money. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS for their bipartisan work on this package of Financial Services bills. I also want to thank Congressman HOLLINGSWORTH and Congresswoman SINEMA for helping colead the Senior Security Act, working hard to strike a bipartisan compromise. Together we work to protect seniors from malicious scammers and ensure our seniors have the savings they need and deserve in their golden years. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act. b1600 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), the vice chairman of our Financial Institutions Subcommittee, who is also the lead Republican sponsor of one of the bills in the package, H.R. 6069, the Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS , as well as members of the Financial Services Committee from both parties, for this important bipartisan piece of legislation. Small and emerging businesses drive our economy, create jobs for American workers, and are at the forefront of technological change. We need to create the conditions where these ventures can access the capital they need to grow. This legislation builds upon the successes of the JOBS Act and JOBS 2.0. The JOBS and Investor Confidence Act includes reforms that will make it easier for the next Microsoft or Amazon or the developer of the next lifesaving treatment to get off the ground. When coupled with the progrowth provisions of a revamped Tax Code, especially the Opportunity Zones program, this will bring capital to marginalized areas and create opportunity for all. This package includes an important and, again, bipartisan bill that Congressman VARGAS and I introduced. The FIND Trafficking Act directs the Comptroller of the Currency to study how virtual currencies and online marketplaces can be misused by bad actors to trade in illicit goods or facilitate human trafficking. I thank the chairman for including this bill in the package. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ), a senior Democrat on the committee and the lead sponsor of the bill. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud the chair and the ranking member for a tour de force of bipartisanship: 32 bipartisan bills with near unanimous support in our committee, all put together in one outstanding package. I want to thank them both for including in this the BUILD Act, introduced by Mr. LOUDERMILK and me. This bill will help Habitat for Humanity and similar organizations. It says that when they provide a zero percent loan, they can use the old disclosure forms or the new disclosure forms, whichever is easiest for them and whichever they have the software to produce. This bill is supported by Habitat for Humanity International and the National Housing Conference. It passed our committee with a unanimous 53–0 recorded vote. I want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for including this legislation in an excellent package, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ), the vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, which is comprised of 32 pieces of legislation that have passed the committee or the House this Congress with wide bipartisan support. As a small business owner, I know how suffocating Big Government can be for the little guy. The fact is small businesses makes up 90 percent of American companies and employ almost half of our workforce. We need to fight for them. In order for the United States to compete with the global market, we must continue to sustain longterm economic growth, and that starts with the passage of the JOBS and Investors Confidence Act of 2018. I am proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in support of this bipartisan legislation, and I am looking forward to the Senate passing this package quickly. Quite simply, business is good. In God we trust. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), the majority whip of the committee and also the lead sponsor of H.R. 5783, the Cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies and Watch Act, and who worked, also, extensively on H.R. 1585, the Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, a hardy congratulations to Chairman HENSARLING  and the ranking member for this exceptional package, the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act. I support it, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. This important bill includes H.R. 1585, a bill that I worked on with my friends from Arizona, Ms. SINEMA and Mr. SCHWEIKERT , and a bill also supported and helped by Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I would like to highlight title IV. This bill expands the accredited investor definition by recognizing the ability to participate in a private offering should not be based solely on an asset or an income test, but that individuals who have the sophistication should also be able to participate. I have spent much of my career helping small companies obtain funding, helping them do private placements under regulation D. This has been a long time in coming. It is a matter of basic fairness, which will provide greater investment opportunities for more Americans and help our businesses grow and invest their capital faster. I encourage all my colleagues to support this good measure. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), who is the lead sponsor of a very important provision in the package, H.R. 5877, the Main Street Growth Act. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018. Terms like ‘‘capital formation,’’ ‘‘liquidity,’’ and ‘‘qualified investor’’ may sound like Washington jargon. In reality, they represent a few of the many important building blocks that drive our markets and create jobs and opportunity around our country. On the heels of the largest regulatory relief effort in nearly a decade, the JOBS Act 3.0 will breathe new light into the entrepreneurial spirit that makes our country so special. This package of nonpartisan reforms includes several policy changes to help small businesses and startups access the most liquid and vibrant markets in the world, including the text of our Main Street Growth Act, which the House unanimously adopted last week. I appreciate the efforts of the chairman and the ranking member to bring this significant legislation to the floor, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support the continued growth of our economy and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the JOBS Act 3.0. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ), who is the lead sponsor of two provisions in the package: H.R. 3555, the Exchange Regulatory Improvement Act, and H.R. 5953, the earlier referenced BUILD Act. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Chairman HENSARLING for not only working on this bill, but working to include these two important provisions as part of this 32bill strong, bipartisan package we are bringing forward today. This is going to go a long way for small business as well as consumers in this Nation. I also want to thank Mr. MEEKS and Mr. SCOTT for working with me on the Exchange Regulatory Improvement Act, which passed the Financial Services Committee unanimously, and also Mr. SHERMAN for working with me on the BUILD Act, which also passed the committee unanimously. I appreciate the bipartisan work we have seen come together on this bill, 
and I want to echo my strong support with all of my colleagues in support of this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD), the lead sponsor of one of the provisions in the bill, H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan JOBS and Investor Confidence Act, and I appreciate Chairman HENSARLING for his leadership on this capital formation package. I want to highlight my own bill included in this package, H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act, which allows issuers to submit to the SEC for confidential review, before publicly filing, draft registration statements for IPOs. H.R. 3903 will reduce the risk to companies that are contemplating going public in order to make listing on exchanges more attractive, which, in the end, will only strengthen America’s financial markets. Mr. Speaker, the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act will make it easier for startups and small businesses in my district to attract the investments they need to go public, to grow, and to create more jobs. I am proud to support it. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield myself the remainder of my time to close. I once again thank my colleagues for their outstanding bipartisan work on this carefully crafted bipartisan legislation. S. 488, the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, is an example of Members on both sides of the aisle working together to support our Nation’s small businesses and investors. S. 488 facilitates access to capital for small businesses, increases protections for consumers and investors, fights the scourge of drug and human trafficking, and promotes financial stability. S. 488 is supported by institutional investors, angel investors, venture capitalists, biotech companies, credit unions, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and exchanges. This bill will help entrepreneurs, small businesses, and investors to thrive in our economy. Finally, I would like to thank Mr. HENSARLING for his foresight in knowing that this was possible because both sides of the aisle really support small businesses. It was Mr. HENSARLING who said: Given that we do both support small businesses, why can’t we come together around a package where we have already shown our support on individual bills either in committee or on the floor and put it all together? He did that. He provided that leadership. I joined with him. Our staffs are to be congratulated because they worked very hard on both sides of the aisle to work out any concerns that we may have, any differences that we may have. They did a magnificent job, and they are responsible for helping us to understand what certainly is and was possible. So despite this, if I may say, there are many onlookers who never thought this could happen. There are many pundits, those who come from special interests, those who come from right here in the House on both sides of the aisle, who are still questioning. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30 seconds. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I had one inquiry from one of the magazines, I believe it was, who said: Tell me what happened in the background, what was really going on. How did this all come together? I want the gentleman from Texas to know I told him it is none of his business. It really happened, and we are pleased about it. We worked very hard on that. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HENSARLING  and all of the members who worked so hard to make this happen, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, some would say the ranking member and I can’t agree even on the time of day. I was told when this debate started that thunderstorms came over Washington, D.C., it was that monumental of an achievement. But in seriousness, I do want to offer my thanks and my gratitude to the ranking member. She and her staff worked very constructively with us on this bill and the preceding important bill, the CFIUS reform, which we are still trying to work out our differences on with the Senate. But, long story short, we came together. This is going to be an important day for small business. It is an important day for 3 percent economic growth, which is so important to American families. I, too, want to echo how important the work of our staffs is. Particularly on the majority side, I wish to thank Kevin Edgar and Fritz Vaughan and their staff for their contribution. This is going to make a difference, ultimately, because small businesses one day become big businesses. This will make a difference in economic growth for all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1615 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 488, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
DEFENDING ECONOMIC LIVELIHOODS AND THREATENED ANIMALS ACT Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4819) to promote inclusive economic growth through conservation and biodiversity programs that facilitate transboundary cooperation, improve natural resource management, and build local capacity to protect and preserve threatened wildlife species in the greater Okavango River Basin of southern Africa, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4819 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Defending Economic Livelihoods and Threatened Animals Act’’ or the ‘‘DELTA Act’’. 
It is the sense of Congress that it is in the interest of the United States to engage, as 
appropriate, with the Governments of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and neighboring countries, and in partnership with donors, regional organizations, nongovernmental organizations, local communities, and the private sector, to advance conservation efforts and promote economic growth and stability in the greater Okavango River Basin and neighboring watersheds and conservation areas. 
It is the policy of the United States to promote inclusive economic growth through conservation and biodiversity programs that facilitate transboundary cooperation, improve water and natural resource management, and build local capacity to protect and preserve threatened wildlife species in the greater Okavango River Basin and neighboring watersheds and conservation areas. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Okavango Delta supports the economic livelihood of a million people in that region. It is in a desert, but the Okavango River flows into that desert and makes a home to the largest remaining population of elephants in the world. This ecosystem spans three countries. It starts in the highlands of Angola, and it flows through Namibia and Botswana. Like other regions across Africa, there is a challenge here in the poaching and trafficking of threatened species in the delta. That poaching of elephant, black rhino, and hippo is increasing. I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of poachers and organized criminal networks across the continent. Wildlife trafficking and profits from poaching provide a key funding source for international criminal networks and for terrorists. These deadly groups undermine regional stability. They spread violence. They disrupt local governance. They have a devastating impact on the economic opportunities for members of the community. This legislation provided by our good friend here, Mr. FORTENBERRY , H.R. 4819, is the Defending Economic Livelihoods and Threatened Animals Act of 2018. This DELTA Act is an opportunity to be proactive and protect this part of the world before it is too late. It strengthens coordination among the Governments of the United States and Angola, Botswana, and Namibia to address these poaching threats and to support local communities in this greater Okavango River Basin. 
A few months ago, I led a bipartisan delegation to the region, and I saw the critical need for these countries to work together to preserve and protect this magnificent landscape. I had not been in Angola since the beginning of that war, and to go back to see Angola today and have an opportunity to meet with the chairman of the committee responsible for conservation there—she is, in fact, herself a park ranger—and to see how Angola has emerged from years of civil war and unrest and is now looking to the international community for partnership and for support is heartening. With Angola’s immense natural resources, we are already seeing, unfortunately, foreign governments—for example, Beijing—pushing unwise development that threatens to siphon off this critical water source. Obviously, to siphon off this water source, it would devastate the river basin. This is why we must act now to protect the animals and communities that call the region home. Animals and poachers, of course, know no boundaries. The water doesn’t know any boundaries. In order for conservation efforts to be successful, we must take a transboundary approach. I was proud to be the author of the Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act some years ago. I think it was in 2004 that it was passed. We saw how increased coordination across national borders can be successful in protecting critical landscapes and combating poaching threats. This DELTA Act looks to build on these proven successes, which have set up national parks now in seven landscapes across Africa. This legislation strengthens the coordination among the Governments, as I said, of the United States, Angola, Botswana, and Namibia. It does that by leveraging partnerships with the private sector, with nongovernment organizations, and with regional bodies. It prioritizes wildlife trafficking and antipoaching programs in this greater Okavango River Basin. And it promotes responsible economic growth for local communities through responsible natural resource management. Again, I thank the bill’s author, Representative FORTENBERRY , and our fellow cochairs of the House International Conservation Caucus, Representatives MCCOLLUM and C UELLAR , for their leadership and steadfast efforts to keep conservation and anti poaching efforts alive here in Congress and to help us drive these efforts. I want to thank Ranking Member ENGEL and, of course, from New York, JOECROWLEY , for their work on this legislation. It is deeply appreciated, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4819, the DELTA Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY ) for his initiative in putting forward this legislation to help protect one of Africa’s most important ecosystems. I am pleased to cosponsor this measure. I also want to commend Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their leadership on international conservation issues, particularly the fight against wildlife trafficking. The Okavango River Basin in Angola, Botswana, and Namibia supports an amazing array of wildlife, including the largest remaining concentration of elephants in Africa. It is also home to more than a million people. The DELTA Act requires the development of a strategy to encourage sustainable management of natural resources in the river basin, including the protection of wildlife. This strategy will require input from a wide range of stakeholders, including national governments, local communities, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector. The goal is to support economic development for the residents of the region while preserving unique ecosystems and protecting wildlife. The DELTA Act has the support of key conservation organizations, including the World Wildlife Fund and the Wildlife Conservation Society. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this bipartisan legislation, which passed our committee by unanimous voice vote, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY ), a member of the Committee on Appropriations and the author of this landmark legislation. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, before I begin my remarks, let me thank Chairman ROYCE , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, for his extraordinary leadership, not only on this bill, but on a whole array of conservation and security initiatives. I thank the gentleman for his chairmanship and for his long service in Congress. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Ranking Member ENGEL for his support of this legislation and Congressman SHERMAN  for his kind and generous remarks. They are very much appreciated. Mr. Speaker, the greater Okavango River Basin is the largest freshwater wetland in southern Africa. Not only is it the main source of water and livelihood for more than 1 million people, as we have heard, it is home to the largest remaining elephant population in the entire world. The pathway for habitat along the threecountry waterway is essential for sustaining this majestic animal and other species. As a creative approach to conservation, to foster an ecosystem of wellbeing for communities and for the purpose of international stability and security, as so well stated by Chairman ROYCE , given the scourge of wildlife trafficking and the nexus that it creates to terrorist network financing, we introduced this bipartisan bill, a transnational conservation initiative linking the natural habitat of the three nations, Angola, Namibia, and Botswana, to ensure the survival of this pristine ecosystem that is essential for the future of conservation, species, as well as the communities and people who live there. When we consider past conflicts that existed in parts of this region, it is truly heartwarming to work with the leaders of these countries to support their vision for the flourishing of animals and people, for the sake of the environment, and for the sake of their economies. This is imaginative foreign policy. It moves us from a singular, traditional type of solution to addressing challenges in a comprehensive, multinational, multisectoral strategy that mirrors the complexity of nature itself, beyond humandefined borders. This bill is a unique opportunity to help save and enhance one of the most beautiful and delicate ecosystems in the entire world before other international actors ruin it. As a cochair of the International Conservation Caucus with Chairman ROYCE and with my good friends Congressman CUELLAR from Texas and Congresswoman MCCOLLUM from Minnesota, I am very grateful for their hard work to help ensure the proper stewardship of natural resources in our own great country, as well as around the world. This bill offers the opportunity to continue to build authentic relations with the countries of Angola, Botswana, and Namibia, as well as local communities and the private sector, to develop effective strategies to promote sustainable resource management, combat wildlife trafficking, and stimulate economic regeneration in this part of the world. Mr. Speaker, again, I greatly appreciate Chairman ROYCE ’s cosponsorship, active support, and leadership in moving the DELTA Act through the committee, and I urge my colleagues to support this innovative, imaginative, and important initiative. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ). Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. SHERMAN for yielding and for the leadership that he has provided on this issue. Certainly, I want to thank the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from California, Mr. EDROYCE , who has been working on this issue for so many years. I want to thank him and the ranking member of the committee, Mr. ENGEL , for all of the work that they have done. In particular, I want to thank my co chair, Mr. FORTENBERRY , for his leadership. I remember talking about this particular bill at the very beginning, and here we are about to pass very important legislation. Certainly, I want 
to join Mr. F ORTENBERRY , Mr. E D ROYCE , Mr. E NGEL , myself, Ms. M CCOLLUM, and the rest of the cosponsors on this bipartisan bill that promotes sustainable economic development, combats wildlife trafficking in Africa’s critical Okavango River Basin, which supports more than a million people in Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and which is home to several threatened wildlife species, including the largest remaining elephant population in the world. b1630 Today, that region is at a near breaking point due to the not very well thought of development activities, and we have got to make sure that we act together. Specifically, this bill will protect the vital Okavango River Basin by strengthening coordination between the United States, Angola, Botswana, and Namibia, and leveraging partnerships with the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and regional bodies; prioritizing wildlife trafficking to make sure that we stop these poaching programs that have really affected this particular area; promoting sustainable economic growth for local communities through responsible natural resource management; and, more importantly, helping to stop the extinction of these majestic animals, these elephants and other endangered species. So it is important that we all work together as lawmakers in a bipartisan way and also partner with nations to build international political support for sustainable development while protecting the world’s most sensitive ecosystems. In today’s global community, it is crucial that we assist our international partners and make sure that we find a better way to protect our world. In conclusion, I would say that we only have one world to live in. It is up to us to ensure that we promote sustainable development so our children and grandchildren have a better world to live in. I want to thank the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, my colleagues, our cochairs, and all of the Members on both sides that have worked so hard for this bipartisan support of this particular bill. So I thank my Members and colleagues for bringing this important matter to the U.S. Congress’ attention, and I urge the support of this bill. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to reiterate the importance of conservation in combating the scourge of wildlife trafficking around the world. This bill reaffirms our commitment to these goals and will result in a strategy to encourage sustainable management of natural resources in the Okavango River Basin located in Angola, Botswana, and Namibia. I thank Mr. FORTENBERRY , Mr. CUELLAR , and, of course, Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member E NGEL for their work. This bill passed our committee by unanimous, bipartisan voice vote. I strongly support it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the greater Okavango River Basin is home to the largest remaining elephant population on this planet, but like other regions across Africa, we know that poaching and trafficking of threatened species is increasing. We know that greater transboundary cooperation is essential to protect the basin in order to combat poaching threats and, obviously, to encourage the responsible management of water resources. The U.S. currently supports programs in Africa to combat poaching threats and promote economic growth, but greater coordination and diplomatic engagement with these governments, these governments working together to streamline these programs and galvanize support from partner countries also in the region, is essential. We do this not only to protect these threatened species, but also because it is in our national security interest to do so. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4819, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ELIE WIESEL GENOCIDE AND ATROCITIES PREVENTION ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3030) to help prevent acts of genocide and other atrocity crimes, which threaten national and international security, by enhancing United States Government capacities to prevent, mitigate, and respond to such crises, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3030 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ). 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it was over 60 years ago that free people around the world pledged to never again stand by in silence as oppressed people are annihilated in a genocide. Unfortunately, since then, we have witnessed mass atrocities and genocide in places such as Bosnia, the Rwandan genocide, Cambodia, Burma, and in the ISIS strongholds in Syria and in Iraq. The United States has often been a leader in responding to these and other humanitarian crises—not soon enough, in many cases. However, there is more, obviously, that can be done, and U.S. efforts have been largely reactive and disjointed, with little transparency or oversight. This bill is the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act. It would correct these deficiencies. This act would require an annual report of administration actions to prevent and respond to potential genocides and mass atrocities, and it would mandate the identification of countries that are at risk of such crimes against humanity. This act also requires that all Foreign Service officers, who often are at the forefront of U.S. efforts to address atrocities ever since our Ambassador in Armenia was the first to sound the alarm on the Armenian genocide, be trained to deal with early warning signs, conflict assessment, mediation, and other responses. All of this will better enable our government to develop a coordinated response as a crisis is developing and, ultimately, to save lives. With its name, this bill honors the legacy of Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel, and it furthers our commitment to his call, for it was his call for ‘‘never again’’—never again by strengthening the U.S. Government’s coordination on efforts to prevent, mitigate, and respond to genocide and other mass atrocities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE , July 17, 2018. Hon. EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : On June 22, 2018, H.R. 3030, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018 was referred to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (the Committee). In order to expedite the House’s consideration of the measure, the Committee will forgo consideration of the measure. This courtesy is conditioned on our mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee with respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained in the legislation or any similar measure, nor will this waiver inhibit the Committee’s ability to address issues of concern going forward. I appreciate your support to the appointment of Members from the Committee to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation. I also appreciate your including this letter in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. Thank you for your assistance with this matter. Sincerely, DEVIN NUNES , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, July 16, 2018. Hon. DEVIN NUNES , Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for consulting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 3030, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018, and for agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of that bill. I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your Committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any HouseSenate conference involving this legislation. I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 3030 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, this bill passed our committee by unanimous, bipartisan voice vote. It is named for Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor and author who spent decades leading the fight to bring Nazis to justice. First, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri, Ambassador WAGNER , and the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, the gentleman from New York, JOE CROWLEY , for their work in bringing forward this very important bill that improves our capacity to prevent and respond to genocides and mass atrocities. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. Millions of innocent civilians have died in mass atrocities and genocides. I would like to take just a second to remind everyone of a few of these tragedies: The first genocide of the 20th century, the Armenian genocide, which killed approximately 1.5 million people; The Holocaust, from 1933 to 1945, more than 9 million people were killed, including over 6 million Jews; Cambodia in 1975, which saw the slaying of 2 million people; Rwanda in 1990, which saw the deaths of 800,000 in just 100 days; and Sudan, Darfur, and the tragedy there. Tragedies and crises like this are not just in the past. Today, we are witnessing mass killings of innocent people in many places around the globe. In Burma, the military has inflicted horrific violence against the Rohingya people. Thousands have been killed. This is ethnic cleansing, and it appears on the verge of genocide. Now, 700,000 refugees have been pushed into Bangladesh, 80 percent of them are women and children. And as I mentioned, in Darfur, some 300,000 are dead, 3 million displaced. This measure gives us the tools to detect the warning signs of a mass atrocity or genocide so that we can respond quickly and improves interagency coordination. Overall, this measure will make our government better equipped to handle the growing threats of genocide and crimes against humanity. This is a good bill. The prevention of genocide and mass atrocity should be a core objective of our Nation’s national security and foreign policy missions. The bill passed, as I said before, our committee by a unanimous bipartisan voice vote. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ), who is the author of this legislation. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act. I introduced this bill to improve U.S. efforts to prevent mass atrocity crimes. The legislation honors the legacy of Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel and his life’s work to fight evil around the world. Mr. Wiesel was just 15 years old when the Nazis deported him and his family to Auschwitz. Having witnessed the near total destruction of his people, he spent his life defending the persecuted. As Mr. Wiesel understood so well, the true horror of genocide is that it is preventable. We are haunted by repeated failures and missed opportunities to end these tragedies before they begin. There is more the United States can and must do to help vulnerable communities and persecuted people around the world. The reality is that good intentions and platitudes like ‘‘never again’’ have not prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians at the hands of the Assad regime nor the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma. When I introduced this legislation, I thought of the Bosnian community in St. Louis, my hometown. This community has shaped what St. Louis looks and feels like. It has added great cultural diversity to the city, immense intellectual capital, thriving small businesses, and a strong religious presence. Two decades ago, members of our Bosnian community were refugees. In 1995, Orthodox Serbs, under the command of General Ratko Mladic, initiated a horrific ethnic cleansing campaign against majorityMuslim Bosniaks. The bloodshed forced 130,000 Bosnian refugees to seek new lives in the United States. It is fitting that today we remember the victims of the Bosnian genocide just a few days after its 23rd anniversary. I am continually amazed by the resilience of our Bosnian neighbors. Their courage has inspired me to seek change. The Elie Wiesel Act expresses Congress’ strong support for better utilization of existing resources, particularly the Atrocities Prevention Board, which is dedicated to coordinating U.S. atrocity prevention and response, and the Complex Crises Fund, which supports agile, efficient responses to unforeseen crises overseas. Additionally, we require the administration to evaluate existing prevention efforts, report on countries at risk of genocide and mass atrocity crimes, and recommend concrete improvements to our early warning systems. The bill also mandates that U.S. Foreign Service officers are trained in atrocities recognition and response. Should this bill become law, America’s diplomats will be better equipped to act before violence spirals out of control. The Elie Wiesel Act establishes that it is the official policy of the United States to regard atrocities prevention as a core national security interest and to address root causes of conflict through our humanitarian, development, and strategic endeavors. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, genocide is preventable. The United States is the global leader in genocide and atrocities response, but we must shift our attention towards prevention so that no one ever becomes a victim in the first place. b1645 H.R. 3030 is an important first step. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ) for his cooperation on this piece of bipartisan legislation, and I urge its support. Mr. SHERMAN. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ) an original cosponsor of the bill. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act. I thank my good friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. ROYCE , and Ranking Member E NGEL for their support in bringing this important legislation to the floor today. I also appreciate the work of Ambassador WAGNER on this measure, and I am proud to be a cosponsor and the lead Democrat on this bill with Congresswoman WAGNER . Standing up against genocide and mass atrocities is a critical responsibility for the United States. There is no other country in the world that can hold other nations accountable but the United States. No other country can do it like we can—not France, not Germany, not Great Britain, certainly not China, especially not Russia. No other country in history has had the moral suasion of the United States. Many of us are concerned about what is happening to our country right now and our positioning in being able to push back against atrocities and human rights violations around the world. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention a concern for what took place yesterday in Helsinki as an example of a growing concern of our ability to hold and to sway moral convictions on these issues. But it is a responsibility that is important to our country and, more importantly, it is a responsibility that is important to our world. If you walk down Independence Avenue and to the Holocaust Memorial Museum, you will see and hear the words, ‘‘Never again.’’ It is a phrase that brings to mind some of the world’s worst atrocities and most heinous crimes. As Elie Wiesel, who this bill is named after, and a man whom I had the opportunity to know and be in his company 
on many occasions, wrote, ‘Never again’ is more than a set of words. He went on to say, ‘‘It’s a prayer, a promise, a vow. . . . And never again the glorification of base, ugly, dark violence.’’ It also reminds us that taking responsibility for stopping atrocities is incumbent on all of us. It requires us to put ourselves in the shoes of the victims and to think about what we hope would be done if we were in their place, if we faced that horror, if we faced those atrocities. What would we want to be done on our behalf? The measure before us takes a step in that direction. It encourages the government to meet regularly and take steps to predict and prevent mass atrocities. It gives strong support for the Atrocities Prevention Board. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New York. Mr. CROWLEY. And it requires the training of foreign service officers on how to take steps to recognize and prevent genocide and other atrocities. It is not as strong a bill as Representative WAGNER and I would have liked it to have been. I know we both wanted to see more in this bill. But, as with most legislation, this is a very important first step, upon which I know further progress will be made down the road. This is an important signal from Congress that preventing atrocities must be part and parcel of the United States foreign policy in the White House, the State Department, the intelligence community, and throughout our government. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support its passage, and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as always, I thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their work in always bringing forth solid, bipartisan bills to the House floor. Mr. Speaker, I offer my full support for Ambassador ANNWAGNER ’s bill before us today, H.R. 3030, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. This bill takes necessary and overdue steps to make preventing genocide and other atrocities a priority in our foreign policy. Indeed, this bill makes it clear that it will be the policy of the United States that the prevention of genocide and other atrocities is not only in our national security interests, but it is a core moral responsibility for us to do so. Far too often, these acts have been met with indifference, indifference from responsible nations and indifference from those who are not directly impacted by the mass murders and the torment and the destruction. Elie Wiesel, this bill’s namesake, challenged us to always take sides, to not allow indifference or neutrality to dictate our actions. As he said, ‘‘Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.’’ Our values and ideals as Americans dictate that we must do what we can to prevent genocide, to prevent atrocities, and to prevent human rights violations. This bill enshrines those principles. It ensures that the United States is at the forefront of the fight against these crimes against humanity, and will use the full weight and force of our foreign policy to prevent them from ever happening again. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ambassador WAGNER for authoring this bill, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this bill to the floor today, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I want to add my voice to commend Congresswoman WAGNER , Congressman ENGEL , and Congressman CROWLEY for working in a bipartisan fashion to put together this important legislation. This legislation firmly establishes that official United States policy is to prevent genocide and other criminal atrocities, and makes certain that it is treated as a core national security interest by supporting the programs that can help avert the deaths of innocents around our globe. Representing one of the largest populations of holocaust survivors in the Nation is one of my greatest privileges as a Member of Congress. To honor these survivors, and to honor the 6 million Jews who did not survive, we must do everything in our power to prevent another atrocity like the one they experienced. When we commemorate the Holocaust, we make a sacred promise to ourselves and to all of our neighbors by saying and committing to ‘‘Never again.’’ This legislation puts real weight behind those words. From the brutal lessons we have learned from crimes against humanity that span continents and centuries, we must forge a brighter future. Jewish tradition compels us to perform tzedakah—acts of justice—and we are driven by tikkun olam—repairing the world. We have a responsibility to be a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves, to make the world a better place. But these values are not unique to Jews or to Judaism. They are values we all strive to share. Our Nation has the unique capability to prevent these tragedies before they unfold. Elie Wiesel, who I was privileged to know, the rightful namesake of this legislation, wrote, ‘‘We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.’’ When this bill becomes law, we can take comfort in knowing the United States of America is taking sides, is not neutral, and is not silent in the face of inhumanity. When we are faced with bigotry and hate, with war crimes and crimes against humanity, with ethnic cleansing and genocide, the United States must always remain a beacon of hope for justice, freedom, and peace. With this bill, we do just that. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this measure, and I thank Ambassador WAGNER and Representative C ROWLEY  for their work. This bill will equip our government with the tools to better monitor and, hopefully, prevent genocide. It passed our committee with an unanimous bipartisan voice vote. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman ANNWAGNER, for her leadership on this important bill. I also thank the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. ENGEL , for his support, along with Mr. SHERMAN , on this bill. Passage of this legislation sends a strong message of the continuing U.S. commitment to respond to genocide and to respond to mass atrocities as they emerge, with effective and coordinated programs that will best protect the most vulnerable. The U.S. must be a world leader in efforts to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3030, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2017, sponsored by my friend ANNWAGNER. This bill will greatly strengthen our efforts to anticipate, prevent, and mitigate genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Wherever there are atrocities being committed, or at risk of being committed, our foreign service officers are also often serving on the front lines. What H.R. 3030 would ensure is that they have the right training to recognize and respond to early warning signs of such crimes. This legislation will also strengthen Congressional oversight by requiring the President to annually report on what is happening on the ground, how the United States has responded, and recommendations for strengthening the U.S. response. I commend my colleague for naming this bill after the late, iconic Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. He spoke so powerfully about the unique, persistent evil of antiSemitism that generated the Holocaust, warning that ‘‘the 
antisemite is by definition ideologically fanatic and pathologically racist . . . an antisemite is someone who has never met me, never heard of me, yet he hates me.’’ Mr. Wiesel and I worked together at the historic 2004 Berlin conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). There, 55 participating governments committed to taking specific actions to combat antiSemitism. In 2002, I led the original Congressional push to place combating antiSemitism at the top of the OSCE agenda, and I was proud to lead this movement once again in 2004, together with parliamentarians from Germany, the UK, and France—and Mr. Wiesel. In his 2004 Berlin keynote address, Mr. Wiesel said, ‘‘We know . . . that antiSemitism is dangerous not only to Jews but to countries too, where it is allowed to flourish . . . When a Jew is slapped in the face, humankind itself falls to ground . . . Antisemitism is rooted in hatred; its language is a language of hatred, its doctrine is filled with hatred—and hatred by its nature, always runs overboard, crossing geographical boundaries and ethnic affiliations. It is a contagious disease.’’ Mr. Speaker, Mr. Wiesel dedicated his life to exposing the insidiousness of antiSemitism and working to prevent other genocides, including those in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Sudan. Named for him, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act offers new ways for us to strengthen our fight against genocide, and I am proud to cosponsor this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3030, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
PROTECTING DIPLOMATS FROM SURVEILLANCE THROUGH CONSUMER DEVICES ACT Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4989) to require the Department of State to establish a policy regarding the use of locationtracking consumer devices by employees at diplomatic and consular facilities, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4989 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ). Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I thank Mr. CASTRO and Mr. MCCAUL, the coauthors of this legislation. I know Mr. MCCAULknows some of the dangers that our diplomats face overseas. In his past service to the United States, he has been in parts of this dangerous world, and this is what our diplomats face. As they work to prevent armed conflict, there are armed combatants on the other side of those issues. As they try to combat terrorism, as they are working out there to empower women or to open new markets for U.S. exports, they are in tough environments. In turn, it is our job to ensure that our diplomats have the information and resources they need to stay safe while they serve our country overseas. b1700 Now more than ever, everyday devices such as smartphones include location tracking capabilities. While these are enormously useful tools, they also, obviously, present security concerns as users’ locations can then be tracked by others, by hostiles. For the thousands of State Department employees who work overseas, this is a real concern. It is a real security risk. While the State Department has longstanding and thorough policies on the use of these devices while in embassies and in consulates, the Department has no such policy to guide personnel outside Department grounds. And that is where we send them, outside the Department grounds. So the bill before us today addresses this security gap. It mandates that the State Department develop a comprehensive, modernized policy on devices that contain tracking capability. It also requires that all current and future diplomatic staff be briefed on the new policy and current best practices for using devices that are enabled with local tracking features. The objective is to build in a culture of safety and selfawareness. Technology is advancing every day, and we must not allow our agencies to expose personnel to new risks. I urge my colleagues to support this act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4989, the Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act. This bill, again, passed our committee by unanimous, bipartisan voice vote. I want to begin by thanking Mr. CASTRO, and also others, for introducing this legislation. I am pleased to be one of the cosponsors. This bill aims to ensure the Department of State has policies in place to prevent our adversaries from tracking the locations of our Foreign Service officers through their electronic devices. From fitness trackers, to smartwatches, to phones, most of us have at least one device that could be used to track us with the right technology that has GPS capacities. Many of us would literally be lost without these devices, but they could pose a security risk. This is especially true for our diplomats overseas whose locations and travels can reveal sensitive information sources. Location information is a potential gold mine to our adversaries. This commonsense measure would make sure that the Secretary of State has a policy in place on the safe use of consumer electronic devices by our diplomatic and consular facilities and personnel. It would require proper training for employees and contractors, and ensure that the policy is coordinated across all parts of our government that use our diplomatic and consular facilities. This bill would also improve congressional oversight of this policy. This bill will reduce the security risks associated with GPS devices and other consumer electronic device. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and the coauthor of this measure. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, the Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act. 
BETTER UTILIZATION OF INVESTMENTS LEADING TO DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5105) to establish the United States International Development Finance Corporation, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5105 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The President shall appoint and maintain an Inspector General in the Corporation, in accordance with the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.). 
It is the sense of Congress that the Corporation should use relevant data of the Department of State, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the United States Agency for International Development, and other departments and agencies that have development functions to better inform the decisions of the Corporation with respect to providing support under title II. TITLE IV—MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND REPORTING

Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is the BUILD Act. Across the globe, lack of access to capital is constraining economic growth, especially in the world’s least developed countries. According to the International Finance Corporation, micro, small, and mediumsized enterprises have an unmet financing need of more than $5 trillion every year in emerging markets, depriving them of the capital that they need to grow. Foreign investment is critical to empowering entrepreneurs, critical to creating jobs and to reducing poverty. Our country has an undeniable interest in supporting the development of vibrant and stable economies around the world. Healthy private sectors promote good governance and support thriving civil societies. It helps reduce civil strife. The resulting stability is good for our national security and also benefits U.S. exports and jobs. Increasingly, other countries are working to advance their economic and political interests by shaping overseas markets. China’s One Belt, One Road initiative is estimated at $1 trillion. This dwarfs the size of the Marshall Plan that rebuilt wartorn Europe in the 1940s and 1950s. Across Africa, Asia, and beyond, Beijing is making massive investments in new construction and infrastructure projects, from the headquarters of the African Union to a port in Djibouti, where both the U.S. and China now have military bases. Beijing now owns 80 percent of this strategically located African nation’s foreign debt. As the president and CEO of OPIC, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, testified to the Foreign Affairs Committee, his words: ‘‘A condition of many of these loans is that Chinese firms, and labor, get the business. . . . This statedirected approach is not consistent with our values, which incorporate the high standards of international financial institutions related to governance, transparency, debt sustainability, environmental, and social safeguards.’’ Chinese development practices have often left countries worse off—and I have seen this with my own eyes—putting some countries into debt distress. Last December, Sri Lanka gave control of the strategic Sri Lankan port to Beijing for 99 years after it could not repay the Chinesebacked loans to fund it. That granted Beijing a foothold in the Indian Ocean and its critical shipping lanes. And due to Beijing’s ‘‘no strings attached’’ financing, some of Africa’s most brutal regimes have been thrown an economic lifeline that undermines democratic governance. Unlike the United States, Beijing does not have an anticorruption standard. It is willing to fund just about any government, from Venezuela to Sudan. The U.S. cannot and should not match China’s investments dollarfor dollar, but we can and should do more to support international economic development with partners who have embraced the private sectordriven development model. However, America’s development finance tool kit, which is spread across multiple agencies, is limited, it is duplicative, it is uncoordinated. So the BUILD Act will address these shortcomings. It will modernize America’s antiquated development finance capabilities to address the challenges of this century. Specifically, it will merge OPIC and USAID’s development credit authority into a standalone U.S. international development finance corporation with new authorities. b1715 Among these new authorities will be the ability to cofinance projects with our allies like the U.K. What this is going to do, just on the U.S. side, is this is going to double their book of business. Through the provision of loans and guarantees and limited equity investments and feasibility studies, political risk insurance, and other investments of support, the new Development Finance Corporation will mobilize private capital to provide countries a competitive alternative to the statedirected approach of Beijing and Moscow. I am pleased that this bill doesn’t just merge existing functions together but also includes critical reforms to protect taxpayers, to improve government efficiency, and to make America’s development finance toolkit very effective. Notably, it adopts many of the same principles as the Millennium Challenge Corporation, including the constraints analysis, which directs investment to where it will have the most impact. This bill will create a dedicated inspector general of the new corporation. It will require that the corporation prioritize support in the poorest countries and those making continual progress towards economic policies that support free enterprise, and it will create lasting institutional linkages between the Development Finance Corporation and other development agencies. This bill has got strong support from the White House, which made it a priority in its National Security Strategy and 2019 budget. In short, the BUILD Act represents a major opportunity for this Congress and the executive branch to transform and modernize our Nation’s tools to support global development and increase opportunities for American entrepreneurs in these emerging markets. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE , Washington, DC, July 16, 2018. Hon. EDROYCE , Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN ROYCE : I write concerning H.R. 5105, the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of2018. This legislation includes matters that I believe fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 5105, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. Further, I appreciate your agreement to incorporate changes suggested by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure into the bill prior to floor consideration. Finally, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I ask that you support my request to have the Committee represented on the conference committee. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the bill. I look 
forward to working with the Committee on Foreign Affairs as the bill moves through the legislative process, Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, July 16, 2018. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHUSTER : Thank you for consulting with the Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to forgo a sequential referral request on H.R. 5105, the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018, so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. Edits requested by your committee have been incorporated in the bill text scheduled for consideration by the House. I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation. I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 5105 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5105. H.R. 5105, the BUILD Act, which stands for Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act, modernizes our international development finance system. It does so by consolidating the existing Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which has the most unfortunate acronym in the Federal Government, since it is referred to as OPIC and is often confused with OPEC. It consolidates that organization into the new Development Finance Corporation. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important measure. I want to start by commending the lead sponsors of this bipartisan bill, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), whom I am pleased to work with on the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, where he serves as chairman and I serve as ranking member; and the second lead sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH), the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. It has been more than a decade since Congress last updated OPIC’s charter. The landscape in development finance has changed substantially, and we now need a new approach to the way our government uses financial instruments to spur economic development and tackle poverty in the developing world. Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to thank the leadership of the committee and the sponsors of the legislation for accepting four of my amendments. The first of these requires a certification from the new DFC, or Development Finance Corporation, that the corporations that benefit from their investment and their affiliates do not conduct any activity which is the subject of U.S. sanctions. This is an important safeguard to ensure that entities that engage in contact that violates U.S. Government sanctions do not benefit from U.S. Government financing. Simply prohibiting the support of sanctioned entities is not enough. We need an affirmative statement from prospective beneficiaries of the DFC that they and their affiliates are in compliance with American sanctions law. Second, the new agency will need to consider whether the benefiting entity is participating in a foreign boycott that is at crosspurposes with American foreign policy. The U.S. should not be in the business of providing assistance to entities that participate in discriminatory boycotts against foreign countries. Since the 1970s, we have had on the books laws designed to prevent our corporations from participating in the Arab League boycott of Israel. It is common sense that the DFC, when it is selecting projects, should take this into consideration. So my amendment will do just that. I should point out that there is another amendment that I would have offered, but, instead, we secured a letter from OPIC that will be binding policy on the new DFC stating that the DFC will not finance regional projects in the Caucasus that are designed to exclude Armenia. If it doesn’t make geographic sense that a regional railroad or road or other activity excludes Armenia, then that is OPIC policy that will be carried forward with the new agency that this will not be financed by the DFC. Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters from OPIC in the RECORD . 
OVERSEAS PRIVATE  INVESTMENT CORPORATION , Washington, DC, May 8, 2018. Hon. BRADSHERMAN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN SHERMAN : Thank you for your continued support of U.S. development finance, including your support for H.R. 5105, the BUILD Act. Knowing of your longstanding support for Armenia, I wanted to clarify an issue raised by your office in writing. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation will not support regional projects in the Caucasus that deliberately, by design or effect, exclude Armenia from participation or benefit, unless such exclusion is necessitated by geographic or economic impracticality. As you know, when the BUILD Act legislation is enacted into law, the functions, personnel, assets, liabilities and policies of OPIC will transfer to the U.S. Development Finance Corporation. Accordingly, this will become the policy of the DFC. Again, thank you for your continued support. Regards, CAMERON S. A LFORD , Deputy General Counsel, Projects. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the third amendment that I thank the sponsors for agreeing to requires an annual report from the new DFC on its compliance with its own human rights, labor, environmental, and social policies. OPIC maintains robust environmental and social policies. This bill carries those policies forward so the new DFC will follow them and will now make an annual report so that Congress can see whether these policies are actually being implemented. The fourth such amendment states that, as to the four public nongovernmental members of the DFC board, that we take into account their experience in international environmental, developmental, and labor organizations. There are a number of other factors that go into selecting the public members of the board, but certainly experience in the environment and labor ought to be taken into consideration. The BUILD Act updates U.S. development finance and, I think, will complement our foreign assistance efforts. With this bill, we can keep the U.S. as a global leader in promoting economic prosperity around the world while, at the same time, encouraging American jobs. I support this measure and hope my colleagues will join me in doing so. Once again, this bill had a unanimous, bipartisan voice vote in our committee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). He is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and he is the author of this legislation. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I am excited to speak on behalf of H.R. 5105, the 
BUILD Act, and urge its passage in this Chamber. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman ROYCE , Ranking Member ENGEL , Ranking Member S HERMAN , and my lead cosponsor, ADAM SMITH of Washington, for the hard work they and their teams have done to bring this bill to the floor. These gentlemen worked tirelessly along with their teams. I would also like to give a shoutout to our legislative director, James Walsh, who did yeoman’s work for this bill. Today, America is confronting unprecedented instability and growing humanitarian crises around the world, all of which have a direct impact on our national security and economic interests here at home. Delivering effective U.S. foreign assistance is crucial, especially in the current fiscal climate in which it is imperative for the U.S. Government to use every dollar more efficiently and effectively. The BUILD Act will ensure the United States delivers foreign assistance both effectively and efficiently by catalyzing the private sector to invest in developing countries. Of our top 15 trading partners, 12 of them were once recipients of foreign aid. Fortythree of our top 50 consumer nations of American agriculture products were once U.S. foreign aid recipients. Additionally, 95 percent of the world’s consumers live outside of the United States, and the poorest two thirds of the world now represent about $5 trillion in purchasing power. Their markets are growing faster than many of our traditional partners and are central to the future of America’s economic prosperity, job growth, and security. It is imperative to the United States economy that we seize upon these opportunities and make the investment now so that we may reap the benefits down the road. One of the ways to do this is to make our development finance more efficient and nimble. U.S. businesses have the capital to invest and lead the world in the understanding of capital markets and sophisticated financial transactions, generally delivering investments in infrastructure and other industries quicker and less expensively. Despite our comparative advantage, other countries, especially China, are using development finance institutions more effectively to expand their influence into the developing world, even here in the Western Hemisphere in the country of Haiti. Our tools for development finance are dispersed across too many Federal agencies and need to be streamlined. The primary U.S. development agency, OPIC, has not been significantly updated since its creation in 1971. The BUILD Act will modernize all foreign finance development and bring it into the 21st century. As you can imagine, the world of financial development has vastly changed since 1970, as all things do, to stay competitive. A modernized Development Finance Corporation is imperative to capitalizing upon those changes. It will help transition countries from aid to trade. We want to help countries become robust trading partners with the United States. By doing so, we will be helping create stable, selfsufficient societies around the world and open new markets for U.S. goods and services. If we are trading goods, economies are growing, they are growing stronger, and relationships are forged, increasing national security. There is truth to the saying, ‘‘a rising tide lifts all boats.’’ The BUILD Act will help make this a reality by transitioning recipient countries again from aid to trade. In addition to improving efficiency, the BUILD Act also creates a more significant amount of oversight and increases the United States’ development effectiveness. The BUILD Act empowers the new Development Finance Corporation, as Secretary Pompeo testified to the Senate, ‘‘to have the flexibility to identify a development need, bring to bear the right resources over the right period and manage it in a way that effectively delivers the outcome and measures it all along the way.’’ Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleague to pass the BUILD Act. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH), the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee and the lead Democratic sponsor of this bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I really want to thank Congressman YOHO. We have worked together on this bill. We have also worked together as cochairs of the Caucus for Effective Foreign Assistance. This bill really shows the bipartisan support on the committee. I certainly want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work, as well, towards a very important goal, and that is to make more effective use of U.S. foreign aid and foreign development. It is a crucial tool right now in the world. We need as many friends and as many partners as we can find in the world. Development through USAID and other agencies is a crucial way that we build the relationships and, as has been mentioned by all three of the previous speakers, as importantly, build the capacity of our partners to have a strong economy and to grow. What this bill does is it makes our foreign investment policy better, more cohesive, and more robust. It enables that agency to invest in the projects that are necessary to help it be successful by expanding what it can do, by expanding its ability to work with other partners, to work with the private sector, and, crucially, to take an equity stake in some of their investments, something that current law prohibits. This will greatly expand their ability to find projects across the developing world to invest in and help grow these countries and move them forward. The overall goal of foreign aid is to make sure that there, hopefully, at some point, are no countries in the world that can’t provide for their people, to go after poverty, to reduce it wherever we can. There are a lot of different projects that are important to foreign aid. Certainly, global health, education, and direct assistance all play a crucial role. But I would submit that nothing is more important than enabling these countries to develop their own economy by giving them the capital they need to invest in projects and grow businesses so that they become self sustaining partners. This bill does a crucially important job in making sure that the U.S. contribution to that effort is as effective as it possibly can be. It lives up to the name of our caucus, effective foreign assistance. This is critically important. A lot of times people think of foreign aid as being, well, that is just sort of a leftwing issue. Well, I want you to know there is true bipartisan support in this Congress by Republicans and Democrats to improve the quality of our foreign aid. b1730 I thank Congressman YOHO for his leadership on that. He has done a great job in making sure that this is a bipartisan issue because it is crucial that we reduce poverty and improve security across the globe, and it is also crucial that the U.S., as the largest, strongest economy in the world, plays a strong role in that effort. This bill will put us in a better position to do precisely that. I will also say, I think this is but the first of many efforts that we can have on improving the quality of foreign aid, of making it more effective and more robust. It is worth noting that this bill also expands the amount of money that is available to our foreign lending. It gives them more money to deal with. I strongly support this bill, this bipartisan effort, and I appreciate Congressman YOHO’s leadership. I look forward to continuing to work with him on this and many other issues. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4989. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to commend the sponsors of this legislation and the leadership of our committee. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote, 
and I point out that this bill received a unanimous bipartisan voice vote in our committee, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote on the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5105, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5480) to improve programs and activities relating to women’s entrepreneurship and economic empowerment that are carried out by the United States Agency for International Development, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5480 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act of 2018’’. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California. There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am the author of this measure. It is the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, and I want to thank those members on the staff that worked on this measure: Amy Porter, Joan Condon, Jessica Kelch, and Emily Cottle, and I thank them because around the globe, women make up the majority of the world’s poor. This is due, in part, to gender constraints that in some places deny women access to basic financial services, like savings accounts. Today, more than 1 billion women remain left outside of the formal financial system, and womenowned, small and mediumsized enterprises face a $300 billion credit gap. A 2014 analysis found that closing the gender gap and access to credit for small and medium sized womenowned businesses would increase per capita GDP by 12 percent in developing countries. That is because when women exercise greater influence over finances, literally, everyone benefits. Childhood survival rates, food security, children’s education, economic opportunity for families, all of that increases. Investment in women yields results for entire communities. Indeed, countries with high female labor force participation rates are more resilient to economic shocks and suffer fewer slowdowns in economic growth. A 2016 report estimated that achieving global gender parity in economic activity by 2025 would add as much as $28 trillion to annual GDP, an amount equal to the combined economies of the United States and China. Confronting the barriers that keep women from being able to fully participate in their local markets is key to generating sustainable, economic growth. And this means not only expanding women’s access to the financial system, but also, as cell phones become more and more available, expanding their access to new financial technology like mobile money. The Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act addresses barriers to women’s economic inclusion in developing countries by requiring that all USAID strategies and projects and activities be shaped by a gender analysis and by expanding the agency’s microenterprise assistance authorities to support smalland mediumsized womenowned businesses. This is critical as small and mediumsized enterprises create four out of five new jobs in developing economies. So the bill is the result of the committee’s extended focus on empowering women and girls through U.S. foreign policy, which has been the subject of five full committee hearings and other subcommittee hearings in recent Congresses. Our women’s empowerment initiative has produced significant legislation including: the Girls Count Act of 2015, the Protecting Girls’ Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act, and the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017, among others. Mr. Speaker, I believe that we should invest our limited foreign assistance dollars wisely, and I have seen the good things that happen when we focus on empowering women. That is what this bill does, and I ask for my colleagues’ support in helping to make it happen. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, H.R. 5480, the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act. I want to thank Mr. ROYCE  and Ms. LOISFRANKEL for their work on this bill. This is an important bill that expands U.S. development policy to empower women entrepreneurs in developing countries. In 2016, the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that achieving global gender parity in economic activity could add as much as $28 trillion to the annual gross domestic product by the year 2025. This bill will help unlock the productive power of women, and particularly womenowned small and mediumsized enterprises. In the interest of time, I won’t go into the details because we have excellent speakers on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill, which passed our committee by a unanimous bipartisan voice vote, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ), chairwoman emeritus on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I ask unanimous consent that she may control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE for introducing 
this important bipartisan measure before us today, and of course, congratulate both him and Ranking Member ENGEL , who work so well in bringing important legislation in a bipartisan manner to the floor every day. This is H.R. 5480, the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, and I am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan measure. We know that when women work, and the number of women in the workforce is increasing, there is a corresponding growth in economies. The benefit that results from empowering women and expanding their economic activities are far reaching. They have a great society impact. From the household to communities, to local, State, and the Federal level, we would see drastic improvements if women not only had greater access, but greater influence over income and finances. Yet, sadly, women continue to face seemingly insurmountable barriers that deter them from becoming full and equal members of society, particularly when it comes to access to formal financial institutions, and that is what this bill would do. It updates and expands USAID policies with respect to microenterprise assistance authority, to chip away at those barriers that exist now. It will also include support for small and mediumsized enterprises. These are the real drivers of employment in so many places around the globe. Also, it would provide women with greater access to economic activities. It will improve the working environment for women and support their property rights. It is a commonsense approach, Mr. Speaker. By increasing women’s participation in the workforce around the world, we will be creating greater economic benefits with positive implications for all aspects of society. Mr. Speaker, I fully support Mr. ROYCE ’s measure. I urge my colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL ), the lead Democratic sponsor of this bill. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, keeping peace in the world, reducing terrorism, creating safe environments where countries can be selfreliant and people can be prosperous is not just about more guns and bombs. Addressing the root causes of global upheaval is an important task. It is an important task of USAID that calls itself the world’s premier development agency, which leads me to thank Mr. ROYCE and Ranking Member E NGEL for their bipartisan leadership and for the other cosponsors of this legislation for this very important bill that we call the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, which recognizes that when girls and women of the world are free from violence, educated, and have access to tools for economic success, their communities are more safe, more economically vibrant, and more peaceful. This is, of course, when women exert greater influence over household finances, economic outcomes for their families improve. The childhood survival rates go up, food security, and educational attainment increases for their children. Women actually place a greater emphasis on household savings, which improves a family’s financial resiliency. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to comprehend the hardships and obstacles that women face globally. I think of a girl like Fatim, born in Mali. At just 8 months old, she was subjected to genital mutilation. By age 12, her father sold her for marriage to a man she had never met. She is among the one in three girls worldwide who will suffer genderbased violence. I think of Nasha, a young Nigerian, desperate for an education, who walks miles, fearful of sexual violence or kidnapping just to get to class. She doesn’t want to become one of the 130 million girls worldwide who are out of school; or Kamila, a woman in Pakistan who dreams of starting her own business and being able to care for her family, but discriminatory laws prevent her from owning property or accessing credit. She is among the 1 billion women in the world excluded from the formal financial system. Given all of the roadblocks, it is not surprising that women and girls are the majority of the world’s poor. Here is the thing: Many of these cruel and unfair practices make the world poorer, too, as we have heard from my colleagues. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, a leading international private sector think tank, if we change this equation and we advance women’s equality, we could add trillions to the global GDP in just years. We are recognizing today that there is an undeniable link between women’s economic success and global prosperity and peacefulness and security. Now, this bill has several components. It makes it USAID policy to do the following: to reduce gender gaps in economic opportunity; to strive to eliminate genderbased violence; to support women’s property rights; and to increase the capability of women and girls to determine their own future. b1745 Next, the bill requires that 50 percent of USAID’s resources for small and mediumsized enterprises be targeted to reach enterprises owned, managed, and controlled by women. It codifies USAID’s practice of shaping policy and activities through a gender analysis. As important, to ensure that our development assistance is reaching women, this legislation mandates that USAID track and measure improvements in women’s economic empowerment, including employment, access to financial services, enterprise development, earnings and control over income, and property and land rights. Finally, this legislation also expands the scope of development assistance from microenterprises to smalland mediumsized enterprises to reflect changes in the field. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining me in support of this critical bill. Again, it is not about bombs, military, and guns. Remember this: when women succeed, when girls succeed, their nations succeed. Mr. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS). Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for bringing this legislation, but especially my colleague, Congresswoman FRANKEL , for being such a champion for women’s rights and issues not only in this country, but around the globe. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, which, as you have heard by those more eloquent than I, will help to ensure that women’s economic development is a fundamental tenet of U.S. development policy. Women tend to spend more of their money on family costs like education and healthcare than men do. Unfortunately, they lack access to financial services and must rely on riskier and less reliable means of borrowing and saving. If global gender parity in economic activity were achieved, we could add as much as $28 trillion to the annual global GDP. That should be incentive enough for us to work to ensure that our government understands and has the capabilities to meet the unique economic needs of women, particularly since women represent more than half the world’s population and a majority of the world’s poor. Now, in addition to serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am proud to be the cochair of the Congressional Mongolian Caucus. We are working with the Mongolian Government to support the cashmere production industry to diversify its miningdependent economy. Notably, an average of 90 percent of the workers in the Mongolian textile sector are female. So if we work to ensure that these women in the cashmere industry have the support, resources, and financial literacy to prosper, we will not only be boosting individual women, we will be boosting an entire economy and will be boosting Mongolia overall. 
This is just one example where uplifting women can benefit an entire industry, a society, and a national prosperity, which, in turn, fosters democratic stability. As Lois has said, when women succeed, the world succeeds, so I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Women and girls around the world must be included in and empowered by ongoing U.S. investments in diplomacy, development, and security. The Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act requires USAID to address genderspecific challenges across the world, and it expands support for small and mediumsized enterprises that are owned, managed, and controlled by women. It also explicitly establishes that it is our national policy to support the empowerment of women worldwide. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, which passed our committee by unanimous, bipartisan voice vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE and my friend from Florida, Congresswoman FRANKEL , for bringing forward this important bipartisan bill. All countries of the world stand to benefit from the increased participation of women in their economies and in their societies at large. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ‘‘aye,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5480, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EAST ROSEBUD WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS ACT Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4645) to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments of East Rosebud Creek in Carbon County, Montana, as components of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4645 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, East Rosebud Creek is located in Carbon County, Montana, just north of AbsarokaBeartooth Wilderness in the Custer National Forest. The bill before us designates a 13 mile segment of East Rosebud Creek, beginning at its source, the East Rosebud Lake, as a wild and scenic river. A second 7mile segment from the outlet of East Rosebud Lake to the point where the waterway enters private property would be designated as a recreational river. This legislation specifically applies only to the segments of the creek that lie within public lands. Important historical uses outside of the wild and scenic boundary are protected by this bill. Finally, H.R. 4645 explicitly prevents the creation of a buffer zone to restrict land use outside of the designated area. This legislation is the result of a compromise supported by a diverse coalition that includes local ranchers, sportsmen, conservationists, and business owners. Companion legislation has been introduced with the support of both Montana Senators. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I my consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill designates a 13 mile segment of East Rosebud Creek in the Custer National Forest as a wild river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This segment was nominated for designation in 1989, so 30 years later it finally comes to Congress, and we are moving forward with the recognition and protection it deserves. The bill contributes to a proud legacy of preserving free and flowing rivers for future generations, and I want to extend my congratulations to the sponsor of the legislation and the entire Montana delegation for their fine work. I know there are several bills that have been introduced by Democrats that seek to designate wild and scenic rivers in their districts. I hope we can move those along as well by working together to make sure these places also receive the appropriate attention as this particular one did. For now, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to 
the author of this measure, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ). Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, East Rosebud Creek is one of Montana’s most picturesque and popular streams. It is located in Carbon County, Montana, just north of the Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness in the Custer National Forest. It provides important habitat for fish and wildlife as well as a myriad of recreational activities, including hiking, fishing, hunting, kayaking, and climbing. My bill designates a 13mile section of East Rosebud Creek beginning at its source, the East Rosebud Lake, as a wild river. A second 7mile section from the outlet of East Rosebud Lake to the point where the waterway enters private property would be designated as a recreational river. This legislation specifically applies only to the segments of the creek that lie within public lands. Important historical uses outside of the wild and scenic river boundary are protected by this bill. Finally, H.R. 4645 explicitly prevents the creation of a buffer zone to restrict land use outside of the designated area. This legislation represents a great compromise that has earned support from a diverse coalition that includes local ranchers, sportsmen, conservationists, businesses owners, and others. Companion legislation has been introduced with the support of the entire Montana delegation, including both Senators. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4645. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
AUTHORIZING NATIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES MEMORIAL FOUNDATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1037) to authorize the National Emergency Medical Services Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1037 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, each year 850,000 EMS providers answer more than 30 million calls to serve 22 million patients in need at a moment’s notice and without reservation. For these heroes who serve on the front lines of medicine, sacrifice is a part of their calling. EMTs and paramedics have a rate of injury that is about three times the national average for all occupations, and some pay the ultimate price in the service of helping others. The men and women of the emergency medical services profession face danger every day to save lives and help their neighbors in crisis. They respond to incidents ranging from a single person’s medical emergency to natural and manmade disasters, including terrorist attacks. But while their first responder peers in law enforcement and firefighting have been honored with national memorials, EMS providers have not. H.R. 1037 aims to change that. The National Emergency Medical Services Memorial Foundation exists to honor, recognize, and remember the commitment, service, and sacrifice of our Nation’s EMS heroes. H.R. 1037 would authorize this foundation to place a commemorative work on Federal land in the District of Columbia to commemorate the commitment and service represented by the EMS community. The foundation will be solely responsible for funding the project, and no Federal funds will be required. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH ), who is the principal sponsor of the legislation. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California for his words of support and also thank the gentleman from Arizona for the courtesy of yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express strong support for my bill, H.R. 1037, the National Emergency Medical Services Commemorative Work Act. This bipartisan legislation will create a National Emergency Medical Services Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative memorial located here on Federal land in Washington, D.C., that will highlight and honor the commitment and sacrifice of emergency medical personnel across the United States. As the chairman noted, each year, there are 850,000 first responders of the emergency medical services who answer over 30 million calls while serving 22 million Americans who are in need of lifesaving care. Americans rely on the courage and selfless sacrifice of the men and women of the emergency medical services, and we all deeply appreciate their commitment to maintaining safety and medical security in our country. b1800 Mr. Speaker, this memorial will serve as a symbol of their sacrifice during the darkest moments in our Nation’s history. For example, this September will mark the 17th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. On that day, within minutes of the attack, more than 100 EMS units and dozens of private ambulances raced to the site, setting up triage centers to treat the wounded. Of the nearly 3,000 victims that died on September 11th, 10 were courageous EMS personnel. More than a decade later, in my home city of Boston, Massachusetts, 
EMS providers were literally on site within seconds of the explosions during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. As a result of their swift and wellcoordinated rescue efforts, led by my dear friend and South Boston native, the late Boston EMS special ops director Captain Bob ‘‘Sarge’’ Haley, EMS personnel were able to treat the 260 people who were injured. Lauded for his skills in designing and implementing worldclass special ops measures in the city of Boston, Captain Sarge Haley’s leadership during the events of that day no doubt saved dozens of lives and is just another example of the sacrifice and heroism that H.R. 1037 seeks to memorialize. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, EMS personnel have been first on site for some of our Nation’s deadliest mass shootings. During the Las Vegas shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival last fall, EMT Brittany Speer, who was attending the event with her family, set up a triage center after the shooting occurred. For years, EMS providers like Ms. Speer have treated and transported victims in a professional and compassionate manner. This efficient and effective response is a result of countless mass casualty exercises that EMS personnel undertake. Mr. Speaker, this memorial is long overdue. These examples are just a small fraction of the countless instances in which EMS personnel have sacrificed and served our Nation. Every day, EMS personnel are exposed to countless risks and dangers in order to provide critical care for those who are in need. It is proper to recognize the efforts of our dedicated EMS first responders and memorialize the personal sacrifice made by more than 600 members of the Nation’s emergency medical service and, in turn, by their families and loved ones. As Members of Congress, we should pass this bipartisan bill and begin the creation of the commemorative memorial to EMS personnel. These individuals have rightfully earned this recognition, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand as one and pass H.R. 1037. Again, I thank the gentleman from California for his support. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for bringing this bill to us. I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1037, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
JUAB COUNTY CONVEYANCE ACT OF 2018 Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3777) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey certain National Forest System land containing the Nephi Work Center in Juab County, Utah, to Juab County, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3777 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Juab County Conveyance Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3777, introduced by Congresswoman MIALOVE, would authorize the transfer of approximately 2.6 acres of U.S. Forest Service land and improvements in the city of Nephi to Juab County, Utah. The bill would require the county to pay all conveyance costs, including the cost of environmental analysis and surveying. This land has been designated by the U.S. Forest Service for administrative disposal since 2013. Under an agreement with the Forest Service, the county fire department houses its mitigation program on this site. On August 15, 2017, the county requested the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer this property to the county, which intends to use the land to house its wildlands fire team and equipment, with plans to construct a new fire station on the property. As fires continue to rage across the West, Congress should take every opportunity to give local communities the resources and support they need to combat these catastrophic events. While this transfer represents just two tenthousandths of 1 percent of the 1.5 million acres of Federal land in Juab County, the new fire station it will facilitate could mean the difference between suppression and conflagration when wildfire threatens Juab County. The legislation would also improve fire response services to surrounding communities and the Federal lands, since Juab County plans to use this land to house its wildlands fire team equipment. There is strong local support from the county and its elected officials for this conveyance. By ensuring that the surrounding communities and public lands have the emergency response resources they need to respond to catastrophic wildfire, H.R. 3777 furthers the important localFederal partnership 
that is critical to restoring the Federal Government as a good neighbor to the communities it impacts. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. At the markup of H.R. 3777, we voiced our concerns that the conveyance authorized by this bill does not include any standard requirements such as, if it is sold, fair market value; if it is conveyed, a reversionary clause. Unfortunately, the majority rejected our amendment to include a reversionary clause. We recognize that this property was identified as suitable for administrative disposal, but that designation doesn’t mean that it is worthless. We are not being greedy or unreasonable, just mindful of history and precedent. With that said, we recognize how important this conveyance is to the county, and we will save this particular fight for another day. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE). Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this bill is being considered today. This bill is both timely and extremely important to my constituents. This summer, tens of thousands of acres have burned throughout Utah. Unfortunately, many regions in the State remain at high risk due to prolonged drought. One of these regions is Juab County, which sits within my district. Juab County consists of more than 2 million acres of land, much of which is covered with dry, flammable vegetation. The county is also experiencing a yearslong drought. In fact, last year, the USDA designated the county as a disaster area due to the damages caused by the drought. More than 70 percent of Juab is controlled by the Federal Government. While significant Federal ownership and control of land in Utah is often a source of contention, Juab County has developed a cooperative and constructive relationship with their local Federal partners. The Forest Service currently owns a small property, just over 2 acres, within the town of Nephi, the county seat of Juab County. It has been vacant and unused for years and was identified as available for disposal several years ago. This property is known as the Nephi Work Center. My bill, the Juab County Conveyance Act, would simply convey this property to the county. Juab intends to use this property to house their wildlands fire team, which is part of their special service fire district. This would enable the county to more effectively mitigate fire risks and protect Juab County residents and both Forest Service and BLM land within the county. As a former mayor who has dealt with fires in and around my community, including on public lands, I want to do all I can to help my constituents. This bill will benefit both the county and Federal agencies that own and manage lands within the county. We are talking about a city of about 1,000 people fighting fires on millions of acres. We just want to do everything we can to make sure we get to the fires as soon as possible and help not just protect costs, but the homes and the livelihoods of the families that live there. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of this bill. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3777, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GILA RIVER INDIAN COMMUNITY FEDERAL RIGHTSOFWAY, EASEMENTS AND BOUNDARY CLARIFICATION ACT Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4032) to confirm undocumented Federal rightsofway or easements on the Gila River Indian Reservation, clarify the northern boundary of the Gila River Indian Community’s Reservation, to take certain land located in Maricopa County and Pinal County, Arizona, into trust for the benefit of the Gila River Indian Community, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4032 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Gila River Indian Community Federal RightsofWay, Easements and Boundary Clarification Act’’. 
Nothing in this Act shall establish, terminate, or otherwise impact any rightofway or easement associated with Hunt Highway in Pinal County, Arizona, including the portion of Hunt Highway that traverses the Reservation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 4032, the Gila River Indian Community FederalRightsofWay, Easements and Boundary Clarification Act, introduced by Congressman O’HALLERAN of Arizona. The Gila River Indian Reservation was established in 1859 and later expanded by a series of executive orders 
in Maricopa and Pinal Counties, Arizona. In 2006, the Tribe sued the Federal Government, alleging a breach of the United States’ fiduciary duty for its failure to accurately survey the reservation’s northwesterly boundary, resulting in the patenting of land along the Salt River to nonIndians. The Tribe also asserted a failed duty to document rightsofway across the reservation, collect rent, and account for the Tribe’s and allottees’ trust assets. Rather than litigate the case, the Obama administration settled with the Tribe in 2016. The settlement provided that the United States would survey all the Federal rightsofway on the reservation. It would also take approximately 3,400 acres of Bureau of Land Management land into trust for the Tribe, after the Tribe purchases the land for fair market value. Finally, the settlement provided monetary damages of about $12.5 million from the judgment fund, an issue not addressed by this bill. This legislation is needed to facilitate portions of the settlement by clarifying the northwestern boundary of the reservation, documenting the existing Federal rightsofway on the reservation, and placing the 3,400 acres into trust after the Tribe buys the land from the Federal Government. The bill is cosponsored by the entire Arizona delegation, and I commend their work to resolve this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ), the sponsor of the legislation. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support and urge passage of my legislation, H.R. 4032, the Gila River Indian Community Federal RightsofWay, Easements and Boundary Clarification Act. I was proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation along with colleagues Congressmen Biggs, Gallego, and Gosar. Mr. Speaker, as we all know, Tribal Nations were here prior to the formation of the United States. However, throughout history, many Federal laws were enacted that diminished land holdings and, as a result, reservation boundaries were often incorrectly adjusted. The Federal Government often lacked the mechanisms to effectively keep track of the various rightsofway that existed on Tribal lands. These challenges remain today and can be serious barriers to Tribal land use efforts for housing, economic development, and cultural purposes. That is why I introduced my bill, which simply finalizes the settlement of longstanding issues related to the Federal Government’s management of Tribal trust assets on the Gila River Indian Community. b1815 The legislation provides for surveys of all the Federal rightsofway on the reservation and establishes a map of those rightsofway to aid the community in planning land use, including building homes, rebuilding schools, locating businesses, and ensuring access to cultural sites. H.R. 4032 also clarifies the northwest boundary of the reservation, which will avoid a title dispute with the city of Phoenix. In exchange for giving up lands that are currently within the reservation boundary, the community will be able to purchase 3,400 acres of culturally relevant lands from the Bureau of Land Management and have those lands taken into trust. H.R. 4032 is important to the Gila River Indian community, to local landowners, and nearby communities. I would like to thank my colleagues across the aisle for supporting this legislation, as well as the chairman and ranking member. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and the administration to ensure this settlement is fully implemented. On behalf of our Arizona communities, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, necessary legislation. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the Gila River Indian community, their leadership, which has worked tirelessly and in very good faith with the Federal Government in addressing the issues that led to these claims against the United States. I would like to congratulate them on this hard work and their persistence, and I am happy that the passage of this bill will finally implement a final part of their settlement. I also want to take time to thank my colleague and friend from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4032, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the consideration of H.R. 6147, and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. NORMAN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 996 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 6147. The Chair appoints the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 6147) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, with Ms. CHENEY in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. b1900 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6147, the fiscal year 2019 Interior, Environment, and Financial Services and General Government appropriations bills. This package continues the House’s important work on our annual government funding legislation. With the passage of this bill, the House will be halfway done with our fiscal year 2019 bills through the floor. I want to thank, and I am sure Ranking Member LOWEY thanks both Chairman CALVERT and his ranking member, and Chairman GRAVES and his ranking member for their work with their colleagues. These bills fund vital programs across the Federal Government, including those that make Americans safer, protect our Nation’s resources, and create jobs. In addition to providing this necessary funding, the bills ensure that the Federal Government is working efficiently and in the best interest of the American taxpayers. This includes streamlining Federal agencies, reforming financial policies, and reducing burdensome regulatory red tape. Both bills reflect American priorities. I would like to highlight just a few of these. The Interior and Environment appropriations bill, authored by Representative CALVERT of California, provides $35.3 billion for the EPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of the Interior and other programs that promote our natural heritage. Within this total, the bill prioritizes funding to fight in preventing devastating wildfires, fully funding the 10 year average for suppression costs. The bill also targets critical resources to major infrastructure that will improve the lives of Americans, boosting funding to ensure communities have access to safe drinking water, and accelerates the cleanup of Superfund sites. This is especially important as we have more than 1,300 national priority sites awaiting urgent attention to address hazardous materials threatening the health of Americans across the country. I appreciate Chairman CALVERT ’s efforts in this area. The Interior bill continues funding for other programs that manage our national resources and cultural heritage, like the National Park Service, the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, the Chemical Safety Board, and the Smithsonian Institution. Beyond these important investments, the bill rightsizes regulatory programs to ensure that the government is working to support American families and their communities. This also includes addressing EPA’s regulatory agenda and supporting the administration’s proposal to reshape its workforce. This will enable the agency to focus on its core duties, while reducing unnecessary spending. The second bill in this package also works to reduce waste across government. The Financial Services appropriations bill, authored by Representative GRAVES of Georgia, totals $23.4 billion which, like the Interior bill, is equal to fiscal year 2018 levels. This bill prioritizes effective programs that improve our national security and expands economic opportunity while finding efficiencies, governmentwide, and while stopping harmful overregulation. This bill also supports America’s small businesses by providing loans and resources that will help us grow and thrive. It also provides stability for our financial system, and protects consumers, and investors. This bill also improves accountability of the American taxpayer by directing the Internal Revenue Service funding towards customer service and stopping the misuse of funding within the agency. Another priority is law enforcement. This bill also provides funding to fight the opioid abuse epidemic, protects our financial institutions from cyber crime, and supports our Federal courts. I would like to commend all the committee members on the Appropriations Committee who led the drafting of these bills, particularly Chairman GRAVES and his Ranking Member, M IKE QUIGLEY , and Interior Chairman K EN CALVERT and his Ranking Member, BETTY MCCOLLUM , along with their subcommittee members and their professional staff that did a remarkable job. I am pleased that the House is taking the next step forward on our appropriations bill this evening. I reserve the balance of my time.

Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong opposition to the Interior, Environment, and Financial Services, and General Government minibus, that fails the American people by slashing environmental protection, rolling back consumer protections, and even cutting basic election security funding. With bills this bad, it is no wonder Republicans have abandoned all pretense of regular order, grouped two unrelated appropriations bills together, and blocked numerous Democratic amendments. These bills are the product of Republicans’ misguided priorities. Instead of using the $18 billion increase in nondefense discretionary spending to create jobs and grow our economy, Republicans have chosen to waste those resources on an unnecessary border wall and cruel attacks on immigrant families. We must do better. As much as it pains me to say, we should be following the Senate and producing bipartisan bills instead of wasting time on playing political games and taking show votes to appease the right wing of the Republican Conference. Turning to the substance of the bills before us, it is absolutely outrageous that they would: Cut the Environmental Protection Agency by $100 million; slash clean water infrastructure grants by $300 million; sink $585 million into a black hole that is dressed up with a fancy name, the Fund for America’s Kids and Grandkids, which is a ploy to not spend the entire financial services allocation; reduce investments in underserved communities through the Community Development Financial Institutions program by $34 million; and provide inadequate funding for small business loan programs and for investments that curb the opioid crisis. However, the bill’s worst cut is the zeroing out of election security grants. On Friday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for their interference in the 2016 presidential election. The indictment describes, in great detail, the efforts Russia took to break into State election databases. We have all heard the public warnings of our intelligence community that Russia will attempt to attack our democracy again. Yet, instead of helping States protect and fortify their election infrastructure from cyber hacking, this bill would eliminate election security grants entirely. Additionally, numerous harmful policy riders strike at the heart of laws and rules that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, threaten the survival of endangered species, attack a woman’s right to choose, undermine democracy in the District of Columbia, and repeal important DoddFrank consumer protections. These bills represent a divisive, partisan approach that threatens to leave American communities more polluted and American families more vulnerable to financial predators. We must do better. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), the chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chairman, it is my distinct honor to bring to the House floor the fiscal year 2019 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. Before I go into details about the bill, I would like to commend Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for his leadership and support throughout this process. As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the fiscal year 2019 Interior and Environment bill is funded at $35.252 billion, which is equal to the FY18 enacted level. We have made sincere efforts to prioritize critical needs within our subcommittee allocation and in reviewing more than 5,200 individual requests. In the interest of time, I won’t outline all the problems or programs and activities funded in this bill. I would like to point out a few highlights. The bill provides robust wildland fire funding totaling $3.9 billion. It fully funds the 10year average for wildland fire suppression costs and provides an additional $500 million in suppression funds for the Forest Service. The committee has also provided a $30 million increase over fiscal year 2018 for hazardous fuel reduction. The bill provides $500 million in fiscal year 2019 for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes, PILT program, which is a top priority for many Members on both sides of the aisle. The bill also makes critical investments in Indian Country, a top priority of this committee. This legislation honors our commitment to Native Americans with a particular emphasis on Indian health, law enforcement, education, and water settlements. The bill fully funds contract support costs and Tribal grant school support costs; provides funding to staff newly constructed health facilities; improves public safety; significantly increases economic development; invests an additional $16 million in fiscal year 2019 to address needs of schools throughout the BIE system; and invests an additional $82 million to correct funding disparities across the Indian Healthcare System. Overall, funding to EPA has been reduced by $100 million from fiscal year 2018, with reductions aimed at research and regulatory programs. Members from the Midwest will be pleased to know that the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is maintained at the fiscal year 2018 enacted level of $300 million. The bill continues to invest in water infrastructure and cleaning up contaminated land. These programs help create jobs and spur economic development in communities all across the Nation. The bill provides funds to leverage over $10 billion worth of investment in water infrastructure through the funding in the WIFIA program and the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds. The bill also provides $3.2 billion for the National Park Service. It maintains, and builds upon, critical investments made in the fiscal year 2018 enacted bill to address longstanding park operations and deferred maintenance needs. We have also attempted to address a number of concerns within the Fish and Wildlife Service accounts. The bill restores popular grant programs through fiscal year 2018 enacted levels. It also restores funds to combat international wildlife trafficking; protects fish hatcheries from cuts and closures; and continues funding to fight invasive mussels and Asian carp; and reduces the backlog of species that are recovered but not yet delisted. We have also increased funds for the Recovery Challenge program, which we started in 2018 to challenge nonFederal partners to a more active role in recovering endangered species. The bill also provides $360 million for Land and Water Conservation programs with bipartisan support. Lastly, this bill makes significant investments toward critical deferred maintenance, construction, and infrastructure needs within the Department of the Interior, Forest Service, Indian Health Service, Smithsonian, as well as critical air and water infrastructure programs within the EPA. In closing, I would like to thank staff on both sides of the aisle who have worked long hours on this legislation. On the minority side, I would like to thank Rita Culp, Jocelyn Hunn, and Rebecca Taylor. On the majority side, I would like to thank Darren Benjamin, Betsy Bina, Jackie Kilroy, Kristin Richmond, Mac Cloyes, and Dave LesStrang from the committee staff, as well as Ian Foley, Rebecca Keightley, Tricia Evans and Dave Kennett from my personal staff. To say the least, this has been a team effort. b1915 Lastly, I would like to thank my good friend and ranking member, BETTY MCCOLLUM , for working with me to address a number of critical needs throughout the bill. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from California. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, while we may disagree on some issues, we are never disagreeable and we continue to work well together. Madam Chair, it is a good bill. I urge its adoption. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ), the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. (Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I would like to thank Ranking Member LOWEY as well as the full committee chair for their work, but I would like to give a special thanks to Chairman CALVERT and his staff, whom he mentioned by name, and of course my wonderful staff, including my personal staff, for working together using a collaborative approach to help us move forward. The subcommittee has a challenging portfolio of issues, and I commend the chairman’s efforts to maintain many of the fiscal year 2018 investments, such as addressing the backlog of deferred maintenance on Federal lands and investing in Indian Country. I want to express how sincerely proud I am of this subcommittee’s nonpartisan approach to addressing the issues facing our Native American brothers and sisters. I am pleased that the bill recommends an increase of $410 million over the fiscal year 2018 enacted level for programs critical to Indian Country. The health, education, and safety of our Tribal communities is a Federal responsibility that our subcommittee takes very seriously, and that is the one bright spot in this bill; but, unfortunately, other important priorities for the American public did not fare as well. Even though the fiscal year 2019 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee allocation is equal to the fiscal year 2018 enacted level, the majority is proposing a $100 million cut from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is just untenable. The cuts in this bill would target air and water quality programs, reduce Federal funding to enforce the law against polluters, and, if enacted, they will undermine the EPA’s ability to keep our families and communities healthy and to protect our environment for future generations. We are at a defining moment in history. The Interior bill has an opportunity to make a global difference in the quality of life for generations to come, but, sadly, this bill is a mirror of the Trump administration’s actions and disregard for the environment. We cannot afford to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence the planet is warming, sea levels are rising, and glaciers are melting. We must do more, not less, to pursue policies and programs that will put us on the right path to conserve and protect our natural resources and the planet we call home. The bill before us also reduces funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund by $65 million from the fiscal year 2018 enacted level. This program has strong bipartisan support. It conserves natural areas and provides recreational opportunities in all 50 States. The American people expect us to be good stewards of our public lands and wildlife, but this bill falls short on that commitment. In addition to the irresponsible cuts to the EPA, I must express my concern and my disappointment to the 18 partisan riders in this bill that pander to special interests at the expense of the public good. These riders undermine clean water and clean air safeguards, jeopardize protection and recovery for vulnerable species, and even intercede in California water issues outside of the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. The Senate has committed to work in a bipartisan manner to keep controversial policy riders out of their appropriations bills. I agree with that strategy and believe these policy issues should receive a full and transparent debate in the authorizing committees of jurisdiction. Congress must stop holding the government hostage over these ideological policy riders. And, finally, it is impossible to talk about the bill that funds the Environmental Protection Agency without addressing the ethical problems that have plagued this administration and were embodied by the former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. There is ample evidence that the former Administrator was misusing Federal dollars for lavish expenses and prioritizing the interest of corporations over protecting America’s families. Mr. Pruitt may be gone from the Agency, but Congress should be doing considerable oversight to ensure that a culture of transparency and accountability is restored at the EPA. We should also be doing our best to ensure that every agency we fund is not abusing taxpayers’ dollars. So I am deeply disappointed that my Republican colleagues voted down multiple amendments in our committee markup that would have held up our responsibility for oversight and adequately funded ongoing investigations. They also denied several more Democratic oversight amendments a chance to come to this floor for debate today. Madam Chair, this bill fails the American people. It cuts environmental protections. It removes safeguards for our air and water and endangered species and allows rampant corruption in the executive branch to go unchecked. I know we can do better than this, and it is my hope we will do better after conference. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from Minnesota. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I thank Mrs. LOWEY for yielding. So despite my current opposition, I intend to continue to work with the chairman through this year’s appropriations process to produce a responsible bill that I know we can have both parties support in the end. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. GRAVES ), the chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I rise tonight to fight for America’s kids and grandkids. That is what we are here to do. This fiscal year 2019 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill, as I will explain in a moment, reflects the public outcry over deficit spending and addresses those concerns on behalf of America’s kids and grandkids. Madam Chair, before I dive into those details, I want to thank Ranking Member QUIGLEY for his hard work and dedication to our work together as we have shepherded this committee through the process in this bill. I want to mention a few of the bill’s highlights. This bill is a product of a very Memberdriven process. We brought appropriators and authorizers together. We consulted other committees. We fostered personal MembertoMember conversations to make sure that priorities in this bill were vetted and supported across jurisdictions. We held several public hearings and reviewed over 2,100 unique Member requests as we put this bill together. As the bill passed out of this Appropriations Committee, it passed with bipartisan support. What more can you do on behalf of America’s kids and grandkids? As in past years, we aimed to provide the oversight and allocate taxpayer dollars with the greatest of care. This bill includes resources to implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which cuts taxes for families and businesses all across our country, spurring economic growth. The funding in our bill will help implement the law very quickly so American families can use the system without disruption whatsoever. In addition, this bill prioritizes law enforcement, homeland security, and cybersecurity. For example, it provides record funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and DrugFree Communities programs. It updates the legacy IT systems that are governmentwide—we have all seen it and we have heard about it—through the Technology Modernization Fund. Similar to our landmark approach last year, this bill also includes major financial reforms. It cuts regulations, streamlines agency processes. In fact, this bill includes more than 20 pieces of legislation that have passed through this body with bipartisan support, in most cases with more than 270 votes. Now, importantly, one of these reforms brings transparency and oversight to an agency we have all talked about, and that is to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, by bringing it under the authority of Congress and under the authority of the Appropriations Committee. 
Now, with these kinds of reforms, this bill has earned a lot of support across our country. From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Investment Company Institute, the American Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, National Association of FederallyInsured Credit Unions, and Credit Union National Association, in addition to the National Taxpayers Union and Citizens for Responsible Budgeting, this bill is bringing together a lot of different interests all across our country. In closing, Madam Chair, I would like to highlight, really, what the heart of this bill is, the major feature of this bill. If your district is anything like mine, you know the American people are frustrated. They are frustrated with Congress, and they are frustrated with this outofcontrol spending. They see our annual deficits fuel our dangerous national debt. So it is time to try something different, and that is what we have done, because if we don’t, we will stay stuck in this fiscal death spiral that we are in. Now, after a lot of thought and effort, we came up with a very creative way to protect funding from being spent. The appropriations process does not make saving money easy, not at all. We all know that if a subcommittee such as mine doesn’t spend everything, another subcommittee will come in and scoop it up and spend it somewhere else. This is just the way legislating is in Washington. So we came up with something different, and we created a new fund in this bill called the Fund for America’s Kids and Grandkids, which safeguards funds for America’s future generations. In fact, it is like a savings account. We put $585 million from this bill as an initial deposit into the savings account, and this money is protected. It cannot be spent until Treasury indicates that we have balanced our budget or we have a surplus. Now, this deposit is only 2.5 percent. It is 2.5 percent of what we were allocated. That is 2
1⁄2pennies of every dollar that we spend. But this is a great step forward, and it is on behalf of America’s kids and grandkids. This approach causes us to think about what deficit spending truly means and in whose name we are borrowing the money and who ultimately is going to get stuck with this debt. Establishing the Fund for America’s Kids and Grandkids means we are appropriating with a new spirit here in Washington, D.C., and that is just because you can spend it doesn’t mean you have to. Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY ), the ranking member of the Financial Services Subcommittee. Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Madam Chair, I first want to thank Chairman GRAVES , whom I had the privilege of working with for a second year in managing this bill. Our discussions have been both passionate and productive, and I thank him for always allowing for vigorous debate throughout the process. And, of course, I would again like to thank the staff on both sides for their work behind the scenes that went into preparing this bill for floor consideration. In particular, I would like to recognize and thank committee staff on the minority side, Lisa, Chris, Angela, Martha, as well as Doug from my personal office. But with that said, I continue to strongly oppose the bill before us today. Given its flat allocation of $23.4 billion, this bill does not adequately meet the growing needs of our small businesses, taxpayers, and middle class consumers and investors. To be fair, I do want to acknowledge how pleased I was to see increased funding for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Federal Defender Services, and the Small Business Administration, three very different priorities, each critical in its own right; but this does not negate the cuts suffered by some of our most important agencies tasked with missions ranging from policing Wall Street to supporting investment in our most underserved communities. After losing over a billion dollars in funding and 18,000 staff between 2010 and 2017, my friends in the majority have reversed course and have begun providing the IRS with additional funds to implement their new law, yet taxpayer service is cut by $15 million. GSA’s funding for new construction is cut by over $400 million, and funds for major and basic repairs and alterations come in at $194 million below the requested amount. The SEC, which is tasked with protecting investors and ensuring fairness in our capital markets, is cut by over $200 million, even though the Commission’s budget is financed by industry fees. The CDFI Fund, after receiving increased funding of $250 million in fiscal year 2018, was inexplicably cut by $59 million in the original draft. With an additional $25 million for CDFI approved in committee, it is still not enough. Failing to fully fund the program means fewer resources to spur economic growth and revitalization in our most underserved communities. In addition to these cuts, the bill contains a long list of partisan riders, both old and new, blocking the IRS from enforcing the Johnson amendment and restricting the SEC from requiring companies to disclose political contributions. It would interfere in the local affairs of D.C. in an infinite number of ways, which simply must stop. b1930 Let’s talk about the business at hand. I was heartened to see Republicans speak out against the President’s performance in Helsinki. The reaction to the President not understanding the full breadth and width of the Russian attack on our democratic process was extraordinary. The Russians attacked us. They will be back. Most likely, they probably never left. But those tweets are one thing. You have to put your dollars and your votes where your tweets are. After providing the States with $380 million in grants to help fortify and protect election systems from cyber hacking, this bill zeroes out that fund for 2019. I have made this argument time and again, but it is worth repeating that the $380 million that has been allocated is a step in the right direction, but it is only a down payment. For a majority of the 13 States that still use voting machines with no paper trail, at most, the funds they receive only cover half the replacement costs. Forty States use old equipment, which cannot handle modern anticyber hacking software. The entity that manages these grants, EAC, has announced that every State has requested funding, showing overwhelming demand for these resources. That is why I offered an amendment in the committee markup to restore funding for the program. Unfortunately, it failed in a partyline vote. Let me emphasize, again: We must do more to protect our democratic process from those who wish us harm, not just for the upcoming midterms, but for 2020 and beyond. Most States maxed out the amount of money they could request from this program. Obviously, many other States, I suspect, would be a little more enthusiastic if the President didn’t tell them this was a witch hunt or a hoax. So there is much more we can do toward that end. Let’s remind ourselves of the last time we had an election debacle of this magnitude: BushGore. This government spent $3.4 billion. Why? Because we treasure the democratic process. We want every vote to count, and we certainly don’t want a foreign adversary to be able to detract from that. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Chair, I just ask my colleagues, let us join together. There was never a more important time to treasure our democracy and fund the programs that protect them. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Chair, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ), a member of the committee. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Madam Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time. I rise in full support of H.R. 6147 and commend Chairman CALVERT on this muchneeded legislation. Back in 1977, Congress established the Abandoned Mine Lands program to 
use coal production revenues to fund critical reclamation efforts. Roll forward about 30 or 40 years, and I want to highlight one important part of the funding bill that is before us that will truly make a difference in many hard hit coal States, including my home State of West Virginia. A new AML pilot program is in this legislation. Back in 2016, and thanks to the leadership of Chairman Hal Rogers and Chairman CALVERT , we worked on establishing this AML pilot program to use some of these funds to help create job opportunities for displaced workers and help diversify the economy. In the last 2 years, the AML pilot program has brought $80 million to West Virginia, bolstering our economy and creating new jobs. These funds are being put to good use and play a proactive role in diversifying our State’s economy, and many other States’. AML pilot funds, for example, are being used to support the Hatfield McCoy Trail System, more than 700 miles of worldclass ATV trails just in West Virginia. I recently took part in a ride along on one of the trails to see firsthand the economic benefits they have brought to West Virginia. The trails being developed using AML pilot funds will attract thousands of new visitors, bolstering job creation in Appalachia and unleashing our tourism potential. These funds are also being used to expand municipal water services, which is critical for businesses and agricultural developments, as well as public health. The Coalfield Development Corporation, for example, is using AML pilot funds to build an aquaponics farm to grow sustainable commercial quantities of fish and vegetables. Simply stated, our towns and counties and States need resources to provide for the future, and this bill does it. It helps us diversify the economies. It helps attract employers and create muchneeded jobs, putting West Virginians and Americans back to work. Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), the distinguished ranking member of the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chairwoman, I thank Ranking Member LOWEY for yielding me this time. Unfortunately, I must rise in strong opposition to this bill and its litany of hollow choices and some dangerous choices. First, on election security, a day after President Trump told the whole world he believes Russian President Putin over our intelligence community, while claiming Russia didn’t hack our 2016 election, this Republican bill provides zero election security grants to help our States prepare against likely cyber interference. Congress, as the first branch of government, must live up to our constitutional obligation. Just months away from our 2018 elections, President Trump essentially greenlit Putin’s ongoing attacks. Does this body wish to be complicit as we head toward 2018 and 2020? This bill surely suggests so. Further, this bill attacks clean water access by repealing the waters of the United States rule without any public input regarding a replacement. It puts America’s waters and the health and wellbeing of the American people at even greater risk, and it is a disservice to our constituents. I strongly oppose the rider that would block the Environmental Protection Agency from addressing waste from animal feeding operations under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. In my watershed, which drains the tristate, binational region of North America into the western end of Lake Erie, the equivalent of 42,500 boxcar loads of animal manure are locally generated every year. That is trainloads of feces over 400 miles long every year seeping into the tributaries to the lake system every year. Additionally, the majority is far too eager to authorize massive corporate giveaways in this appropriations bill. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from Ohio. Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chairwoman, their socalled CHOICE Act guts essential safeguards that require banks to plan and prevent the kind of financial catastrophe we saw in 2008. The only people who haven’t been brought to justice are the scoundrels on Wall Street who created the mess. I hope our colleagues will join me in opposing this bill. And let me thank Chairmen FRELINGHUYSEN , GRAVES , and CALVERT , as well as Ranking Members LOWEY , M CCOLLUM , and Q UIGLEY for their efforts on this bill. I know how hard it is to bring an appropriations bill to the floor, and I am sorry I cannot support this one. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Chairwoman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), the chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chairwoman, at this time, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. LANCE. Madam Chair, I thank Chairman CALVERT for his leadership on this legislation and for recognizing the critically important work of cleaning up Federal Superfund sites across the United States. The remedial program for cleanups will see a $40 million increase in this package, bringing the Superfund total to $1.17 billion. This funding is well spent. One cleanup project in the congressional district I serve, the American Cyanamid Superfund site in Bridgewater, New Jersey, is a worthy project, indeed. The American Cyanamid site has been a hazard for too long, and the project was placed on the Superfund list in 1983. It is time to have the 44,000 tons of hazardous waste on this site safely and permanently destroyed. This is why we have a Superfund program and why the work of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Appropriations Committee is so important. Federal officials and resources with the knowhow and expertise have tackled these problems in other parts of the country and now need to focus on Bridgewater and other worthy projects across the Nation. This is a good project. I rise to call attention to its great merits and to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Chairman CALVERT , the committee, and the EPA for their involvement and support thus far. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman. I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey for expressing support for the Superfund program. The Superfund program continues to be a priority of this committee. In the fiscal year 2018 omnibus, we provided a $66 million increase to the program to accelerate cleanup of Superfund sites and respond to the release of hazardous materials. I look forward to working together through the 2019 process to ensure that the Superfund program receives necessary funding to clean up and revitalize our Nation’s toxic sites, like the American Cyanamid site, so that they are returned to productive use. Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chairwoman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ), a member of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. PINGREE. Madam Chair, I thank Ranking Member LOWEY for yielding me the time. Madam Chair, I rise today as a member of the subcommittee in reluctant opposition to the bill before us. I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for their hard work on this bill. I know that, in a truly bipartisan fashion, there has been an effort to address many issues that are important to me and to other Members. For example, I appreciate that the committee has come together to fund a National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities at strong levels that will help support our local economies and protect important cultural institutions. But the truth of the matter is that we will be voting on numerous amendments tonight that will add poison pill riders to the bill. They will gut our environmental protections and act as a straightforward assault on our country’s air, water, and Federal lands. The fact that so many of these harmful amendments were made in order by the Rules Committee is a telling statement of misplaced priorities. But even 
more telling are the amendments that were not made in order. None of the amendments to protect our oceans was made in order. Not one of the 10 amendments offered to prevent the devastation of our oceans due to oil and gas drilling off our coasts was made in order. We had Members from both sides of the aisle offering these amendments. We had Members from all across the country offering these amendments, and not one was allowed for full House debate, neither was an amendment I offered to push the administration on distributing appropriated funding that it has sat on without reason. This administration created guidance for the Department of the Interior in December of last year, which added another layer of bureaucracy and review for alreadyapproved projects. How ironic that a Republican administration would actually be purposefully adding bureaucracy that they so often rail against. This has led to an unconscionable delay in getting funds out to the communities in Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico that have been impacted by natural disasters, as well as other projects not related to hurricane relief. As we enter our second month of the current hurricane season, our American citizens have yet to see the full relief that they are owed and that this Congress has provided for them. That is because of this administration’s unnecessary delays. Again, I know the work that has gone into the creation of this bill with funding levels from many programs that are vital in my home State of Maine. In Maine, we have a strong appreciation for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the United States Geological Survey. We love estuaries, wildlife refuges, and National parks, like the beloved Acadia National Park in Maine and our new Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument. This funding is critical, and I am proud to be on the subcommittee that funds all of these national treasures and vital programs. But because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will spend the next few hours attempting to gut the Clean Air Act, eliminate the EPA methane rule, restrict the Endangered Species Act, zero out funds for diesel emissions reduction, and ban even the discussion of the cost of carbon in our Nation, I will not be able to support this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition. b1945 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), who is the chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I thank the chairman. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). Mr. RUIZ. Madam Chair, I want to thank Chairman CALVERT along with our friend and neighbor, Congressman COOK, on this issue which is, quite frankly, a matter of survival for two communities in my district. I submitted an amendment to this Appropriations bill to ensure the city of Banning and the community of Banning Heights can continue to receive water from a conveyance flume that they have relied on for over 100 years. The water from the flume provides 100 percent of the water for the community of Banning Heights and approximately 30 percent of the water for the city of Banning. This isn’t a small matter for these communities. In fact, I understand that during times when Banning Heights hadn’t received water from the flume, the city of Banning has had to use temporary means to deliver an emergency supply of water to them. This shouldn’t even be an issue. The two communities have an undisputed water right and a historic rightofway to maintain the flume that brings the water to the community. The flume was previously used by Southern California Edison under a hydroelectric permit with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For more than a decade, Edison has been in the process of decommissioning this permit, and the city of Banning and Banning Heights are simply seeking to ensure that the flume can be repaired and maintained and continues to deliver water. Earlier this month, the Forest Service issued a letter stating that they would require the inclusion of new instream flows as a contingency of the issuance of a special use permit just to allow the city to make repairs to the flume. This requirement would mean that in an average year, the two communities would receive no water from the flume on more than 100 days, I repeat, no water for nearly onethird of the year. Additionally, during periods of drought, the Forest Service estimates that the communities could go more than 50 consecutive days during the summer months without water. This is simply unacceptable. While my amendment will not be debated on the floor today, I will continue to work with the Forest Service to resolve this situation in a way that protects the water rights of Banning and Banning Heights and makes sure that any new instream flows do not take away water from communities that need it. Madam Chair, I thank Chairman CALVERT again for his attention to this. I ask the gentleman for his commitment to work with me to resolve this critical issue for my constituents. Mr. CALVERT. I thank Mr. RUIZfor raising this issue. I would like to offer and continue working with the gentleman and the Forest Service to amicably and productively resolve the situation. Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I reserve balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Chair, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, we should be making investments that protect our communities and make it easier for working families to get ahead. This bill falls far short of those goals. It shows the majority is not serious about enacting spending bills on time and is rife with deficiencies from a tax on the environment and consumers to wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, and it fails to stand up to Russian aggression and protect our elections. Vote ‘‘no.’’ Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Chair, I am pleased the House is taking the next step towards our Appropriations bills today. These bills maintain vital Federal responsibilities and reflect common American values. Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–81 shall be considered as adopted, and the bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of further amendment under the 5minute rule and shall be considered as read.

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . BIGGS

AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . SOTO 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. SOTO. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, line 2, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $500,000) (increased by $500,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SOTO. Madam Chair, my amendment would move $500,000 from the United States Fish and Wildlife general administration account to the National Wildlife Refuge program specifically for the wildlife and habitat management of invasive species. This amendment is identical to an amendment I offered last year that passed this body by a voice vote, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this amendment again this year. Invasive species threaten native plant and animal species and their vital habitats. Currently, invasive species are the most frequently mentioned threat within the National Wildlife Refuge System Threats and Conflicts database and are a growing risk to our ecosystems. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the only agency in the United States Government with the primary responsibility of the conservation of our Nation’s fish, wildlife, and plants. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages more than 561 refuges encompassing more than 150 million acres of habitat within the National Wildlife Refuge System. As of 2013, more than 2.4 million acres of the refuge system are impacted by invasive plants, including Lake Hatchineha in my home district in central Florida with approximately 1,715 invasive animal populations residing on the refuge lands. It is important we provide enough funds to enable the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to combat and reduce the harmful impact of invasive species. Again, this amendment would increase funds to combat invasive species that threaten native species in their vital habitat. Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. b2000 Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I am happy to accept the gentleman’s amendment and to work with the rest of my colleagues to address a need for funding to battle the spread the harmful invasive species. I support an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from California for his support, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . LANCE  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. LANCE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, line 2, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(increased by $1,000,000)’’. Page 8, line 21, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(reduced by $3,850,000)’’. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . COURTNEY  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 14, line 10, after the first dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $300,000) (increased by $300,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chair, again, this is a simple amendment which would designate $300,000 within the operation of the National Park System for the New England National Scenic Trail. This is an amendment which was offered last year and was adopted by voice vote in an en bloc amendment. Again, the language is absolutely identical. By way of background, the New England Trail was designated as a National Scenic Trail in 2009, making it one of the newest of the Nation’s 11 National Scenic Trails. The trail is 223 miles long and winds through 41 communities in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Amazingly, nearly 2 million people live within 10 miles of the trail, making it one of the most accessible National Scenic Trails for one of the most densely populated parts of the country. It was passed in 2007. Congressman John Olver, RICHIE NEAL, JOHNLARSON , ROSA DELAURO , nowSenator C HRIS MURPHY , and I introduced and passed the law, the New England Scenic Trail Designation Act. Unfortunately, the trail has been woefully underfunded for the last 5 years. The trail system has received an average of $127,000 in funding, which is split three ways between the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the National Park Service. Of the approximately $43,000 each entity receives, the vast majority goes to facility maintenance, volunteer coordination, community engagement, outreach to youth, and the trail’s landowner hosts. Impressively, much of the work that is done is supported by volunteers who put in more than 5,000 hours of maintenance activity annually. I would just note that the managers of the trail have done their best to leverage an impressive $1.53 million in nonFederal funding in 2015. So they actually have been very efficient and creative in terms of trying to leverage and maximize the support that is, again, far below what the national park trail feasibility study recommended back in 2005, when they recommended an annual budget of $271,000. Again, this is an amazing trail that goes through New England landscapes such as longdistance vistas with rural towns as a backdrop, farmlands, forests, and large river valleys. It also travels through colonial historical landmarks and highlights a range of diverse ecosystems and natural resources: mountain ridges and summits, forested glades, and wetlands. Again, I want to thank Chairman CALVERT and Ranking Member M CCOLLUMfor their support last year. I would urge passage of this identical amendment. It is supported by my colleagues in the region. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I support the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I appreciate the Member’s interest in the New England Scenic Trail and the National Park Service operations generally. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chair, silence is golden, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . COURTNEY  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ), and I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 15, line 4, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000)’’. Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chair, this bipartisan amendment would restore $5 million to the National Park Service’s Historic Preservation Fund to achieve level funding from the 2018 fiscal year. This amendment continues the same spirit of bipartisanship that Congress displayed in 2016 when we reauthorized the Historic Preservation Fund through 2023 and that Congress displayed last year when we passed a similar amendment in this Chamber. Since the Historic Preservation Fund’s creation in 1966, Congress has allocated more than $2 billion to communities across the country to connect Americans to our history and to contribute to our sense of place. Historic preservation projects prioritize local workers, create more jobs per dollar spent than other construction projects, and use fewer carbon emissions than building anew. The Historic Preservation Fund includes funding for State historic preservation offices, which work with local communities to revitalize historic locations and protect American heritage. Importantly, State historic fund offices administer the historic rehabilitation tax credit, which, nationwide, has leveraged $131 billion in private investment and created 2.4 million jobs since its inception. It is that kind of high return leverage that the Historic Preservation Fund achieves. That explains why the program received the funding level in the 2018 omnibus that Mr. BLUMENAUER  seeks to restore. I would note that the omnibus was a bipartisan and bicameral agreement which the chair and ranking member supported. Again, this amendment does not seek to raise spending above the 2018 omnibus, which cleared both Houses with a healthy bipartisan vote and which was signed into law by President Trump last March. Madam Chair, I urge passage of the Blumenauer amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. 
The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. b2015 Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, as the gentleman knows, I am a strong supporter of the National Park Service and the Historic Preservation Fund. While I have some concerns about the offset at the Office of the Secretary, this is a bipartisan amendment I can accept, and I urge adoption of the amendment. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MS . SEWELL OF  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 115–830. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 15, line 4, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $2,500,000)’’. Page 15, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $2,500,000)’’. Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $2,500,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment, which would increase the funding for competitive grants to preserve the sites and stories of the civil rights movement by $2.5 million. My district, the Seventh Congressional District, is also known as the Civil Rights District. Many historic events, from the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, to the Children’s March, to the Montgomery bus boycott, to Bloody Sunday, all took place in my district. These events are of national significance, and we are fortunate that the National Park Service is working with States, local communities, and nonprofits to preserve and interpret these stories. I am so grateful that the National Park Service has a strong presence in my district, and I have seen firsthand that they not only preserve the sites and stories of our great American history, but they also bring economic revitalization to the communities. In my hometown of Selma, Alabama, the National Park Service Selma Interpretive Center brings tourism dollars to a rural Black Belt county that would otherwise not have such economic development. In Birmingham, the civil rights monument is already playing a critical role in the downtown redevelopment. In fact, for every dollar invested in the national parks, $10 is generated in national economic activity. The National Park Service also supports more than a quarter million private sector jobs. Therefore, I believe that making a small, additional investment in the Historic Preservation Fund will yield great dividends and results in economic revitalization in communities across this country. The civil rights preservation fund has benefited civil rights sites from Iowa, to Nevada, to Massachusetts, and beyond. Grant projects from these additional funds would help provide for interpretation, education, surveys, oral history documentation, as well as physical preservation. It will also help lesser known civil rights sites get known. The National Park Service’s own 2008 study found that civil rights history and landmarks are underrepresented in the National Park System, so this grant will also give us an opportunity to increase the amount of money and funds that we give for historic preservation of civil rights sites. From reconstruction, to the era of Jim Crow, to the birth of the civil rights movement, to the current struggle for equality and justice, there is so much history that deserves to be preserved and interpreted for the benefit of future generations. I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. CALVERT , and the ranking member, Ms. MCCOLLUM , for their help in preserving civil rights sites all across the United States. Now is the time to do that preservation. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ), my friend, the Democratic assistant leader, who will also support increasing the Historic Preservation Fund. Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Sewell amendment. This proposal would increase funding for grants from the Historic Preservation Fund to preserve the sites and tell the stories of the civil rights movement. I want to thank my colleague TERRI SEWELL for her leadership on this issue, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support of this program in the past. First funded in fiscal year 2016, this program has met a great need in rural communities across our Nation that are struggling to preserve and protect their legacies. Last year, the program funded a $500,000 grant to preserve Trinity United Methodist Church, which will help secure the church’s legacy and preserve its history for future generations. I was a student at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, South Carolina, during this time, and I know well the role that Trinity played in our meetings and our rallies, many of them attended by luminaries like Martin Luther King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, Thurgood Marshall, and many others. This is but one example of several successful grants in South Carolina and throughout the Nation. There is much more work to be done to fully preserve this history. Madam Chair, I strongly support this amendment. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, to the gentlewoman, my colleague on the House Intelligence Committee, this is certainly an amendment I can accept. The gentlewoman and I have a history over the years of working together on this program, and I am happy to continue it. Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Chair, I want to personally thank Chairman CALVERT as well as Ranking Member MCCOLLUM for working closely with me on this amendment. Madam Chair, I urge all my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 115–830. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 15, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $500,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and ranking member, Mr. CALVERT and Ms. M CCOLLUM , for their leadership on these issues of preservation. The Jackson Lee amendment increases grant funding by $500,000 so that organizations interested in historical preservation, especially in underrepresented communities, have the ability to study, survey, and nominate properties to the National Register of Historic Places. Due to lack of resources, certain communities are underrepresented in this process, so this amendment ensures that they have a greater opportunity. 
The Jackson Lee amendment ensures that sites important to our American history are no longer overlooked due to mere lack of resources. It accomplishes this goal by promoting research that uncovers information to assist in telling the full American story. Historical places create connections to our heritage that help understand our past, appreciate our triumphs, and learn from our mistakes. And they cover all of the cultural backgrounds, from African Americans, to Anglos, to Hispanics, and to Asians, all in this wonderful, diverse country who have had a story to tell, as well as Native Americans and many others. Such stories might otherwise be lost because urban renewal and outmigration of Blacks destroyed or led to the abandonment of many African American communities. Preservation helps recognize, save, revitalize, and protect Americans’ historic places, build communities, and foster education and pride. I am reminded of Freedmen’s Town in my home city and Emancipation Park, which was the first park bought in the entire State of Texas by freed slaves. Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 8 to Division A of H.R. 6147, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019. This Jackson Lee Amendment increases grant funding by $500 thousand so that organizations interested in historical preservation, especially in underrepresented communities, have the ability to study, survey, and nominate properties to the National Register of Historic Places. Due to lack of resources, certain communities are underrepresented in this process so this amendment ensures that is no longer the case. This Jackson Lee Amendment ensures that sites important to our American history are no longer overlooked due to mere lack of resources, it accomplishes this goal by promoting research that uncovers information to assist in telling the full American story. Historical places create connections to our heritage that help us understand our past, appreciate our triumphs, and learn from our mistakes. Madam Chair, by understanding and designating landmarks we stimulate local revitalization and foster interest in places that otherwise may go unnoticed, despite cultural and historic significance. By preserving historic sites that tell the story of Americans in this country, we draw attention to the contributions of both ordinary and extraordinary people. Such stories might otherwise be lost because urban renewal and the outmigration of blacks destroyed or led to the abandonment of many African American communities. Preservation helps to recognize, save, revitalize and protect America’s historic places, build communities, and foster education and pride. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) provides matching grants to State and Tribal historic preservation offices. These HPF grants are used to pay for research and surveys of historic sites, training for staff, and the work involved in nominating these sites to the National Register of Historic Places. In short, it makes preservation possible to communities that otherwise would not have the means to engage in the nominating process. The Jackson Lee amendment is essential because it provides funds to preserve sites that are directly connected to the Civil Rights Movement. For example, earlier this year I introduced H.R. 4745, the Emancipation National Historic Trail Act that seeks a federal designation of the Emancipation National Historic Trail. The Emancipation National Historic Trail extends approximately 51 miles and marks the migration of newly freed slaves, who, upon learning of the Emancipation Proclamation two years after the President had signed it into law, departed from what is now the Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, and charted a course along Texas State Highway 3 and Interstate Highway 45 North to Freedmen’s Town and Emancipation Park in Houston. Increasing grant funding for this program would make projects like the Emancipation Trail possible. Madam Chair, it is imperative that we preserve and codify the historical record and memorialize significant events of our past. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for Jackson Lee Amendment No. 8 to Division A of H.R. 6147 as it is vital that we support the preservation of important sites. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I have no objections and urge adoption of the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for that, and I want to give an example that earlier this year I introduced H.R. 4745, the Emancipation National Historic Trail Act, that seeks Federal designation of the Emancipation National Historic Trail, that it would extend 51 miles and mark the migration of newly freed slaves. But, more importantly, it takes us from Captain Granger in Galveston, who brought the slaves in Texas who were freed in 1865, 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, and it tracks the historic markers all the way to Freedmen’s Town and Emancipation Park. This is an opportunity not only for the communities to be joined together but, again, to reemphasize history that is intertwined. A study shows the connection between culture, heritage, and tourism, and that 37 percent of global tourism has a cultural motivation, and 57 percent of travelers are strongly influenced by history and culture in their choice of holiday destination. This will help underserved communities. Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 9 OFFERED BY MR . CLYBURN  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 15, line 4, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $2,000,000)’’. Page 15, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $2,000,000)’’. Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $2,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Chair, this amendment would increase by $2 million the Historic Preservation Fund to restore and preserve buildings and sites on the campuses of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. It is offset by a minor reduction in the administration account for the Department of the Interior. Most HBCUs were founded after the Civil War to provide higher education to African Americans, most of whom were newly freed from slavery. These institutions continue to serve a vital purpose and have deep historical connections with African Americans and American history. Most of them have sites and structures of historical significance that are in dire need of restoration and preservation. Early in my tenure in Congress, I worked with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus and in leadership of this committee and the Committee on Natural Resources to authorize and appropriate funds to the GAO to study the breadth of this issue. The GAO identified 712 endangered historic buildings at an approximate cost of restoration of $755 million. My amendment today will increase the funding in the bill for this important program by $2 million, to a total of $7 million, still $3 million below the level authorized by the Housepassed bill. I have seen the transformational power of historic preservation in my congressional district, where buildings like Ministers’ Hall at Claflin University and Chappelle Auditorium at Allen University were restored after decades of abandonment to their original glory as iconic institutions of their communities. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ). 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Chair, I rise today as a supporter and cosponsor of this amendment, which would add $2 million for the Historic Preservation Fund grants for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs have always been a hub for bright, young African Americans to come together and to promote both individual development and community development. These institutions are national treasures, and their legacy and history deserves to be protected for the benefit of future generations. The Historic Preservation Fund grants for HBCUs are a perfect tool to help these institutions protect their historic civil rights sites and buildings, and I look forward to continuing to work with the 14 HBCUs in my home State of Alabama to seek these funds. Madam Chair, I again thank Assistant Leader CLYBURN for his leadership on this matter over the years. I thank him for the opportunity to speak on this amendment. I also thank the chairman and ranking member. Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have left. The CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ), the ranking member of the subcommittee. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I am honored to stand up and support Historically Black Colleges and Universities and, as has been pointed out, the important role that they play in our education system. Adding additional resources to preserve these structures on these campuses is necessary to maintain them. Madam Chair, I am very honored to represent many people from the Oromo community who are proud alumni from HBCUs. I stand with the gentleman to make sure that we have the resources needed for African American preservation and history, not only to have passed along our appreciation of our Nation’s history to future generations, but to give the next generation great buildings to be educated in. b2030 Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Chair, I thank Ranking Member MCCOLLUM . I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Ms. SEWELL , and Congresswoman ADAMS for their support of this legislation. As a proud graduate of an HBCU, with a daughter who is an HBCU graduate, I am very much supportive of restoring and preserving the tremendous history of these institutions. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman’s amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, the gentleman and I have a history over the years of working together to support HBCUs. I thank the gentleman for working with me on this issue and with the ranking member, and I urge the adoption of this amendment. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 10 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 115–830. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 15, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $1,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking member of this committee for their commitment to historic preservation. Since 1837, Historically Black Colleges and Universities have served the needs of higher education for the African American community. The first HBCUs were established in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, and Tennessee. After the Civil War, there was an influx of HBCU establishments throughout the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest. The Jackson Lee amendment provides an additional $1 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, and within that fund to be allocated to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, institutions that are uniquely American, fundamentally historical, and distinctly beneficial to the American culture and history. In my State of Texas, it joins with any number of States throughout the United States in the North, the South, the East, and the West. Interestingly, these schools are not relegated to the South. They are actually all over the United States, and they are older structures. For those of us who visited these schools, we recognize the importance of continuing to preserve their historic structure. I mentioned earlier that there are great results in funding and profits for those who can provide historic opportunities for travelers to visit. In 2017, Congress appropriated $4 million for the Historic Preservation Fund to rehabilitate historic structures on campuses of HBCUs that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places either individually or as contributing to the National Register of Historic Places. I can assure you that these are great assets to America. The projects must meet major program selection criteria, and all work must meet the Secretary of the Interior’s standards and guidelines for archeology and historic preservation. Simply, what we are doing is allowing our history to be preserved. The network of more than 100 historic institutions, established as early as 1837 for former slaves and by former slaves and freedmen, contain repositories of important books, papers, and memorabilia of Black history. Black history, as other history, is American history, and the opportunity to preserve it and to continue to expand the opportunity to improve buildings that will now educate this generation of students is an important role for us to play. Madam Chair, I rise in support of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 10 to Division A of H.R. 6147, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Financial Services Appropriations Act of 2019. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 10 provides an additional $1,000,000 for the Historic Preservation Fund to be allocated to Historically Black Colleges and Universities—institutions that are uniquely American, fundamentally historical, and distinctly beneficial to American culture and history. Since 1837, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have served the needs of higher education for the African American community. The first HBCUs were established in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, and Tennessee. After the Civil War there was an influx of HBCU establishment throughout the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest. Since the 1990s, the National Park Service has awarded over $60 million in grants to over 80 of the remaining active HBCUs. These grants work to preserve the historic structures on HBCU campuses, many of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 2017, Congress appropriated $4 million from the Historic Preservation Fund to rehabilitate historic structures on campuses of HBCUs that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places either individually or as contributing to a National Register historic district. Projects must meet major program selection criteria and all work must meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation. HBCUs represent a significant place in American history. This network of more than 100 historic institutions established as early as 1837 for former slaves and freedmen contain repositories of important books, papers and memorabilia of Black history. In addition, HBCUs served as meeting places during the civil rights struggles of the 1900s. Against substantial odds, HBCUs have played a unique role in transforming the landscape of higher education in the United States, and continue to prepare the African American professional and civic leaders needed by communities, employers and the nation. In 2013, HBCUs comprised 3 percent of all four and twoyear colleges and universities, but enrolled 10 percent of African American 
undergraduates, produced 18 percent of the nation’s African American college graduates, and generated 25 percent of African Americans with bachelor degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Created to educate black students at a time when society had yet to integrate, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU’s) have had an outsize impact on the success of the black community and therefore the American community as a whole. HBCUs do not only educate—HBCUs have and will continue to fill an important role in education opportunity and engagement for millions of young people from diverse backgrounds. Ensuring HBCUs receive the funds necessary to succeed enriches our culture as a nation and promotes a more complete history of our country to be preserved. Emphasizing the importance of diversity is the best way to tell the complete story of the American experience, and when the American story is told by all of those who helped shape its success as a nation, we perpetuate American exceptionalism. Madam Chair, our HBCUs are not just academic institutions, rather, incubators that stimulate black excellence that, more importantly, preserve the rich and true history of those of African descent—again, contributing to the fabric of American culture as a whole. Texas Southern University, an outstanding HBCU, is a major contribution and asset to the 18th District, serving as a distinct example of the benefits that these institutions offer to the community. HBCUs not only enjoy historical campuses, but they are also repositories of expertise on American History. In a 1998 study, more than 100 HBCUs identified 712 historic properties that were owned by the schools in responses to a survey from the U.S. Government Office of Accountability. Nearly half of those buildings, 323, are on the National Register of Historic Places indicating significance in American history, and the others were eligible for the national register based on surveys by state historic preservation officers or considered historic by the colleges and universities. According to the surveys at that time, 103 HBCUs estimated $755 million in costs to restore and preserve the properties, such as improving accessibility to people with disabilities, roof replacement and removing leadbased paint or asbestos, both known for containing cancercausing material. Routine maintenance costs were not part of the estimates. We, as a nation, have a responsibility to foster education, culture, knowledge, diversity and leadership; and with that, Mr. Chairman, we have a responsibility to ensure that HBCUs continue to serve as repositories of American History and thrive as academic institutions and continue to benefit society as a whole. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for Jackson Lee Amendment No. 10. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentlewoman’s amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I am happy to continue to work with the gentlewoman from Texas on this program and others, and I have no objection. Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I thank Mr. CALVERT , and, again, I thank the ranking member who has been so gracious. I believe Texas Southern University—not as old as 1837—Prairie View A&M, and others throughout the Nation will benefit from preserving these historic buildings, and, as well, providing them as a source of learning for everyone around the Nation. Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 11 OFFERED BY MR . OLSON  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. OLSON. Madam Chair, I rise as the designee of Congressman TEDPOE to speak on behalf of his amendment. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 15, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $20,000,000)(increased by $20,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. OLSON. Madam Chair, we have a class of American warships that haven’t been built since World War II. They are called battleships. America made 64 battleships. Only seven survived World War II. They are the North Carolina, Alabama, Massachusetts, Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin. But one survived World War II and World War I. This ship is special. It is the Battleship Texas. She is over 104 years old. She was commissioned on March 12 of 1914. She patrolled the Atlantic during the First World War. She is the first American ship with antiaircraft guns. She is the first battleship that had directors and rangekeepers to lock on with their 10 14inch main batteries. There she is today. She has made history in our Navy. March 1919, Lieutenant Commander Edward McDonnell took a British Sopwith Camel off turret number 3, Naval aviation was born. The wings of gold started on the USS Texas. The skipper of the Texas was so impressed. He noticed those planes could see splashes for the weapons. They could target with aircraft. That meant the Texas would be the first ship ever to launch planes to recover as spy mechanisms during a war. The Texas was at Casco Bay, Maine, on December 7, 1941, the day Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. In the Atlantic Ocean, on October 23, 1942, as part of Operation Torch, the invasion of French Morocco, the Texas bombed and bombed and bombed the enemy. June 6, 1944, at 5:50 a.m., the Texas roared to life with a constant bombardment of all the weapons—225 14inch rounds hit the Germans in 34 minutes. June 7, the next day, she is off the cliffs of Pointe Du Hoc where the rangers were in a dogfight for their lives being shot at from above. The Texas launched two Higgins boats, supplied the rangers with more weapons, and brought the wounded home. That may have been a natural fit. And the command of those rangers was a Texan, a proud Texas Aggie, Earl Rudder. On the beaches that day, my colleague, TEDPOE’s father, Virgil Poe, heard the Texas roar and saw the flame come out of the big guns. When the war in Europe with Hitler went ashore, the Texas redeployed to the Pacific. On February 16, she pounded the Japanese on Iwo Jima for 3 straight days before the Marine Corps landed. March 1945, 6 straight days of bombing Okinawa cleared the way for the Army and Marines to take that island back. The Texas struck the Naval record as a registered vessel on April 20 of 1948. She was given to my home State, the State of Texas. She is now the flagship of the Texas Navy, Admiral TEDPOE’s flagship. Our colleague, TED, is an admiral of the Texas Navy. She is moored right where Texas won independence, the San Jacinto Monument, right there southwest of Houston, Texas. But sadly, inaction in D.C. and in Texas has done what the German Kaiser, General Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, and General Tojo could not do. The Texas is sinking. Rust and time are winning. The Texas still has a heart of a warship. She twice set sail during Hurricane Ike. She and all these battleships deserve to be saved. It is time to heave up and trice up. Vote for this amendment, and save our battleships. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MRS . DINGELL  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in House Report 115–830. Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 19, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $250,000) (increased by $250,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan. Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Chair, I rise in support of my bipartisan amendment to H.R. 6147, the Interior Appropriations Act, which I am proud to introduce with my friend and colleague from Michigan, Congressman JOHN MOOLENAAR . Our amendment would provide funding to continue and advance the great science that is being done in the U.S. Geological Survey’s Fisheries Program. We need more research to protect important ecosystems, like the Great Lakes, from invasive species and better understand how to conserve and protect important fishery resources. The Great Lakes Science Center, which is strategically located near access fishery resources in communities across the eight Great Lakes States, would be an appropriate recipient of these additional resources. The Great Lakes are a way of life for so many across Michigan and many other States, including agriculture, commercial and sport fishing, transportation, shipping, power generation, recreation, and tourism. Whether you live, work, or vacation on the Great Lakes, we all benefit in preserving and conserving the Great Lakes for future generations. The Great Lakes Science Center would be able to adopt cuttingedge technologies to support fisheries management, native prey fish restoration, and invasive species control by deploying autonomous underwater systems to assess impacts of bottomdwelling invasive species on economically important fisheries and recreational resources. The Science Center would continue to do their work on piloting gene silencing techniques to control zebra and quagga mussels in lakes and rivers with nationwide applications. Fisheries science has been broadly recognized as a national and regional priority for many years, and nearly every action in the past has been to either maintain or increase the funding for the USGS fisheries assessments in the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Fishery Program also has enjoyed long bipartisan support from Congress. b2045 The Great Lakes are a treasured national resource, with more than 20 percent of the world’s freshwater, 9,000 miles of shoreline, and supporting a $16 billion outdoor recreation economy. It is critical we maintain funding to continue the United States Geological Survey’s research and to enhance exploration in cuttingedge technologies to support fisheries management, native prey fish restoration, and invasive species control that is being done at the Great Lakes Science Center. Madam Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bipartisan amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I am happy to support the gentlewoman from Michigan in her quest. The Great Lakes Science Center has bipartisan support for the role it plays in protecting the economic and environmental health of the Great Lakes region. Madam Chair, I support my colleague’s amendment, urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and I thank the ranking member, Representative MCCOLLUM , who shares the love of the Great Lakes with me. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . COURTNEY  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 19, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $100,000) (increased by $100,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chair, this amendment designates $100,000 in funding to the United States Geological Survey so that they can create a searchable map showing occurrences of an iron sulfide material known as pyrrhotite nationwide. Pyrrhotite is a material that has, unfortunately, shown up in concrete quarries in New England and Canada. When it is mixed into the aggregate poured into the foundations of homes, over a period of time, because it is an iron material and exposed to moisture, it actually rusts, expands, and cracks, basically causing a catastrophic collapse of the foundation. In Connecticut, there are estimates that as high as 19,000 homes that have been infected with pyrrhotite material. It spread into western Massachusetts and three rivers in Quebec. The whole community of thousands of people have been devastated by the presence of this material. The Trump administration and the Treasury Department actually recognized last November a property casualty loss tax guidance that allows homeowners who basically have to spend about $200,000 to repair their homes—because they have to lift the house, pull out the old foundation, and pour a new foundation—to claim it as a property casualty loss deduction. Last month, Dr. Ben Carson from HUD came up and did a tour of these homes. It is a devastating occurrence, and it has potential nationwide consequences. The United States Navy actually has a bidding process out right now through its SBIR program to come up with a testing mechanism. They calculate that they basically own about 300,000 structures throughout the United States. They want to have a system for testing for the presence of pyrrhotite. I brought a picture, which shows the effects of the catastrophe. This is a home where the house was lifted. The material of the foundation is so badly compromised that the contractor can actually pull it apart by hand, it is that serious. This amendment would allow the United States Geological Survey to create a searchable database nationally that would allow us to identify this. The Office of Congressional Affairs contacted our office and indicated that they do have the capacity to develop a national pyrrhotite map, but it is not in their current plan. This amendment, which is also supported by Mr. LARSON from Connecticut’s First District, would direct that priority. Madam Chair, I urge passage of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I support this amendment. I will work with the gentleman to address this issue with the United States Geological Survey and learn more about where this mineral occurs. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chair, I thank the chairman for his consideration of this amendment. It is a very serious problem and much appreciated in the New England area. I thank the ranking member, Ms. MCCOLLUM , for her support as well. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 14 OFFERED BY MS . GABBARD  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 printed in House Report 115–830. Ms. GABBARD. Madam Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. HANABUSA ), and I have an amendment at the desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 19, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $4,798,500)’’. Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $4,908,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Hawaii. Ms. GABBARD. Madam Chair, this amendment would increase the United States Geological Survey’s surveys, investigations, and research account by $4,798,500 to accommodate for impacts caused by recent volcanic eruptions. The offset for this modest increase comes from the Interior Secretary’s administrative account. On May 8, 2018, in my district, the Kilauea Volcano on the Big Island, Hawaii, began erupting. The volcanic activity and destruction has yet to stop or wane. It has destroyed over 700 homes, forcing thousands of people to evacuate, to seek emergency aid and shelter, and to somehow find a new future for their lives. There has never been a more critical time where the United States Geological Survey’s Volcano Hazards Program on Hawaii island has been sorely needed; however, their office was severely damaged by the seismic activity from the ongoing volcanic eruptions. Hawaii island itself has seen hundreds of these types of seismic eruptions over the last month and a half. As a result, the staff currently occupy empty spaces at University of Hawaii at Hilo, like classrooms, or they telework, undermining their quality of work, with the staff potentially putting their lives at risk. The United States Geological Survey provides essential information for the health, safety, and wellbeing of people all across the State of Hawaii, and in neighboring locations such as the Marshall Islands, which has been blanketed by volcanic smog following the Kilauea eruption. To most effectively do their job, this team needs a workplace where they can house their equipment, conduct research, and most effectively uphold their mission, which is to enhance public safety and minimize social and economic disruption. This amendment will provide the necessary resources for this team to at least temporarily relocate to a suitable location and continue to carry out their lifesaving historic work. Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to help us immediately address this situation and pass our amendment. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, it is my understanding that the United States Geological Survey is in its early stages of discussing temporary spaces but that, eventually, the United States Geological Survey may have to develop a longterm solution for the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. I encourage the Department of the Interior, the United States Geological Survey, and the National Park Service to work together to develop a plan for the future observatory because operating the HVO out of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was a costeffective solution for many years. Madam Chair, in the meantime, I certainly support my colleague’s amendment. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. GABBARD. Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support for this very timely and important resolution. I have been on the ground there and have seen how the United States Geological Survey’s HVO is literally monitoring the activity 24 hours a day, sending out realtime updates to people whose lives and homes and farms hang in the balance. Unfortunately, the volcanic activity that we are seeing there right now is continuing at a very aggressive rate with no end in sight, so his support for this amendment comes at a critical time, and I really appreciate it on behalf of my constituents there. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 15 OFFERED BY MR . KILDEE  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. KILDEE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 19, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $1,000,000)’’. Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(decreased by $1,022,728)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. KILDEE. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my bipartisan amendment that would provide $1 million for the United States Geological Survey to eradicate grass carp in the Great Lakes. Grass carp are an invasive species, one of the four species of Asian carp that pose an immediate threat to the Great Lakes and its coastal wetlands. Since being introduced in Lake Erie, the grass carp population has been increasing, threatening our coastal wetlands and our region’s economy that relies so heavily on the health of the Great Lakes. Our coastal wetlands are important to Michigan’s environment and the wildlife they serve as a natural water filter and habitat for fish and waterfowl. Since 2010, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has been supported by Democrats and Republicans in Congress, has helped to restore the wetlands the grass carp are now consuming. The immediate threat of grass carp in Lake Erie jeopardizes the investment and the goals of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. This amendment is simple. It empowers and funds the United States Geological Survey to track and monitor grass carp so that we can stop their spread in the Great Lakes. By passing this amendment, the United States Geological Survey would have additional resources to find out where grass carp are breeding so we can know how to stop their invasion and remove them from the Great Lakes. Funding from this amendment will double our efforts in Lake Erie to ensure we protect our coastal wetlands, our wildlife, and the Great Lakes themselves. With this amendment, we have an opportunity to address this urgent threat of invasive species such as grass carp. Madam Chair, I thank my friend from Michigan, Congressman WALBERG , for working with me on this bipartisan amendment. I also thank our friends on the Appropriations Committee—Congresswoman KAPTUR , Congressman JOYCE , and Congressman M OOLENAAR — who have also been involved and helped on this. And I, of course, thank Chairman CALVERT and Ranking Member MCCOLLUM for their efforts in working with us on ensuring that this amendment receives fair consideration. Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, we can accept the gentleman’s amendment. The committee takes invasive species threats seriously. We spent a lot of time on Asian carp in our committee in prevention efforts throughout the bill. It is a bipartisan effort. Everyone is very concerned about this. We are talking about a bounty program, possibly, to go after these things. Let’s go do it. I accept the gentleman’s amendment, but I will be working with him and the rest of my colleagues to ensure that Asian carp and grass carp control and prevention efforts are effectively coordinated across the agencies within our jurisdiction. Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KILDEE. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for his support, and I 
thank Chairman C ALVERT and Ranking Member MCCOLLUM for their efforts in dealing with this really important issue. It is particularly important to those of us who live in the Great Lakes region, but it is important to all of us. This is really not only a question of maintaining this ecosystem, but it is important to our economy. Madam Chair, I thank all of my colleagues for their support. I urge the passage of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). The amendment was agreed to. b2100

AMENDMENT NO . 16 OFFERED BY MR . JOHNSON  
OF OHIO  Page 27, line 10, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(increased by $30,000,000)’’. Page 68, line 9, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(reduced by $30,000,000)’’. 
AMENDMENT NO . 17 OFFERED BY MR . JOHNSON  
OF OHIO  Page 27, line 19, strike ‘‘3’’ and insert ‘‘6’’. 
So we can accept this package of amendments at this time. I look forward to maintaining funding for the six States, with distribution similar to fiscal year 2018 and the final 2019 enacted bill. As such, I encourage my colleagues to adopt the amendment. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH ). Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I appreciate Chairman CALVERT ’s support as well, and the appropriators’ hard work on this. This was created by Hal Rogers. It is fascinating because what happens is that people say they want us to transition the economy in central Appalachia. This is one of the ways to do that, and it actually saves money. We have a project in my district that we are close to getting finalized on this, where it would cost $6.7 million to clean up a site, if we did it the normal way. With this program, which we wish to continue, it will only cost the government about 2.5, $2.6 million, and we end up with a site that can be used again for economic development and jobs in Appalachia. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I will close. I want to reaffirm what my colleague from West Virginia said. This is important for economic development in communities in Appalachia. It will have a significant impact on economic development work throughout the region, while being offset by only a slight reduction in EPA’s environmental programs and management account, totaling only 1.21 percent of that account. So this is good legislation. It is a good bill for Appalachia, a good set of amendments for Appalachia. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I want to be clear. I understand that this amendment would direct more funding to States in Appalachia who have suffered from the ravaging environment caused by coal mining, and that is a very noble goal, as I said before. But at this time I have to oppose this amendment. Once again, I want to point out, we were level funded in our allocation in the Interior bill that we are debating today with amendments, and I cannot support any further deeper cuts to the EPA. But as the chairman moves forward and as we go to conference, if we can start restoring some of the funds to the EPA, I would like to work with the gentleman to restore some of the funds to this also important program; but at this time I have to oppose. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 31, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $36,000,000)(increased by $36,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, Arizona’s First Congressional District is home to the largest population of Native Americans and Indian lands in the Nation. Many of the Tribal governments that I represent face a public safety crisis. Nearly every Tribal community I visit is caught in the justice facility backlog, and it is having a serious impact on their ability to protect and serve their communities. The backlog in unmet need for Tribal justice facilities has grown significantly since fiscal year 2014, when the Department of Justice unilaterally stopped new and replacement construction of Tribal justice buildings. All the while, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has kept condemning these types of buildings. This negligent lack of Federal coordination between agencies has resulted in communities being forced to go without essential infrastructure. Tribal justice officials dedicate and risk their lives to provide basic law and order in Native American communities. However, as a former police officer, I can tell you, no justice system can function without a safe and secure facility to house these officers. The San Carlos Apache Tribe’s justice system is a devastating example of the backlog for justice facilities in Indian Country. The BIA condemned the San Carlos Police and Courts Building known as BIA Building 86 in 2009. The Tribal police officers and courts worked for 6 additional years in a condemned building, until the Bureau of Indian Affairs provided them with temporary trailers, which had been intended to be used as classrooms and temporary housing in 2015. Here we are, 3 years later, and this temporary fix is failing the San Carlos police and courts, as well as the entire community. The San Carlos Police Chief works in an office with cracks in the wall where he can see outside. The generator doesn’t provide air conditioning to the police patrol or court sessions of trailers, and that is in Arizona. Water service is intermittent. There is not enough space for evidence storage. The floors can’t securely support storage safes that include cash, drugs, and other evidence. I can go on and on. It is clear that it is past time to provide the San Carlos Apache Tribe, and Tribes across the country, a permanent facility to safely house their police and courts. b2115 I commend Appropriations for providing $18 million for replacement of new public safety and justice construction. My amendment demonstrates the reality that the need is greater. It suggests a funding level of $36 million divided between replacement and new construction. This would help provide for the needs of communities like San Carlos, who have had their police and court facilities condemned by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Every law enforcement officer at the local, State, Tribal, and Federal levels risk their lives to protect and serve their community. If we can’t give them the basic tools to do their jobs, our communities risk safety and justice for victims. We must do better. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment on behalf of these brave law enforcement officials, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I am happy to accept the gentleman’s amendment and work with him and the rest of my colleagues to address the public safety and justice construction needs in Indian Country. The ranking member and I have worked very closely together in Indian Country to recognize the shortcomings throughout Indian Country in Indian education, Indian healthcare, and certainly within the Indian public safety and justice problems that we are having throughout the United States. Mr. Chair, I certainly support an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, I just want to thank the chair and the ranking member for all their commitment to Indian Country and for their support of this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ). The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 19 printed in House Report 115–830. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 31, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $10,000,000)’’. Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $10,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, across Indian Country, access to safe and clean drinking water is a major issue that we are obligated to address. In the northwest corner of my district, the Hopi Tribe has a water system with over three times the Federal maximum standard for safe drinking water for arsenic. Let me repeat that: three times the amount of arsenic than the maximum standard considered safe. Members of the Tribe have no choice but to use this unsafe water. This is beyond unacceptable in any community in America, but it is a fact of life for Tribes across the Nation. No matter where you are born, no child or family in America should have to risk their health because they can’t access clean water. This basic lack of water infrastructure has limited many Tribes’ ability to unleash their economic potential in rural communities across the country. The Hopi Tribe has limited financial resources. In fact, it has an 80 percent unemployment rate. Our country’s unemployment rate is 4 percent. It also has a mine that is potentially going to close that supplies 80 percent of its general funds. They have not sat idly waiting for the Federal Government to fix the problem it created. The Tribe has launched the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project to directly address this challenge. Through the project, the Tribe has identified arsenicfree wells and mapped the pipeline route that will deliver arsenicfree water to villages and towns across the reservation. All the Tribe needs to complete the project is construction funding. Unfortunately, funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs Construction account has not been adequate enough to fund projects across country like Hopi’s. That is why I am offering a commonsense amendment to increase BIA’s construction funding by $10 million. Increasing this funding for construction of water infrastructure will enable the BIA to assist communities in building water systems that will deliver clean drinking water to schools and homes, some for the first time. This amendment is not only a wise investment for Tribal communities as they seek to develop their economies and attract investment, but it is also a moral imperative. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to increase access to clean water for tribal communities across the country. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I was happy to support the gentleman and accept the prior amendment, but this just goes too far. I couldn’t agree with the gentleman more that the Federal obligations for construction in Indian Country far outweigh the amount of money we have in the budget. That is why the Bureau of Indian Affairs Construction account has been and will continue to be a nonpartisan priority for the subcommittee, and we are certainly proud of the progress we have made so far, but I cannot support an offset on an account that also serves Indian Country and other underserved populations. In addition to cutting the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, this amendment is likely to cut the Office of Native American Relations, the Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization, the Office of Civil Rights, and the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Again, while I agree with the increase, and I certainly don’t disagree with the gentleman’s intentions, I cannot in good conscience agree to this offset. If we find money down the road in this process as the gentlewoman and I are going through the conference, this is something I would be very interested in looking at, but right now I must encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, I understand that this bill increases the BIA Construction funding levels from last year, but I must remind the gentleman that this program is still woefully underfunded considering the tremendous needs across the West and in rural communities. Although I believe this amendment’s offset is reasonable considering the basic immediate and dire needs of tribes across the country, I appreciate the gentleman’s comments and I hope he will commit to working with me on a bipartisan basis going forward on this amendment to ensure our communities have meaningful access funding for clean water. I clearly understand the impacts potentially to the Bureau, but I also understand that when you have 80 percent unemployment and the risk of losing 80 percent of your general fund, that there is no other alternative than to look for money here, and I would appreciate consideration in the future. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 20 OFFERED BY MS . PLASKETT  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 20 printed in House Report 115–830. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 38, line 21, insert after the dollar amount ‘‘(decreased by $3,818,000)’’. Page 40, line 19, insert after the first dollar amount ‘‘(increased by $3,818,000)’’. Page 40, line 19, insert after the second dollar amount ‘‘(increased by $3,800,000)’’. Page 41, line 8, insert after the dollar amount ‘‘(increased by $18,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I thank the committee for the opportunity to express my strong support for this amendment to the Department of Interior division of this bill. This amendment amounts to a small uptick in critical funding for assistance to territories at the Department of Interior’s Office of Insular Affairs, to the amount that has already been recommended by the majority in the Senate. This is a modest uptick of just under $4 million in Federal support for Americans in insular territories of the United States, namely, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. Nearly a half million Americans reside in these islands, which have been part of this great country for over a century. Since then, the Federal Government has supported the territories largely through Department of Interior assistance activity, with funding channeled towards technical assistance to local governments and to assist in upgrading essential community facilities like schools and hospitals and critical infrastructure, including waste disposal and wastewater systems. Even before two Category 5 hurricanes struck the Virgin Islands, our schools faced structural deficiencies not conducive to a healthy learning environment. Our hospitals face serious deferred maintenance issues due, in part, to their extremely high proportion of uncompensated care, because we face inequitable treatment in the Federal health programs like Medicaid and Medicare. There are few facilities for assisted living among a growing population of aging citizens. 
Construction or repair to schools and hospitals account for much of the Capital Improvement Project expenditures that come directly out of this Assistance to Territories account. I believe it is imperative that the Federal Government enhance its commitment to address the pressing needs of Americans living in the territories as we face grave natural disasters and security threats. I continue to be concerned about the catastrophic impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria to the Virgin Islands, especially in light of financial solvency issues, coupled with the anticipated amount of time before government industry and utilities are able to fully function and generate revenues. There are also additional revenue losses and other operational needs stemming from passage of significant tax reforms last year. The Virgin Islands and most of the insular territories have mirror tax codes of the United States, meaning that when we make changes to the Federal Tax Code, they automatically apply as a tax code of the territories, with few exceptions. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changes bring in a host of unintended new revenue and economic loss issues that the local governments of the territories will need significant technical assistance to mitigate. The U.S. territories are part of the United States, and jobs in these territories are American jobs. According to the Department of Labor, the unemployment rate in the Virgin Islands is currently at least 12 percent, three times the national rate. The people living in American island territories are citizens of this great Nation and entitled to equality to the people living in the 48 contiguous States, Hawaii, and Alaska, but the Virgin Islands and other territories are not included in the same formula grants as other locations. We do not receive the same funding for grants, technical assistance, programs that provide jobs, or infrastructure. A continuation of level funding to the small assistance account is highly inadvisable at this time, for the reasons I have outlined previously. Americans residing in the U.S. territories may be the first to be hit by a major hurricane, but have no vote on the budget for FEMA or anything else. They continue to be severely tried, and in circumstances beyond their control. Please approve my amendment as a simple matter of fairness to them and equitable to the majority of the Senate’s requests at this time. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, in light of the catastrophic hurricane season last year and the fact that we are already in the midst of another hurricane season right now, I suspect there is additional relief needed for the territories in the weeks and months ahead. So with this reality upon us, I am happy to accept the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman, the ranking member, and the members of this committee for supporting this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 21 OFFERED BY MS . MOORE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 21 printed in House Report 115–830. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $500,000)’’. Page 112, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $500,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, the intent of the amendment is to reserve funds for the Smithsonian to do an exhibit in conjunction with local groups and organizations focused on celebrating the United Nations International Decade for People of African Descent. I am so proud to offer this amendment. Mr. Chair, January 1, 2015, through December 21, 2024, has been designated as the United Nations International Decade for People of African Descent, with the theme, ‘‘People of African Descent: recognition, justice, and development’’ by the United Nations General Assembly. The population comprising the African diaspora is expansive, spanning across the globe from the Americas and the Caribbean, to Asia and Europe, with persons of African descent having a historic presence on every continent. b2130 Around 200 million people identifying themselves as being of African descent live in the Americas. The goal of this initiative is for the United Nations and its member states, among others, to take advantage of the auspicious period of history by undertaking activities in the spirit of recognition, justice, and development for people of African descent around the globe. Among the goals of this international initiative is to underscore the important endowments made by people of African descent to our world societies and to promote a greater knowledge of and respect for the diverse heritage, culture, and contributions of people of African descent to the development of societies. Now, in this country, Mr. Chairman, the Smithsonian is uniquely positioned to celebrate the launch of this International Decade at the national level here in this country by creating temporary and maybe permanent exhibits that can help promote the cultural and artistic goals of the International Decade and to create an effective exhibit or series of exhibits across its museums on the contributions of African descendants in the United States, where Black history is inextricably and integrally woven since this country’s founding and even before. Yes, Mr. Chairman, Africans explored these shores long before Columbus and archeological findings here do prove. The Smithsonian has a history of undertaking efforts to commemorate and tell the story of the impact of African descendants on African American history, politics, culture, and society, including the opening of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Smithsonian has a wealth of artifacts and holds the resources to put together a wellregarded national showcase to weave together a compelling and concise study and story of some of the most notable contributions across sectors of African descendants. Likewise, it can work with local organizations to borrow or make available artifacts, documents, and relics related to telling the story in a way that no other institution in our country can. Simply put, the Smithsonian has the right mix of expertise, archives, and artifacts to help tell the story as well as the ability to work with local groups throughout our Nation that are guardians of some of these narratives but may not have the resources. With these additional resources, it is hoped that the Smithsonian will partner with other State and local institutions to help create a story reflective of the U.N. International Decade for People of African Descent and promoting the history and heritage of people of African descent and their impact on our country here. In an era of xenophobia and rising intolerance, now, more than ever, we need to join in helping to publicly recognize the culture, history, and heritage of people of African descent and their impact on the Nation and the world and have the International Decade for People of African Descent be more than an empty rhetorical platitude to African Americans on this shore. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, while I certainly have some concerns about 
the offset, I am able to support my recent classmate’s and colleague’s amendment. As the gentlewoman knows, this bill has a strong history of supporting underrepresented communities, including African American and Tribal communities. This bill funded the construction of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture and continues to strongly support the operations of this very popular museum. This bill maintains a strong bipartisan support for Tribal health, Tribal education, Tribal law enforcement, and numerous other priorities critical to Native Americans and Alaska Natives, and this bill supports underrepresented communities throughout the Historic Preservation Fund grants under the National Park Service. Though we may have to turn the lights off at the Department of the Interior if we keep going on—he is a Navy SEAL; he will get by—I certainly urge the adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague, because we will turn the light on the contributions of Africans on this continent during this decade. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 22 OFFERED BY MR . WELCH  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 22 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $4,000,000)’’. Page 68, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $4,000,000)’’. Page 68, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $4,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, Lake Champlain is one of the natural wonders of New England and, indeed, an international treasure. It is a watershed that includes New York, Vermont, and the Province of Quebec. To protect this unique natural and economic resource, Congress enacted legislation in 1990 under the bipartisan leadership of Democrat PATRICK LEAHY  and Republican Jim Jeffords that led to the creation of the Lake Champlain Basin Program. Over the years, the basin program has worked with private organizations, local communities, and individuals on both sides of the border to coordinate and fund efforts that benefit the Lake Champlain Basin’s water quality, fisheries, wetlands, and wildlife recreation. It has been a great example of a locally driven program working from the ground up with the help of a Federal partner. It has been a tremendous success, and the purpose of this amendment is to maintain the funding at the level that it was at before. I have joined 28 years later after Democratic Senator PATRICK LEAHY and Republican Jim Jeffords with my Republican colleague from across the lake, Representative STEFANIK , in this amendment. It is important to both sides of the lake and the Province of Quebec, who is not here represented, but here in heart. So I ask for the support of this amendment, and I want to say to my colleague, ELISE STEFANIK , from across Lake Champlain, that we think the view of New York is beautiful, and we share a commitment to maintaining the beauty of that lake. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ). Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from across the lake, PETER WELCH . This is truly a bipartisan issue, as Mr. WELCH identified. This is important to our local ecosystem. It is important to our recreation. It is important to our tourism. But it is also a job creator, bringing in new people to our region. I love the views as I look across the lake to Vermont, and I know that we are really a joint economy around Lake Champlain. I also want to thank Chairman CALVERT and the Appropriations Committee for their support of this important initiative in the Northeast. As I said, this is truly bipartisan, and it fully funds this important program. So I thank Mr. CALVERT again and his staff, and I thank Mr. WELCH for being a true partner on this issue, which is locally driven and such a success story for our districts. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman as a good partner, as well, and I thank Mr. CALVERT for his consideration. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 23 OFFERED BY MR . VARGAS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 23 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000)’’. Page 71, line 11, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000)’’. Page 76, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000)’’. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from California (Mr. VARGAS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support my amendment to H.R. 6147, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019. This amendment would increase funding for the U.S.Mexico Border Water Infrastructure Program by $5 million. As a Representative of California’s entire U.S.Mexico border, I have seen firsthand the positive impact these programs have on communities in my State and across all of the communities along the U.S. border. The Tijuana River Valley is a beautiful transboundary watershed on both sides of the border with a mixture of agriculture, preserved habitats, and rural housing developments. Periodic rain in the region produces a steady stream of crossborder flows of wastewater, trash, and sediment from Tijuana into San Diego County. This has a devastating effect on border communities, including Imperial Beach, San Diego, and other residents in the Tijuana River Valley. Last year, millions of gallons of sewage was discharged in the Tijuana River Valley after a heavy rain. This resulted in prolonged beach closures, which affected the quality of life and the public health of the people in these communities. Border Patrol agents also experienced very severe health complications from exposure to sewage and to chemicals and toxic waste along the border. San Diego Countybased military installations are also at risk of continued disruptions, which would affect their readiness to combat threats. Residents across San Diego County have grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress on viable solutions. All too often, Tijuana’s wastewater infrastructure is unable to handle the heavy rains, which result in sewage ending up on the U.S. side of the border. The EPA’s Border Water Infrastructure Program provides resources for communities to build and enhance current longterm protections and rehabilitation projects all along the entire U.S.Mexico border. The EPA investments in these wastewater projects are a key factor in significant water quality improvements in U.S. waterbodies, such as the Rio Grande, Santa Cruz River, the New River, and the Tijuana River. The program’s funding has made significant progress addressing public beach health and the environmental impact of inadequate drinking water and wastewater infrastructure along the U.S.Mexico border. 
The 2,000mile border between the United States and Mexico is one of the most complex and dynamic regions in the world, with a growing need to address the transborder environmental issues; so I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, don’t get me wrong. I am not opposed to what the EPA is doing at the border to improve water quality, but I think it is important to note that the bill already provides $10 million for the program, equal to the fiscal year 2018 level, and did not support the elimination of the program as proposed in the President’s budget. As the gentleman knows, we are levelfunded in this year’s appropriation bill, so I wasn’t able to get additional funds for some of these programs that I like. Because a $5 million reduction could significantly impact the work of the Secretary of the Interior— we have been chewing away at that all night—the programs under this jurisdiction, and other important offices funded by the account, I can’t support the amendment. I will continue to work with the ranking member as we move this through this process because I know the important work we have done in California and along the entire border. It is a good program, and I certainly support it, but I can’t support this amendment at this time. Mr. Chair, I must oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for those words, and I know that he wants to continue to work with us, and I look forward to that. I would just add that the situation is getting much worse, and I would also add that a number of these military installations that we are placing right along the border, especially the Special Forces that we have, the SEALS, I think are going to become more and more affected by this sewage that crosses the border. Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with the chairman and the ranking member to see if we can find more money because this is a real problem in San Diego, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. VARGAS ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 24 OFFERED BY MS . ESTY OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 24 printed in House Report 115–830. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $7,000,000)’’. Page 71, line 11, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $7,000,000)’’. Page 77, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $7,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut. b2145 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman MCKINLEY , for working with me on this amendment. Our amendment increases funding for State grants to assess or clean up brownfield sites by $7 million in fiscal year 2019. Too many cities and towns across America with proud manufacturing legacies are now struggling with vacant brownfield properties. In my home State of Connecticut, the city of Meriden alone has at least $10 million worth of brownfield projects for which they have been unable to secure funding— and that is just one city in one State. Every single congressional district across this country is home to at least one brownfield site. In fact, some have hundreds. The benefits of funding brownfield cleanups are enormous. For every $1 invested in brownfield redevelopment, 18 additional dollars are leveraged in outside investment. That is one of the highest leveraging of outside money of any Federal program. Despite the clear, demonstrated value of Federal brownfield investments, the EPA has been forced to turn down very worthy projects due to lack of funding. In fact, the EPA has only been able to fund about onequarter to onethird of the applications it receives. Between 2012 and 2017, over 1,600 applications for viable projects were turned down because of inadequate Federal funding. The base bill before us today provides just $153 million for brownfields in fiscal year 2019—the very same amount that was enacted for 2018. For such an effective program that is in high demand all across the country, maintaining status quo funding for brownfield redevelopment is unwise and, frankly, unacceptable. If the EPA had been able to fully fund the qualified brownfield projects from 2012 to 2017, an additional 54,000 jobs would have been created along with $10.3 billion in leveraged outside money. Mr. Chairman, last November, 409 Members of this House voted to increase funding levels for the EPA’s brownfields programs to $200 million plus an additional $50 million for the State response program. That is a total of $250 million authorized by this House as compared with $153 million we have before us tonight. Mr. Chairman, 409 Members heeded calls from their cities and towns, mayors, county and regional officials and constituents who urgently want to restore their downtowns and communities putting former industrial sites back on to the tax rolls and creating jobs. Dilapidated warehouses, abandoned factories, and former gas stations littered across our cities and towns are untapped economic opportunities just waiting to be redeveloped into productive uses like startup incubators, affordable housing, tech centers, and public green space. Increased funding will return brownfields to productive uses, generate additional tax revenue, clean up the environment, grow jobs, and revitalize communities all across our country. Investing in our civic infrastructure is essential to moving this country forward. Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ). Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for taking this amendment on. When you think about it, we are only funding about 300 to 400 projects a year. But in testimony before our committee, there are 450,000 contaminated sites across America; and if we are only renovating 400 sites, you can imagine how many thousands of years it will take assuming no additional brownfield sites are developed as a result of this. So this idea of grasping just $7 million I think is a fundamental way of trying to say: We need to do more in this effort; we need to put more funds in it. I agree with the gentlewoman’s remark. If $250 million was authorized, then we need to put more money in this if we are serious about brownfields and removing the stigma across our community. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank my colleague, the gentleman from West Virginia; and I want to thank the 409 Members who joined in urging support for this program which has proven to be one of the most effective in the Federal Government. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 25 OFFERED BY MR . GRIJALVA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 25 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(decreased by $2,500,000)’’. Page 43, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $2,500,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would fully fund the Department of the Interior’s Office of the Inspector General. By my count, there are at least 14 Federal investigations that are either underway or completed into the current Secretary alone. That is more investigations than the last four Interior secretaries combined. Still more issues with the Secretary are under preliminary investigation. Even more have not been announced to this date. Interior’s Office of the Inspector General is doing most, if not all, of that work. Funding and staffing shortfalls resulting from flat funding or small cuts have caused the Office of Inspector General in recent months to forgo investigations altogether. Investigation requests from Congress and from tips originating within the Department of the Interior have either been rejected or are awaiting resources to be freed up in order to address them. The Office of Inspector General is also referring a growing number of hotline complaints to the Interior Department for investigation, creating a situation in which the department is investigating itself. Half of those referred complaints involve allegations of ethics violations, sexual harassment, prohibited personnel practices, law enforcement misconduct, and reprisal. Untrained supervisors conduct many of these investigations without following standard protocols and without collecting sufficient evidence. Specially trained, experienced noncriminal investigators are needed to keep these investigations within the Office of Inspector General. The Office of Inspector General’s independence from the office they are examining is essential to their ability to conduct thorough, unadulterated investigations, inspections, or audits. Now is not the time to revert to the preWatergate days when an agency was in charge of investigating itself. This amendment would provide five additional investigators to focus on administrative issues and up to six investigators in field offices which also lets the Office of Inspector General’s criminal investigators focus on criminal misconduct instead of being pulled away to help in other areas. There are particular risks that are being unaddressed because of current funding levels. The Department of the Interior paid out $10 billion in financial assistance and contracts in fiscal year ’16 and ’17. During that time, there was about a 16 percent drop in audits. Contracts and financial assistance are some of the highest risk areas in terms of the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse. My amendment would also provide five new auditors for the Office of Inspector General which are needed to address contracts and financial assistance which is responsible for a disproportionate share of the Office of Inspector General’s 20–1 return on investment. I want to emphasize that. For every dollar we spend on the Interior’s Office of Inspector General, according to the Partnership for Public Service, the taxpayer gets $20 back. This amendment will help ensure that this scandalridden administration doesn’t monopolize the Office of Inspector General’s best people who are supposed to be rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in the agency. If there was ever a time to fully fund the Office of Inspector General, it is now. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, although I am a big fan of the Inspector General’s Office, the current budget is funded at the budget request, and therefore I do not see us raising $2.5 million by raiding the Secretary of the Interior’s operating account. I think it goes way too far. I am glad to know that the gentleman from Arizona actually listened to our talking points on that. But I think at this point in time I would like to keep it exactly where it is. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ). Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the time. Mr. Chairman, I also rise in opposition to the amendment. As the gentleman mentioned, the bill already includes a $1.5 million increase for the Inspector General which is the amount that was requested. This transfer is not needed, and if enacted, it could affect the operations of the Department of the Interior. For those reasons and others, I oppose this amendment. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the figures in the delayed investigations, the deferred investigations and the need for additional auditors were all in the $5 million indication by the Office of Inspector General that that was what was needed in order to be able to comply with the demands of their office and the demands that the public and Congress have for assuring that all the agencies are running under the protocols, the procedures, and the laws that we insist they do so on. Mr. Chairman, $2.5 million that is being requested in this amendment would bring that total to $5 million, which is the amount that the Inspector General has indicated is needed. Mr. Chairman, I ask for a vote of approval on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 26 OFFERED BY MR . DENHAM  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 26 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment No. 26. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 38, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $2,000,000)’’. Page 80, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $2,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, California continues to suffer devastating water shortages and inadequate clean drinking water. We must build new water storage. My amendment would simply transfer $2 million into the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act administrative expenses account from the Department of the Interior Office of the Secretary account. The base text of this bill has $3 million less for WIFIA administration than was provided for the fiscal year ’18 and provides a $10 million increase for the Office of the Secretary account. The WIFIA program is a vital program for water infrastructure. The program was established in the water resources 2014 bill and has been accepting loan applications for clean and drinking water projects. Water storage projects and flood risk reduction infrastructure projects are eligible under section 3905 of 33 U.S.C. 52, but EPA has yet to establish a process for administering such loans. The additional administrative resources in the amendment would allow 
the WIFIA office to more quickly pursue financing of Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers projects. It took 4 years—until April 2018—for WIFIA to issue its first loan for a wastewater project. This is an unacceptable timeframe for establishing an essential water financing program when the American Society of Civil Engineers scored our water infrastructure as a D grade last year. The administration’s infrastructure principles document recommends expanding WIFIA authorities to water storage projects which is the lifeblood of California’s Central Valley and other reclamation States. We can’t wait another 4 years for WIFIA to issue loans for these projects. The Army Corps and EPA expect to execute a memorandum of understanding for financing projects very soon which will further strain WIFIA administrative resources. Additionally, the Senate has included a deadline for Reclamation and EPA to reach an MOU in their water resources bill. Mr. Chairman, this is good policy which mirrors my New WATER Act, H.R. 434. This amendment is necessary for properly and effectively carrying out both MOUs. In closing, California continues to suffer devastating water shortages and inadequate clean drinking water. Areas of California’s Central Valley have not only had bad quality water, but some towns have no water at all. We must build new storage. This bill helps us to move that forward and expedite the process. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. b2200 The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ). The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 27 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 46, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $3,000,000)’’. Page 110, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $3,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, the Office of NavajoHopi Indian Relocation was established to compensate and build homes for those Navajo and Hopi impacted by the Federal Government’s mandated changes of the reservation boundaries, which resulted in families being forced to move away from their homes. My amendment opposes efforts in the underlying bill to prematurely close the Office of NavajoHopi Indian Relocation. The bill significantly cuts this office while preparing for its premature closure. I strongly oppose these cuts. The agency has not completed its mission, and families continue to wait for the benefits they were promised. Closing the agency without providing the benefits to the affected families entitled to them would be a violation of our trust responsibility. Once the agency’s mission is complete, it is essential that the remaining land management responsibilities are passed to capable and responsible agencies that will work with stakeholders to ensure that the trust responsibility is taken seriously. For this to occur, a comprehensive plan must be developed, and the plan must include meaningful input from both the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe, and a thorough audit of the Office of NavajoHopi Indian Relocation. I have concerns that preliminary discussions that have the Office of the Special Trustee assuming land management are premature, as the Office of the Special Trustee has no experience with land management or building housing. While the details of the closure plan are worked out, it makes sense to continue funding the agency, so it can finish its mission and an orderly and agreeable closure plan can be developed. The families impacted by relocation have suffered enough, and we have a responsibility to ensure that we solve the problem in an orderly way, not simply shift the responsibility. My amendment simply shifts the funds that were provided to the Office of the Special Trustee, to assume land management responsibilities, back to the Office of NavajoHopi Indian Relocation where it can be used to build homes and review appeals until the agency mission is complete or a comprehensive closure plan is developed with significant Tribal input. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their interest in this important issue, and I look forward to continuing to work with them toward a resolution that keeps the promises made and is inclusive of all impacted parties. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this amendment for several reasons. The NavajoHopi Settlement Act of 1974 was intended to last 5 years. After that, the plan was to go ineffective. This program has lingered on for nearly four decades longer than it should have. The Office of the NavajoHopi Relocation has indicated its intent to close by September 2018. Accordingly, we should not be reducing or even paying more money in fiscal year 2019 when they want to close the office in fiscal year 2018. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I have personally gone around this process for a long time now, both before I came to Congress and during my tenure in Congress. We have hundreds of families who still are in an appeals process. We have homes throughout both reservations that are simply in a deteriorated state. This is not spending more money. It is shifting money from one agency to another to allow us to continue to make sure that the needs of this relocation project are met. The time limit of 5 years was extended time and time again because of the technical nature of this process and the difficulty in our mandated process to make this a whole system that worked. It hasn’t worked. It needs to be worked on, but not until we have a comprehensive plan. There is no comprehensive plan. There is just an idea and a concept, but no comprehensive plan. I will be glad to work with anybody on a comprehensive plan, but the idea that we just walk away from this right now without an agency that really knows what it is doing makes no sense at all. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, originally, this legislation was intended to help 1,000 families. We have helped more than 3,600 Navajo families and 27 Hopi families. When we talk about the comprehensive plan, maybe we ought to get everybody in order to make sure that plan is acceptable by everybody before we keep throwing money at the problem. Mr. Chair, once again, I am in opposition. Once again, it is four decades past its time. We don’t get resolution on this aspect without putting some force behind it. There has to be finality to this. This cannot keep going on. Without putting some finality to the finances, we will see this continue over and over again. Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out the Navajo and the Hopi have indicated precisely what 
they want to do. They need the time to be able to recognize that there is a comprehensive plan for their future and the families that are impacted. It is not in place. Mr. Chair, I request that my amendment be accepted, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (O’Halleran). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 28 OFFERED BY MR . HECK  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 28 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. HECK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 67, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $500,000)(increased by $500,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK. Mr. Chairman, this is a straightforward amendment to ensure that the EPA is laserfocused on helping address the biggest source of water pollution in the United States: stormwater runoff. Stormwater runoff is what happens when rain falls—we get a lot of that in Washington State—and it flows across roofs, parking lots, and streets. As that rainwater heads on its way to rivers, lakes, and bays, it picks up all sorts of toxic, nasty stuff like metals, oils, fertilizers, and pesticides, just to name a few. Toxic stormwater has a direct effect on the health of our waterways and, more importantly, on our economy. Nowhere is that more clear, frankly, than in my home State of Washington and in the Puget Sound, which is, by water volume, the largest estuary in America. We actually have video of polluted stormwater literally killing salmon in a matter of hours—not days or weeks, but hours—and our endangered southern resident orcas, which we are on the verge of losing altogether, are harmed both by having fewer salmon to lunch on and by absorbing the pollutants directly into their body. We have made a lot of progress in this country in dealing with point source pollution, but stormwater runoff is a lot tougher to deal with now. It is a lot more decentralized, and there are a lot of jurisdictions involved. It is going to require a lot of improvement in water infrastructure over time. State and local governments are kind of stepping up to be sure to meet this challenge. They know the harms posed by stormwater, but their budgets are stretched thin. What they really need is a strong partner in the Federal Government. That is part of why I am so glad the House just last night passed a companion bill to this, the Innovative Stormwater Infrastructure Act, on consent. It had strong, bipartisan support. It creates a task force at EPA comprised of Federal, State, and local governments, along with nonprofit and private partners to develop recommendations for finding some innovative ways to fund stormwater infrastructure. But the recommendations coming out of that task force won’t be very useful if we don’t know more precisely what and how big the need is. That is why the Clean Watersheds Needs Survey is important. That is a survey that Congress actually required of the EPA to conduct under the Clean Water Act on a periodic basis. It is a comprehensive assessment of the outstanding need for stormwater and wastewater control facilities nationwide. We know there is a need. In my State alone, we estimate that stormwater runoff can be solved with a $19 billion, with a B, infrastructure investment over the next generation. The last survey that EPA did dates way back to 2012, and a lot has happened since, a lot of water under the bridge, pun intended. To be clear, we are dealing with data that is 6 years old. In order to make sure our communities are able to deal with the problem, frankly, we need to have better and more current data. That is what this is about: good data, good science. This is what this amendment seeks to do by ensuring the Clean Watersheds Needs Survey is prioritized by the EPA, no new money, just prioritized to get that done as required under the law. It is, frankly, not that large of an expenditure to undertake. We have to make sure that the agency is in fact using every tool in its toolbox to help our communities address stormwater. I will say it again: The number one leading cause of water pollution in America is stormwater. Of course, that starts with being able to have a full picture of the problem we face. Mr. Chairman, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman’s amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the interest in our Nation’s water infrastructure needs. Although this amendment does not do what the gentleman intends it to do, I think it is always important for Congress to have a clear understanding of what improvements need to be made to meet the quality goals of the Clean Water Act. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment I can accept, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HECK. Mr. Chair, however the chairman has journeyed to his conclusion, it is deeply appreciated. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK). The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina. Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Chair, I offer this amendment to underscore the importance of the EPA’s Environmental Justice Program. H.R. 6147 cuts more than $700,000 in funding from this important program that has made an incredible difference in many communities across the country, including in my State of North Carolina. The Environmental Justice Program supports and empowers communities as they work to address significant environmental and public health issues at the local level. b2215 In North Carolina, this program has provided funding for 13 different initiatives since 2001, including the Environmental Justice Education and Research Center at Shaw University, which engages high school and college students in environmental justice research; the Healthy Homes Greensboro collaborative, which works to reduce housingrelated asthma hospitalizations in lowincome, minority neighborhoods resulting from exposure to toxic chemicals; and Clean Energy Durham, which runs a volunteerdriven, neighbortoneighbor energy education program for lowincome residents of Lee County. Nationally, this program has helped do everything from cleaning contaminated soil on reservations to managing oil spills from an abandoned power plant in Cleveland. 
AMENDMENT NO . 30 OFFERED BY MR . SOTO 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 30 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase funding for the National Estuary Program and Coastal Waterways Program by $468,000. It does so by removing and then reapplying $468,000 within the $2.4 billion appropriation for the Environmental Programs and Management Account within the Environmental Protection Agency. This amendment is identical to an amendment I offered last year that passed this body by a voice vote, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment again this year. Currently, the House Report accompanying this bill calls for a funding level of $26,723,000. This amendment will restore funding to the level that passed the House for the last 2 years. This amendment is intended to increase funding for the National Estuary Program that protects and restores water quality and ecological integrity of estuaries of national significance. Currently, 20 estuaries located along the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Coasts and Puerto Rico are designated as estuaries of national significance. Four of these estuaries are in my home State of Florida. This program is efficient at leveraging funds to increase estuaries’ ability to restore and protect ecosystems. The National Estuary Program has obtained more than $10 for every $1 provided by EPA, generating nearly $4 billion for ontheground efforts since 2003. This amendment will result in a real return on investment for the American people. With more than half the U.S. population living within 100 miles of the coast, including the shores of estuaries, this amendment will result in an enhanced quality of life for those living along the coast, while maintaining a healthy ecosystem that supports endangered and threatened species. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I certainly appreciate the gentleman’s desire to show support for robust funding for the National Estuary Program. The FY19 bill provides $26.7 billion for the National Estuary Program, which is equal 
to the FY18 enacted level. This is an amendment I can accept. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from California for his support, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to restore funding for the southern New England estuaries program. I plan to offer and withdraw this amendment in hopes that we can continue this discussion and work out a solution that will continue support for this program that is deeply meaningful to our region. I am honored to be joined in this amendment by Congressmen CICILLINE , KEATING , and K ENNEDY , all of whom know how important this EPA funding is to Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, estuaries support life. They are the fragile but vital ecosystems where saltwater and freshwater mix together, and they support a robust number of species. In Rhode Island, these coastal and tidal areas provide environmental balance, but they are increasingly threatened by human activity. We need to continue to support their restoration, less they regress and become permanently damaged. Over the past several years, we have seen the success of EPA’s southern New England program. With projects since fiscal year 2014, these funds have helped protect and restore watersheds in the Narragansett Bay, Mount Hope Bay, and Buzzards Bay. They have supported coastal areas in South County, Rhode Island, and along Cape Cod and the islands. The EPA’s geographic programs have worked in other parts of the country as well, from the Puget Sound to the Chesapeake Bay, and they are working in New England. Mr. Chairman, as I have said in the past, our estuaries are the lungs of our coastal areas. These EPA funds continue to help our New England estuaries recover and to thrive. While I plan to withdraw this amendment, I hope that Chairman CALVERT  and I can work together to preserve this needed program. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I am happy to work with the gentleman as we go through this process. If we can find some additional funds as we move to conference, I will be more than happy to revisit this issue with the gentleman. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I am grateful for the chairman’s comments, and I hope we can, as the gentleman said, work together on this, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Chair, I withdraw the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. 
AMENDMENT NO . 32 OFFERED BY MS . JAYAPAL  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 32 printed in House Report 115–830. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 69, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $12,000,000) (increased by $12,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and the chair and ranking member of the Interior Subcommittee. Mr. Chair, today I rise to highlight the importance of the EPA’s Superfund Enforcement program. Around the country, communities are being put at risk by those who do not responsibly handle the waste that they actually create, and it can result in years of ongoing damage, which leads to health complications and environmental degradation. The Superfund Enforcement program at the EPA was granted authority under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, to enforce environmental cleanup laws that bring habitats and communities back from the brink in places where pollutants have seeped into the ground. One of the Superfund sites in my State is the Hanford site, which is a decommissioned nuclear production complex next to the Columbia River. It was established as part of the Manhattan Project in 1943, and it was the location of the first fullscale plutonium production reactor. The site is massive, and its legacy not only includes its devastating role in World War II but also the environmental impacts in central Washington and beyond. b2230 The EPA has referred to the Columbia River as the ‘‘lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest,’’ and they are right. And it is why it is so crucial that we at the Federal Government do everything we can to clean up Hanford. Another Superfund site, this one in my district, is the Duwamish River, which was designated as a Superfund site in 2001. Over the course of many years, factory waste and household pollutants have run into the Duwamish, and the Duwamish air quality is the most toxic in our State. Water pollutants have affected our local fish and they have threatened the food supply and the fishing culture, particularly of those nonEnglish speakers, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and people of multiracial backgrounds who depend on the river as a way of life. It has gotten so dangerous that the State and Federal Governments have actually issued a warning against the consumption of fish from the river. On average, community members in the Duwamish live an average of 8 years shorter than other King County residents. The Superfund Enforcement program allows the Federal Government to assess locations like this from Washington State to Washington, D.C., and determine who is responsible for cleaning up these potentially devastating contaminants. By the numbers, Mr. Chairman, the Superfund Enforcement program has not only been incredibly successful, it has actually saved taxpayers money and leveraged a lot of money for us. According to the EPA, in fiscal year 2017, the agency reported that they reduced, treated, or eliminated 217 million in pollution. During that same time, 245 million pounds of hazardous waste was treated, minimized, or properly disposed of, and 416,000 people were protected by the enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Thanks to the Superfund Enforcement program, many of the bad actors who create the problems are actually responsible for cleaning them up, and we leverage a lot of the Federal Government’s money. In fiscal year 2017, the amount committed by liable parties to clean up Superfund sites was $1.227 billion, which goes a long way toward ensuring that communities can be safe, healthy, and protected. While the funding levels in the 2019 bill are not as low as the President’s budget requested, I urge my colleagues to support continued funding in 2018 at the 2018 enacted level of $166 million or higher. 
AMENDMENT NO . 34 OFFERED BY MR . LAMALFA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 34 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 85, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(decreased by $5,000,000)’’. Page 85, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $4,500,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment today simply aims to increase funding to help combat illegal marijuana grow operations in our Nation’s national forests. Illegal marijuana grows pose a significant threat to public safety as well as the environment. According to the DEA, the majority of illegal marijuana production that occurs in Federal land is carried out by Mexican drug cartels. These cartels smuggle deadly weapons, illegal pesticides, and other dangerous materials across the border to grow illegal substances on our public lands. Siskiyou County, in my district in northern California, has actually declared a state of emergency over the damage illegal marijuana production has caused to neighboring communities, the surrounding environment— again, damage much beyond what anybody would ever accuse legal industries of, farming, timber, whatever—and they are using, again, banned chemicals in the process, damaging wildlife, the environment, water supply, across the board. While the majority of illegal grow activity occurs within California’s borders, States across the country are also affected. Drug trafficking organizations are operating on 72 national forests in 21 States throughout the country. Our agencies need the funding and tools to take proactive steps to push back against this growing, large threat. According to the Forest Service, it would cost over $100 million over 5 years to reduce the spread of this problem in California alone. My amendment would increase funding to the National Forest System account by $4.5 million. Indeed, that is barely scratching the surface of what is truly needed, but it is a good start, and then we can fashion a pilot to show the good we can do over time. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would increase that reduction and transfer $5 million to the National Forest System account, and as the gentleman explained, the funding would be used for the purpose of eradicating illegal marijuana growing operations in the national forests, and that is something that I support. I know we work on it in Minnesota, and we have worked on it in our State forests. So I agree that this work is very important. I worked to ensure this funding was included in the fiscal year 2018 omnibus bill, so the funding is already provided, and now it is part of the program’s base. So the amendment, to me, is unnecessary because the program is already funded, but the offset is also problematic. The Forest and Rangeland Research account fund does scientific research that informs policy and land management decisions regarding such issues as I know we all care about: wildfire, fuels research, invasive species, which also can, especially in our forests, lead to the forest being less healthy so they have less resilience to wildfire, and new, innovative ways to harvest forest products, which in my State and many States is very important. This amendment, I don’t think is intended to, but I do believe it could negatively impact bipartisan programs like the Forest Products Laboratory and the Forest Inventory Analysis program. So, as I mentioned, I am opposing this not because I don’t think we need to work on eradicating illegally grown marijuana in our public lands, but because this program is already in part of the base, and the offset is problematic for many of the shared goals I think many of us in this body have. So with that, I oppose this amendment, and I currently don’t plan on speaking on it again. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate my colleague’s position there, but we are talking about, again, what the Forest Service says themselves is a $100 million problem over 5 years, or $20 million per year. This would seek to boost that. If you saw the emergency situation, again, in areas like my district and adjacent, you would probably agree this 
$4.5 million boost would be very important in order to get a good start at that. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ). Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman because this is somewhat personal to me. I appreciate the gentleman’s interest in this illegal marijuana cultivation in our national forests. One of the largest national forests in the State of California, Cleveland National Forest, is literally in my congressional district and right close to my house. We are always having problems with people setting up illegal grow operations in the Cleveland National Forest. So this increase to remediate these sites is needed. I agree with the gentlewoman that these offsets are difficult, but I am pleased to offer my support for the gentleman’s amendment. Hopefully, we can get rid of some of this illegal marijuana that is grown in these national forests. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have left. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chairman, again, I appreciate the conversation here, but when you look at the depth and the danger of what is being brought into our States and my own part of northern California, my colleague in the Cleveland National Forest, this is an acute problem. The environmental damage is unspeakable with the amount of chemicals, the damage to the wildlife, and the threat this poses to people out there innocently hiking, camping, utilizing the forest or maybe for even logging operations. So we need to kickstart this as strongly as possible, and that is why I offer this amendment tonight in order to counter and send a message that we are taking this seriously where Federal employees, Federal agents have feared to tread in recent years because of this tremendous threat that the Mexican nationals and gang activity has caused in our national forests that belong to the people. So, again, I urge my colleagues to support this. It is an important start and weaves into so much with human trafficking, environmental destruction, and even, in some cases, murder associated with the problems of the growth of this product in our national forests. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 35 OFFERED BY MR . WELCH  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 35 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 85, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000)’’. Page 85, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, across the country, an invasive beetle known as the emerald ash borer has been wreaking havoc on ash trees. It was first discovered in 2002 in Michigan, but since then, it has spread to 33 States, killing millions of trees, inflicting severe harm on the forest products industry, and costing municipalities and property owners millions of dollars. b2245 Ash trees infested with the emerald ash borer suffer nearly 100 percent fatality rates over a 3 to 5year period. At this point, there is no known effective treatment. Earlier this year, the emerald ash borer was discovered in Vermont. While the discovery was not a surprise, the news is devastating. Forests are a central part of our economy, our landscape, and our way of life. It is going to be difficult to eradicate the pest, but there are steps we can take to contain its spread. Mr. Chairman, I thank the Appropriations Committee, Mr. CARTER , and Ms. MCCOLLUM for acknowledging the threat this invasive species poses. The report language accompanying the bill recommends a $19.5 million increase to forest health management under the State and private forestry account for addressing highpriority invasive species, pests, and diseases, including the emerald ash borer. I support that increase. My amendment specifies that, of this amendment, at least $5 million should be used to help mitigate the spread of and eradicate the emerald ash borer. Ultimately, a successful response will require a strong partnership between Federal, State, and private sector stakeholders. This amendment is a good first step to ensure the Federal Government is doing its part. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing this issue to our attention. Invasive species, pests, and diseases have wreaked havoc across the Nation and continue to do so. I know that the emerald ash borer has been a tremendous pest throughout a good part of our country, certainly in State and private forests also. We need to improve management in our forests, and we need those conditions to improve. So I am happy to accept the gentleman’s amendment, and I hope we can reduce the emerald ash borer. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. CARTER , I thank Ms. M CCOLLUM , and I thank the Appropriations Committee for their support, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 36 OFFERED BY MR . RUIZ 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 36 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Congressman POLIS, and I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 85, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $2,000,000)’’. Page 90, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(decreased by $2,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bipartisan amendment with my colleagues Representatives POLIS, KING, and R ENACCI to support the brave men and women who serve as volunteer firefighters. This commonsense amendment would add an additional $2 million for volunteer fire assistance grants. These grants provide matching funds to local and rural volunteer fire departments to assist with training and the purchase of communications and safety equipment. California experienced one of the worst wildfire seasons in history last year, and this year is shaping up to be no different. Volunteer firefighters will provide nearly 80 percent of the initial defense of homes, businesses, and communities in the face of these fires before reinforcement arrives. In my district, where we are under the constant threat of wildfire, departments such as Idyllwild Fire Protection District and the Riverside County Fire Department have benefited from the VFA grant program. These departments provide fire protection services to dozens of rural communities in my district that are at a heightened risk of wildfire due to the sustained drought and heat California is experiencing. The volunteer firefighters who serve Idyllwild routinely overcome significant communications and topographical challenges. Grant programs, 
like volunteer fire assistance grants, help them respond quickly and effectively to fire emergencies. Throughout the rest of my district, interim Riverside Fire Chief Daniel Talbot has done an excellent job leading the department and preparing for what is already an intense fire season. This week alone, several new fires have sprung up as tripledigit temperatures continue to create a tinderbox across the Western United States. Images of blackened cars and houses reduced to their foundations are already far too common, images we will, unfortunately, only continue to see more of. Despite this constant and recurrent threat, we still fail to treat fires like the devastating natural disasters that they are. The damage caused by wildfires in California, Colorado, and other States has been heartbreaking, and yet we still continue to underfund mitigation, suppression, and prevention efforts for these disasters. Any additional assistance we can provide to those on the front lines to keep our communities safe is our social responsibility to protect the common good, especially when volunteers risk their lives to save our lives without pay. Many of these departments who benefit from the VFA program operate in rural towns on shoestring budgets, so an additional $2 million will go a long way to helping them purchase critical extra equipment. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment to give our firefighters the equipment and training they need to keep the public safe. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan amendment with Mr. POLIS, Mr. K ING, and Mr. RUIZ. As a former volunteer firefighter, maintaining adequate funding for the volunteer fire assistance program is of particular importance to me. First responders are pillars of our community, and it has been a privilege of mine to advocate for them in Congress. This program provides financial and technical assistance through grants to rural communities of less than 10,000 people that are matched by the community or State on a 50–50 basis. Grant funding for this program can be used to obtain and repair equipment and improve fire protection capabilities. Ever more striking is that many of these rural fire departments often rely on volunteers. In fact, 70 percent of all firefighters are volunteers, over half of whom are found in rural communities. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to provide these brave men and women the funds they need to adequately combat wildfires and protect our communities and treasured American landscape. Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. RENACCI. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I certainly support this amendment. Mr. RUIZand I represent the same area. Volunteer firefighters are extremely important, especially in our rural areas, and this is something we all should support. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to accept the amendment. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, this amendment would reallocate $2 million to the Interior’s volunteer fire assistance program with six to eight volunteer firefighters. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate and thank my colleague, who has given his time in fighting fires in his capacity. I thank my colleagues, as well as the chairman and the ranking members for their work on this bipartisan bill. Mr. Chairman, once again, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and commonsense amendment to support the volunteer firefighters who protect our communities, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 37 OFFERED BY MR . CARBAJAL  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 37 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee for Mr. POLIS of Colorado, and I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 86, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(decreased by $10,000,000)’’. Page 86, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $10,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment No. 37 on behalf of my colleague from Colorado, Representative POLIS. Mr. Chairman, as we continue to see global temperatures rise and extreme weather events like wildfires become more prevalent, it is imperative that Congress take action to help reduce these threats. This amendment would increase funds for hazardous fuels management activities by an additional $10 million in order to mitigate the threats of wildfires and help save lives. This program reduces dangerously high fuel loads and helps restore and improve the health and resiliency of our forests. Managing hazardous fuel loads is critical to protecting the American public from wildfires, providing for fire safety and preserving our Nation’s natural resources. Fuel treatments provide safer conditions and more strategic options for firefighters. In the 2016 fiscal year, the Forest Service funded and helped conduct fuels treatment on more than 3.2 million highpriority acres nationwide. This included 2.1 million acres on areas with populated communities, high fire areas where the Forest Service could alleviate the risk more effectively. Assessments of fuels treatment effectiveness show that 91 percent of treatments were effective in changing fire behavior and/or helping to control wildfire. Despite this progress, the Forest Service estimates that there are millions of acres at high risk of wildfires, including some that are adjacent to communities. We must make investments in hazardous fuels programs that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing wildfire risk and continue to prioritize treatments in the highest priority areas to protect lives, property, and watersheds. As the Representative for the central coast in California, I can tell you that we are no strangers to wildfires. This year alone, my district witnessed the devastating impacts of the Thomas and Holiday fires. The Thomas fire became the largest fire in California history, burning nearly 282,000 acres in Ventura County and Santa Barbara County, and later triggering mudslides that tragically claimed the lives of 23 individuals in my district. If we can take action to prevent wildfires, we should. We know it pays to be prepared. And we know that for every dollar spent on mitigation activities, we save $6 in return. Mr. POLIS’ amendment is a commonsense measure that would help provide sufficient funds to ensure that we are protecting lives and property from the threats of wildfires. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, certainly, I agree with the gentleman that hazardous fuel reduction is something that is extremely important. That is why we provide for a $30 million increase from last year’s levels for hazardous fuel reduction in this bill. Second, the national forests are overgrown and prone to severe and catastrophic fires, there is no doubt about 
it. Colorado, for instance, has already experienced a number of these fires this year, and, certainly, our home State of California is no different. We have had a number of fires, and we have fires going on at this very moment. The timber program, which removes trees from these overgrown stands, significantly reduces the threat of catastrophic fire. We went down a path in the early 1990s that many people in the mainstream environmental movement now realize is a mistake. We have now got out of that enterprise, and a lot of these forests, unfortunately, have overgrown and have bark beetle disease, so that now becomes hazardous fuel. Unfortunately, it wasn’t harvested in a responsible way earlier. Responsible harvesting of timber from the national forest is a necessary component of good forest and land management. b2300 So taking money from that account is the offset that I can’t support. But certainly, I do support hazardous fuel reduction, because, unfortunately, we have created a lot of it in our home State of California and throughout the West. So, unfortunately, I have to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, this amendment offsets the $10 million increase for fuels management by reducing from the forest products. Unlike the forest products line item, which funds timber sales, the hazardous fuels program is focused exclusively on reducing wildfire risks and employs a wide range of tools, including prescribed fire, mechanical fuels reduction, and thinning activities. Increasing funding for hazardous fuels management can save lives. And when we consider the priority of forest products versus the opportunity to thin these fuels, I think the priority is clear, for saving lives, for saving property, and saving our environment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ). The amendment was rejected. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 38 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO . 39 OFFERED BY MR . GROTHMAN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 39 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 115, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $23,250,000)’’. Page 116, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $23,250,000)’’. Page 147, line 2, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $46,500,00)’’. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to modify the amendment in the form I have placed at the desk. There was a minor change in the figure there. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to object. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized on her reservation. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, while I appreciate the request made is intended to correct an inadvertent drafting error, I am concerned that granting the gentleman’s request would legitimize a double standard being applied to unanimous consent requests here on the House floor. For example, during consideration of the defense appropriation bill 3 weeks ago, Congresswoman JACKSON LEE sought to obtain a unanimous consent to correct just this sort of innocent drafting error in her amendment. The majority informed us that, while they had no problem trying to fix the error in some other less direct manner later in the process, they would object to doing so by unanimous consent. More importantly, just today, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee asked for and could not get unanimous consent to consider a resolution endorsing Speaker RYAN’s own statement rebuking the President’s statements in Helsinki in which the President said that he takes the Russians’ word over that of the U.S. intelligence community, and refused to condemn the Russians’ attacks on our democracy. If Democrats can’t even get unanimous consent for that, endorsing a statement by the Speaker of the House, it starts to look like a partisan double standard for giving unanimous consent. Mr. Chair, I withdraw my reservation of objection. The Acting CHAIR. The reservation is withdrawn. The Clerk will report the modification. The Clerk read as follows: Modification to amendment No. 39 offered by Mr. GROTHMAN : 
Page 115, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $23,250,000)’’. Page 116, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $23,250,000)’’. Page 147, line 2, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $46,500,000)’’. 
Mr. GROTHMAN (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I will address the amendment. The purpose of this amendment is to try to make a small dent in what I consider to be the overall excessive spending that is going on here. In the year which we are currently in, we anticipate borrowing about 22 percent of the Federal budget. A few years ago, we had that number down to around 11 percent—and to a certain extent because of the hurricanes, but to a certain extent not—we now are borrowing up to 22 percent. President Trump, at the time he originally submitted the budget for this time, which was before the budget agreement was reached, I think, anticipated spending over $50 billion less than the amount that was spent in the last year. I tried to look at something to just give a little bit, a tip of the cap, to President Trump’s request. I think he is paying a lot more attention to the burden we are placing on our children and grandchildren than Congress collectively. And I looked at the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. I am requesting a 15 percent reduction in both of those numbers. It seems when you reduce anything else, it seems to plan that it is a matter of life and death, and horrible things are going to happen. I like the arts. I don’t know if I like the humanities quite as much as the arts, but they are okay, too. But it is hard to believe, at a time when we are borrowing 22 percent of our overall budget, that a minor 15 percent cut in these two items would be inappropriate. We are, right now, going up in the National Endowment of the Humanities, hitting an alltime high this year, at the time of this huge deficit, and we are also increasing in the proposed budget the amount we are spending on the humanities. It seems to me that these things, you could argue, are not necessarily a Federal purpose at all. I am not like President Trump was 2 years ago and trying to zero out these two lines altogether, but I think it is a little bit of an insult to our President, an insult to our children, an insult to our grandchildren to go up to high numbers on both these items. So the purpose of my amendment, a minor 15 percent reduction. There is still more in both these accounts than we had just a few years ago. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CALVERT. I certainly agree with the gentleman that we have a budget problem. I served on the Budget Committee for a number of years and recognize the fact that we are spending too much money. However, if we take a look at the entire budget picture, nondefense discretionary accounts represent 16 percent of total Federal outlays. And if you take a look at the nondefense discretionary accounts, over the last number of years, we are pretty flat. We are pretty flat spending right now. I mean, even with this increase, even with this increase. However, this NEANEH program is something I can’t support. While I understand, again, why the gentleman wants to save money, this amendment would have unintended consequence affecting the men and women who serve in the country in uniform, military veterans, their families, as well as Native Americans, Alaska natives. We are putting a lot of this money in to help people get through their post traumatic stress syndrome. This amendment would have devastating consequence on critical work for the National Endowment for the Arts at Walter Reed Medical Center, 11 other clinical sites across the country that are supporting therapy service. We have reformed the National Endowment for the Humanities to make sure that we have low overhead, and that this money is getting out into the country. This money doesn’t go to New York or L.A. This goes out to the rural areas around the country that don’t have the benefit of large interest in arts. So I certainly urge Members to support the innovative work the NEA and the NEH are providing our men and women in uniform, our veterans, and families. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ). Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I too rise to speak in opposition to this amendment. The NEA and the NEH have strong, bipartisan support on this committee, and I had really hoped the days of attacking these agencies were behind us. Maybe they seem like a good political target for those who don’t understand the ways the arts and humanities affect our daily lives, but the economic benefits are undeniable for big cities, small towns, and everywhere in between. The arts and culture industry contributes $764 billion to our economy every year, and the endowments are uniquely positioned to help smaller, rural areas, as you heard the Chair say, access that energy in a way that private capital can’t or won’t. And efforts to reach underserved communities are just as important. NEA’s Creative Forces program helps servicemembers and veterans manage TBI and PTSD through arts therapy. A cut would majorly impact the program’s reach. Similarly, NEH has funded the popular veterans book clubs that use literature that help process experiences in our military. I have been lucky to talk to some participants, and this is a deeply meaningful program that, again, is in jeopardy if this proposed cut moves forward. Frankly, all of this comes at a very small price tag. The NEA and NEH use minimal Federal investments. I will just end by saying this is an important way to create jobs, support families, and sustain communities in every Congressional district. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ). Mr. LANCE. I thank the chairman for his strong support of these programs. I rise in opposition to the gentleman’s amendment. Cuts to these programs may be pennywise, but I think they are poundfoolish. I am the Republican chair of both the Arts Caucus and the Humanities Caucus in this House, and these programs do wonderful work throughout the entire Nation, in every hamlet in America and, of course, supporting our veterans. For every dollar the United States spends on Federal arts initiatives, nine nonFederal dollars are leveraged, generating roughly $600 million in matching funds. Last year’s Federal arts appropriation was under $150 million, but the industry returned $10 billion to the Federal Treasury in income taxes. I understand the gentleman’s argument about government spending and our national debt. I take these matters seriously and have opposed a recent measure in this body that will increase our national debt over the next decade. But on these programs, I trust that my colleagues from the Arts and Humanities Caucuses will expand on the incredible cultural and educational importance of supporting these programs as well. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. Mr. GROTHMAN. Just a comment from the humble Congressman from Wisconsin. It was said that this is a small amount. I still think $300 million is a lot of money, okay? And we are only taking about $45 million out of that. We are leaving a lot behind. We are leaving—I don’t feel, at this time, with such a big debt, we should be setting the alltime high that we have ever put in the endowment for the humanities and higher than any other amount we have put in the arts for the last 8 years. And when I run for this job, I don’t find anybody running around saying that they have got a big crisis in this country. I have a lot of rural area. And we have got to spend a lot more money in Washington, we have got this big debt, on the arts and humanities. My local and municipal government are pleased to fund this. Philanthropists are pleased to fund this, and even people without a lot of money like me are happy to fund it on our own. I request that the amendment pass and we make a little dent in this huge level of spending, and take a small amount out of here; not as much as President Trump, who cares so much about our children and grandchildren, wanted to take out, but at least a small 15 percent out due to our huge debt. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, can I inquire how much time I have left? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1 minute remaining. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, one thing I want to make a point of, and because obviously this deficit is a problem. Everybody recognizes that. Seventy percent of all our spending today is nondiscretionary spending, 70 percent. When I came to Congress 26 years ago it was 30 percent. Today those numbers have totally flipped. Now it is 30 percent discretionary, 70 percent nondiscretionary. Of the discretionary account, half of that goes to defense. The other half goes to nondefense discretionary. No way are we ever going to balance the budget on nondefense discretionary spending. At some point, we all need to come together, Republicans, Democrats, the President, and come to a budget agreement. It has been tried before and needs to be tried again. And the 70 percent of nondiscretionary spending has to be on the table and we have to bend those cost curves. We are not going to—and I dispute the fact that we are at an alltime high on NEH and the National Endowment for the Arts. In past years, those numbers were quite higher. b2315 Those numbers have been cut down over the years, and we are trying to do the best we can on these discretionary accounts; but being what it will, this is not, I think, a wise cut. Money is going to every congressional district in the United States. Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 40 OFFERED BY MR . BEYER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 40 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 138, beginning on line 1, strike section 430. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, neither of the amendments that I offer tonight have much to do with the appropriations we are addressing. They are not about specific budget provisions, although I very much enjoyed listening to the many amendments tonight and am impressed with how often the discussion has been cordial. Instead, this amendment seeks to preserve current Clean Water Act protections for our rivers, streams, and wetlands. Our Nation’s river systems and wetlands provide irreplaceable resources: natural water quality improvement, flood protection, shoreline erosion control, recreation, general aesthetic appreciation, and natural products for our use at no cost. Yet section 430 of this bill seeks to undermine the critical balance between protecting these waters and the daytoday operations of our Nation’s farmers, ranchers, and foresters. Under current law, you do not need a Clean Water Act permit if discharges of dredged or fill material are associated with normal farming, ranching, or silviculture activities. This exemption pertains to normal farming and harvesting activities that are part of an established, ongoing farming or forestry operation. Only when the activities change or convert the use of a waterbody to a new purpose or impair the historic flow or reach of a stream or wetland does the exemption no longer apply. What this means is that farmers can continue to plow their fields, plant their seeds, and harvest their crops without ever having to obtain approval under the Clean Water Act; but if a farmer wants to use the current exemption to convert his farmland into a residential development, he can’t do that unless he gets a permit. A rancher couldn’t use this exemption to plow under a wetland to expand the reach of her grazing lands, and forestry operations can’t use this exemption to change the course of a local stream to improve drainage on their growing lands. Section 430 of this bill seeks to provide an absolute exemption for impacts to any streams or wetlands that happen to be on agricultural, ranching, or forestry lands. This is a fundamental change to the Clean Water Act and one where the impacts have never been explored. This amendment would be a departure from almost 40 years of implementation of the Clean Water Act by eliminating the existing provision requiring that the exemptions are limited to established, ongoing farming practices. It could result in the loss or impairment of thousands of acres of valuable wetlands. Mr. Chairman, we shouldn’t be using an appropriations bill to change Federal policy related to the protection of our Nation’s rivers and streams. To the best of my knowledge, no hearings or investigations on the impacts of this provision have ever been held. If Congress intended to overturn almost 40 years of Clean Water Act precedent, regular order would require hearings before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which has sole jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act, and approval by that committee before consideration on the floor. Mr. Chairman, this rider is bad policy for the protection of our environment, for the protection of human health, and for the protection of public safety. Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment. My colleague today has labeled this language a loophole in the bill, which is false. A loophole is used to get around a law. The language he wants to strike requires EPA and Army Corps to follow the law. I ask once again my colleague, a friend of mine and a nice guy, to come visit us in northern California and meet with the farmers and ranchers who have seen firsthand this misuse and abuse of the Clean Water Act and to gain an understanding why this language is necessary. It is not theoretical. This is regulatory overreach at its worst going on right now. The recapture provision of the Clean Water Act was never meant to swallow the original intent of the agricultural exemptions clearly laid out in the act, but that is exactly what has been happening. If this amendment passes, it would only get worse. It was never the intention of the Clean Water Act to punish farmers for conducting normal farming practices, normal operations, such as plowing or doing stock pond maintenance, indeed, continuing what it is they have always done. There is a difference between filling a river and a difference between plowing the corner of a field. These exemptions were constructed to address that difference. The ongoing expansion of enforcement, indeed, the reinterpretation of clear exemption, is not what has been going on for 40 years as asserted, but only in recent years under the previous administration have they reinterpreted these laws; otherwise, you wouldn’t have these farmers and others in such a fuss over what they have done for many decades. The ongoing expansion of enforcement of the Clean Water Act has chipped away at the rights of landowners and has made it a danger to farmers to effectively utilize their own property—key word, ‘‘own.’’ This isn’t somebody else’s wetlands. This isn’t someone else’s habitat. This is land that belongs to farmers who have been practicing farming in the way they see fit for many years before this reinterpretation. It is really ridiculous that a farmer must worry about being slapped with a fine in the millions of dollars just for plowing on their own land or a decision to rest that land, let it lie fallow, or wait for improved market conditions. In my district, there have been lawsuits against residents for farming without Federal permission. Cases like these across the country have cost farmers millions of dollars—yes, millions of dollars—in legal damages, and they risk running farmers out of business. I don’t know of many farmers who can absorb milliondollar fines very many times and continue doing what they are doing. If this amendment is not defeated, these damages to farm communities will only grow. America’s farmers and ranchers deserve our support. They deserve to be able to make decisions about managing their land, managing their crops, have crop rotations that make sense to them for market conditions, or just allowing the land to rest without having to seek an onerous permit if they let their land rest for a couple years, this without more regulatory ambiguity and red tape. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I tried to listen very carefully to my friend from northern California. Number one, I would love to come visit and talk to his farmers and his ranchers, with his permission and accompaniment. Number two, I think if there is administrative misuse, if there is a reinterpretation of a law that has been in place for 40 years, let’s address that. Let’s do that through the Department of the Interior. We have, I believe, from the gentleman’s perspective, a very friendly administration. Let’s make sure that they are implementing the law appropriately. By the way, I agree with the gentleman, it was never intended to punish farmers. The gentleman’s northern California experience is different from ours here. My mom and dad both grew up on farms in northern Virginia, which are completely residential developments right now. We want to make sure that we don’t, with this rider, make it possible for a farmer to change from farming to suburbia without ever obtaining a permit, 
and that is essentially what we have done. By the wholesale nature of this repeal, of the nonstop to the exemptions, we essentially really shortcut the Clean Water Act. I urge us to look for a middle ground solution that answers the needs of farmers without opening wide this exemption for any farming, ranching, or grazing activity, forestry activity that might result in this full repeal. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chair, indeed, I appreciate my colleague’s comments and thoughts on this. We are not talking about conversion to suburbia. We are talking about a reinstitution of a crop that may have been lying fallow for a few years or changing from a crop such as a hay crop to wheat. Indeed, one of my growers up north got in big trouble because they wanted to put in a wheat crop on their own land, which isn’t wetlands unless we want to start reinterpreting that way by EPA working with their henchmen in the Army Corps, basically out of the Sacramento office, to keep coming after him and finding more and more people. This puts more wind in their sails to come after people who are making an honest living, not trying to develop houses or suburbia. Indeed, I would agree with the gentleman on that. And that is going to require a fairly difficult permit process, especially in my home State of California, if you want to start turning this ag land into suburbia. It is not what we are after. There was a farm bill some years ago called the Freedom to Farm. What has happened to that? What has happened to that concept? With clear exemptions in the Clean Water Act for normal farming practices, not new interpretations that have been put in place in the previous administration we are still trying to unwind and get their attention on, that is why this amendment would be damaging towards that effort. It is not a fight over clean water; it is a fight over Federal control. They never intended for this. It is unfortunate I have to even be here today to defend simply requiring the bureaucrats to follow the law and the clear exemptions that were put in place under the Clean Water Act. Activities of the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers go above the law to impose these requirements, again, significantly expanding the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, which clearly exceeds congressional intent when they passed the Clean Water Act 40plus years ago. Mr. Chair, again, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ). The amendment was rejected. AMENDMENT NO . 41 OFFERED BY MR . BEYER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 41 printed in House Report 115–830. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 138, beginning on line 10, strike section 431. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 996, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike section 431, which repeals the current Clean Water Rule. Without this Clean Water Rule, the streams that supply public drinking water systems to one in three Americans will remain at risk. Mr. Chairman, everyone agreed that clarity was needed in light of the Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 that created uncertainty about the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. Calls for EPA to issue a rule even came from such organizations as the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the Western Business Roundtable, and the National Association of Manufacturers. The EPA and the Corps solicited comments to clarify the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, and that included a lengthy and inclusive public rulemaking process that included over 200 days for public comment. The comment period was even extended twice in response to extension requests. The final rule reflected over 1 million public comments in the proposal, the overwhelming majority of which supported the Clean Water Rule. They had 400 meetings across the Nation with various stakeholders. The final Clean Water Rule was robust and ensured that water sources were protected by taking into account the connected systems of water, from wetlands and seasonal bodies of water to large rivers and lakes. The requirements of the rule were meticulously developed and addressed longstanding uncertainty, improving our national commitment to protect not only America’s water, but the American people. About 117 million Americans get drinking water from streams that were vulnerable to pollution before this new Clean Water Rule. Our health and our lives depend on clean water, our economy depends on clean water. Mr. Chairman, what is unusual is the Trump administration is already working to replace, revise the 2015 rule, so I am baffled why this rider is necessary. Does the rider mean the Republican Party can’t trust its own EPA to write the rule to their requirements? So I stand here today to denounce this unnecessary rider and to defend clean water for the American people. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. b2330 Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman’s amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, with the change of administrations, we were able to reduce the number of issues addressed in this bill, but some issues warrant continued congressional attention. WOTUS is one of them. Deciding how water is used should be the responsibility of State and local officials who are familiar with the people and the local issues. Under the WOTUS rule, however, the reach of the Federal jurisdiction would be so broad that it would significantly restrict a landowner’s ability to make decisions about their property and a local government’s right to plan for its own development. The language in the underlying bill simply repeals the misguided WOTUS rule and clarifies what rules will be in effect until a new rule is finalized, specifically, the same rules that were in effect immediately prior to the promulgation of the final WOTUS rule. WOTUS is an issue that warrants continued congressional attention and the provision in the underlying bill is the appropriate action to take. For these reasons, I must urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I certainly respect the opinion of the chair, but I do take issue with the notion that it is a misguided WOTUS rule. There were 1 million comments, 400 meetings, and I served on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee and National Resources Committee in the last 2 years of the Obama administration when EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy came to us and said that after the original publication of the intended new clean water rule, there was so much feedback that she went back to the drawing board for another year of hearings and comments to address the many concerns that were raised by farmers, cattlemen, and others, most of which were resolved at the time. Mr. Chair, I respect the notion that a new administration has the right to go through the same process, the same hearings, and the same public comment to modify the rule to evolve it as we move forward. But to just throw out the old rule by a rider to an appropriations bill, seems the wrong way to make law, the wrong way to govern. Mr. Chair, I encourage my few colleagues here at a little bit before midnight to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ). The amendment was rejected. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. LANCE ) having assumed the chair, Mr. BUDD, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 6147) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
SUPPORTING ICE (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for an agency that works extremely hard to keep our country safe, and that is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE. While some on the other side of the aisle have called for ICE to be abolished—yes, that is not a joke, and indeed, have proposed a bill that they are now running away from, they failed to put their money where their mouth is on the issue when their bluff was called. ICE is, in fact, one of the most important components of our country’s interior law enforcement. Without them, even the most modest level of border security would be difficult. In 2017 alone, the numbers are staggering: 226,119 illegal aliens removed; 32,598 Homeland Security criminal arrests; 4,818 gang arrests, including 796 MS–13 members; and 2,370 pounds of the very dangerous fentanyl drugs seized, which only a small amount is very dangerous to thousands of people. The statistics should speak for themselves. ICE is critical for our country and its law enforcement. We should be doing everything we can to support them instead of threatening and abolishing an agency that works around the clock to protect our borders and our interior from these great threats. We should appreciate this branch of law enforcement, not try and run it out of town.
