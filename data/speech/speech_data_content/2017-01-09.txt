hodgepodge of State laws exist to deal with faithless electors, some of which are illequipped to handle the problem. Fortunately, the Uniform Law Commission has proposed the Faithful Presidential Electors Act, which has already been enacted in four States. The Faithful Presidential Electors Act provides a Stateadministered pledge of faithfulness, with any attempt by an elector to submit a vote in violation of that pledge constituting a resignation from the office of elector. In such case, the act provides a mechanism for filling an electoral vacancy. At the conclusion of my remarks, I will include in the RECORD a copy of the Faithful Presidential Electors Act. In short, Mr. Speaker, based upon my view of the Constitution, Congress properly handled the issue of faithless electors in this election. This election should, however, serve as a wakeup call to States that further action on their part may be necessary. 
UNIFORM FAITHFUL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS  ACT (Drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and by it Approved and Recommended for Enactment in All the States at its Annual Conference Meeting in Its OneHundredand Nineteenth Year in Chicago, Illinois July 9–16, 2010 Without Prefatory Note or Comments) [Copyright 2010 by National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, September 28, 2010] 
ACT SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This [act] may be cited as the Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors Act. SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.

Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5 through 8, this state’s electors are the winning elector nominees under the laws of this state. Legislative Note: For a state wishing to accommodate unpledged electors, the following three sentences could be substituted for the first two sentences of Section 3: ‘‘Any political party [or unaffiliated presidential candidate] advancing candidates for elector positions in this state shall submit to the [Secretary of State] the names of two qualified individuals for each elector position to be contested. One of the individuals must be designated ‘‘elector nominee’’ and the other ‘‘alternate elector nominee’’.

Legislative Note: This act does not deal with the possibility of death of a presidential or vicepresidential candidate before the electoral college meetings, or with any other disabling condition or the discovery of disqualifying information. A state may choose to deal separately with one or another of these possibilities. SECTION 5. CERTIFICATION OF ELECTORS. In submitting this state’s certificate of ascertainment as required by 3 U.S.C. Section 6, the [Governor] shall certify this state’s electors and state in the certificate that: (1) the electors will serve as electors unless a vacancy occurs in the office of elector before the end of the meeting at which elector votes are cast, in which case a substitute elector will fill the vacancy; and (2) if a substitute elector is appointed to fill a vacancy, the [Governor] will submit an amended certificate of ascertainment stating the names on the final list of this state’s electors. SECTION 6. PRESIDING OFFICER; ELECTOR VACANCY. (a) The [Secretary of State] shall preside at the meeting of electors described in Section 7.

(c) To qualify as a substitute elector under subsection (b), an individual who has not executed the pledge required under Section 4 shall execute the following pledge: ‘‘I agree to serve and to mark my ballots for President and Vice President consistent with the pledge of the individual to whose elector position I have succeeded.’’. Legislative Note: As with Sections 3 and 4, adjustment of this Section is required for any state where unpledged electors are permissible. For a state wishing to accommodate unpledged electors, the language of subsections (b)(2), (b)(3), and (c) could be changed to the following: (b)(2): ‘‘if the alternate elector for the vacant position is not present to vote but other alternate electors who were nominated by the same political party [or unaffiliated presidential candidate] are present, by appointing an elector chosen by lot from among those alternate electors of the same political party [or of the same unaffiliated presidential candidate] .’’ (b)(3): ‘‘if the vacant position is that of an unpledged elector and the alternate elector for that vacant position is not present to vote, or if there otherwise are no alternate electors eligible for the vacant position under paragraphs (1) and (2), by appointing any immediately available individual who is qualified to serve as an elector and has been chosen through nomination by and plurality vote of the remaining electors, including nomination and vote by a single elector if only one remains.’’ (c): ‘‘To qualify as a substitute elector for a vacant position associated with an elector who had executed a pledge, an individual who has not executed the pledge required under Section 4 shall execute the following pledge: ‘‘I agree to serve and to mark my ballots for President and Vice President consistent with the pledge of the individual to whose elector position I have succeeded’’.’’ SECTION 7.

NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington (Mr. REICHERT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, today is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. Behind me are the faces of 135 men and women. They are the faces of those who paid the ultimate price serving and protecting us this past year so that our families and our children can live safe and enjoy our freedom. As you can see, freedom isn’t free. You may not know or recognize these faces, but you know the faces of others who have served or that are serving today. They are the faces of our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, and friends. Some were ambushed and executed. Some lost their lives responding to a call to save a life, someone who called for help. Tacoma police officer Jake Gutierrez, from my home State of Washington, is one of the faces behind me. He lost his life in the line of duty just last month while trying to protect a woman from domestic violence. Jake was supposed to have exchanged wedding vows with his fiancee in just a few weeks. Instead, she and his three daughters and granddaughter attended his funeral and tried to picture a life without Jake. Tragically, again last month, a time meant for celebration was filled with another Washington family’s sorrow. Veteran officer Mike McClaughry from the Mount Vernon Police Department was shot in the head while responding to a call for help. Today his children, wife, friends, and family sit by his hospital bed and his life now hangs in the balance in the hands of God and his doctors. This feeling of loss is one that I am also familiar with. In 1982, my partner and best friend, Sergeant Sam Hicks, was shot to death attempting to arrest a murder suspect. He left behind his wife and five sons. That was over 30 years ago, but the loss of a loved one is a pain that cannot be forgotten, cannot be erased. This national day of appreciation is not only a day to reflect and appreciate the service of those who have served, but those that are serving today. They are driving, walking, patrolling your neighborhoods, keeping us safe. They are ready to put their lives on the line, yes, but every day they do so much more for us that goes unnoticed: The officer that took the stolen bike report on Christmas Day and the next day delivered a new bicycle to that little boy’s home; How about the officer who anonymously buys groceries for a needy family; The officer who counseled a little girl who was being bullied because of the clothes she wore and then bought her a new set of clothes; How about the officer who went to a call where he had to cradle a 2month old baby in his arms, giving CPR to his little, fragile blue face, hoping for the best news, fearing the worst—and getting the worst—and then headed off to his next call; The officer that held the hand of a dying man after a motorcycle accident and then sharing his last words with his family; The officer who was spit on, ridiculed, and insulted by a man threatening to kill the officer and his wife and then minutes later saving that same man from taking his own life with a butcher knife. These men and women are coaches, volunteers, and mentors, helping people find jobs, feeding the homeless, helping them find homes, and sometimes even taking them into their own homes. These are real people. They are your neighbors, they are your friends, and they are us. This is not a job for them. It is a calling. They serve because they want to help. They want to make a difference. They serve with the heart of a servant. On this day, let us take a moment to appreciate all members of the law enforcement community across this Nation and their families by putting a blue light in your window or on your front porch. This is not just a sign of appreciation for law enforcement across this country, but a sign, a small symbol of unity for us all. We need that now in our Nation more than anything. Help us remember that we are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Most people don’t know, but I am a big James Brown fan and I really like the way he puts it in a not so well known song from the sixties about America. He says: America is the greatest country in the world. America is the greatest country in the world . . . Now Black and White they may fight, but when the enemy comes, we get together and we run ‘em out of sight. 
This is a Black man in the sixties with these positive words about our country. Mr. Speaker, I say this: That we take James Brown’s words, we take his advice, and we get together. The enemy is here. That enemy is hate. We get together and we run them out of sight. Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to observe a moment of silence, please, for two officers who were killed in Florida just today on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. These are two more officers killed today, just hours ago. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 12 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HOLDING ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another year. At the beginning of this new day, we are grateful as individuals and as a nation for all the blessings we have been given. We ask Your blessing upon the Members of this people’s House as they reconvene for this first session. May they anticipate the opportunities and difficulties that are before them, and before so many Americans, with steadfast determination to work together toward solutions that will benefit their countrymen. Grant that they be worthy of the responsibilities they have been given by their constituents and truly be the people You have called them to be. May Your Spirit, O God, be in all of our hearts and minds and encourage us to do the works of peace and justice now and always. May all that we do be done for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the 
last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WOMACK led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
REMEMBERING DR. BILLY BERT BAKER (Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay respects to an admired, respected, and visionary educator, and a genuinely terrific person, Dr. Billy Bert Baker, of Gilbert, Arkansas, who passed away on Friday, January 6, at the age of 84. My relationship with Dr. Baker goes back decades. He was a family friend. After spending 17 years as a faculty member and administrator at my alma mater, Arkansas Tech, in 1974, he became the first employee of North Arkansas College in Harrison, served the college for more than 27 years, was its founding president, and retired at the age of 68. Under his leadership, Northark achieved several firsts, one of the most noteworthy being the 1993 merger of Northark and Twin Lakes Technical College, the first consolidation of a community college and a technical college in Arkansas. Billy Bert was also instrumental in the creation of both Northwest Arkansas Community College in Bentonville and the ASU— Mountain Home campus. Dr. Baker’s own unofficial motto was to ‘‘help people grow, one at a time.’’ That is exactly what he spent his life doing. He touched the lives of thousands—made them better men and women—and his legacy continues to enrich the lives of people throughout northern and northwest Arkansas through the institutions of higher learning that he envisioned decades ago. Rest in peace, Dr. Baker. My deepest condolences are with Bonnie, your wife of 63 years; your two sons, daughter, grandchildren; and the entire Northark family in this time of great loss. 
CHINA SHOULD TAKE THEIR CRIMINAL ILLEGALS BACK OR LOSE VISAS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Qian Wu was held up at knifepoint and brutally assaulted. Her attacker, a Chinese citizen who was illegally in America, was captured and sent off to prison for the assault. He should have been deported as soon as he finished his sentence, but China would not take back the outlaw. So, under American law, the attacker could not be held indefinitely in our prison and was turned loose on American streets. As soon as he was released from prison, he tracked down Qian Wu and murdered her. Mr. Speaker, the law requires that a person who illegally enters the United States and is ordered deported must be repatriated to their native country. The lack of cooperation from countries that refuse or delay repatriation allows criminals like Qian Wu’s killer to remain in America and commit more crimes. My bill, the Timely Repatriation Act of 2017, restricts diplomatic visas to countries that deny the repatriation of criminal aliens deported from the United States. Countries like China must take back their lawfully deported criminal citizens or pay the price of losing diplomatic visas. And that is just the way it is. f 
FAKE NEWS INCLUDES CLIMATE CHANGE (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a good example of fake news appeared in Sunday’s New York Times. It is a column headlined, ‘‘As Trump Denies Climate Change, These Kids Die.’’ This may be a new high—or maybe a new low—for climate alarmists and their exaggerations. Two facts: first, most severe and persistent droughts occurred decades ago, not recently; and second, there is little connection between climate change and extreme weather, in general, according to numerous studies. Climate alarmists tend to ignore scientific evidence and encourage media hype, and, of course, the liberal media is all too willing to go along. Climate discussions should be based on good science, not politically correct science. 
GUANTANAMO BAY DETERS TERRORISTS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last month I was grateful that President Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law—legislation that will clearly prevent the closure of the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Sadly, this has not stopped the President from releasing murderous terrorists, which, by weakness, encourages more attacks against American families that we can anticipate in the future. Under President Obama, nearly 150 detainees have been released; and just last week, the President released four more hardened terrorists, creating a recruiting environment with a legacy of not being serious about murderous attacks in the future. The President should promote a legacy of peace, not more attacks. The administration’s own numbers reveal that as many as onethird of the terrorists from Guantanamo return to the battlefield to kill American families. In March, senior officials from the administration even testified that former prisoners from Guantanamo were responsible for American deaths. I appreciate that Presidentelect Donald Trump does not support releasing terrorists from Guantanamo Bay, and I look forward to working with him to keep Guantanamo open. He knows that imprisonment is a deterrent to protect American families. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. f 
U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 2334 (Mr. HOLDING asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, just before Christmas, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israel. I believe it goes almost without saying that Israel is our most trusted ally in the Middle East, which is why I find this so troubling, Mr. Speaker. The Obama administration had the power to veto the resolution and support one of our only allies in the region, but President Obama, less than a month from leaving office, dictated the United States would sit on the sidelines. Well, Mr. Speaker, I am committed to preserving our alliance with Israel and ensuring a lasting peace is found in the region—a position that has been expressed multiple times on the floor of this House by my colleagues—and I believe we can’t afford to sit on the sidelines anymore. Mr. Speaker, the United States supports Israel. The Obama administration is leaving behind a failed foreign policy legacy, but our alliance with Israel will endure. Former Senator Jesse Helms believed the United Nations required fundamental reform to address these kinds of problems. I believe this latest action by the Security Council underscores that need. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DENHAM ). Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 4:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 9 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1630 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of New York) at 4 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 309) to amend the Public Health Service Act to foster more effective implementation and coordination of clinical care for people with a complex metabolic or autoimmune disease, a disease resulting from insulin deficiency or insulin resistance, or complications caused by such a disease, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 309 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 309, the National Clinical Care Commission Act, introduced by Representative PETEOLSON and which was supported by over 229 cosponsors in the 114th Congress. H.R. 309 establishes a clinical care commission to evaluate and recommend solutions regarding better coordinating and leveraging of Federal programs related to complex metabolic or autoimmune disorders, such as diabetes. Metabolic disorders take a large toll on many Americans each year, and complications from these disorders can lead to catastrophic health outcomes. Currently, there are various programs across the Federal Government that touch on metabolic disorders—some focus on prevention and others focus on treatment—but there is a lack of coordination among these programs. Improving coordination of such efforts provides an opportunity to reduce costs while improving health outcomes. This legislation received broad support from the Energy and Commerce Committee, passing through a full committee markup by a voice vote during the 114th Congress. H.R. 309 provides no new spending and utilizes only existing funds at the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 309, sponsored by my Texas neighbor, Congressman PETE OLSON , and our other colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee, DAVID LOEBSACK of Iowa, the National Clinical Care Commission Act. This legislation aims to improve Federal efforts to treat and prevent metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and diseases resulting from insulin deficiency or insulin resistance. The most common metabolic disorder in the U.S. is diabetes, which affects more than 29 million Americans. Racial and ethnic minority communities suffer increased rates of this condition. 15.9 percent of American Indians and Alaskan Natives, 13.2 percent of nonHispanic Blacks, and 12.8 percent of Hispanics have diagnosed diabetes, compared to just 7.6 percent of nonHispanic Whites. Diabetes takes a huge toll on human health. It is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. Additionally, all too often, diabetes leads to avoidable complications such as blindness, limb amputation, and kidney failure. In addition to the effects on human health, diabetes care makes up a large percentage of U.S. healthcare expenditures. Currently, $1 of every $5 of healthcare costs is spent on caring for people with diabetes. The proportion of Medicare funding is even greater. Currently, $1 of every $3 of Medicare expenditures is spent caring for people with diabetes. That is why it is important to improve Federal efforts that prevent avoidable cases of diabetes and metabolic disorders and ensure all Americans have treatment and management of services necessary to successfully manage this and other of these conditions. I am glad to see this legislation move forward, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 309. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ). Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Denton, Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) for yielding me time to speak about my bill, H.R. 309, the National Clinical Care Commission Act, a bipartisan bill that received unanimous support in the last Congress and was cosponsored by over half of my House colleagues. It had this level of support because our Nation faces an epidemic. Diabetes or prediabetes affects over 100 million Americans. Nearly one in three of our neighbors is affected. This is in addition to all of the Americans whose diseases fall under complex metabolic, autoimmune, or insulinresistant diseases. When I first came to Congress in 2009, it was crystal clear that we had a big problem. The benefits of all the Federal research dollars going into these diseases were simply not making their way to patients. Researchers at the NIH, the CDC, the FDA, and even DOD weren’t sharing diabetes research. It was clear to me in 2009, and it is clear today in 2017, that we need a laserlike focus on improving patient care by pursuing a strong Federal focus on research. My bill accomplishes that goal by creating a national clinical care commission comprised of doctors who specialize in diabetes care for patients. This commission will have 3 years to strengthen their partnership between Federal stakeholders and health professionals, who will bring handson clinical experience to improve care. This is not a new, unending bureaucracy. After 3 years, this commission will sunset. In 3 years, it will be gone. We have already made a huge investment of taxpayer dollars into research. It is time for us to leverage that investment and translate that into meaningful prevention and effective treatment options. So today, I ask my colleagues to again help those who suffer from diabetes or other complex metabolic and autoimmune disorders by voting for H.R. 309. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I reserve the balance of my time in case someone shows up. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), a new member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1192, the National Diabetes Clinical Care Commission Act, which establishes within the Department of Health and Human Services the national diabetes clinical care commission. The commission will look into dissemination of information and resources to clinicians on best practices for delivering highquality care and how best to effectively deploy new and emerging treatments and technologies. As a pharmacist, I play an important role in diabetes care by screening patients who had a high risk for diabetes and educating patients to empower them to take better care of themselves. I believe all of my colleagues would agree that making government work to help evaluate and recommend solutions regarding diabetes is important. The American Diabetes Association reports that there are almost 30 million people living with this disease. With better coordination and leveraging of Federal programs that relate to clinical care for people with diabetes and chronic diseases and conditions caused by diabetes, we will begin to stem the tide of this awful disease. This legislation should be a priority for our country, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ) to the Energy and Commerce Committee. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers at this time. This is a good bill. It did pass at the end of last Congress. Maybe by passing at the beginning of this Congress, we will give the other body ample time to take it up this year. It is a good bill. It is worthy of our consideration again today. It provides no new spending. 
I urge passage of H.R. 309. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 309. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
IMPROVING ACCESS TO MATERNITY CARE ACT Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 315) to amend the Public Health Service Act to distribute maternity care health professionals to health professional shortage areas identified as in need of maternity care health services. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 315 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Access to Maternity Care Act’’. 
Section 332 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ‘‘(k)(1) The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall identify, based on the data collected under paragraph (3), maternity care health professional target areas that satisfy the criteria described in paragraph (2) for purposes of, in connection with receipt of assistance under this title, assigning to such identified areas maternity care health professionals who, without application of this subsection, would otherwise be eligible for such assistance. The Secretary shall distribute maternity care health professionals within health professional shortage areas using the maternity care health professional target areas so identified. ‘‘(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall establish criteria for maternity care health professional target areas that identify geographic areas within health professional shortage areas that have a shortage of maternity care health professionals. ‘‘(3) For purposes of this subsection, the Secretary shall collect and publish in the Federal Register data comparing the availability and need of maternity care health services in health professional shortage areas and in areas within such health professional shortage areas. ‘‘(4) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall seek input from relevant provider organizations, including medical societies, organizations representing medical facilities, and other organizations with expertise in maternity care. ‘‘(5) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘full scope maternity care health services’ includes during labor care, birthing, prenatal care, and postpartum care. ‘‘(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as— ‘‘(A) requiring the identification of a maternity care health professional target area in an area not otherwise already designated as a health professional shortage area; or ‘‘(B) affecting the types of health professionals, without application of this subsection, otherwise eligible for assistance, including a loan repayment or scholarship, pursuant to the application of this section.’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 315, the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act, which I introduced with Representative ESHOO . H.R. 315 increases data collection by the Department of Health and Human Services to help better place maternity care providers through the National Health Service Corps repayment program. Currently, maternity care providers participate in the National Health Service Corps through the primary care designation, but they are not always placed where they are needed the most. H.R. 315 will require increased data collection on maternity care providers who will then be placed in geographic areas within existing health professional shortage areas, again, where they are most needed. This legislation enjoyed broad support on the Energy and Commerce Committee, passing through the full committee markup by a voice vote in the 114th Congress. H.R. 315 provides no new spending, Mr. Speaker. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 315, the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act. This important legislation would require the Health Resources and Services Administration to better identify areas with increased need for maternity care services. This would help ensure the placement of maternity care providers within the National Health Service Corps in areas with the most need for their services. Improving access to maternity care providers in our most underserved communities will help reduce the poor health outcomes that can result when women don’t have access to quality, prenatal maternity services that they need. Those outcomes can include increased infant mortality, preterm births, low birth weight infants, and maternal mortality. To provide just one example of how limited access to quality maternity care service is affecting American communities is that while global maternal mortality rates have fallen by more than a third from 2000 to 2015, the maternal mortality rate in the United States has increased. In 2015, 25 women lost their lives during pregnancy or childbirth per 100,000 births in the U.S., compared to 23 women who did so in only 2000. It is clear that we must do more to reverse the troubling trend and other poor outcomes that result in limited access to maternity care providers. Congress must make it a priority to ensure our women have access to prenatal and maternity care services. I support H.R. 315. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), the chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and a fellow OB/GYN. b1645 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 315, the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act, sponsored by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), a fellow OB/GYN and chairman of the Health Caucus. One of the easiest ways to ensure a safer and healthier pregnancy experience for both mother and child is through adequate maternity care. Unfortunately, there are pockets across the United States where women do not have access to needed OB/GYN care, which puts both mothers and babies at risk should a complication arise. As an OB/GYN who spent 31 years in practice, I find it unacceptable that 1 million babies are born to mothers who did not receive adequate prenatal care. Without that proper care, babies born to these mothers are three times more likely to be born at a low birth weight and five times more likely to die than babies whose mothers did receive adequate maternity care. With a large number of OB/GYNs nearing retirement age and a female population expected to increase by 36 percent by 2050, there is no more important time than now to ensure adequate access to maternity care for all mothers, no matter where they live. A woman living in rural east Tennessee or rural Texas should have the same access to adequate maternity care as someone living in the city of Nashville, Memphis, Dallas, or wherever. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation that would require the Health Resources and Services Administration to designate maternity healthcare professional shortage areas and target maternity care resources where they are most needed, helping to ensure healthier pregnancies and healthier babies. It was my job as an OB/GYN to make sure that mothers and their children 
were healthy during and after pregnancy, and I feel very strongly about that duty now that I am here in Congress. While this bill will not solve the entire shortage crisis, I think this bill is a meaningful start. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 315, the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act. Our Nation is facing a critical shortage of maternity healthcare services and professionals. Many Americans in rural or medically underserved areas have little to no access to maternity care services, either due to geographical constraints or a shortage of healthcare providers. This bill would encourage physicians and other healthcare professionals to serve in rural and underserved communities by creating a maternity care designation in the National Health Service Corps. The National Health Service Corps provides up to $50,000 in student loan repayments for healthcare professionals who commit to providing care in health profession shortage areas for a minimum of 2 years. The program has already made great progress in increasing access and reducing provider shortages in dental care, mental health, and primary care. Maternity health professionals can and do already serve in the National Health Service Corps, but they are placed in the same manner as primary care providers. This bill would create a separate designation for maternity care providers, ensuring that maternity health needs are more efficiently addressed in underserved communities that need them the most. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 315, once again, is a bill that passed with overwhelming support in the last Congress. I hope that by taking it up early in this Congress, we will allow time for the other body to attend to this needed legislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 315. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 315. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
SPORTS MEDICINE LICENSURE CLARITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 302) to provide protections for certain sports medicine professionals who provide certain medical services in a secondary State. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 302 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—In the case of a covered sports medicine professional who has in effect medical professional liability insurance coverage and provides in a secondary State covered medical services that are within the scope of practice of such professional in the primary State to an athlete or an athletic team (or a staff member of such an athlete or athletic team) pursuant to an agreement described in subsection (b)(4) with respect to such athlete or athletic team— (1) such medical professional liability insurance coverage shall cover (subject to any related premium adjustments) such professional with respect to such covered medical services provided by the professional in the secondary State to such an individual or team as if such services were provided by such professional in the primary State to such an individual or team; and (2) to the extent such professional is licensed under the requirements of the primary State to provide such services to such an individual or team, the professional shall be treated as satisfying any licensure requirements of the secondary State to provide such services to such an individual or team. (b) DEFINITIONS .—In this Act, the following definitions apply: (1) ATHLETE .—The term ‘‘athlete’’ means— (A) an individual participating in a sporting event or activity for which the individual may be paid; (B) an individual participating in a sporting event or activity sponsored or sanctioned by a national governing body; or (C) an individual for whom a high school or institution of higher education provides a covered sports medicine professional. (2) ATHLETIC TEAM .—The term ‘‘athletic team’’ means a sports team— (A) composed of individuals who are paid to participate on the team; (B) composed of individuals who are participating in a sporting event or activity sponsored or sanctioned by a national governing body; or (C) for which a high school or an institution of higher education provides a covered sports medicine professional. (3) COVERED MEDICAL SERVICES .—The term ‘‘covered medical services’’ means general medical care, emergency medical care, athletic training, or physical therapy services. Such term does not include care provided by a covered sports medicine professional— (A) at a health care facility; or (B) while a health care provider licensed to practice in the secondary State is transporting the injured individual to a health care facility. (4) COVERED SPORTS MEDICINE PROFES SIONAL .—The term ‘‘covered sports medicine professional’’ means a physician, athletic trainer, or other health care professional who— (A) is licensed to practice in the primary State; (B) provides covered medical services, pursuant to a written agreement with an athlete, an athletic team, a national governing body, a high school, or an institution of higher education; and (C) prior to providing the covered medical services described in subparagraph (B), has disclosed the nature and extent of such services to the entity that provides the professional with liability insurance in the primary State.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the RECORD  on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 302, the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act of 2017, introduced by my colleague on the Health Subcommittee, BRETT GUTHRIE . The bill is identical to H.R. 921 from the last Congress, which passed by a voice vote in the House in September. Team physicians and other licensed sports medicine professionals often travel with their athletes to away 
games and other sanctioned sporting events outside of their home State. When providing care to an injured player during the game or in the locker room afterwards, they are often doing so at great personal and professional risk. If they are sued, their home State license could be in jeopardy and their malpractice insurance may not cover them. This commonsense bill would provide needed clarity. First, by stating that their liability insurance shall cover them outside of their home State for limited services within the scope of their practice, subject to any related premium adjustments. Second, to the extent that the healthcare professional is licensed under the requirements of their home State to provide certain services to an athlete or to a team, they shall be treated as satisfying corresponding licensing requirements of the secondary State in these narrowly defined instances. H.R. 302 is supported by a wide range of professional medical associations as well as amateur and professional sports organizations. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 302, the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act. This bill solves a problem unique to sports medicine professionals who are required to travel to different States with their teams. Medical licensure is regulated on a StatebyState basis and does not work across State lines. Thus, often when a sports medicine provider travels with a team to another State, they are technically practicing without a license, and their medical liability insurance is rendered null. This is not something that is not important. This weekend, the Houston Texans are proud to be in the playoffs. They are going to New England, and we would like to have our Texas doctors making sure our players are safe. This bill would ensure that sports medicine professionals who contract with a team are covered by their medical liability insurance while traveling with their team. It also provides that any incidents of medical malpractice occurring under the care of a traveling team sports medicine professional must be treated as if it occurred in the professional’s primary State of practice, regardless of where the game took place. Providers still would not be allowed to practice beyond the scope of their licenses, and they may only treat athletes on the field. By working with the Energy and Commerce Committee and stakeholders last Congress, the sponsors of this bill have created a sensible solution to this distinct problem. I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill. I thank Mr. G UTHRIE from Kentucky and Mr. RICHMOND from Louisiana for their excellent work. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ). Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Tonight, millions of Americans, including myself, will tune in to the College Football Playoff National Championship between the University of Alabama and Clemson University. As with any college or professional competition, both teams will have healthcare practitioners traveling with them to the game. Unfortunately, many States do not provide legal protection for sports medicine practitioners who travel with these athletes since they are not licensed to practice medicine in the secondary State. The Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act, which I introduced with Mr. RICHMOND of Louisiana, would ensure that sports medicine professionals can provide highquality and timely health care to athletes without having to worry about potential liability when traveling across State lines with their teams. The nature of sports medicine professionals’ jobs require them to frequently travel between States so that athletes can receive proper care the moment they are injured. However, providers are at great personal and professional risk because medical liability insurance does not cover costs for lawsuits related to care provided in States in which they are not licensed. It is not a reasonable solution to require practitioners to become licensed in every State where their teams will play during a given season. This came to my attention, and I talked to a friend of mine who is an emergency room physician in Auburn, Alabama. He travels with Auburn University. At the time, a few years ago, they were playing in what was then the BCS game. So here is a friend of mine, a physician, traveling with Auburn to the Rose Bowl in California. Fortunately, it didn’t happen, but what if he had to take care of Cam Newton, who was the quarterback at the time? First of all, the players want physicians that know them taking care of them, but think of the liability because he was in California when he is licensed to practice in Alabama and if something had gone wrong to as valuable an athlete as Cam Newton. It is important that we do this. It is just pure common sense. It is very bipartisan. My friend Mr. RICHMOND and I have worked on this together. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense, bipartisan bill to provide clarity for sports professionals performing their duties when caring for athletes. We passed this bill quickly last session. We are going to do it quickly again this Congress and give time for the other body to address this. I would personally like to thank my longtime legislative director, who just took another job. She worked tirelessly on this. As simple and as commonsense as this bill is, there are a lot of details when you are trying to define details about going across jurisdictions and State lines. I wish Megan Jackson well in her new endeavor. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 302, the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act, and what it means for sports medicine professionals looking to provide comprehensive services to those in need. Congressman GUTHRIE ’s legislation, which I have cosponsored, would overhaul the current system that leaves sports medicine professionals and athletic trainers vulnerable to liability issues. Athletic trainers and other sports medicine professionals can travel with a team to another State, and by providing care, they are opening themselves up to repercussions. These professionals provide preventive care as well as medical care and advice to athletes in the event of an injury. Currently, insurance companies don’t fully cover those professionals who travel with their team or organization to a secondary State. This legislation extends liability insurance coverage to those medical professionals to allow them to safely and fully carry out their responsibilities. They shouldn’t have to decide if they can or can’t provide care to the same people simply because they happen to be in a different location for a short period of time as part of their job. Within this bill, we can ensure that these professionals with the knowledge and experience to administer care will have the protections needed to safely and properly fulfill their duties. I applaud the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ) for his work on this issue and the work of the Energy and Commerce Committee to address these reforms to the sports medicine field, and I urge passage of this important legislation. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1700 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 302 by this body, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 302. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 304, the Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act, introduced by the gentlemen from North Carolina, Mr. HUDSON and Mr. BUTTERFIELD . H.R. 304 would update the Drug Enforcement Administration registration process for emergency medical services agencies with multiple locations, clarifying recordkeeping requirements related to the transportation and storage of controlled substances in the process. Further, the bill would ensure that paramedics and other EMS professionals are able to continue to administer pain and antiseizure medications in emergency situations pursuant to standing or verbal orders when certain conditions are met. This commonsense measure is supported by over a dozen EMS and trauma care organizations. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 304, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 304, the Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act of 2017. Ensuring that we have access to the right medicine at the right time is critically important in emergency situations. While controlled substances have abuse and diversion potential, they also have lifesaving potential. In fact, they are very often used by emergency medical services—EMS—providers in situations where every minute counts. Currently, these providers must often administer controlled substances during emergencies using a standing order. However, it is unclear whether or not this is permissible under current law. To help clarify the current law, H.R. 304 would amend the Controlled Substances Act to make clear that EMS personnel can, in fact, administer controlled substances in emergency situations under a standing order from an EMS medical director. This bill helps guarantee that patients will have timely access to drugs they need during an emergency. It will also streamline the DEA’s emergency medical services registration process by allowing a single registration for a State EMS agency as opposed to a separate registration for each EMS agency location. To help safeguard against diversion, the bill will hold registered EMS agencies responsible for receiving, storing, and tracking all controlled substances. This bill passed the Energy and Commerce Committee and the House floor last Congress, and it incorporates important feedback from a wide range of stakeholders. I believe our efforts in this important bill will ensure that EMS professionals have the flexibility that they need to respond during emergencies, while preserving the DEA’s ability to enforce controlled substances laws and regulations. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of H.R. 304. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for this important piece of legislation, H.R. 304, the Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act. This is a bipartisan bill. It was introduced by two of our colleagues from North Carolina, Representatives HUDSON and B UTTERFIELD . It previously passed the House by voice vote, no objection, back in November; but, unfortunately, it was not taken up by the Senate before the last Congress adjourned, meaning we have to be here today to restart this process. This, along with three other Energy and Commerce bills that we are considering today, shows that the Energy and Commerce Committee is picking right up where we left off, in a bipartisan way, to produce quality legislation that will improve the public health. Now, H.R. 304 is really an important bill because it enables our Nation’s emergency medical services professionals to continue to provide quality emergency care by recognizing the unique nature of their practice. Specifically, as you may have heard, the bill clarifies that paramedics and other EMS professionals can administer certain pain and antiseizure medications in emergency situations pursuant to standing or verbal orders. In other words, the doctor has said to the EMS person, you can do these things in emergencies. Now, think about this. You are in a car wreck. The EMT shows up in the ambulance. They can’t communicate with anybody because they are down in a valley or somewhere where they don’t have communication. Without this legislation, it is uncertain now, because of this ruling out of the administration, whether or not they can give you antiseizure medication or pain relief medication until they can get in contact. This is not what any of us wants, so this legislation fixes that. During this process, when this decision was made a while back, I heard from Dr. Paul Rostykus, an emergency physician in Jackson County, Oregon. He said that this is really critical to saving lives and reducing suffering, particularly in our remote and rural areas where these emergency technicians, EMTs, may struggle to call in emergencies and it can take much longer for patients to reach the nearest doctor. I just implore you to talk to anybody that is running around the ambulances, and they will tell you this is really, really important for patients. I had an ambulance driver tell me— an EMT tell me it is important for them because sometimes in an accident, somebody is injured and they are kind of out of control and have a seizure. Now, I am not a doctor. We actually have one here who can tell us 
more. But they then are able to administer certain medications that will calm the patient, prevent them from hurting themselves or hurting the EMT. So I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 304 as well as the other bipartisan Energy and Commerce bills that are on the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to pass these important bills. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Congressman HUDSON and Congressman BUTTERFIELD , both great members of our committee on this very bipartisan bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 304, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 304. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS ) and the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 353, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I first thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman SMITH, for his continued leadership on the Science Committee. H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, prioritizes improving weather forecasting for the protection of lives and property at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This bill does so by focusing research and computing resources on improved weather forecasting, quantitative observing data planning, next generation modeling, and an emphasis on researchto operations technology transfer. As a Representative from Oklahoma, I understand the need for accurate and timely weather predictions firsthand. Every year, the loss of life from deadly tornadoes in my home State is a stark reminder that we can do better to predict severe weather events and provide longer lead times to protect Americans in harm’s way. I am proud that the legislation has a dedicated Tornado Warning Improvement Program. The goal of this program is to reduce the loss of life from tornadoes by advancing the understanding of fundamental meteorological science allowing detection and notifications that are more accurate, effective, and timely. Constituents in my home State will benefit greatly from longer tornado warning lead times, which will save lives and better protect property. H.R. 353 makes clear that NOAA will prioritize weather research and protect lives and property through a focused, affordable, attainable, forwardlooking research plan at the agency’s Research Office. The bill also encourages innovations and new technology capacities by creating a joint technology transfer fund in NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. This transfer is 
essential to get new forecasting, models, and technologies out of the research side of NOAA and into our operational forecast to better protect our country. The bill directs NOAA to develop plans to restore our country’s leadership in weather forecasting. It is no secret that many people in our weather community are distraught that our forecasting capacities have deteriorated in recent years. While other countries are making great strides in weather advancements, Americans are paying the price for diminished leadership with their lives and their wallets. This is yet another reminder that we can do better. This legislation directs NOAA to actively consider new commercial data and private sector solutions to further enhance our weather forecasting capacities. The bill also includes a pilot project, which will provide NOAA a clear and credible demonstration of the valuable data from commercial technologies available today. H.R. 353 is the result of 4 years of work to craft a meaningful package that will create new and real improvements to our country’s weather forecasting systems. The time has come for Americans to have the most accurate and timely weather predictions. They deserve nothing less. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 353, the ‘‘Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017.’’ I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forego action on the bill. The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 353 at this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, LAMAR SMITH, Chairman. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act. This bill, introduced by my colleague, Mr. LUCAS , is a product of hard work and negotiation over the past two Congresses. In addition to Mr. LUCAS , I thank Chairman SMITH and also Environment Subcommittee chair, Mr. BRIDENSTINE , and former chair, Mr. CHRIS STEWART , who were great partners in this process. The language before us today is a result of a truly bipartisan and bicameral effort. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible for many important tasks at the cutting edge of science and public service, and weather forecasting is one of the tasks most critical to our country. In the northwest Oregon communities I represent, my constituents rely on timely weather forecasts to decide when to harvest their crops, when to go to sea to fish, how to navigate the roads safely when there is freezing rain or snow, and to prepare for possible flood conditions. The National Weather Service provides excellent forecasting products to support our economy, but with the increasing frequency of severe weather events, there can be and should be improvements in our forecasting capabilities and delivery. For example, forecasts can be more precise regarding what will happen and when. Improved forecasts can provide more lead time to allow communities to prepare, especially in severe weather events. Forecast information should also be communicated more effectively to the public and those in harm’s way to reduce the loss of life and property. This bill is designed to address those important goals. The bill connects the research side of NOAA, the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, more effectively to the forecasting needs of the National Weather Service. This research tooperations pipeline is essential for the continued improvement of our weather forecasting enterprise. b1715 The bill contains several provisions that will improve interactions and information sharing between NOAA’s researchers and the National Weather Service. It also improves communications between NOAA and the broader research and private weather communities. The bill also establishes interagency coordination, through the Office of Science and Technology Policy, across multiple agencies outside of NOAA that share responsibilities for weather research and forecast communications. This is essential as we face budget constraints, and it will help speed the adoption of best tools and practices across the various agencies. H.R. 353 also recognizes that even the best forecasts will not serve the public’s needs unless there are effective communications systems. The bill directs NOAA to do more research, listen to experts, and improve its risk communications techniques. The bill also reestablishes a program that allows NOAA to give awards to people who save the lives of others through NOAA’s Weather Radio All Hazards program. The bill also formally establishes the pilot program currently operating at NOAA to engage in contracts with the commercial sector for weather forecasting data. Additionally, the bill requires NOAA to examine the benefits and costs of different sensors by running simulations of different configurations of instruments and datasets on forecasting accuracy. It is important that these requirements are not too prescriptive so that NOAA can use the most efficient, accurate, and costeffective model for this situation. This legislation will produce advances in weather forecasting and capabilities that will result in better development of forecast innovations and technology. Ultimately, this will save American lives and property. I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle for their input and support. Also, I would like to thank the hardworking committee staff on both sides of the aisle for their efforts to continue negotiations to move this bill forward. I ask my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. BRIDENSTINE ), my colleague 
who has worked very diligently on this effort for a number of years. Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Speaker, every year that I have had the honor to serve Oklahoma’s First Congressional District, I have also faced the unfortunate reality that I will lose constituents to tornadoes, as will many of us who represent constituents in Oklahoma. This terrible fact has motivated me and others from our delegation to work hard for policies that will save lives and property and move us to a day where we have zero deaths from tornadoes or other extreme weather events. I would like to thank Chairman SMITH, Vice Chairman L UCAS , and Environment Subcommittee Ranking Member BONAMICI for their tireless efforts to see this bipartisan legislation move forward. The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 is the product of extensive negotiations between the Environment Subcommittee, which I chair, and the Senate Commerce Committee, and I am proud of the bipartisan and bicameral agreement that this bill represents. H.R. 353 directs the NOAA Administrator to prioritize activities that will save lives and protect property. Again, this is critically important to my State, which is in the heart of tornado alley. This legislation will help NOAA develop more accurate and timely warnings for hurricanes, tornadoes, and other highimpact weather events. It calls on NOAA to develop a plan to maintain forecasting capabilities that are second to none in the world, primarily because, by some metrics, we lag behind our counterparts in Europe, the U.K. and Canada. The bill encourages better cooperation across NOAA offices and enhances collaboration with universities, such as the University of Oklahoma, which is a national leader in weather research. It will also ensure that innovative methods and technologies, such as warn on forecast, currently being developed at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, are rapidly deployed in operational status so that the American people can benefit. Further, beyond improvements to shortterm forecasts of extreme events, the bill directs NOAA to improve our understanding of seasonal forecasts, which can be immensely useful to industries such as agriculture. Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased this bill finally authorizes a commercial weather data pilot program. H.R. 353 authorizes $24 million over the next 4 years for a pilot program for NOAA to purchase commercial spacebased weather data and test it against NOAA’s proprietary data. This can improve forecasts and save the Federal Government money. This will allow NOAA to continue to expand upon the two pilot contracts it awarded in September of last year. Mr. Speaker, this has the potential to be a paradigmshifting provision. Commercial weather data can augment the data we receive from systems such as JPSS and GOES, while also serving as a mitigation strategy in the event we experience a gap in weather data from these systems. More data from innovative sources has a real potential to improve our forecasting capabilities. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Speaker, I believe there will come a time when there will be zero deaths from tornadoes. I think this bill will help us implement the necessary steps to get there. I once again thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for all their very hard work to get this done, and I encourage our counterparts in the Senate to move this legislation to the President’s desk quickly. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) who has guided the Science, Space, and Technology Committee ever so carefully for a number of years. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma and the vice chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for yielding, and I thank both him and Mr. BRIDENSTINE , another gentleman from Oklahoma and a member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, for taking the initiative and introducing this legislation. H.R. 353, Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, will transform our Nation’s weathergathering efforts and help save lives and property. Severe weather routinely affects large portions of the United States. Nearly every year, we witness the devastating effects of tornadoes across our country. The deaths and the damage from these events underscore the need for a worldclass weather prediction system. H.R. 353 improves weather observation systems by the use of observing system simulation experiments and next generation computing and modeling capabilities. This bill strengthens the underlying atmospheric science, while advancing innovative technology and reforming operations to provide better weather data, models, and forecasts. It prompts NOAA to actively employ new commercial data and solutions through a multiyear commercial weather data pilot program. Further, it directs NOAA to consider commercial data options rather than rely on slow, costly, and continually delayed governmentowned satellites. For far too long, our government has relied on these massive, multibillion dollar government satellites. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee has jurisdiction over NOAA’s satellite office and has conducted ongoing oversight of the agency’s satellite program. Our conclusion is that it is in real need of reform. Over the years, events at NOAA have revealed mismanagement, cost overruns, and delays of its weather satellites. This detracts from our ability to accurately predict our weather, which unnecessarily endangers Americans. This bill will right the ship and allow NOAA the flexibility to buy new, affordable, and potentially better sources of data from the private sector, which has the power to make real improvements to our weather forecasting capabilities. It also creates a muchneeded technology transfer fund in NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research to help push technologies developed through NOAA’s weather research into operation. This will ensure that the technologies that are developed are effectively employed and do not idle on the lab bench. Again, I thank Mr. LUCAS and Mr. BRIDENSTINE for their initiative on this issue. Americans from coast to coast will now be better prepared for severe weather with the passage of this bill. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I wish to take a moment to thank the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) for all of her efforts to bring us to this point. We still have a ways to go ultimately, but great strides have been made. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. BRIDENSTINE ) for his input and efforts and, of course, again, the chairman of the full Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Mr. SMITH of Texas, for helping in that critical role of being the catalyst for all of this. From the perspective of a farmer, some will say: What does this really mean? But when it comes to trying to gauge how to plant your crops, how to harvest your crops, whether you are a truck driver driving up and down the highways and biways of America, a citizen moving around the country, someone along the coast, or, as Ms. BONAMICI pointed out, a fisherman, this information will make your life more efficient, it will make your life safer, and it will enhance the productive capacity of this country. This is one of those investments that we will all gain from. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017. 
This bill is the culmination of more than four years of compromise and negotiation, and demonstrates that the issues of weather and climate can be addressed in a bipartisan way. In that regard, I want to recognize the efforts of JIMBRIDENSTINE and S UZANNE  BONAMICI , as well as the bill’s sponsor, F RANK  LUCAS . Their leadership and commitment has really driven this process forward. Mr. Speaker, weather affects all of us everyday. It is a constant presence in our lives. Tropical storms batter homes and disrupt lives from my home state of Texas all the way to Maine. States like Oklahoma, Illinois, and again Texas are some of the most tornado prone areas in the entire world. Sadly, turning on the television to see a part of our country devastated by tornados, or hurricanes, or other severe weather incidents, has become a far too familiar occurrence. To help Americans avoid and cope with these potentially devastating events, we need to have the very best weather forecasting and warning capabilities. The National Weather Service and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research at NOAA play a central role in protecting the lives and property of every American. The bill before us today will help accelerate innovation, and turn cuttingedge weather research into essential weather forecasting tools and products; tools which forecasters can then use to protect American lives. The legislation removes barriers that exist between the weather research community, our nation’s forecasters, and the privatesector weather enterprise. Improving collaboration and cooperation within NOAA, and also between the agency and the broader weather community, will impact the accuracy and timing of our weather predictions. These improvements will ultimately save lives and make our communities safer. Strengthening our resilience to severe weather events is both vital and necessary to strengthen our nation’s economic security. H.R. 353 will advance our weather forecasting capabilities and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 353. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 6:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 5 o’clock and 26 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. DONOVAN ) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day to recognize and support our many men and women bravely serving and protecting their communities all across Minnesota and our country. Law enforcement officers are heroes. They put their lives on the line to keep our neighborhoods, homes, businesses, and schools safe and secure, as was evidenced by the tragedy that took place in Orlando. We owe them so much for the many risks and difficult decisions they make every single day. It is important that we don’t take their service for granted. Our communities are better, thanks to their unwavering commitment. That is why recognitions like today or National Night Out in August, where we promote police community partnerships through neighborhood block parties and cookouts with officers, are so critically important in strengthening the bond between community and law enforcement. Our men and women in uniform, as well as their families and loved ones, make tremendous sacrifices for the safety and security of their neighbors. We thank them and recognize them for their daily service. 
HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS KILLED IN ORLANDO (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of Master Sergeant Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department and Deputy Norm Lewis of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. As the former Orlando police chief, I had the honor of knowing both Sergeant Clayton and Deputy Lewis. Sergeant Clayton was violently murdered while responding to a call this morning. Deputy Lewis was killed while responding to a scene during the search for the suspect. As we recognize Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, we mourn the deaths of these two public servants. Sergeant Clayton was a fine officer, wife, and mother. She was 42 years young, and had just celebrated her first anniversary with her husband. Deputy Lewis was deeply admired by all of his colleagues. He loved helping people, and it showed in his work. He was just 35. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask all Members to join me in observing a moment of silence to honor and remember these heroes during this difficult time. f 
COMMEMORATING NAT HENTOFF (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the late Nat Hentoff, a man who constantly defied expectations. He died this weekend on January 7. Nat defined himself as a ‘‘Jewish, atheist, civil libertarian, leftwing pro lifer.’’ A writer for the Village Voice and brilliant jazz critic, he joined forces with constituents across political, ideological, and religious spectrums if he believed he shared common ground with them. He was not afraid to alienate his fellow liberals by agreeing with prolife heretics, as he once jokingly called them, nor was he afraid to speak to crowds of Christian prolifers, even when many of them said being atheist and prolife were mutually exclusive. Rather than worry about their judgment, he cared too much about fairness and equality to remain silent. He was more concerned with expressing what he believed to be true: that the unborn have great potential and that, with their own unique genetic code, they are human persons with as much a right to life as any of us. I commend Nat Hentoff for his courage and intellectual integrity. It is not easy in our culture to swim upstream. It takes a certain spirit, grit, and determination. These are characteristics Nat Hentoff possessed in abundance. May he rest in peace and may his family be consoled. 
b1915 NECESSARY STEPS TO RESTORE OUR DEMOCRACY (Mr. KHANNA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I am the son of immigrants, born in Philadelphia as the Nation celebrated our bicentennial. I ran for Congress because we have lost sight of our founding ideals. In Federalist 10, James Madison warned that factions, with their own special interests, may undermine the public good. Today, Congress is crippled by these factions: powerful PACs and lobbyists. This must change. I am proud to be one of six Members who refuse all contributions from PACs, and we need a bipartisan caucus to eradicate their influence. We also cannot let congressional seats become feudal estates. The turnover rate here in the people’s House is less than European monarchies. Congress desperately needs a 12year term limit like there is in the California legislature. Mr. Speaker, banning PAC money and instituting term limits are necessary steps to restore our democracy. f 
RECOGNIZING SANDRA MYERS (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Sandra Myers of Laurel Springs, North Carolina. This remarkable and talented woman is retiring after spending her entire 40year career with the Social Security Administration. Since the age of 18, Sandra has worked in the Wilkesboro field office where she started in an entrylevel position and currently serves as branch manager. My district staff and I have had the pleasure of working with her for many years now, and we have always found her to be a kind, caring person who is dedicated to serving others. Sandra and her husband, John, are nearly lifelong members of their church. Upon her retirement, she plans to continue to assist the community by helping elderly members at her church complete errands, remain active, and attend services. Sandra Myers is a perfect example of servant leadership, as well as the incredible work ethic that so many of my constituents in the Fifth District share. Alleghany County is fortunate to call this hardworking citizen one of its own. 
NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, today is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and I think it is very appropriate in this body to stand up and show that appreciation, especially in these confused times where signals come out of this place that don’t show appreciation but, instead, depict our law enforcement in very unflattering terms. To our friends in law enforcement, we want you to know that the vast majority of us believe in what you do and that we value you and what you do every day out there to keep us safe, to keep us secure in our homes and our communities. We also honor those—too many—whom we have lost tragically in the line of duty. I know their families pray every night that they will return home safely. Too often, just in 2016, many of these families’ worst fears were realized, as 135 fathers, sons, mothers, and 
daughters never returned home from the line of duty. In my home State of California, 11 officers lost, one even from my own district, Deputy Jack Hopkins of the Modoc County Sheriff’s Department. We recognize him, and we recognize all the brave men and women around this country who sacrifice, who stand as a thin blue line between us and a lot of mayhem. We are truly grateful and want to take time this day to recognize what you do for us. God bless you all. Amen. 
REAL LEADERSHIP TACKLES ISSUES (Mr. RICHMOND asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend an 18yearold school student who expressed his life experiences, and he did it in the form of art protected by the First Amendment to our Constitution. But what I also want to do is make sure that we, as Members of Congress, don’t use our bully pulpit in this very prestigious and most elite body in the United States to condemn the actions of an 18yearold who is only expressing what he sees on a daily basis. What real leadership is is to talk to that young man and ask him why, in his community, this is his perception; ask him why he fears the police; and ask him why, in his neighborhood, they fear the police. We, as Members of Congress, understand the sacrifice of law enforcement and the fact that they put their lives on the line every day, and we honor them. But when there is a question on any segment of our society that they don’t get equal justice, equal protection of the laws, and that the Pledge of Allegiance rings hollow when you say ‘‘and justice for all,’’ what real leadership does is tackle that issue as opposed to jumping on an 18yearold high school student. 
COMMENDING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day to commend the law enforcement officers throughout our Nation who answer the call to serve their communities. Law enforcement officers face increasingly difficult circumstances while working to serve and protect the public. It is a dangerous job, and often it is a thankless job. Just last week, Pennsylvania mourned the loss of a 23yearold Pennsylvania State Police trooper who was shot and killed while investigating a domestic incident. Our officers put on their uniforms each day knowing that they can be in harm’s way at any moment. They answer the calls in times of distress, they follow the rules, and they wear the badge proudly. We must remember that our officers are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and husbands and wives. They are human, and they arguably have one of the most difficult jobs in America. So today, and each day, let’s honor our brothers and sisters in blue. Let’s thank them for the important work they do to keep us all safe. f 
WE SHOULD BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, the 115th Congress has a unique opportunity to clean the swamp, especially of Members who were convicted of committing felonies while serving in office and drawing a retirement check from the taxpayers. I reintroduced the Trust Restored to the United States Taxpayer Act, which eliminates the taxpayerfunded portion of congressional pensions for Members who were convicted of a felony while serving. I applaud the 10 fellow Members of the House who cosponsored TRUST, and, in doing so, demonstrated they were willing to hold themselves accountable to their employers, the American taxpayers. We are willing to hold ourselves to the same standards we hold those who serve in our military and elsewhere. If Members of Congress are serious about cleaning up Washington and are truly accountable for their actions then supporting this bill is common sense. If we break the law and break the trust of the people who have placed us in power as their representatives then we should be willing to forfeit the taxpayerfunded portion of our retirement. We are not above the law. If anything, we should be held to a higher standard. I encourage my colleagues to support this. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to have this opportunity to stand on the House floor and to anchor the Congressional Black Caucus’ Special Order hour, where today we want to discuss some of the issues and challenges confronting this country that we hope this newly constituted Congress will be prepared to take up as we move into the 115th Congress. The first and most glaring issue confronting the Congressional Black Caucus is the nomination and confirmation of JEFF SESSIONS to be the Attorney General of the United States. The members of this caucus, since its inception, have fought for equality and justice, and we do it because it is the right thing to do, and that is how we were raised. JEFF SESSIONS ’ record is atrocious when it comes to equal rights, equal protection, justice for all, and voting rights. At worst, he was a coconspirator in the promotion of segregation and discrimination. At best, he lacked the courage and motivation to fight for equality, equal protection, and justice. In the words of Maya Angelou: ‘‘When someone shows you who they are believe them. . . .’’ Presidentelect Trump has shown us time and time again exactly who he is through his words and his actions. His Cabinet nominations offer further evidence of who he is and what he values. Each of these individuals have shown us who they are as well. Mr. Speaker, tonight you will hear from many passionate, educated, experienced freedom fighters from our communities, and they will each address their concerns with the nominations coming from the Presidentelect. We do it out of an obligation to continue to fight for the least of those, those who cannot hire a lobbyist, those who are struggling to make ends meet, those who wake up every day trying to figure out how to put clothes on their kids’ back, food on the table, a house, a roof over their head, and to continue to fight for the American Dream, opportunity for their children. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
IMPACT OF CABINET NOMINATIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome you to tonight’s Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour that will examine the negative impact of Presidentelect Trump’s nominations for the position of U.S. Attorney General, Secretary of Education, and Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
Let’s be honest here, the 2016 Presidential election showed us both the worst and the best of American politics. The most disturbing development of the election season, of course, was the Presidentelect’s campaign that was an ‘‘us versus them’’ type of campaign that really divided the Nation. It was really sad for people to see that on display. On November 9, after winning the Presidency, the Presidentelect tweeted: ‘‘Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before.’’ But will he keep his promise of doing all that he can to repair our divided nation? So far he has been very disappointing. And when you look at the nominations of Senator SESSIONS , Betsy DeVos, and TOMPRICE to key positions in his administration, it seems like he has forgotten, that he has forgotten and ignored our Nation’s dark history of oppression, particularly to the African American community. b1930 The Presidentelect’s nominees represent everything that the Congressional Black Caucus has vehemently fought against. As a caucus, we fought to ensure that the African American community is empowered with the tools it needs to achieve the American Dream. Mr. Trump’s Cabinet nominations are set to push the dream back so far out of reach for millions and millions of Americans. Mr. Speaker, we have a list of Members that would like to speak tonight. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ), the dean of the United States House of Representatives. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana (Mr. VEASEY ) for opening up this part of our Special Order for which the Congressional Black Caucus has come together to more critically examine the nomination of Senator JEFFSESSIONS . As the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, I led a joint statement in November that was signed by every Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee opposing Senator SESSIONS ’ nomination for United States Attorney General. The Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, charged with the administration of the criminal justice system and the enforcement of our civil rights. Senator SESSIONS is clearly unsuitable to lead the Department of Justice. In 1986 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, witnesses said that Mr. SESSIONS had referred to the NAACP, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and other civil rights groups, as both unAmerican and communist inspired. One prosecutor in the Alabama United States Attorney’s Office testified that Mr. SESSIONS referred to him as ‘‘boy’’ and counseled him to be careful of what you say to White folks. His appointment to the Federal branch was opposed by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and other organizations. Senator SESSIONS has criticized the section 5 preclearance provisions in the Voting Rights Act, which I and many others have been fighting to restore since the 2013 Supreme Court Shelby County v. Holder decision. In the 114th Congress, Senator SESSIONS opposed bipartisan criminal justice reform efforts. He has also opposed the reauthorization of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act and nearly every immigration reform bill that has come before the Senate. A vote to confirm JEFFSESSIONS as Attorney General is a vote against freedom and equality. So I join with many of my colleagues today in urging the Senate to oppose his nomination, and I thank my colleague for yielding to me. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CONYERS very much for his words as the dean of the House. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE  WATERS ). Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage opposition to the nomination of JEFF SESSIONS to the Attorney General’s Office by this Presidentelect. We have been asked and we are constantly asked: Are you saying he is a racist? He defined himself. He defined himself long ago when he was denied a Federal judgeship in 1986 after having been appointed by Ronald Reagan. He was denied because his colleagues said they heard him use the Nword. Also, it was very well documented that after two of the members of the KKK killed an African American man, he said: Oh, I thought the KKK was okay until I learned they smoked marijuana. This is the same man that said, again, that the NAACP and the SCLC were unAmerican, that they were communist inspired, and it goes on and on and on. And it is not whether or not we are calling him or we think of him as a racist; he defined himself in that manner. He was denied the appointment to the Federal judgeship, including by Republicans who voted against him. So here we have a man who is going to be considered for the Attorney General’s Office where we have the Civil Rights Division. Should we be worried about that? You bet your bottom dollar we should be worried about that. Not only has he defined himself as a racist, but this is a throwback. This is a man who is a setback. This is a man who does not agree with his colleagues on criminal justice reform. This is a man who loves mandatory minimum sentences. This is a man who does not want the Justice Department to work with local police departments who are in trouble, like what happened in Ferguson. This is a man who is against voting rights. This is a man who has shown himself to be against women. This is a man who does not support the LGBT community. Why would we want him to have this very important, prestigious position as the Attorney General overseeing civil rights? I don’t think so. I advise everybody who is listening and all of our colleagues to support him not being appointed to that position and to get the word over to the Senators that they should not support him, they should not vote for him. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ). Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON ), the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. VEASEY for helping organize this Special Order on a topic that is of great concern to me and many of my constituents. The Attorney General, as we know, serves as the United States’ chief law enforcement official. He or she does not serve certain States, certain classes of people, nor is their service limited to a particular party. The Attorney General is there to serve all of us. With that in mind, I stand here on the floor of the House concerned with Senator SESSIONS ’ nomination to become the next Attorney General. Based on his record, there are a number of reasons why I believe that Senator SESSIONS is unfit to lead the Department of Justice. First, at his 1986 confirmation hearing to serve as a Federal judge for the Southern District of Alabama, it was revealed that Senator SESSIONS had called the NAACP and the ACLU un American and communist inspired. I am a life member of the NAACP and a participating member in the ACLU. Neither one of those organizations are unAmerican or communist inspired. A Department of Justice attorney also testified that Sessions said he believed that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Operation PUSH, and the NAACP taught anti American values. Well, if being free, if being able to exercise your right to vote, being able to not determine one’s color as a condition for participation, then I am not certain what Mr. SESSIONS was talking about; but I do know that he has called a Black attorney ‘‘boy,’’ and he also talked about a White civil rights attorney as a ‘‘race traitor.’’ Also, what I am more concerned about is, in the aftermath of the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, he opposed taking down the Confederate battle flag. Now, if there is one symbol that we all understand that represents hate, it is the confederate 
battle flag. I am concerned that Senator SESSIONS continued to try to defend that symbol. I can’t imagine someone being the Attorney General having that kind of attitude and that operation. Mr. Speaker, I join the chorus of other members of the Congressional Black Caucus who raise their voice in opposition to what would be a travesty to the Department of Justice if Senator JEFFSESSIONS is confirmed. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON ) for his timely comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), my fellow Texan from Houston. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. VEASEY for his leadership. Let also thank the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. RICHMOND , for his leadership. Before I start, let me offer my appreciation to law enforcement officers across America—this is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day—and join my colleague, VALDEMINGS , particularly acknowledging the sadness in Orlando today in the loss of two law enforcement officers in the line of duty. I rise today for not a personal statement or a statement that has to do with personality. As the President elect said of Mr. SESSIONS , he is a fine and decent fellow. I have no interest in determining whether that is true or false. But I do want to hold the Presidentelect accountable for the words that he said on election night that he pledged to the Nation that he would be a President for all Americans. That pledge, I believe, will ring hollow for tens upon tens of millions of Americans with the nomination of the Secretary of Education, who is against public schools, the nomination of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has no plan for health care, and, finally, the nomination for Attorney General. Rather than select someone who is championing and protecting, rather than opposing and undermining the precious right to vote, the constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy, criminal justice reform, and the support for reform of the Nation’s immigration system, it is quite the contrary in the nomination of Senator SESSIONS —a person who opposed Shelby County v. Holder in terms of the basis of trying to constructively support voting rights, an individual who is hostile to comprehensive immigration reform, and certainly someone who has constantly not sought to fix, but has sought to undermine. So, for example, as a U.S. attorney, he was the first prosecutor in the country to bring charges against civil rights activists of voter fraud. But, Mr. Speaker, listen to this: he didn’t just bring charges; he had 29 counts of voter fraud that resulted in civil rights activists facing 100 years in prison. He has repeatedly denied the disproportionate impact of voting restrictions on minorities and has been a leader in the effort to undermine the protections of the Voting Rights Act, and he did nothing to reconstruct the Voting Rights Act and restore section 5 when tens upon tens of Members of Congress worked diligently to try to fix the Shelby case. He criticized Attorney General Eric Holder for challenging State election laws, claiming they are necessary to fight voter fraud. Evidence supports that voter fraud is almost nonexistent, with 31 confirmed cases out of more than a billion ballots cast. Senator SESSIONS fought to continue practices that harm schools predominantly attended by African American students. He led the fight to uphold the State of Alabama’s inequitable school funding mechanism after it had been deemed unconstitutional by the Alabama Circuit Court. Finally, in the State of Alabama, nearly a quarter of African American students attend what is called apartheid, or what can be called apartheid schools, meaning the school’s White population is less than 1 percent. Now we understand that the Senator has taken credit for desegregation efforts in the State of Alabama. There is no evidence of his participation in the desegregation of Alabama schools or any school desegregation lawsuits filed by thenAttorney General SESSIONS . b1945 I would say to you as I close, we who are vulnerable look to the Department of Justice as the solid rock of justice for the Nation. Whether we are immigrant, whether we are a woman who is trying to fight against violence, whether we need civil rights, whether we are LGBT, whether we are those who are seeking religious freedom or freedom of expression, the Department of Justice is a solid rock of justice for this Nation. With that in mind, I believe that this nominee, who now stands with the criteria evidenced by the record, stands not prepared, not fit to hold this position of the Attorney General of the United States—a sacred position of law and justice. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee; Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, and the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus, I rise today to express my views regarding the PresidentElect’s nomination of U.S. Senator JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD ‘‘JEFF’’ SESSIONS III of Alabama to be the next Attorney General of the United States. On Election Night the PresidentElect pledged to the nation that he would be a president to all Americans. That pledge will ring hollow to tens of millions of Americans in light of his announced intention to nominate one of the U.S. Senate’s most farright members, Senator JEFF SESSIONS (R–AL) to be the next Attorney General of the United States. Perhaps nothing would do more to reassure the American people that the PresidentElect is committed to unifying the nation than the nomination and appointment of a person to be Attorney General who has a record of championing and protecting, rather than opposing and undermining, the precious right to vote; the constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy, criminal justice reform, and support for reform of the nation’s immigration system so that it is fair and humane. The nomination of Alabama Senator SESSIONS as Attorney General does not inspire the necessary confidence. As a U.S. Senator from Alabama, the state from which the infamous Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder originated, Senator SESSIONS has failed to play a constructive role in repairing the damage to voting rights caused by that decision. He was one of the leading opponents of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. He is one of the Senate’s most hostile opponents of comprehensive immigration reform and was a principal architect of the draconian and incendiary immigration policy advocated by the PresidentElect during the campaign. And his record in support of efforts to bring needed reform to the nation’s criminal justice system is virtually nonexistent. In 1986, ten years before Senator SESSIONS  was elected to the Senate, he was rejected for a U.S. District Court judgeship in view of documented incidents that revealed his lack of commitment to civil and voting rights, and to equal justice. And his Senate voting record and rhetoric has endeared him to white nationalist websites and organizations like Breitbart and Stormfront. As a U.S. attorney, Senator SESSIONS was the first federal prosecutor in the country to bring charges against civil rights activists for voter fraud. Senator SESSIONS charged the group with 29 counts of voter fraud, facing over 100 years in prison. Senator SESSIONS has repeatedly denied the disproportionate impact of voting restrictions on minorities and has been a leader in the effort to undermine the protections of the Voting Rights Act. Senator SESSIONS has spoken out against the Voting Rights Act, calling it ‘‘a piece of intrusive legislation.’’ Senator SESSIONS criticized Attorney General Eric Holder for challenging state election laws, claiming they are necessary to fight voter fraud. However, evidence supports that voter fraud is almost nonexistent, with 31 confirmed cases out of more than 1 billion ballots cast. As Attorney General of the state of Alabama, Senator SESSIONS fought to continue practices that harmed schools predominantly attended by AfricanAmerican students. Senator SESSIONS led the fight to uphold the state of Alabama’s inequitable school funding mechanism after it had been deemed unconstitutional by the Alabama circuit court. In the state of Alabama nearly a quarter of AfricanAmerican students attend apartheid schools, meaning the school’s white population is less than one percent. Although Senator SESSIONS has publically taken credit for desegregation efforts in the state of Alabama, there is no evidence of his participation in the desegregation of Alabama schools or any school desegregation lawsuits filed by then Attorney General SESSIONS . 
I call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to subject the nomination to the most comprehensive, searching, and withering examination. The United States has been blessed to have been served as Attorney General by such illustrious figures as Robert Jackson, Robert Kennedy, Herbert Brownell, Ramsey Clark, Nicholas Katzenbach, Eric Holder, and Edward H. Levi. The duty of the U.S. Attorney General is to lead the Department of Justice in protecting and expanding the civil rights of all Americans and the pursuit of equal justice for all, not to turn back the clock on hard won rights and liberties. No senator should vote to confirm the nomination of JEFF SESSIONS as U.S. Attorney General if there is the slightest doubt that he possesses the character, qualities, integrity, and commitment to justice and equality needed to lead a department, the headquarters building of which is named for Robert F. Kennedy, one of the nation’s greatest and most indefatigable champions of civil rights and equal justice for all. Mr. VEASEY. I thank very much Ms. SHEILA JACKSON LEEof Texas. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from California, Ms. BARBARA LEE. Ms. LEE. Let me thank Representative VEASEY for hosting this important discussion on Presidentelect Trump’s disturbing nomination and for the gentleman’s commitment to defend civil and human rights for all Americans. Now, more than ever, the voices of the CBC’s are so important in this fight. I would also like to recognize our new chair, CEDRIC RICHMOND , as he takes the helm of the CBC during these very challenging times; but I know that, under his leadership, our caucus will continue to fight in a very strong and aggressive way for equality and justice. The Presidentelect, Mr. Speaker, ran one of the most divisive and racially tinged campaigns we have witnessed in modern history. Since winning the Presidency, Presidentelect Donald Trump has nominated individuals to serve in his Cabinet, proving that he will govern just as he campaigned. There is no greater example of this disturbing reality than in Senator JEFF SESSIONS ’ nomination to serve as our country’s Attorney General. The Justice Department is our best tool in protecting civil and human rights and voting rights. By appointing Senator SESSIONS to lead this department, Presidentelect Donald Trump is making it clear that he will abandon these fundamental values. Senator SESSIONS has a long history of opposing civil rights and equality. He has called the Voting Rights Act a piece of intrusive legislation. He said that the Supreme Court’s disastrous decision to gut voting rights was good news for the South. In the 1980s, he was rejected from serving as a Federal judge due to his blatantly racist comments. Any one of these statements should be disqualifying. In the proposed, bigoted Trump administration, frankly, I am not surprised; but I am appalled that the Presidentelect would choose such an extreme and divisive figure to serve as Attorney General. Clearly, someone who has publicly displayed prejudice and intolerance is not qualified to serve as our chief law enforcement officer for our civil rights laws. By that standard alone, one thing is clear: Senator SESSIONS is wholly unfit to serve as Attorney General. Senator SESSIONS has forcefully degraded the LGBT community, has voted against the Violence Against Women Act, and has undermined the cornerstone of the civil rights movement and the Voting Rights Act. His nomination really is a chilling indication of how a Trump administration intends to govern. This country has made tremendous progress in the fight to protect, preserve, and expand civil rights for all Americans. We will not allow a Trump administration to drag us back into the past. As the conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus is a voice for the marginalized. Our message to the Trump administration and to Presidentelect Donald Trump is simple: A vote to confirm Senator JEFF SESSIONS is a vote against justice. We will fight to protect any rollback on civil or human rights. We will not be silent. I call on all of my colleagues to oppose Senator SESSIONS ’ nomination as the United States Attorney General because his history disqualifies him for this important position. Mr. VEASEY. I thank very much Representative LEE. I really appreciate the gentlewoman’s remarks. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to someone who, over the last 20 years, has been in nearly every battle in the United States Congress when it comes to the issue of civil rights. He is Representative BOBBY SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for organizing this Special Order. I will be brief. There are a lot of people who want to speak. I will just speak to the jurisdiction of the Education and the Workforce Committee, on which I have the honor of serving as the ranking member. Mr. Speaker, as we consider appointments to the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services, we shouldn’t just look at people’s personalities, but at what the policy implications are of their appointments. The Senate must reject those nominees who will fail to stand up to the goals and aspirations of America’s children and workers. The first nominee I will speak to is that of Secretary of Labor, Mr. Puzder, who was the CEO of CKE Restaurants. He has spoken out many times in opposition to an increase in the minimum wage. Many States have recognized that the minimum wage is so low that people who work full time fail to make a wage that exceeds the poverty level. What is his position going to be on increasing the minimum wage? With overtime, are people entitled to work overtime after 40 hours? The regulation is in place. Will he enforce that new regulation? Or will he try to overturn the regulation that recognizes and honors the 40hour workweek, whereby those who work more than 40 hours will get time and a half? If you look at CKE’s retirement plan, it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of fees. What will his position be? When you look at the fiduciary rule— which requires financial advisers, when they are looking at somebody’s retirement fund, to have the worker’s best interest in the forefront, not their personal profits and what they can rip off from someone but to look at the worker’s views as paramount—will he change that so that we can go back to the days in which people could take advantage of unsophisticated workers and sell them products that are not in their best interests? What are his positions going to be on enforcing Federal regulations? CKE Restaurants has been found in violation of many wage regulations. Will he vigorously enforce those? Those are the kinds of things that we need to look at when we look at the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, is best known for her support of vouchers. Vouchers in Michigan have shown that they fund schools that are actually worse than the average, so they have not done any good. Will she support public education? Or will she support the privatization of education? Finally, Health and Human Services: Will we privatize Medicare? Will we repeal without replacing the Affordable Care Act? A lot has been said about repeal and then replace later. Let me tell you, until you have seen a plan, you can just count on the repeal; there will probably never be a replace. What will happen to everybody if there is no plan? Twenty million people—maybe 30 million—will lose their insurance, and the insurance market for everybody else will be in chaos. We need to make sure that we look at this and get these decisions straight before we confirm anybody. All of the nominees and others should be reviewed not on their personalities, but on the policy decisions they will be making. The next generation of Americans will base their education, their jobs, and their health care on the decisions these nominees will make. The Senate should reject any of the nominees that will take us in the wrong direction. Mr. VEASEY. I thank Mr. SCOTT of Virginia very much. Mr. Speaker, I inquire as to how much time I have left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 32 minutes remaining. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I next yield to the lone voice in the State of 
Wisconsin, someone who is always speaking out on these issues not just for her district, but for the many people around her State who want that voice from the CBC: Ms. GWEN MOORE  of Wisconsin. Ms. MOORE. I thank Mr. VEASEY so much, and I thank our new chair of the Congressional Black Caucus for his tremendous effort in putting this very important Special Order hour together. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening because I am extremely concerned about the nomination of Senator JEFFSESSIONS . Certainly, Presidentelect Trump has a right to nominate people and have them be presented before our Senate, and, certainly, you don’t expect a Republican to necessarily agree with all of your positions; but I am concerned about Senator SESSIONS because I think he has aligned himself with extreme ideological views that won’t best serve all of the people of the United States. During the last 7 years, the Department of Justice has investigated at least 23 law enforcement agencies in response to rampant civil rights abuses. I fear that, under an Attorney General JEFF SESSIONS , those consent decrees and that very important work in resolving the conflicts between, particularly, African American communities and police officers will be lost. I am extremely concerned, as are at least 70 civil rights organizations and organizations that serve women, with an Attorney General JEFF SESSIONS . They are concerned about not just the antiabortion views that Senator SESSIONS has displayed, but about the zealous antichoice positions that he has taken—his association and alignment, again, with extreme antiabortion organizations. They believe that he is not capable of fair and impartial action as Attorney General. What is so chilling, as an example, is when Senator SESSIONS was asked about Presidentelect Trump’s Access Hollywood scandal in that he said he didn’t characterize the grabbing of a woman’s genitals as necessarily a sexual assault. Very, very chilling and disturbing. In being from Wisconsin, where we have fought egregious and unfair voter ID laws that were designed to disenfranchise, particularly, African Americans, Mr. SESSIONS has indicated that the gutting of the Voting Rights Act has actually had no impact and that no one has been denied the right to vote. He seems to be tone deaf to the cries of African Americans across this country to protect their voting rights. I encourage the Senate to look very carefully at this nominee, because, in fact, the United States Attorney General’s only charge is to protect the civil rights of all of the citizens. I don’t know that he will be willing or able to do that. Mr. VEASEY. I thank Representative MOORE . I appreciate the gentlewoman’s comments and I thank her for mentioning some of the issues with voter ID in Wisconsin, which may have tilted the election results in that State. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my good friend from Brooklyn in the Empire State, Representative YVETTE CLARKE . Ms. CLARKE of New York. I thank Mr. VEASEY for his leadership this evening. I thank our chairman, CEDRIC  RICHMOND , for his vision and his timeliness in bringing this to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of the Ninth Congressional District of New York in opposition to Donald Trump’s nominee for the position of Attorney General of the United States, Senator JEFFSESSIONS of Alabama. I stand with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus as we raise our voices on behalf of the millions of Americans who depend on this caucus to speak as the conscience of the Congress—speaking truth to power. Mr. Speaker, I struggle to understand how Senator SESSIONS can even be considered to lead the Department of Justice when time and time again throughout his political career he has actively opposed the mission and purpose for which the Department of Justice was created. For the better part of my life—at least a half a century—the Department of Justice has assumed a position of leadership in the fight for the civil rights of African Americans who seek the uninhibited right to vote, for young women who seek protection against sexual assault on college campuses, for disabled individuals who fight for equitable access to basic services, and for immigrants who aspire to pursue their visions of the American Dream. The nomination of Senator SESSIONS  does not support the legacy of progress that has been made under the auspices of the modernday Department of Justice. As a young prosecutor, he directed racial slurs at his African American colleagues. Senator SESSIONS  spoke highly of the Ku Klux Klan. He actively targeted and persecuted activists like Mr. Albert Turner—one of Dr. Martin Luther King’s advisers—for simply trying to register disenfranchised voters. b2000 When he became Attorney General of Alabama, Senator SESSIONS , a product of segregated education, worked tirelessly to prevent predominantly African American public schools from accessing an equal share of resources that had been long denied to Black students. As a Member of the Senate, Senator SESSIONS has been an outspoken opponent of criminal justice reforms that many of his Republican colleagues support. He is a leader in the effort to define undocumented Americans as ‘‘the other’’ and forcibly separating families in the United States. The women and men who lead the Department of Justice are called upon to pursue justice; but with such a documented history of hostility toward the most vulnerable populations—people of color, women, disabled individuals, and immigrant families—we cannot expect Senator SESSIONS to pursue justice on their behalf. I absolutely and unequivocally oppose the nomination of Senator SESSIONS . He has demonstrated his disdain for the most basic of human principles: equality, justice, and fairness. These principles represent the promise of our Constitution. The Senate considering and confirming Mr. SESSIONS would break that very promise. Mr. Speaker, I stand with the CBC today asking the Senate of the United States to uphold the virtues of the Constitution and reject this divisive nomination. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to remind Members that we have 3 minutes per Member left of speaking time. I wanted to just remind Members of that so everyone will have an opportunity to speak on this very important matter. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Representative CEDRIC RICHMOND as he takes the helm of the CBC and manages this exercise tonight; and also Representative MARC VEASEY , who will be the point man for doing these Special Orders. We are called upon tonight at a critical time in the Nation’s history. We have a new President coming in who is polarizing, divisive, inexperienced, and immature. He is making some selections for his appointments, and the Senate has the opportunity to weigh in on those appointments. So what is happening is that there are incomplete and missing answers to the Senate questionnaires that appointees like Senator JEFF SESSIONS , who I rise in opposition to, have completed and sent in. This puts the Office of Government Ethics that vets these candidates at a severe disadvantage of not having the information that they need in order to vet these appointees, like Senator JEFFSESSIONS . They don’t have the information that they need. So we also have a compressed schedule of nominees to be considered over the next few days. This, combined with the incomplete answers, puts us in a position of not having enough information to conduct full, fair, thorough, and sifting analysis and vetting for the American people. These are the people who are going to serve them into the future. So I am very concerned, especially about a guy like Senator SESSIONS who has a history of being opposed to civil rights for certain Americans. Now, there are those who would say that this took place 30 years ago, all of the things that he said and did prior to becoming a Senator 20 years ago. Some will say that all of these things that have been cited about Senator SESSIONS are 30 years old. We have to look at what has occurred in the life of Senator SESSIONS to make 
us think that he has changed. It takes a courageous person like George Wallace to come forward and say: I was wrong for being a racist. It takes a strong person like Lee Atwater to say: I was wrong. Senator SESSIONS has not said he was wrong. There is nothing that Senator SESSIONS has written that says: I apologize for what I did back then. There is nothing that he said. Certainly his legislative record, which is only nine bills over the last 20 years— three of which were ceremonial in nature—there is nothing in that legislation that would lead us to conclude that he has changed. So he is going to be bad for the Attorney General’s office. I conclude by asking my Senate colleagues to think carefully about what you are about to do and say ‘‘no’’ to Senator JEFFSESSIONS . Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. PAYNE ), my classmate and a voice from the New York area. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Fort Worth (Mr. VEASEY ). I was looking forward to a potential clash with his team next week, but I guess you have to get out of Green Bay before you can go to Dallas. Mr. Speaker, the job of the U.S. Attorney General is to protect the rights and freedoms of every single American. Senator SESSIONS ’ record and public statements suggest that, if confirmed, he will not uphold our Constitution’s values of fairness, justice, and equality for all. Since the election, President elect Trump’s victory has been marred by allegations of voter intimidation and suppression in key States. It is clear that we need to restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. Yet, Senator SESSIONS has called the Voting Rights Act an intrusive piece of legislation. When he was the United States Attorney in west Alabama, Senator SESSIONS used the power of his office to intimidate and dissuade African American voters. Americans recognize the need for Congress to find a bipartisan solution to immigration reform. Yet, Senator SESSIONS has been one of the loudest opponents of comprehensive immigration reform. He has even fought against legal immigration, arguing, instead, for immigration moderation. Americans also recognize the dire need for criminal justice reform. Yet, Senator SESSIONS has opposed bipartisan legislation to modernize prison sentencing for lowlevel drug offenders. On every measure, Senator SESSIONS  has shown that he will be detrimental to African Americans and other minority communities as our Nation’s next Attorney General. The next Attorney General must build on the progress of the last few years under Attorney General Lynch and Attorney General Holder. He or she must safeguard civil rights, prosecute hate crimes, protect the right of due process, and uphold the Constitution and our basic values and freedoms. Every indication is that Senator SESSIONS is too extreme and unwilling to protect the safety and the rights of every American. If confirmed as U.S. Attorney General, Senator SESSIONS  will pose a grave threat to our justice system and to the communities that system is meant to protect. His ideologies are in direct contrast with the Justice Department’s mission. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ), my classmate from the Buckeye State, representing the Columbus, Ohio, area. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and chair of this Special Order hour (Mr. VEASEY ) and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus (Mr. RICHMOND ). It is indeed an honor, Mr. Speaker, for me to stand here with these colleagues tonight. We come tonight with a strong message. We are here to speak out against Presidentelect Trump’s Cabinet nominations who, based on their records, are, in my opinion, too divisive, too extreme, too out of touch, and unable to protect the interests and the safety of all Americans—individuals like JEFF SESSIONS and Betsy DeVos. Trust me, Mr. Speaker, these nominees need to be vetted. The American people deserve to know who will be in charge of these critically important Federal agencies. We are extremely concerned with Senator JEFFSESSIONS ’ nomination to be the U.S. Attorney General. SESSIONS , as you have heard tonight and you will continue to hear, has continuously obstructed the progress we have made with the enactment of the historic civil rights legislation of the 1960s. He has consistently, Mr. Speaker, fought to block legislative efforts to ensure racial equality, including his staunch opposition to full enforcement of the Voting Rights Act—the very bill, Mr. Speaker, if confirmed, he would be in charge of enforcing and protecting. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues. We cannot allow that to happen. Next up in Trump’s Cabinet of cronies is his nominee for Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, who has pushed to expand taxpayerfunded vouchers for private and religious schools and has absolutely zero experience as an educator or an educational leader. She has, however, Mr. Speaker, spent millions of dollars lobbying for school choice proposals which harm disadvantaged and atrisk communities. Now, I am from the great State of Ohio, and to have someone owe our Ohio Elections Commission $5.3 million, we cannot allow that to happen. We have to be the voice for the people. Especially those people who are voiceless. Mr. Speaker, let me end by saying that as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I stand here tonight wanting the public to know that we are concerned and we are exercising our right and our voice. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York, the Empire State, (Mr. JEFFRIES ). Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague and classmate, Representative MARC VEASEY , for his leadership today; and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative CEDRIC RICHMOND , for convening us and for the leadership that he has already shown. We have a Presidentelect who, for 5 years, perpetrated the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America, and who ran one of the most divisive campaigns in the Nation’s history and then promised that he was going to bring all of us together. Then you have got his colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have said: Well, Democrats, people in the civil rights community, African Americans, we should give the new President a chance. This is the same group of people who declared war on Barack Obama on day one of his Presidency and governed themselves under the following approach: Obstruction today, obstruction tomorrow, obstruction forever. That should sound familiar to folks from Alabama and the Deep South. Now they want us to give them a chance. You can’t lecture us on Presidential etiquette. You have no credibility in that area. We will decide how we want to engage. As it relates to your pick to head the Department of Justice, it is totally unacceptable, unreasonable, unjust, and unconscionable, not because of anything that he may have said 30 years ago, as offensive as that may be, but because of the positions that Senator JEFFSESSIONS  has taken today. Today, in 2017, based on his recent track record, he supports the Confederate battle flag, not 30 years ago, but today. Today he supports voter suppression efforts that are advanced by his unwillingness to repair section 4 and section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. That is not 30 years ago. I don’t care that you showed up in Selma, Alabama, for a photo op. Your position on the Voting Rights Act is unacceptable today. b2015 Today you support mass incarceration, the failed drug war, and the prison industrial complex. And because of your position today, reasonable Americans should oppose your ascension to the Department of Justice. Mr. VEASEY. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ). Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus for coming out and speaking out. I rise today to express concern and strong opposition to Presidentelect Trump Cabinet nominations for Attorney General, Secretary of Education, 
and Secretary of Health and Human Services. Presidentelect Trump chose not to practice what he preached, and he didn’t drain the swamp. Instead, he nominated politically divisive individuals to serve in his administration. Throughout a public service career spanning more than 30 years, Senator SESSIONS used the power of the courts to discriminate against civil rights leaders. He allegedly used racially charged language to disparage minorities, expressed support for the KKK, and then tried to dismiss it as a joke. He celebrated the gutting of the Voting Rights Act and opposed samesex marriage. He denied the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade and voted against greater access to health care for veterans. He blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act and voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. He does not respect the rights of minorities or women, and he has proven himself to be unfit to serve as United States Attorney General. Education is the great equalizer. One of the most important investments families make is in their children. The Secretary of Education must be committed to providing a free, worldclass education to all students regardless of race, gender, ability, status, financial means, or geography. Unfortunately, Betsy DeVos has consistently fought for private school vouchers that divert funds from public schools, our communities, and our children who need these investments the most. She has even used her personal wealth to lobby against important transparency and accountability measures that would have provided necessary safeguards for Michigan students. DeVos’ track record of undermining public education and her lack of commitment to defending the civil rights of students causes me great pause in her quest to become Secretary of Education. I can’t support it. Betsy DeVos, absolutely no. Finally, Chairman PRICE. He has made it clear that his budget priorities are highly partisan. We can expect that if he is confirmed, he will strip 20 million people of affordable health care, women would be denied their right to contraception and reproductive health care, and devastating cuts would be levied against Medicaid funding. We can’t go back to a time when being a woman is a preexisting condition for insurance coverage. Chairman PRICE’s nomination offers just that. These folks will not unite the American people, and they cannot be trusted to advocate for our most vulnerable populations, so I urge my Senate colleagues to oppose the confirmations of Senator JEFF SESSIONS , Betsy DeVos, and Chairman TOMPRICE. Mr. VEASEY. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE ). Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take a stand against those who seek to further divide our Nation. We face the greatest chaos not by the acts of outsiders or foreign intruders, but by the division and war with each other. The nomination of JEFF SESSIONS as our Attorney General threatens our strength as Americans. Over three decades of a career in public service, JEFFSESSIONS ’ words and actions lead to one question: Who is included and excluded from the public he chooses to serve? JEFF SESSIONS has referred to the Voting Rights Act as a ‘‘piece of intrusive legislation.’’ The first Federal prosecutor in the country to bring charges against civil rights activists for voter fraud since the passage of the VRA in 1965, SESSIONS has called the Shelby v. Holder case, which eliminated the preclearance formula, ‘‘good news . . . for the South.’’ SESSIONS has referred to the NAACP and ACLU civil rights groups saying they have done more harm than good by trying to force civil rights down the throats of the good people of the United States. He has referred to these organizations as unAmerican and communist inspired. African Americans and other people of color are disproportionately affected by acts of voter suppression and the criminal justice system. Those, among others, are the key areas in which SESSIONS has shown deliberate disregard for the justice and equality of all Americans. This is a pivotal moment in our Nation’s history, and we simply cannot treat the American people like a social experiment. History will reflect on this moment in time, and our action and inaction will be accounted for. Mr. VEASEY. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ). Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who have spoken this evening. As I have said, I would have liked to have spent this transition period working with the Presidentelect on ways to solve our Nation’s issues. I would have liked to have been reassured that, despite disparaging and divisive rhetoric, his actions would have worked to unite us all. Instead, we are battling against a nominee who has already been deemed unfit for a Federal judgeship. So what can possibly make him fit to serve as our Nation’s top law enforcement officer? The definition of justice is the quality of being just, impartial, or fair. Synonyms include equity, objectivity, and neutrality. Senator SESSIONS has built a reputation and a voting record that does not align with justice. I do not wish to relitigate the past, and while it cannot be ignored, we don’t have to look too far back to identify Senator SESSIONS ’ priorities. In 2006, he voted to renew the Voting Rights Act. In 2013, he supported the Supreme Court decision to strike key provisions of that law. Following being denied a Federal judgeship, Senator SESSIONS cosponsored legislation to honor Rosa Parks with a Congressional Gold Medal while also voting against legislation in 2009 to extend Federal hate crime protections against people targeted because of their sexual orientation. Further, he has been the ringleader to immigration reform. How can we in good faith recommend, nominate, or confirm a person to a post that is solely responsible for protecting the civil rights of all Americans, including those who are vulnerable, disadvantaged, and discriminated against? This administration is continuing to ask us to put aside our intellect and to trust their intentions. I refuse. This administration would like us to support a man who, throughout his career, has determined the rights of those who look like me, like constituents I serve, as inferior. I refuse, and I ask the Senators to please consider this as they listen to whether or not this gentleman deserves to be confirmed. Mr. Speaker, as I’ve said before, I would have liked to have spent the transition period working with the PresidentElect, Trump, on ways to solve our Nation’s issues. I would have liked to have been reassured that despite disparaging and divisive campaign rhetoric—PresidentElect Trump’s actions would work to unite us all. Yet, instead we’re here battling against the nominee for the 84th attorney general of the United States who was already rejected as a federal judge. His disqualification was rooted in allegations that he called a black attorney ‘‘boy’’ and his suggestions that a white lawyer working for black clients was a race traitor. Not only that but Senator SESSIONS found humor in his only issue with the Ku Klux Klan was their drug use, and accused civil rights groups as being ‘‘unAmerican’’ organizations trying to ‘‘force civil rights down the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them.’’ So what could possibly make him fit to serve as our Nation’s top law enforcement officer at the Department of Justice? The definition of justice is the quality of being just, impartial, or fair. Synonyms for justice include equity, objectivity and neutrality. Senator SESSIONS has built a reputation and, most importantly, a voting record that does not align with that definition. I do not wish to relitigate the past as I would not want to be judged on my actions and thoughts of 30 years ago. However, Senator SESSIONS ’ growth and commitment to inclusivity—even 30 years later—remains to be seen. Following being denied a federal judgeship, in the early 90s, Senator SESSIONS cospon sored legislation to honor Rosa Parks with the Congressional Gold Medal, while also voting against 2009 legislation that extended federal hate crime protections to people targeted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. While in 2006 he voted to renew the Voting Rights Act, just years later in 2013 he supported the Supreme Court’s decision to strike key provisions of the law. 
Furthermore, he has been the ringleader of opposition for immigration reform. How can we in good faith recommend, nominate, or confirm this person to the post that is solely responsible for protecting the civil liberties of all Americans—including those who are vulnerable, disadvantaged, and discriminated against. This administration is continually asking us to put aside our intellect and to trust their intention. I refuse. This administration would like us to support a man who throughout his career has determined the rights of those who look like me and the constituents I serve are inferior. I refuse. This administration would like us to sit idly by as Donald Trump tries to overwhelm us into tacit submission to his dangerous agenda. I refuse. A TrumpSessions Department of Justice would be not only an attack on our civil rights and equality; it would be an insult to the intelligence of the American people. Mr. VEASEY. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ). Mr. MCEACHIN. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for organizing this hour today. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today because I believe that confirming JEFF SESSIONS as Attorney General for the United States would jeopardize the progress we have made for equal rights and against discrimination. Mr. Speaker, it is an affront to common sense to confirm someone who has criticized the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and believes that this landmark law, which provides all Americans with the right to cast a ballot for candidates in our democratic process, is intrusive. It is an affront to common sense, Mr. Speaker, to confirm a nominee who views an old advertisement calling for the death penalty of people who are later exonerated as a mark of conservatism. Mr. Speaker, it is an affront to common sense to confirm someone who was previously rejected as a choice for a Federal judgeship to lead a Department that, in part, vets future Federal judges. It is an affront to common sense, Mr. Speaker, to confirm someone who does not believe in justice for all to lead the Department of Justice. Mr. Speaker, it is clear that this nominee would not act in the best interest of all Americans, regardless of color, gender, country of origin, sexual orientation, or economic status. Mr. Speaker, it is my fervent hope that the Senate of the United States will deny the confirmation of this nominee. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Presidentelect Donald Trump’s cabinet nominations are nothing short of alarming. With the United States Senate expected to begin nomination hearings this week, we need to ensure that Congress follows a fair and thorough vetting process as we evaluate the suitability of these individuals to fill the various cabinet positions. One source of concern is the process by which Republicans in Congress are choosing to conduct these nominations. The recent Republican effort to rush the nominees through the process does not invite confidence in our ability to properly consider each individual on their merits. Walter Shaub, Jr., Director of the Office of Government Ethics, raised his concerns of this very fact given that his office is charged with conducting ethics screening reviews of the nominees. The aggressive hearing schedule to consider these nominees is unprecedented and has placed an undue burden on the Office of Government Ethics (OCE) and its ability to conduct thorough ethics reviews. These ethics reviews are essential to the process and help us to identify potential conflicts of interest or other ethical considerations before we confirm these individuals to serve in public office. Director Shaub has stated that it is unprecedented for the Senate to conduct a confirmation hearing before the ethics review process has concluded. This is simply unacceptable and undermines the democratic process. The nominees themselves are also cause for concern. Namely, I believe that the nomination of Senator JEFFSESSIONS for Attorney General of the U.S. Department of Justice threatens the best interests and safety of the American people. Senator SESSIONS has served in the United States Senate for twenty years, during which his record on civil rights and other national issues was questionable at best. For example, he voted several times against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which aimed to hold offenders of violence against women accountable for their actions. He has also taken a very clear position against rights for the LGBT community, which would deny these Americans basic human rights. His positions on criminal justice and government reforms are also disturbing. Mr. Speaker, I have serious concerns about the means by which my Republican colleagues are approaching the nomination process this Congress. If we are to properly evaluate the qualifications and the ethical suitability of these nominees, we must conduct an exhaustive examination of each nominee based on their merits—not on their politics. The Republicans are failing to uphold these basic principles through their recent actions. In the name of protecting the American people and doing what is best for our country, I urge my Republican colleagues to return to normal order and delay these nomination hearings until OCE can conclude its ethics reviews of the nominees. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COMER ). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities against Members of the Senate and the Presidentelect. 
ELECTING MEMBERS TO CERTAIN STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 34 Resolved, That the following named Member be and is hereby elected to the following standing Committee of the House of Representatives: (1) Committee on Armed Services—Mr. Smith of Washington. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS TO PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair announces the Speaker’s appointment, pursuant to clause 11 of rule X, clause 11 of rule I, and the order of the House of January 3, 2017, of the following Members of the House to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence: Mr. HIMES, Connecticut Ms. SEWELL , Alabama Mr. CARSON , Indiana Ms. SPEIER , California Mr. QUIGLEY , Illinois Mr. SWALWELL , California Mr. CASTRO , Texas Mr. HECK, Washington 
HOPE IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here tonight at the beginning of this new year. It has been great being in east Texas this weekend, last weekend, hearing all of the hope that has arisen as we have entered this new year, 2017. I think it is going to be a good year. I am told that just on the basis of a new President coming in who is promising to throttle back, remove so much of the heavy, iron boot off of the throat of the economy that firms are starting to hire again. Businesses are making plans to expand and grow. And then we are seeing reports of plants that are deciding to stay in the United States instead of going elsewhere. There is a lot of optimism out there. There are young people that are asking what was it like back when you came out of college and had multiple job opportunities for most of the people coming out of college instead of opportunities to live with your parents or your grandparents or a parent or the other parent. They actually had multiple job opportunities, and that optimism has arisen. As we entered this year, also, it is very sad to see a form of racism and negativity that arises. I have said before publicly, and I think it is still true, we need go back no further than the confirmation hearing for Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. But the more you look, the more you find that the most persecuted person to be in America these days is a conservative African American. If you are Black and you are conservative, you can expect 
slings and arrows and hate from all over the country—vicious, mean. And it was yet another slap, as if the hightech lynching of the Senate confirmation hearing, as grossly unfair as it was, that woman that withheld any complaints whatsoever, followed a man from job to job, never raised a complaint until he gets ready to be confirmed to the United States Supreme Court, raised allegations that can’t possibly be denied or supplemented, verified—not effectively. b2030 You raise them 20plus years. That is why we have laws on the books to protect from allegations too many years after the fact. We have statutes of limitations. If you sit on something and don’t tell people for years and years, and then all of a sudden, for political reasons, you raise up allegations against someone who is basically defenseless—the thing is Clarence Thomas was not defenseless. There were like 15 people, 15 women, who came forward and said: Look, I was there around Anita Hill when these things were going on. Those things never happened. Clarence Thomas is a brilliant, fine man, over and over. Does any of that come up when HBO talks about him? Of course not because they were out to slander him, libel him, make him appear to be some crazy guy. The guy is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Some say: well, yeah, of course the only way he got into Harvard— which, at the time, was too conservative, he thought, for him, law school after Holy Cross, and then it was too conservative, and he ends up applying to Yale and going there, one he didn’t think quite as conservative. But he began to notice, as he points out in his book, that the liberals would talk to him about sports and oppression of Black people in America, and that is all they wanted to talk about. But he began to notice that two or three other conservatives, the few that there were in Yale at the time, Yale Law School, basically would talk to him about anything, and I have had a conversation, in prior years, with him about that at Yale. But it is interesting. You know, the liberals say: oh, yeah, we are the ones that care. Now you are only here because we pushed for affirmative action. You couldn’t possibly be smart enough to be in a place where I am, the liberals think. So yeah, it is because of us liberals you are here. No, the guy is brilliant; he deserved to be there on his own merit, on his own intellect. He deserves to be a member of the United States Supreme Court. He deserves the acclaim that he has never properly gotten. But people who have clerked at that Court know the integrity, the intellect, the consistency of Clarence Thomas. He was maligned. They thought, basically, it was an effort to ‘‘Bork,’’ as it has come to become, or become a verb, what was done to Justice Bork, accuse him of outrageous offenses, derail his confirmation, so that this conservative, principled, qualified individual doesn’t make it to the Supreme Court. Well, the effort worked on assassinating so grossly unfairly the character of Justice Bork, but it didn’t work on Clarence Thomas because he is a man of steadfast faith, integrity, and not just the brilliant intellect. And it is really heartbreaking. I mean, I thought—even though I didn’t support President Obama because I didn’t want him taking us down a socialist road, a socialist health care road. He talked about these things. The videos were out there. He wanted to get us to where the government controlled health care, singlepayer, in other words, socialized medicine, where the government gets to decide whether you get health care or whether it is any good or not and, of course, it ends up not being, most of the time, once the government has total unfettered control. I didn’t want to go those places he wanted to go, but, I think the good thing is, it shows that America is above racism, and this is a man who can bind up this Nation as never before. And yet, he has spent right at 8 years now creating more division in this country than we have had since the sixties. And who was stirring it up back then? Well, he was in the middle of groups that were stirring it up back then, protege of Bill Ayers. First fundraiser he had in the home of someone who felt like it was a good idea to kill police, at least try to. I hear constant allegations that are so unfair. Those who know JEFFSESSIONS make some very fair observations. I noted the great fairness of someone with whom I disagree often, but Senator SUSAN COLLINS . This article from CNN Politics says: ‘‘ . . . a moderate Republican elected to the Senate the same year as Sessions in 1996, admits that she and Sessions ‘don’t agree on a host of issues,’ but she was happy to accept his’’—JEFF SESSIONS —‘‘request to introduce him at his confirmation hearing alongside senior Alabama Sen. RICHARD SHELBY .’’ ‘‘‘He’s a decent, honorable, patriotic individual,’ Collins said in an interview in her Senate office. ‘I felt bad he was not getting a fair shake from those who were denigrating him.’’’ ‘‘The Maine lawmaker’’—SUSAN COLLINS—‘‘is referring to allegations of racial insensitivity—the same Democrats used to block SESSIONS from moving through committee thirty years ago.’’ ‘‘Collins explained that she is basing her endorsement of SESSIONS ’ character on her own experience working with him over the past 20 years.’’ Well, isn’t that a good thing, Mr. Speaker? You have a Senator that says: You know what? I’m not going to listen to the slings and arrows. I’m going to go based on the evidence that I have seen, heard, and known for myself. You can denigrate someone all you want, but we are going based on what is real, what is factual; and God bless her for doing so. ‘‘I don’t know what happened more than 30 years ago, when JEFFwas nominated to be a district court judge, and his nomination failed,’ she said. ‘But I do know the JEFFSESSIONS that I have worked with in the past 20 years. And he is a good person, and I believe that he will perform very well as attorney general.’’ ‘‘Another Republican colleague who went out of his way to get to know SESSIONS is Sen. T IMSCOTT, the only AfricanAmerican GOP Senator. In December, SCOTT invited S ESSIONS to visit his home state of South Carolina, where the two lawmakers met with criminal justice professionals in Charleston.’’ And, you know, I have such great regard for my colleagues across the aisle, but I am heartbroken that 30 years after the denial of JEFFSESSIONS a judicial bench, when the JEFFSESSIONS  that I have come to know in the 12 years I have been in Congress—I have come to know him, I feel like, pretty well. He is a good, decent, fair man. He tries to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. He tries to treat people fairly and equally. I saw this quote from assistant—he was Assistant District Attorney Thomas Harrison, who had started in helping prosecute regarding the lynching of a 19yearold—just horrific—19yearold African American, Michael Donald in Alabama. And the Assistant District Attorney Harrison, at the time, who prosecuted the case in State Court, he was quoted as saying: ‘‘Sessions asked what we needed’’—because Sessions was U.S. Attorney, what they needed, in other words, to go after the culprits that would do such a horrendous criminal act. And he says: ‘‘ . . . I said, in order to get a capital murder conviction, we need these things, and he’’— talking about JEFF SESSIONS —‘‘said that in that regard whatever the federal agents did or the FBI did he would make those things available. He did in fact do that.’’ I don’t know, that is the kind of JEFF SESSIONS I have gotten to know over the years, and it is a little heartbreaking to hear allegations about a guy. I really like him. And then to hear allegations that I have heard made about me in a grossly unfair manner. And I can’t explain all of the allegations about—that are so grossly unfair about JEFF SESSIONS . But I can address some of the things that have been alleged to make him unfit to be Attorney General that I know are ridiculous. One of the points that was made was regarding his concern or opposition to the new Voting Rights Act extension, I guess that is what they were talking about, and I know a great deal about that. That comes through the Judiciary Committee, and I know my friend, 
fellow Republican, J IM SENSEN BRENNER , had reached an agreement with Democrat JOHNCONYERS and others, and they weren’t letting amendments get through. I was trying to make the point clear, if you want to save the Voting Rights Act, you can’t keep punishing a State because they did something wrong 50 years ago. That is not constitutional. And if you insist on continuing to put these punitive positions in the Voting Rights Act that will continue to punish southern States that have recorded these days, and it was pretty well true across the South, they had less racial disparity than places in the North, in Wisconsin, in Massachusetts, in California. Yet, people from these other States, because they made a majority, said: we don’t care that they are—there is less racial disparateness in those southern states. There was harm 50 years ago, and there was, and it needed to be cleaned up. It desperately needed to be cleaned up, and we needed a Voting Rights Act in order to help cure the evils. But what was pushed through in a voting rights extension, with my opposition—and I don’t know what JEFF’s arguments were, but I know how wrong it was. And I came down here, and my friend—and I mean that—my friend, JOHNCONYERS , was sitting right there, and it was toward the end of the year. And I said: Look, I have talked to liberal law deans from different parts of the country, New York, California, Texas; and when we discuss what you have put in the Voting Rights Act, you are still treating States punitively that are now doing better than California, New York, Massachusetts, at least some districts in those States. Wisconsin had a district with a huge problem. You can’t do that. It is going to be ruled unconstitutional. And I still cannot support it, but why don’t we do a joint amendment and fix this? And my friend, JOHNCONYERS , he is a very honorable man, and he said: Let me talk to some of our folks. And when I talked to him before the end of the year, he said: We think it is okay, and the people I talked to think it is okay. We don’t need to amend it. We are going to leave it just like it is. Well, it is wrong. Whether it is in a Voting Rights Act, whether it is in a criminal bill, a civil bill, if you are punishing people for the sins of their grandfathers or fathers, it is wrong. It is unAmerican. And I don’t know if JEFF SESSIONS has called something like that unAmerican, but I will. When you try to punish an individual for something their father or grandfather did, that is unAmerican. That is wrong. And lo and behold, the liberal law professors and deans that I have talked to across the country, before I begged— well, I begged JIMSENSENBRENNER . He was sitting at the back right back there. b2045 He said: Nope, we are not touching that bill. They were happy to let it go to the Supreme Court one day just the way it was. Just as I explained to JOHNCONYERS right here, just as I explained to JIMSENSENBRENNER right back there, this should be struck down if the U.S. Supreme Court is going to be fair and partial and follow the Constitution. You can’t keep punishing people for something their fathers or grandfathers did when they are doing better than people in your own State and you vote to punish them. Why? Because you can. Their fathers or grandfathers committed a wrong many years ago. A grievous wrong it was, and it needed correction. There are some places where it still does, but you don’t keep punishing people 50 years after they bring up their problem. So I hear people say JEFFSESSIONS is not fit because he opposed the Voting Rights Act. I tried to clean it up. It had an unAmerican provision in there. I just can’t believe anybody on either side of the aisle would continue to support the idea that we should punish children or grandchildren for something their father or grandfather did many years ago. This child has become an adult and they have made sure there is fairness abounding. Well, there is always going to be injustice. One of the great problems in this Justice Department is that it was always quick to take up for someone who had been shot by policemen—before they knew any of the facts—and demonize the local police. Sometimes—in rare cases, but every now and then— they did deserve demonizing. But the Department of Justice should not demonize them before we find out the facts. In most of those cases, when we find out the facts, whether it is Baltimore or other places, most of the time people or even a professor of some kind, like the President, said he acted stupidly, talking about the policeman. It turned out the policeman conducted himself very reasonably. We never did hear whether the President apologized to the policeman or not, but the point is that the President and the Justice Department have spent 8 years dividing us in ways I did not believe were possible 8 years ago. So I hear my friends come in here and start condemning a man as not being fit to serve because of things like opposing an unconstitutional, un American provision in the Voting Rights Act. It was then, it is today. If somebody tries to pass a punishment of some group of people for something their grandparents did, it is wrong, it is unAmerican. I will say it to the day I die. Now, it is very unfair. I saw it as a felony judge. It broke my heart. In chambers, but never in the courtroom itself, it would bring me to tears. I would break down when I saw the suffering of children because of the sins of their parents. But the government should not be in the business of punishing people intentionally. There was a provision in the Voting Rights Act that did just that. I also heard an allegation about JEFF SESSIONS either opposing a hate crime extension or hate crime bill. I can tell you from conversations I had years past, back when we were talking about hate crimes bills, we did not need hate crime laws. What was the fake news that was trotted out here in Washington, trotted out around the country? Remember what happened down in south Texas? It wasn’t in my district, but I am familiar with what happened down there. There were three White guys that took a poor, decent African American, used a chain, tied him to their truck, and drug him until he was dead. It was in print and publicly. I would personally have no problem with a jury ordering a sentence, if we could put it in the law, so that the family of that victim could decide what they were going to use to drag the defendants and the terrain they would drag those White defendants over, but that is not the law. The law in Texas is that our juries can find you guilty and sentence you. Well, the juries don’t actually sentence death. That is left to the judge. The juries answer three questions. I know. I have put it to juries three times. On one occasion the jury came back locked up, so I sentenced that defendant to life. On two occasions of three capital murder cases I tried to completion, the jury found unanimously, number one, he committed the murder and he knew that a murder was going to be committed; number two, that he is a future danger to society; and number three, there was no evidence that mitigated against the imposition of the death penalty. The jury comes back with yes, yes, and no; and it is left to a judge like me to look a man in the eyes and tell him that I sentence him to death. There is nothing that goes to your soul like looking someone in the eye and saying: You are going to be taken to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and you are going to be put to death for the crimes you have committed. I believe in the death penalty, but I believe with all my heart you have to make sure due process occurs. I could care less about race. I hear these allegations about JEFF SESSIONS . I know J EFFand I know this is ridiculous. As I was listening to some of these broad statements just taking a swat at JEFFSESSIONS , a really fine, decent man, it took me right back to 20 years or so ago when I was that felony district judge in Texas and I tried capital murder cases, murder cases. Never mind the fact that I was courtappointed to appeal the capital murder conviction of an African American man and I did everything I possibly could ethically and within the 
law for my client, who I believed was wrongly convicted in this case. His case was overturned after my argument. I was the only one arguing for our side. I was the one that solely did the brief. Even though the family paid thousands of dollars to somebody from another State, I did the whole thing. I did it all. I didn’t have a clerk do it. I did it all. His capital murder conviction was reversed. His mother used to bring me wonderful food. I loved her. I went to her funeral. She was just an incredible Christian woman and her funeral did her justice. Of course, then her daughter ran against me for Congress three times, but that is another story. Nonetheless, I can remember back when I was a felony judge and I got served with a subpoena by a defense lawyer. They had taken the position in a pleading in another court that, because I had allegedly appointed a disparate number of White people to be grand jury foremen over African Americans, I must be bigoted. Therefore, convictions in Smith County should be overturned. I think they subpoenaed another district judge or two. We had three. I knew that lawyer. He knew I wasn’t a racist. He subpoenaed me and made allegations in print before he even knew who had been on my grand juries during those years I was a felony district judge, but he made the broad based allegation that I must be racist and we have got to throw out these cases. Before I came to testify, he actually got the list of my grand jurors. I didn’t get to choose the grand jurors. Those were chosen by grand jury commissioners. The commissioners chose the grand jury members. I got to choose the grand jury foremen. I didn’t care about race. I didn’t care about gender. I appointed people because, when I looked at the background, the little bios we had on each of the grand jury members, I wanted somebody that was going to be a leader on that grand jury. I didn’t care about race. When the criminal defense lawyers did their homework after they made allegations, they notified me that I would not be called as a witness because I appointed too many African American grand jury foremen. Therefore, it was a disparate number of African Americans. It was too many. Therefore, I would hurt their case because I would show that maybe I was more biased for African Americans than against them. I didn’t care about race. I can remember a couple of grand jury foremen. One of them was, I think, an assistant school superintendent. I knew the guy. He was a solid citizen. I had seen him in action. He was a real leader in the community. He was an honest, fair man. I thought he would be great as a grand jury foreman. And he was. Probably the best grand jury foreman I ever appointed—she was a saint—was Ms. Glass. I knew enough about her when I saw she was on the grand jury, I knew she would be the foreman. That woman was a saint. She was organized and she called things like they were. You couldn’t help but fall in love with Ms. Glass if you were around her for any length of time at all. Those memories of getting a subpoena alleging that I am a racist until they actually did their homework and found out, oops, he may be too proAfrican American, we don’t want him to testify, I got that same feeling when I was hearing those allegations against JEFFSESSIONS . It is not based on facts. It is: Oh, we just had the feeling that maybe he was being unfair. I think somebody mentioned the Southern Poverty Law Center or something. I know that the Southern Poverty Law Center, in my opinion, after they incited hatred against the Family Research Council, incited hatred against other people. The Southern Poverty Law Center was supposed to be the antithesis of hate. Yet, they stirred up a guy so much that he would go into their lobby and try to kill people at the Family Research Council. It is more of this craziness. The Bible warns of us a day when up will be down, right will be wrong. I keep wondering, Are we there? We hear from people at the civil rights commission that maybe Christians are the big hate group in the country. Really? b2100 It is the only religion that is truly based on love because to be a Christian, you have to believe God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believed in His Son would not perish but have everlasting life. And then His Son so loved the world that He laid down His life for people, even as they called Him names and mocked Him. It is a religion of love. It is not a religion of hate. Yet, right is wrong, up is down, let’s call somebody that wants justice and fairness a racist. Really, is that fair? So, supposedly, JEFF SESSIONS —I think this was alleged at him at one point—is not fit to serve as Attorney General because he is for vouchers. Mr. Speaker, when you hear from African Americans here in Washington, D.C., about how their children have suffered under horrendous gang conditions in a school, and then for this Camelottype moment they got vouchers—they won the lottery—that Republicans pushed for, they got to go to great schools. These kids that had been oppressed and shoved in either being in gangs or dealing with gangs, they got to go get a good education because they got a voucher. When you have an African American mom cry before you and say: My other kids, are they going to have to go face the gangs? Why can’t they go be a doctor or an engineer? I don’t think it is hate. I don’t think it is prejudice that has your heart ache for a mom like that and says: Yeah, yeah, why don’t we give moms and dads or whoever is taking care of the kids money. You go to the school. It is not an indictment of public schools. We didn’t have kindergarten. All 12 years of mine were in public schools. I had fantastic teachers, incredible, inspiring. I was going to major in history at A&M on an Army scholarship, so it didn’t matter much what I majored in. I knew I was going in the Army for 4 years. I hoped to go to law school some day if we weren’t at war. But my math teachers in public schools—7th grade, Ms. Edwards. In high school I had fantastic math teachers. Although some students didn’t like them, I loved them. They were great. College algebra, we had a professor who let us either turn in our homework that we had to do for every—it was a Monday, Wednesday, Friday class— turn in the homework or he would give you one question at the beginning of each class. If you didn’t want to do the homework, you had to take that one question. If you answered it wrong, you got a zero for the day. I didn’t open my book until 15 minutes before the final and never did the homework because my 7th grade teacher, Ms. Edwards, and all my math teachers in high school were so good. I had the foundation. It was there. Of course, I enjoyed math, but I made an A. It was easy because of the public school training I got, but not every public school has that advantage. I had the advantage of having an 8th grade English teacher for a mother, and she was in public school until the brain tumor took her. That is a burden. You come home after football practice: ‘‘I am going to go lay down. I am exhausted, Mom.’’ ‘‘Oh, what are you going to lay when you get there?’’ ‘‘Okay. All right. I am going to lie down. Are you happy? Just cut me some slack. I am going to go lie down.’’ Well, that is living with a public schoolteacher. I miss her and love her. But because I think—or if J EFFSESSIONS feels the same way—I think he may—heck, if schools are not teaching children to read and write so they can excel and become president of their company or President of the country, then let them go to a school. I think public schools will end up winning out. They have got the wherewithal to have the best schools. They just don’t have any incentives. That was the purpose of vouchers, to provide incentive. I have heard the allegation that Trump, you know, was a birther. I haven’t had a lot of conversations with Trump. I have had a number of them. But my impression was that he never said that—maybe he did, I just didn’t hear him say Obama was not born in America. But I know I have heard people say repeatedly that, I, LOUIE GOHMERT , am a birther. Which is a lie. I have never, ever, ever said that. Yet, it became such a credo of the left, some 
guy on FOX News one night—I think he was on Megyn Kelly, a Democratic consultant. She says, Tell me somebody that hates—Well, LOUIE GOHMERT is a birther, he said. And if I recall correctly—I am pretty sure I do—he later wrote an article: Okay, okay, Gohmert never actually said that Barack Obama was not an American citizen, but he did support the birther bill, therefore, he is a birther. Well, that takes me back to August— I guess it was July of 2009; I believe it was—and my friend BILLPOSEY from Florida had a little 2page bill. It may have been 2 and just a hair at the top of the third page. I think it was a little bit at the top of the third page, just over 2 pages. And it was a good bill. I read the bill. I try to do that before I will ever agree to support a bill. And I read the bill. I recall that The New York Times and The Washington Post, I think around January of 2008, raised the issue of whether or not JOHN MCCAINwas qualified under the Constitution to be President of the United States because, apparently, he was born in the Panama Canal Zone. Gee, is that being a natural citizen, born in the Canal Zone? His dad was in the Navy, military. So, yeah, maybe so. The New York Times and The Washington Post raised the issue. I was in Israel during August when I got word that I was being accused of being a birther. I can recall out here in the Speaker’s lobby a whole slew of reporters wanting to know about my being a birther. One of them, at the time, was with The Washington Post. I knew she was a good reporter. That is why she is not there now. I couldn’t believe it. It was kind of: Et tu, Brute? Really, you think I am a birther? Well, I understand from the White House that you signed on the bill, and, if I recall the words correctly, it was to delegitimize the President and have him thrown out of office. I said, wow. I think those were the words. It was something like that, but it was exactly the words that every reporter who approached me was using: You are trying to delegitimize the President and have him thrown out of office? I think Doonesbury used words like that. So when, privately, this one reporter caught me in another place and said: I understand you are a birther; you are on the birther bill? I said: Are you talking about BILL POSEY ’s bill? She said: Yeah, the birther bill. I said: Have you read it? She said: Well, no, but I know it is trying to delegitimize the President and have him thrown out of office. I said: Tell you what, I haven’t been giving statements to these ridiculous allegations. I think I gave a written one I dictated from Israel, but when I was here, it was just absurd. I said: I tell you what, you read the Posey bill. It is just barely over 2 pages. You read that bill, and if you still want a statement from me, I will give you as long a statement as you want. The next time I saw her, I said: Did you read the Posey bill? She said: Yeah. It didn’t do anything they said it was going to do. Exactly. It was a very wellconceived bill. It was not a birther bill. But in the mind of Rahm Emanuel, he saw it as an opportunity to allege that someone was racist, a birther, accusing the President of not being an American citizen. Because my thought was: Well, if he is born to an American mother, what difference does it make? Is it really— But I do still find it interesting that the President wouldn’t come forward, as anybody else in America would, and say: Here is my birth certificate. It took Donald Trump making a demand for him to finally come forward. Who knows if that is the right one or not. But I never had any issue with Barack Obama being an American citizen. I didn’t have any question. I do think he should have come forward and shut down the noise much sooner, but I think he and Rahm Emanuel liked using that and liked to call people like me a birther even though it was an absolute lie. I never believed the President was not an American citizen. Yes, I signed on to that BILLPOSEY  bill. What BILLPOSEY ’s bill has been for, what, 11 years now—well, no, I am sorry, 8 years now it has been called a birther bill. All it did—anybody can go read POSEY ’s bill from back in 2009—it said, before a candidate for his or her party’s nomination, or pursues his or her party’s nomination for President, the party must make a determination that that individual meets the qualifications of the Constitution. And it would not kick in until 2012. So the crud these reporters were getting from somebody in the White House—maybe Rahm Emanuel. Who knows? It sounded like Rahm. But whoever sent them the information, whoever sent Garry Trudeau the false lies that he used for a strip never bothered to read the bill and see that the allegations of birtherism—whatever that is—was just a lie. It said beginning in 2012. Nobody was trying to get anybody thrown out of office, but that made perfect sense. So the next time The Washington Post and The New York Times raised an issue of whether or not somebody like JOHNMCCAINwas really qualified to be President, you would get it resolved long before that person got elected President. I couldn’t imagine a worse horror for America than to have someone elected President and then get thrown out after they are elected. We are talking about massive riots. We are talking about destroying this country, just dividing it even worse than this administration has been able to do on its own. I didn’t want to yank a President out of office, but I thought BILLPOSEY  thought of a very fair way to deal with it. By the way, those who were concerned about my friend TEDCRUZbeing appropriate to be President, meeting the constitutional requirements, I thought, well, gosh, if the left hadn’t so demonized BILLPOSEY ’s bill, he had the framework that would get this all out of the way long before you ever got to a party nomination so that the party had it all resolved, and you couldn’t come in at the last minute after the nomination, saying: Nope, you didn’t go to the—it would take care of it. I had a Supreme Court Justice say years ago: Gee, if there is no legislation that sets up a foundation or an enabling process, then don’t come running to the Supreme Court. If you are not going to do your job and set it up or have enabling legislation come out of Congress, don’t come running to us to fix what you are not doing. b2115 And he wasn’t talking about anything specific, but I thought about those comments. Well, great, the Posey bill would be terrific enabling legislation. And if the White House wasn’t so freaked out over BILLPOSEY ’s legitimate bill, the Ted Cruz issue would not have been an issue at all. It would have been long determined long before we got into a heated race in the primary, because before a party chair could accept the application to become a candidate, it had to determine whether or not that candidate met the constitutional requirements. And if somebody wanted to challenge, then they would need to come forward and do it at that point, and you get it all worked out. It was a good bill. But poor BILLPOSEY has been so vilified for coming up with a good idea that was branded as a racist birther. It was a really legitimate bill. And I keep coming back to this. It reminds me of what I am hearing being said about JEFFSESSIONS —a very decent man. I don’t try to push my religious beliefs on others, but it is a part of who I am as a Christian. I try to forgive others, and I have been amazed by the grace of God how I have been able to forgive people who have really jerked me around and even work with people that have really stabbed me in the back before. But I have been amazed. JEFFSESSIONS was called all kinds of things in 1986, yet 10 years later he is elected to the Senate. He never sought any kind of revenge against those who did him so unfairly and unjustly because he cared about justice and doing the right thing. This country needs to heal. If people are going to keep screaming racism when it appears the biggest source of racism may have been all those people who told me, well, I wanted to vote for the first Black American in our history and I really didn’t know much about politics, you mean you voted for someone because of the color of their skin? Yes, I wanted to be able to tell future generations I voted for the first Black President. 
I wanted to do that, too. That is why I voted for Alan Keyes in 1996. Sorry, Phil Gramm; I know you are from my State, but I just really thought a lot of the intellect and integrity of Alan Keyes, and I still do. That is why his son works for me. He is brilliant, fair, smart, and pretty doggone funny too. But I don’t care about race, and we need to quit throwing this ‘‘racist’’ term about. Enough already. Let’s give JEFF SESSIONS a fair hearing. Let’s look at what his record really is. And if he, like I did, opposed an unconstitutional punishment of a future generation who had done no wrong for something grandparents had done, then he is right. That is unconstitutional. It is unAmerican. I am grateful that Donald Trump has nominated a man like JEFF SESSIONS for the Senate. God bless JEFFSESSIONS . I yield back the balance of my time.
