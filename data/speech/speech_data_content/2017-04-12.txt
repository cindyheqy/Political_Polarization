Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the life of Mr. Kevin Lee Frye, who passed away on March 23, 2017 at the age of 53. Throughout his life, Mr. Frye was a respected leader in our community and an exemplary Firefighter and Emergency Medical Technician in both Prince William County and the City of Manassas. His dedicated service helped keep the people of Virginia’s Tenth District safe for over thirty years, and he will always be remembered. Mr. Frye began his career of service in 1983 with the Buckhall Volunteer Fire Department, Company 16, which is located in Manassas, Virginia. It was here where he held the ranks of Lieutenant, Captain, and Assistant Chief, In October of 1989, Mr. Frye joined the City of Manassas Fire and Rescue Department that both cooperates and coordinates with the Manassas Volunteer Fire Company and the Greater Manassas Volunteer Rescue Squad. He honorably served the City of Manassas Fire and Rescue Department for over 25 years, holding the rank of Lieutenant and also serving on the Health and Safety Committee. During this time he also served as the department’s Training Officer, cultivating a rising generation of new service members that will carry on his legacy of dedication as they continue their careers with Mr. Frye’s counsel always in mind. He always displayed both determination and dedication and continued his training and mentorship of other Firefighters and EMT’s even while battling cancer. Through his long and impressive career Mr. Frye became one of the most respected, senior firefighters in the entire department, and his memory will always be present as a true inspiration to both the department and our local community. In addition to his selfless legacy and career of service, Mr. Frye enjoyed fishing, completing home projects, and spending time with his family. He is survived by his wife, Stacy, and his two sons, Zachary and Tyler. He will be missed by the countless lives he has touched over his years of public service. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the life of, and bidding farewell to, Kevin Lee Frye. May he rest in peace, and his family be comforted. COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GUAHAN LIONS CLUB HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO 
Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and congratulate the Guahan Lions Club as they celebrate 25 years of public service to the people of Guam. The Guahan Lions Club was established in 1992 by a group of business people, teachers, accountants, engineers, and government and private employees who shared a common desire to give back to our community. Throughout its rich history, the Guahan Lions Club has championed numerous causes and donated thousands of dollars in support of charitable organizations. The Guahan Lions Club was charted by the International Association of Lions Clubs on March 23, 1992, and since then the club has advocated for numerous causes and donated thousands of dollars in support of charitable organizations. They were critical to the passage of local legislation, Guam Public Law 23–27, that sought to combat graffiti, and they held an islandwide ‘‘Graffiti Wipeout Camapaign’’ to remove graffiti throughout Guam and ensure that the island was clean. They have also been strong supporters of the Salvation Army, Guma Trankilidat, the Guam Memorial Hospital, St. Dominic Home Care, as well as numerous other community and non profit organizations. They have also joined other Lions Clubs in Guam and throughout the region in sharing their knowledge and expertise on ways to improve local communities. I join the people of Guam in thanking all members of the Guahan Lions Club for their invaluable work to our community. I especially congratulate the Guahan Lions Club’s charter members—Evelyn Angeles, Cely Aquino, Thelma Barrozo, Fely Co, Monito Co, Bella Duplito, Fernando Duplito, Aida Fernandez, Fred Flores, Mirasol Flores, Rose Hidalgo, Nydia Llarenas, Cely Nisperos, Romy Nisperos, Lulu Oliamot, Rolly Ricabar, Yolly Ricabar, Nora Sicad, Bernie Tiong, Lath Tiong, Emelio Uy and Gloria Villanueva—for their foresight and diligence in creating the foundation for their success. On behalf of the people of Guam, I congratulate the Guahan Lions Club on their 25 years of service and look forward to continued success in the future. 
Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 38th Anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which originated in the Congress, and which has been instrumental in protecting the people of Taiwan from the ambitions of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Along with the Six Assurances issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, the TRA forms the basis of our security relationship with one of our most important security and trading partners in Asia. The U.S.Taiwanese relationship has particular importance for my State of Ohio. Ohio’s exports to Taiwan are valued at over $500 million a year and are growing in value. Taiwan is also one of our largest export markets in Asia. Together, the Six Assurances and TRA remain the bedrock of the U.S.Taiwanese relationship, but we must do more. As the PRC forges everstronger links with its neighbors through trade and investment, so we must find new ways to strengthen Taiwan’s regional presence and secure our own interests in the wake of our withdrawal from the TransPacific Partnership. It is my hope that we take bilateral steps to deepen our own trade relationship, which I hope will culminate in a free trade agreement. Such a goal, when achieved, will enhance our own economic presence in the region and contribute to Taiwan’s freedom and prosperity. For myself and on behalf of my constituents, I celebrate our friendship with the people of Taiwan as this anniversary approaches, and offer my congratulations to them as we celebrate their democratic way of life. f 
RECOGNIZING RENARD GROUP ADVERTISING FOR 40 YEARS SERVING THE TYLER COMMUNITY 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in recognition of Renard Group Advertising, the oldest advertising agency dedicated to supporting and assisting the businesses, organizations and charities of Tyler, Texas. This agency recently celebrated 40 years of dedicated service to its community. As the representative and servant of the 1st District of Texas, I have had the privilege of knowing the city of Tyler, its blessed and beneficent inhabitants along with its very rich history. Renard Group truly and accurately promotes the pride, passion and personality of the people and businesses who make Tyler the remarkable and closeknit Rose Capital that it is and proudly will be for the future. Accordingly, congratulations is due to and extended in honor of all those who have contributed to Renard Group Advertising’s success, especially its founder, Michael P. Smith. 
HONORING THE 2016–2017 GONZAGA BULLDOGS MEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM AND THEIR REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of the 2016–2017 Gonzaga University Bulldogs Men’s Basketball Team. After a spectacular 37–2 season culminating in an appearance in the NCAA Championship game, we celebrate and reflect upon their success. This season once again demonstrated that Gonzaga men’s basketball is one of the nation’s elite programs. The Zags ended the regular season 29–1, a run which included their 3rd Advocare Invitational Championship, a number one ranking, and their fifth West Coast Conference regular season championship in a row and 17th since 1999. They also continued their run of 19 straight NCAA. tournament appearances by winning the West Coast Conference Tournament Championship, their 15th since 1999 and fifth in a row. This year’s NCAA Tournament was a watershed moment in the program’s history. After hard fought wins over South Dakota State, Northwestern, and West Virginia, the Zags defeated Xavier to reach their first Final Four in program history. And they capped it off, beating South Carolina in the Final Four to advance to their first NCAA Championship Game. Additionally, the individual accomplishments of this year’s team are significant. Guard Nigel WilliamsGoss was a standout on the court and in the classroom, becoming a consensus AllAmerican for his performance on the court and an Academic AllAmerican. Przemek Karnowski shattered the record for alltime wins in Men’s Division I College Basketball by winning 137 games over the course of his career. Head Coach Mark Few, who has been a leader in our community in both basketball and service, capped his most successful season by becoming National Coach of the Year. These individual accolades serve to highlight the overall success by this team. I also want to recognize and congratulate all of the individuals who were so important in this year’s success, including coaches Mark Few, Tommy Lloyd, Donny Daniels, and Brian Michaelson and all of their staff; Director of Basketball Operations John Jakus; Athletic Director Mike Roth; The Gonzaga University Administration, board of trustees, and President Thayne McCulloh; and athletes Przemek Karnowski, Nigel WilliamsGoss, Jordan Mathews, Johnathan Williams III, Josh Perkins, Silas Melson, Zach Collins, Killian Tillie, Rui Hachimura, Bryan Alberts, Jeremy Jones, Dustin Triano, Ryan Edwards, Rem Bakamus, Jack Beach, Jacob Larsen, and Zack Norvell. All of them exemplify the team philosophy of hard work, personal sacrifice, and shared values. Their success is an inspiration. So today, I rise to recognize the Gonzaga Bulldogs Men’s Basketball Team and the community that supports them—the current and former players, coaches, staff, students, administration, and fans. The Gonzaga Bulldogs have long been a model for excellence in college basketball, and have continuously exceeded expectations. We are grateful for their positive impact on Eastern Washington, and we look forward to their continued success. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE SIXTH GRADERS OF BLUE RIDGE MIDDLE SCHOOL 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the sixth grade students of Blue Ridge Middle School located in Loudoun County, Virginia and the adults who worked with them, in creating an extraordinarily successful One to the World Project, recently. Through the Loudoun County Public Schools’ One to the World Project, students have an opportunity to work on a challenging societal problem using critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity to make a difference in addressing or alleviating the problem. Students and faculty at Blue Ridge Middle School, as well as the staff at Mobile Hope of Loudoun and their Executive Director, Donna Fortier, devoted countless hours to this project and truly went above and beyond what could have been expected and I am proud of their collective efforts and generosity. The students decided to address the problem of homelessness and made arrangements to partner with Mobile Hope of Loudoun to deliver items of support to them. As soon as the partnership arrangement was made, the sixth graders of Blue Ridge Middle School enthusiastically began to work on a variety of videos, posters, brochures, and presentations in order to raise awareness for their project and to solicit donations. Impressively, the students received over 1,400 donations, ranging from clothing to household cleaning products, and diapers to canned foods. The project concluded with a visit and speech from Donna Fortier, whose direction and leadership truly guided the students. Not only were they able to see firsthand how local organizations like Mobile Hope of Loudoun can help those in need, but they also learned the value of being charitable. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Blue Ridge Middle School’s sixth graders, the school’s faculty, and Ms. Fortier for their extraordinary work on this project. Dedicating their time and efforts to helping those less fortunate attests to their unselfish character and determination to better their community. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE KANNAPOLIS MIDDLE SCHOOL HISTORY QUIZ BOWL TEAM 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Kannapolis Middle School North Carolina History Quiz Bowl Team for their victory in the 2017 History Quiz Bowl. This year, the team of Katie Messick, Robert Le, Tanner Sims, Raegan Koon, and Kandace Davis took home the top prize after beating five other squads in the competition. Originally sponsored by the state in a partnership with various historic sites, the Quiz Bowl pits local eighth graders against each other to test their knowledge of North Carolina and national history. After the 2008 recession, the state cut funding for the event but a few dedicated teachers kept the competition alive. Now the competition operates as a communitybased event showcasing exceptional students from both public and private schools. This year’s event brought a host of talent and I am extremely proud of all of the students who participated. As a history major myself, I have a deep appreciation for both our state and nation’s history and I am glad these students share the same passion. I am also thankful for the teachers and volunteers who made the event possible. I look forward to many more years of a successful competition and wish all the students well as they continue their academic pursuits. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in congratulating the Kannapolis Middle School History Quiz Bowl Team on their accomplishment. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF CAMP HOPE/CHRIS NEAL FARM 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Camp Hope/Chris Neal Farm on the occasion of its 10th Anniversary. Created by Gold Star parents, William, ‘‘Mike’’ and Galia White, the camp located on the farm in St. Francois County, Missouri, honors their 23yearold son, Marine Private First Class Christopher Neal White. Chris was killed in action in Al Anbar, Iraq on June 20, 2006. Not long after, the Whites began to develop their vision for helping wounded soldiers enjoy the great outdoors as their son had done. Camp Hope provides outdoor adventures for combat wounded veterans of the War on Terror and activeduty combatwounded soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors. Their Camp Hope experience is entirely free of charge. Camp Hope’s mission is to offer these combat veterans the chance to shoot skeet, hunt turkey and deer, fish, hike, explore the country, or relax around the everburning fire pit. The goal is to help them experience healing through nature. Since 2007, dozens of wounded soldiers from across the nation and all branches of service have laughed and cried together and found their own sense of peace at this 170 acre farm near Farmington. Volunteers—many of them veterans themselves—have helped to make the dream come true donating their time and money to these heroes on the homefront. In celebration of the 10th Anniversary of Camp Hope/Chris Neal Farm, it is my great pleasure to honor the Whites, the volunteers who join them and the combat veterans they serve today before the United States House of Representatives. 
Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the dedication and bravery of our nation’s law enforcement, especially in relation to keeping drugs out of our communities. I would like to commend the efforts of Wisconsin officers who are on the front lines to halt the flow of methamphetamines into our communities. After a threeyear investigation conducted by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, 19 individuals have pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute meth in central Wisconsin. During that period, the individuals involved distributed 127 pounds of meth, at a value of $5.7 million. These heroes in law enforcement deserve our praise. They go to work every day not knowing if they are going to come home. And they are leading the fight against meth, which has scourged our families and communities. Meth distributors intentionally seek to create new addicts in our communities by flooding the market with cheap product and targeting individuals. Our officers see the consequences of meth in the eyes of the children they rescue from homes consumed by this addiction. That’s why the fight against this epidemic is so important, and why we are eternally grateful for their service. I would like to recognize the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office, especially Detective Lieutenant Chad Collinsworth; the Wisconsin Department of Justice, Division of Criminal Investigation; the Wausau office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Marathon County Sheriff’s Office Special Investigations Unit; the Wausau Police Department, and IRS Criminal Investigation unit for their work on behalf of our community. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Americans to take the opportunity to thank a police officer in their community. They have our backs, and the least that we can do is to let them know that we have theirs. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DESEGREGATION OF THE PURCELLVILLE LIBRARY 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 60th anniversary of the desegregation of the Purcellville Library and to express gratitude for all those people of good will who helped bring about the change. On April 9, 1957, the Purcellville Public Library opened its doors to AfricanAmerican patrons, and on April 8, 2017, the community of Purcellville celebrated this important historical milestone with a series of informational programs and exhibits describing the Civil Rights heritage of western Loudoun. It is clear that we all owe a great debt of gratitude for the courage and tenacity of two residents of Purcellville, Samuel Cardoza Murray and his wife, Josie Cook Murray, who had a very successful upholstery business in the town. Around Christmas, 1956, the Murrays went to the Purcellville Library to do some research on ornate Austrian shades for a window in a customer’s home and were shocked when they were denied the opportunity to take out books that they needed. That incident began a several month struggle by the Murrays to challenge the library’s segregation policy. The Murrays’ struggle included being rebuffed by several attorneys, and experiencing various other forms of personal harassment. Although the financial wellbeing of the library played a role, a positive side of the controversy was the sentiment of the residents of Loudoun revealed in a petition and counter petition that were collected; Those petitioning to keep the library segregated got 44 signatures and those willing to integrate the library had 366 signatures, which was eight times the number of the prosegregation group. The integration of Purcellville Library has great historical significance as one of the first victories in the civil rights movement in Loudoun County. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking Samuel Cardoza Murray and Josie Cook Murray for their commitment to make sure that all young minds will be nurtured in our libraries, in our schools, and in our homes. f 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an American leader, a true pioneer, and my dear friend, Peg Yorkin, on the occasion of her 90th birthday. As a CoFounder and Chair of the Feminist Majority Foundation, Peg has been a tremendously effective and tireless advocate for women’s rights, setting an inspiring example for women across the United States and around the globe. Peg Yorkin’s visionary leadership and extraordinary generosity have made the Feminist Majority one of the most formidable partners in enacting groundbreaking legislation for women and families for over four decades. Strengthened by Peg’s bold vision, the Feminist Majority’s achievements include the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which contained a provision for monetary damages to women who win sexual harassment lawsuits; the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; the Violence Against Women Act, and many more. The breadth of Peg’s accomplishments is truly remarkable. In addition to her work with the Feminist Majority, Peg has provided outstanding support to a variety of other praiseworthy women’s causes including Voters for Choice, the Rape Foundation, and the Sojourn Center for Abused Women. Peg has helped to advance women’s access to reproductive health care in America and drawn the world’s attention to the plight of women and girls in Afghanistan. Peg’s leadership has spotlighted the vast potential of the national and global empowerment of women. With each day that passes, Peg’s legacy continues to impact women everywhere as the march for women’s economic, social, and political progress continues. It is my great honor to join Peg’s children and grandchildren, her many friends, my colleagues in the House of Representatives, and women everywhere, in wishing Peg a happy 90th birthday—and many more years to come. f 
RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF MAJOR JACK BORNHOEFT, USAF (RET.) 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the wartime service of Major Jack Bornhoeft, a longtime resident of the Village of Mount Prospect, Illinois. On April 3, the Consul General of France in Chicago, Vincent Floreani, recognized Jack Bornhoeft as a French Knight of the Legion of Honor. The award is an important recognition of Major Bornhoeft’s contribution to efforts to liberate France from German occupation. In 1942, Jack Bornhoeft, then only 19 years of age, volunteered for service in the Army Air Corps. He would eventually pilot a B–26 Marauder on 45 missions—participating in three major campaigns from September 1944 through June 1945. Jack Bornhoeft risked his life time and time again—participating in operations across France and Germany as United States and Allied forces fought against the Nazi regime. He and his crew regularly braved enemy fire, and their B–26 survived numerous hits. I am forever grateful for the service of Major Bornhoeft and his crew, and I believe that we must never forget what they and other service members went through as they risked—and in many cases sacrificed—their lives to defend freedom in World War II. I also want to recognize the Village of Mount Prospect, Illinois, and the French government for their efforts to recognize veterans like Major Bornhoeft who have done their duty and deserve recognition. I Thank Major Bornhoeft, for all that he has done for our country. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IN THE YEAR OF ITS BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University of Michigan in the year of its bicentennial. Since 1817, the University of Michigan has established a reputation as one of the world’s foremost centers of learning and research, and has produced generations of leaders, scholars and innovators. Founded in 1817 in Detroit, Michigan, the University of Michigan has since evolved to become one of the United States’ great public institutes of higher education. The university was moved to its current location in Ann Arbor in 1837, where it continued to expand and develop. Today, the University of Michigan contains nineteen colleges, including prominent 
graduate schools of medicine, law and business, and educates tens of thousands of undergraduate and postgraduate students each year. Michigan also serves as one of the leading centers of research and played a key role in developing key scientific breakthroughs such as a vaccine for polio. In addition, the University of Michigan is well known for its student activism and was instrumental in the establishment of the Peace Corps. The university has also achieved excellence in athletics, with the Wolverines consistently competing at the highest levels of collegiate sports. The University of Michigan continues to serve the state and country by attracting some of the brightest educators and scholars and inspiring a new generation of leaders. Its alumni include twenty six Rhodes Scholars, political leaders including former President Gerald Ford, and leading innovators like Google co founder Larry Page. The university also has a rich literary tradition, having educated prominent writers and journalists including Mike Wallace and Arthur Miller. The University of Michigan has successfully pursued knowledge and truth for two hundred years, and I have confidence that it will continue to build on this outstanding legacy going forward. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the University of Michigan during its bicentennial. The University’s record of excellence in scholarship and research is worthy of commendation. 
IN RECOGNITION OF KRISSY GREEN AND THE DOUGLAS J. GREEN MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize my constituent, Krissy Green, for her devotion to United States military service members both here and abroad. Ms. Green, along with her mother, Suni Chabrow, founded the Douglas J. Green Memorial Foundation in honor of her brother, Specialist Douglas J. Green, who was killed in the line of duty in 2011. The Douglas J. Green Memorial Foundation is an allvolunteer, non profit organization that has been dedicated to providing comfort and support for military service members through the shipment of care packages since 2011 and planning memorable experiences for service members to look forward to once they return from deployments. Specialist Douglas J. Green enlisted in the United States Army in 2007 shortly after graduating from Potomac Falls High School in Virginia’s Tenth District and served two tours of duty in support of both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. It was in his second tour in Afghanistan that Specialist Green made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. Specialist Green was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star with a Combat V, a Purple Heart, an Army Commendation Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his distinguished and honorable service. He is remembered not only for his bravery, but also for his generosity and smile. While on deployment, Specialist Green’s family fondly recalled his appreciation of receiving care packages from his family and friends. He always enjoyed sharing care packages with his fellow service men and women, and, with this in mind, his mother and sister started the Douglas J. Green Memorial Foundation. As the Director of Activities for the Greater Virginia/District of Columbia region, Krissy Green maintains her brother’s legacy by sending care packages to troops, many of whom were friends of her brother. Ms. Green has established partnerships with local businesses and organizations in Virginia’s Tenth District, such as Soldier Fit in Sterling, Virginia, to host events to put together, care packages. Her efforts have allowed for her brother to be remembered and celebrated, and these efforts have bettered the lives of hundreds of troops overseas. Since 2011, the Douglas J. Green Memorial Foundation has continuously helped service men and women around the world, and I am grateful the organization holds many of its events in my district. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Krissy Green and the Douglas J. Green Memorial Foundation for its dedication to serving our nation and honoring the life of Specialist Douglas J. Green. I wish Krissy Green, Suni Chabrow, and the entire organization the best in their future endeavors. f 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor Reverend Eddie Perry, pastor emeritus of Saint John’s Baptist Church. Reverend Eddie Perry’s efforts and continued courage to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ through oratory teachings, community involvement and leadership are to be commended. He continues to make an indelible mark in Charles City and has served as the pastor of Saint John’s Baptist Church for several years. Reverend Perry is a committed husband and father whose continued leadership is an inspiration to his congregation and all those who know him—myself included. Reverend Perry is a dedicated man of faith. I thank Reverend Perry for his service. The bell of his lifelong achievements will ring for all of eternity. 
H.R. 1353, THE TRANSPARENCY IN TECHNOLOGICAL ACQUISITION ACT OF 2017 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office regarding H.R. 1353. The cost estimate was not available at the time of the filing of the Committee report or consideration by the Full House. U.S. C ONGRESS , CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE , Washington, DC, April 12, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1353, the Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Megan Carroll. Sincerely, KEITH HALL. Enclosure. H.R. 1353—Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017 H.R. 1353 would expand requirements for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to report to the Congress on the status of the agency’s planned investments in technologies related to transportation security. CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1353 would have no significant effect on the federal budget. According to TSA, the agency already collects data necessary to meet the legislation’s requirements to provide additional information about acquisition programs on a more frequent basis. As a result, CBO estimates that any change in the agency’s costs, which would be subject to appropriation, would not exceed $500,000 in any year. Enacting H.R. 1353 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, payasyou go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1353 would not increase net direct spending or onbudget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10year periods beginning in 2028. H.R. 1353 contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, tribal governments. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Megan Carroll. The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. f 
COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SMS CORMORAN’S SINKING IN APRA HARBOR, GUAM 
Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the scuttling of the World War I German ship, the SMS Cormoran, in Guam’s Apra Harbor, which occurred on April 7, 1917. The SMS Cormoran was scuttled by its crew on April 7, 1917, the day the United States entered World War I. Twenty six years later, on August 27, 1943 the Japanese freighter Tokai Maru was torpedoed and came to rest also in Apra Harbor’s waters. This Apra Harbor site is symbolic of Guam’s rich history and unique role in United States and world history, as this is the only site in the world housing two shipwrecks from the two World Wars. Originally a Russian merchant fleet vessel, SMS Cormoran was captured by Germans in the years leading up to World War I, and was transformed into an auxiliary cruiser which Germany docked in the Chinese province of Tsingtao, a small German colony at the time. 
In December of 1914, the SMS Cormoran was chased by Japanese warships on a routine trip, and running low on fuel, docked at Apra Harbor on Guam. At the time, Guam was a U.S. territory, and the United States was a neutral nation. The SMS Cormoran’s captain, Captain Adalbert Zuckschwerdt requested fuel and provisions from Guam’s naval Governor William Maxwell, who promptly denied the request due to the United States’ neutrality. Instead he gave Captain Zuckschwerdt two options—to leave Guam immediately or remain interned. Captain Zuckschwerdt chose to remain on island. On April 7, 1917 the United States entered World War I, and naval Governor Roy Smith ordered Captain Zuckschwerdt to surrender his personnel and the SMS Cormoran. While Captain Zuckschwerdt surrendered his personnel, he ordered the crew to scuttle the vessel. American soldiers noticed the activity and fired a warning shot, which signified America’s first engagement with Germany the very same day we declared our entry into World War I. Six German soldiers died in the scuttling of SMS Cormoran and they were buried with full military honors at the U.S. Naval Cemetery. In 1975, the wreck of the SMS Cormoran was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. I commend the work of the Guam Visitors Bureau and all other stakeholders for organizing an event to commemorate 100th anniversary of the SMS Cormoran’s sinking, which prompted the first American action upon its entry into World War I. This ceremony highlights Guam’s unique history in world events and provides an opportunity to showcase the distinctive historical sites that are only available on our island. 
CONGRATULATING THE LOUDOUN VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL BOYS’ BASKETBALL TEAM ON WINNING THE 4A STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a boys’ basketball team from Loudoun Valley High School, in our Tenth Congressional District, who recently won the 4A State Championship. Their dedication, hard work, and perseverance, along with guidance and direction of head coach, Chad Dawson and assistant head coach, Josh Mallory, helped earn their school’s boys’ basketball program its first state championship title. The Loudoun Valley Vikings opened the state tournament with an impressive 83–61 win over the 2016 state champions, the Monacan Chiefs of Chesterfield, in the quarterfinals. The Vikings then prevailed over the George Washington Eagles of Danville in the semifinals. The game was initially close as the Vikings were only leading by eight points at the end of the first half, but they persevered as their endurance led the Vikings to yet another victory. In the state championship game, the Vikings faced the Eagles of Jamestown City County who entered the game with a remarkable 27–3 record for the season. While the Eagles were a formidable opponent and should be applauded for their effort, the Vikings handily won the game as the skills that their coaches instilled in them shined from start to finish. The Viking’s championship victory marked the conclusion of an impressive 30–1 team record for the season. We are all proud of these young men and their coaches. Loudoun Valley High School’s basketball team, their coaching and athletic training staff as well as School Athletic Director, Kris Kelican, have made Loudoun County and Virginia’s Tenth Congressional District proud. Winning a state championship is an extraordinary achievement and it attests to the team’s noteworthy athletic talent, laudable work ethic, commitment to teamwork, tireless dedication, and determination to succeed. I also want to commend the Vikings’ excellent coaching staff, as without their mentorship this would not have been possible. The Loudoun Valley basketball program has certainly earned this distinct honor, and the leadership that sports instill and the sportsmanship these young men have acquired in their athletic student careers will valuably serve them in their future academic endeavors and dedication to athletics. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the Loudoun Valley Vikings on winning the 4A State Championship and representing Virginia’s Tenth Congressional District with such distinction. I am proud to represent these students and wish them all the best in their future endeavors.
