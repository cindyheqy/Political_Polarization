Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the outstanding service and heroism of one of California’s finest, Riverside County Sheriff’s Deputy David Solis, who serves in Coachella, California. On May 25, 2017, Deputy Solis engaged in a chase with a suspect in a vehicle, which led to a foot pursuit. The suspect unexpectedly drew a firearm and shot Deputy Solis six times at close range. Though he was critically injured, Deputy Solis continued to feed his team information, ensuring other officers could secure the area, which led to the eventual capture of the suspect. Incredibly, Deputy Solis was back to work after just 4 months of recovery. His bravery, strength, and professionalism exemplify the very best in law enforcement, which is why his department selected him to receive the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor for exhibiting ‘‘extraordinary valor above and beyond the call of duty.’’ It is the highest decoration for public safety officers. Deputy Solis, you truly embody these values. Your courage has made our entire valley a safer place. You and all law enforcement officers put yourselves in harm’s way each day to keep us safe. On behalf of my wife, Monica, and the entire 36th Congressional District, I thank you, Martha, and your children—Caleb, Jonah, Grace, Jeremy, and Penny—for your service and sacrifice. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, the tax plan being considered in conference right now will be devastating for the people I represent, in particular, seniors, homeowners, students, and taxpaying middle class Californians. According to every nonpartisan estimate out there, this tax plan will blow a giant hole in our deficit, a $1 trillion hole, in fact. So my first question is: Who is going to pay for it? Well, next year it will be our seniors, to the tune of $25 billion in cuts to Medicare. And 10 years from now? We will be looking at cuts to programs that invest in our children and our future, like Pell grants for our students. My next question is: Who will actually benefit? Well, it won’t be California homeowners, who, on average, will see their taxes go up by $800 a year. It won’t be hardworking families in southern California, who will be doubletaxed on their income. It will be corporations that will get free rein to ship jobs overseas, because any income ‘‘earned’’ abroad will be completely tax free. It will be the wealthiest 1 percent who get more than 50 percent of the tax cuts in this plan, while sticking our children with the bill. I want to simplify and modernize our Tax Code to give middle class families the purchasing power they need to improve their lives and spark the economy. This plan, unfortunately, will further burden the middle class for the benefit of millionaires. So, let’s start over. Let’s come back to the table to make real, bipartisan tax reform a reality and to give real tax cuts to all the people we serve. f 
HONORING PAUL WENGER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor a true friend and advocate of agriculture. For the past 8 years, Paul Wenger has led the California Farm Bureau with passion and dedication, ensuring that one of our State’s most vital industries remains at the forefront worldwide. As a longtime native of California’s Tenth District and the city of Modesto, Paul has consistently been engaged in making our community a better place. As a thirdgeneration farmer, Paul grows almonds and walnuts on the family farm, which includes property purchased by his grandfather in 1910. His farming operation also includes a marketing component for processed almonds and walnuts through his Wood Colony Nut Company. Paul attended Modesto Junior College, or MJC, before transferring to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where he earned a degree in animal science. From 1990 to 1994, he served as president of the Stanislaus County Farm Bureau. Three years later, Paul became a statewide officer, when he was elected second vice president. He was then elected first vice president in 2005. He also served as a member of the Bureau’s board of directors and chaired its water advisory committee and water development task force. Since 2009, Paul has served as president of the statewide California Farm Bureau. He has been on the front lines fighting for water rights and supplies, less government overreach, immigration reform, and sustainable working lands that are essential to keeping farming and ranching alive. In 2014, he received the Stanislaus Farm Bureau’s Distinguished Service Award and has been long praised for his effective messaging, engagement, passion, and unwavering principles. Paul has successfully given California a strong voice at the national table by serving on the board of directors for the American Farm Bureau. Alongside his work to advocate for our region at the State and national level, Paul has dedicated countless hours to our local community as well. He served on the Salida Volunteer Fire Department, the HartRansom School Board of Trustees, the Central Valley Farmland Trust Trustee Council, and the Stanislaus Land Trust and Agricultural Pavilion boards, just to name a few. He has been very active. Paul’s tenure as president ends this year, but I am confident he will continue to play a vital role in the advocacy and evolution of our agriculture industry. I thank Paul for his hard work and continued friendship. I thank his wife, Deborah, his three sons, and their grandchildren for graciously sharing Paul with the farmers, ranchers, and our community, who have relied on his leadership. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and recognizing my good friend for his unwavering leadership, accomplishments, and contributions on behalf of the agriculture industry. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LOWELL HAWTHORNE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. CLARKE ) for 5 minutes. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to a great man, a loving husband and father, a visionary entrepreneur, a philanthropist and humanitarian, my beloved and dear friend, Mr. Lowell Hawthorne of the Bronx, New York. Lowell Hawthorne immigrated to the United States from the beautiful island nation of Jamaica in 1981 and, like most immigrants to our country, began his pursuit of the American Dream. After working his way up the administrative ranks of the New York City Police Department as an accountant handling police pensions, he was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug and started a homebased business doing tax returns for coworkers and friends on the force. Determined to provide for his family a life that he never had, in 1989, inspired by his father and sisters, who were bakers, and with the financial support of his wife and siblings, he would go on to open the first Golden Krust Bakery, on East Gun Hill Road in the Bronx, New York. His specialties included the Jamaican beef patty, Caribbean baked goods, and other culinary delights. From there, his entrepreneurial talents, work ethic, and dogged determination allowed him to soar, methodically expanding his empire to include over 120 stores in nine States across the country. Golden Krust Caribbean Bakery & Grill would become the first CaribbeanAmericanowned business in the United States to be granted a franchise license. Producing more than 50 million beef, chicken, and vegetable patties a year, Golden Krust is also the largest CaribbeanAmericanowned business in the Nation. Lowell has been described by his employees as a nice boss, a wonderful guy, 
a Godfearing man, also, as someone who cared deeply for his staff, his family, his community, and the beloved land of his birth, Jamaica. He leaves to cherish his legacy his devoted wife of 34 years, Lorna, and his four children, who all worked for the company: Daren, Omar, Monique, and Haywood. I admire Lowell for bringing our shared love of Jamaican culture to life on a larger scale through food and fellowship. His success story is an inspiration to all who continue to dream the American Dream. I personally was honored to have known him. As part of a tightknit Caribbean diaspora and Jamaican community, he was considered a beloved part of my extended family, so much so that my mother adopted him, as mothers often do, and took him under her wing and into her heart. Lowell was more than a friend; he was a brother. Today, I honor his life and living legacy. I will miss my friend and will cherish him always. On behalf of the people of the Ninth Congressional District of New York, the Clarke family, and myself, I wish to express my most deepest, profound condolences to the family and friends of the honorable Lowell Hawthorne. 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD INVESTIGATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY) for 5 minutes. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, a few days ago, we learned of the Department of Justice’s decision to open an investigation in the appalling practice of abortion providers harvesting and trafficking aborted babies’ body parts for profit—finally. Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues surely remember, in July of 2015, senior Planned Parenthood officials were caught on camera discussing how abortion procedures could systematically be altered in order to preserve certain organs so that they could be sold to researchers. They talked of ‘‘crushing’’ here and ‘‘crushing’’ there, being careful to preserve little parts of a baby’s body because they are valuable on the research market. They talked of menus for organs and how lucrative these arrangements could be. It was sick, callous, and completely inhuman. It also happens to be against the law. Soon thereafter, several of my colleagues and I called for an investigation into these disturbing revelations. But, Mr. Speaker, our demands fell on deaf ears. Attorney General Loretta Lynch turned a blind eye and didn’t pursue an investigation. Even after multiple congressional committees referred their own investigations to the authorities at the Department of Justice, nothing was done. At the time, I said it was disappointing, but hardly surprising. We all know how much political weight Planned Parenthood throws around in this town. But, Mr. Speaker, in this country, no one is above the law. That is why I was so pleased to receive word that the Department of Justice, now under the leadership of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, appears to be following up on the evidence and taking our calls for an investigation seriously. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, who I am proud to say was formerly my chief of staff, requested unredacted documents from the committee’s investigation into the suspected harvesting and trafficking of fetal tissue. He said, for now, the documents are for investigative use only, and a formal resolution may be required for further proceedings, such as a grand jury. I appreciate the Department of Justice’s attention to this, and I know I am not the only one who will be watching this closely. When the terrible videos first surfaced in 2015, I immediately came to the House floor and stood right here in the well and spoke out about this outrageous activity. Someone later told me I was the first one to speak on the floor, and, Mr. Speaker, I will be the last, if I have to. I said then: ‘‘I promise . . . we are not done talking about this.’’ Today, I am glad that has proven to be true. f 
b1030 LET’S TAKE CARE OF THOSE AT THE BOTTOM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, again, I express my gratitude for the opportunity to speak from the well of the Congress of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I believe that there is some misinformation being accorded the American people. Misinformation because there seems to be a belief among those who are pushing a tax plan that will put us an additional $1.5 trillion, more or less, in debt. There seems to be the notion being pushed that somehow by giving major corporations major breaks, these major corporations will make a major concession and they will move major amounts of dollars down to those who work at the very lower levels of their businesses: those who clean the floors. Those who are there, they are called the night crew, and they make it possible for those who come in, in the daylight, to have a clean office and a better work environment. There seems to be a notion that somehow there will be a trickle down to them. I don’t see the empirical evidence to support this position. I encourage my friends who believe in trickle down to move to bubble up and allow the minimum wage to be raised. Raise the minimum wage and make it a living wage. If you can get it to those at the top, why not assure those at the bottom some degree of benefit from the $1.5 trillion? You but only have to decide that you will make a part of this tax bill a raise in the minimum wage. Make it so. You can do it. And if you should do it, you will find that there will be some people who will appreciate the fact that you didn’t just look out for those at the top, that you also decided that you were going to take care of those at the bottom. Finally this, Mr. Speaker, to those who believe that people will pull themselves up by bootstraps that they don’t have, please know this: Dear brothers and sisters: People who are poor cannot do more with less. There is a belief that if you are rich, you need more to do more. But if you are poor, you can do more with less. If poor people could do more with less, there would be no poor people. Let’s take care of those at the bottom. Let the system bubble up, as opposed to trickle down. f 
MODERNIZING SNAP The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an issue that is receiving a lot of attention both in the media and in the House Agriculture Committee, and that is our Nation’s largest antihunger problem, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. As we approach the upcoming farm bill, I would offer a brief perspective, something that I have been keeping in the front of my mind throughout all of these conversations. Mr. Speaker, SNAP is about families that are living paycheck to paycheck here in our Nation. It is about helping households across this country, not so much worry about where the next meal is coming from, but letting them worry more about their children’s education, their own work, and, quite frankly, their own future. It is about helping every citizen realize the American Dream by modernizing a program that helps lift folks out of poverty, rather than trapping them there. Mr. Speaker, this will not be easy. There will be people who demonize our efforts. Some will even criticize the process. We will have those who paint doomsday scenarios about what we are trying to get done. Some will say it is too much, too soon, and too fast. Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. Our committee has spent 3 years examining every aspect of this program. We have heard from citizens across this Nation who have been helped by SNAP, and we identified modest improvements that we believe will better serve those in greatest need. 
Mr. Speaker, we must get this policy right. As I said, we must get this policy right. I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that these reforms are about maintaining the American value of generosity, a generosity that says no American should go to bed hungry each night. But, Mr. Speaker, it also strengthens that great American tradition of self efficiency that compels us to work to improve our own stations in life. By doing this, by modernizing SNAP, by making these changes that incentivize work, encouraging collaboration, and promote and improve access, we will be ensuring better nutrition for our American families. And, as budgets tighten in our country and across this government, we will be preserving a program that must be preserved for future generations. 
HONORING JIM HASLAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, one of the finest men I have ever known, Jim Haslam, turns 87 today. Mr. Haslam is one of the greatest leaders Tennessee has ever had, and he is certainly our greatest philanthropist. He came to the University of Tennessee at the age of 17 to play football for the legendary football coach, General Robert Neyland. He played on some of the greatest teams in Tennessee history, teams that won almost every game, losing only four games in the 3 years that Jim Haslam played. In 1958, he bought a small gas station in Gate City, Virginia, on the Tennessee line. I believe I read at one point that he paid just $6,000 for that four pump station. Through much hard work and long hard hours, he slowly built that one little gas station into the Pilot Flying J chain. He is still involved in the business today. We frequently tell people in the military: Thank you for your service. That is a good thing to do. However, we don’t show nearly enough appreciation for people who start small businesses, turn them into bigger businesses, and provide good jobs for people and their families. The Pilot Flying J Company now has over 750 travel centers in 43 States and in Canada, and provides jobs for over 27,000 people. Very few people in this world can say that they are providing jobs for 27,000 people. Jim Haslam has now contributed over $100 million to the University of Tennessee. He and his family have contributed very large sums of money to almost every good cause in east Tennessee, in addition to the university. He and his wife, Natalie, do not just contribute money. They are very active in all sorts of civic and charitable groups in Knoxville. He is also a very patriotic man and has great love for this country. He served his country in our Nation’s military. He is one of the biggest contributors to the Republican Party in this Nation and is personally involved in many campaigns. He has been a very good friend and supporter for both me and my late father, and I am very grateful to him. Most important of all, Jim Haslam has been a good family man. He and his late wife raised three children. Then, many years ago, he married Natalie, a longtime friend; and between them, they raised six outstanding children. One of his sons, Bill Haslam, is our great Governor in Tennessee and a chairman of the Republican Governors Association. His other son, Jimmy Haslam, now leads the Pilot Flying J Company and owns and operates the Cleveland Browns football team. Through hard work, honesty, dedication, and simple human kindness, Jim Haslam has lived the American Dream. He has touched thousands of lives in good and positive ways. This Nation is the greatest country in the history of this world because of people like Jim Haslam. This Nation is a better place today because of the life he has led. I salute him on his 87th birthday and give him best wishes for many, many more. 
GRANDFATHER RANGER DISTRICT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Grandfather Ranger District of the Pisgah National Forest and community partners. Recently, the Grandfather Ranger District of the Pisgah National Forest received the coveted 2017 Restored and Resilient Landscapes Award from the U.S. Forest Service southern region. The Ranger District received this award due to efforts to produce a healthy and more diverse forest. This project, which began in 2012, has exceeded its goal of restoring 40,000 acres of forest for parkgoers to enjoy. Specifically, collaborative partners have worked together to remove understory fuels to decrease wildfire risk, restore shortleaf pines, and increase wildlife openings, while improving areas for deer and other wildlife to forage. These combined efforts of the Grandfather Ranger District and collaborative partners have yielded fantastic results for our community and our forests. I know that these efforts will benefit generations of outdoor enthusiasts and conservationists for years to come. I salute the Grandfather Ranger District and the many partners who earn the Restored and Resilient Landscapes Award. RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 40 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. YODER ) at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Almighty God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Lord, You are powerful and strong, yet You bend to Your people and show them mercy and sustaining grace. Help the leaders of our Nation make wise decisions in our day. May they look to You for guidance every step of the way until we stand in Your light forever. Set us all on a path that will lead to peace and security. Bless us this day and every day, and may all that is done within the people’s House be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mrs. LAWRENCE led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Daryl Busch, the former mayor of Perris, California, who passed away earlier this month. As a U.S. Navy veteran, a smallbusiness owner, and a pillar of the Perris community, Mayor Busch’s commitment to public service was never in doubt. His professionalism, class, and compassion are just a few of the many reasons he was elected mayor of Perris for six consecutive terms. During his tenure, the city emerged from serious financial challenges to become a stable and growing community, and his leadership was critical to completing the Metrolink extension, which now connects Perris to neighboring communities. The foundation he built during his 17 years of public service will benefit the city and its residents for years to come. My thoughts are with Kay, his wife of 57 years, their son, Barry, and the rest of the Busch family. 
KEEPING OUR CHILDREN INSURED (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of helping children who, through no fault of their own, have no health insurance. These are children who are ineligible for Medicaid, and their family cannot afford private insurance. CHIP, or Children’s Health Insurance Program, helps these children receive coverage. In Kansas, more than 79,000 vulnerable children are enrolled in CHIP. That is why I have worked to preserve and strengthen it during my time in Congress. Last month, I voted for reauthorizing CHIP for 5 more years, through 2022. This invaluable benefit to kids in Kansas and across the country was included as part of a bipartisan bill called the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, which passed the House last month and now awaits further action in the Senate. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass this bill and reauthorize the important CHIP program to ensure that families and children who rely on this program remain covered. f 
GOP TAX BILL INCENTIVES: AUTOMATION OVER JOB CREATION (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address my concerns with the GOP tax bill. Calling this bill the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is simply wrong. Adding $1.5 trillion to our deficit and assuming—and basically hoping—corporations will create jobs is irresponsible. There is no guarantee jobs will be created and no incentive for job training. This is wrong. In America, we have a skilled trade crisis. We cannot continue to operate our economy and jobs without skilled trades. We must give incentives to invest in new technology and equipment for our corporations, but we must do that while demanding that they also invest in skilled trade training and investment. Tax reform was a real chance to close the skills gap, reinvest in our workers, and create a 21st century job training program. 
IMPORTANCE OF TAX REFORM (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to emphasize the importance of the reductions and reforms reflected in H.R. 1, which the conference committee will work on today. People in my district and across America await meaningful tax reform. Most Americans paid too much in taxes. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last year that Americans paid more money in taxes than they spent on food and clothing. It is no wonder that nearly 60 percent of Americans believe our current Tax Code is unfair—it is. America’s Tax Code is currently chock full of special interest deals, while families living paycheck to paycheck and job creators need lower and simpler taxes now. Throughout this process, my approach has been to evaluate this tax legislation from one question: Will this improve the lives of the vast majority of the people in my district? That answer is, absolutely, yes. The Tax Foundation projects that the House plan will save the average family in Michigan about $2,200 a year. That is real money. Americans deserve to keep more of what they earn. I look forward to reviewing the conference report and finalizing the tax reduction package that will provide relief to all Americans. f 
LET’S VOTE NOW (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge House Republicans to put aside partisan politics and pass the Dream Act. This fall, I have shared story after story from the House floor of young Oregonians who have benefited from DACA. Sitting at this desk behind me is a discharge petition which will bring a vote on the Dream Act now. Unfortunately, this will require 24 of my Republican colleagues to join us in support. As of today, we only have two. This is despite the fact, if leadership put that bill on the floor, it would have overwhelming bipartisan support. We must act on this. It is clear that the administration is, at best, problematic. When asked about the status of DACA, this President said: They shouldn’t be very worried; I have got a big heart. But it was only a few short months later that he announced an end to the DACA program. The Dream Act must be passed by Christmas. We should do it today. Continuing to delay a vote on the Dream Act basically puts 800,000 recipients at risk, is irresponsible, and puts those lives in limbo. These young folks are doctors and teachers. The path forward is foggy, at best, right now. They deserve a better future. Let’s vote now. 
RECOGNIZING 2017 CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE WINNERS (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three high school students from Kennewick, Washington, as the winners of Washington’s Fourth District 2017 Congressional App Challenge. Seth Florman, Damon Fuller, and Kyler Zimmerman spent many hours creating and refining an app they named Powerhouse, which enables the user to take on the role of businessowner of an energy company. These students designed the app to illustrate an energy company’s responsibilities to the community and to draw attention to the challenges energy providers face. Thank you to our panel of judges and to the engineers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory who will be providing the winners with a tour of their great facility. The Congressional App Challenge highlights the value of computer 
science and coding, and I am proud to represent central Washington, where schools and teachers are dedicated to encouraging students to excel in STEM education. This year, the Fourth Congressional District’s App Challenge had the highest number of entries since my office began participating in the contest, which is a testament to the creativity of our young people. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Seth, Damon, and Kyler on their wining app, Powerhouse, and I look forward to their continued educational and professional success. 
RECOGNIZING ORANGE COUNTY CIF CHAMPIONS (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize not one, not two, but three championship high school football teams in my district. Anaheim’s own Katella High School varsity football team won their first ever CIF Division 11 championship victory. On December 1, the Katella Knights varsity football team brought a championship title to their school for the first time in the school’s history. On December 2, Orange High School, another public school in my district, brought home the Division 13 CIF title. Also on December 2, Mater Dei High School’s varsity football team won their first CIF Southern Section Division 1 title since 1999. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating these fine athletes, their coaches, and their outstanding football programs. I must say congratulations to the Knights, Panthers, and Monarchs. All three teams will be playing for their State titles in their respective divisions this Saturday. 
RECOGNIZING NICKLAUS CHILDREN’S NEW OUTPATIENT CENTER IN PINECREST (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami on the opening of its new Sports Health and Urgent Care Center. With this new center, Nicklaus continues its proud tradition as one of the leading pediatric institutions in the Nation. Located in my congressional district, just down the street from my home in Pinecrest, this center will provide injury prevention and performance training programs, as well as rapid care, to our young athletes through the cuttingedge therapy services found at Nicklaus Children’s Hospital. It will also serve as a resource to families to take their young children, sadly, in times of medical emergencies. For decades, Nicklaus Children’s Hospital has inspired hope and promoted lifelong health in south Florida by providing the best care to kids in our community. It prides itself in bettering south Florida one patient at a time. So I invite everyone to come out and meet the staff of the new Nicklaus Sports Health and Urgent Care Center this Friday, December 15, at the Suniland Shopping Center in Pinecrest from 9 to 11 a.m. f 
HONORING MAYOR VI LYLES (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Vi Lyles, who recently made history as the first AfricanAmerican woman elected mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. A selfless and devoted public servant, Lyles’ journey began in a deeply segregated South, requiring her to overcome numerous obstacles. After more than three decades in public service, she retired from the city of Charlotte and was then elected to serve two consecutive terms as a member of the Charlotte City Council, rising to mayor pro tem. Her leadership helped mold our city into one of the fastest growing cities in America and a beacon of the South. Mayor Lyles, mother and grandmother, is one of my sheroes and a role model to many. Like strong African American leaders who came before her, like Shirley Chisholm and Fannie Lou Hamer, Lyles’ election shattered yet another glass ceiling. As the 59th mayor of Charlotte, the story of Vi Lyles will be an inspiration to young girls and boys and women throughout North Carolina and the Nation for generations to come. Join me in welcoming and congratulating our new mayor, Mayor Vi Lyles. I look forward to our continued partnership to move Charlotte forward. 
b1215 STOP THE BLEED (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to help raise awareness for the Stop the Bleed training course. Recently, I had the opportunity to take this course, offered by the American College of Surgeons. This simple training teaches you how to treat bleeding injuries and help save a life. The most common preventable cause of death after an accident is losing too much blood after trained responders arrive. This past June, I saw the difference having these lifesaving skills can make when several of my colleagues and friends were shot while we were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game. We were fortunate to have the skills of former Army medic, my colleague, Congressman BRADWENSTRUP , who was able to apply a tourniquet to Majority Whip STEVE SCALISE and help save STEVE ’s life. Each year, more than 180,000 people die from injuries sustained from car crashes, falls, industrial and farm accidents, shootings, and natural disasters. Every American could potentially save a life by learning these very simple skills. I commend this campaign and I hope by raising awareness we will equip more Americans to do just that. 
GUN VIOLENCE (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about something truly heartbreaking. Three years ago, 20 children and 6 adults were ruthlessly gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Since then, no meaningful gun legislation has been passed in this Congress, in spite of widespread public support for commonsense gun reform. And guess what. We had another fatal shooting in Las Vegas, where almost 60 people were gunned down. And there was another one in Texas, where churchgoers were shot down while praying. In the last 4 years, two Members have been shot. Talk about hitting close to home. According to the CDC, on average, 93 Americans are killed with guns every day in our country. This is simply unacceptable. Our Nation also has the highest homicide by firearm rate among the world’s most developed nations. In October 2017, there were over 232 homicides in Philadelphia, meaning that the homicide rate was 8 percent higher than during the same time last year. The city of Philadelphia knows all too well the lives lost at the hands of gun violence. Promoting public safety and making our neighborhoods stronger and safer block by block is something I will continue to fight for. Mr. Speaker, the American people are tired of excuses and inactions. This is truly a matter of life and death. We need to look out for our Nation’s future and we need to stop this block by block. 
QUESTIONS SURROUNDING OCTOBER AMBUSH IN NIGER (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind Congress and the Nation that there are still many questions surrounding the October ambush 
in Niger during which my constituent, Sergeant La David Johnson and three members of his unit were killed by Islamist militants. This week, two news organizations reported disturbing details that raise questions about the true nature of the unit’s mission in Niger. There also is a question of who exactly was making the decisions on that fateful night: Was it the soldiers or their commanders back at base? According to one report, after being separated from the unit for 48 hours, Africa Command believed that Sergeant Johnson was still alive and may have been captured, tortured, and executed. The true story of what happened to Sergeant Johnson may be, in the end, a source of embarrassment for the Pentagon and this Nation, but the agency owes his family and the American people the truth, however ugly it may be. Mr. Speaker, I am committed to keeping this issue on the front burner and in everyone’s mind until we know what happened to Sergeant La David Johnson.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. This rule provides for consideration of two bills dealing with Iran and its continued support of international terrorism. In addition, the rule makes in order all submitted amendments. These bills were the subject of hearings in the Financial Services Committee and were marked up and reported favorably to the House. Both 
bills received bipartisan support in the committee, and I would expect that we will see significant bipartisan support on the House floor. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that Iran’s leaders have a threat to our way of life. We don’t have to look any further than Iranian support for lethal attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly through IEDs, to witness Iran’s hostility toward us. Going back several decades, Iran has routinely terrorized the Middle East and has sought to export terror worldwide. Iran’s numerous threats to annihilate our friend and ally, Israel, are a steady drumbeat that should continuously remind us of Iran’s threat. In 2001, the Ayatollah Khamenei is quoted as saying: ‘‘It is the mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to erase Israel from the map of the region.’’ In 2002, a leader of Hezbollah, which is a known extension of the Iranian regime, said: ‘‘If Jews all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide.’’ But lest we think these are the views of the past, the Ayatollah was quoted in 2014 saying that ‘‘this . . . regime of Israel . . . has no cure but to be annihilated.’’ And we could go on. The evidence of Iran’s intent on the destruction of Israel is nearly endless. Just yesterday, the commander of Iran’s revolutionary guards offered to support Palestinians if they choose to stage an armed uprising to take by force Israel’s newly recognized capital: Jerusalem. Any country whose leaders actively support terrorism against Israel and whose leaders take an official position that the nation of Israel should be eliminated from the Earth are, and always must be, a sworn enemy of the United States. But it is not just Israel. Other Middle Eastern allies in the United States have been the target of Iran’s hostility as well. Namely, Saudi Arabia has been increasingly threatened by the Iranian regime. In 2011, our FBI and DEA agents successfully disrupted a plot by Iran to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the U.S. here in Washington, D.C. The uncovered plot included bombing a restaurant in D.C. at which the Saudi Arabian Ambassador was planning to eat. The bombing would almost certainly have killed innocent Americans as well. The list could go on. Iran has fomented unrest in Iraq, has sought to subject Sunni Muslims to Shiite militias, has supplied the Syrian regime in its yearslong civil war, has supported Hezbollah and Hamas, has flagrantly disregarded international law by building a nuclear program, and has taunted the United States. b1230 Who can forget the image of U.S. Navy sailors, hands behind their heads, forced to kneel under gunpoint on an Iranian military vessel? Or the thinly veiled attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq using proxy militant groups? Or the numerous incidents in the Persian Gulf involving harassment of the U.S. Navy? Yet, against this backdrop, the United States entered into an agreement with Iran. The agreement, commonly referred to as the ‘‘Iran deal,’’ was opposed by a bipartisan majority in the House. It relaxed sanctions on Iran, opened channels for business investment, and allowed Iran a pathway forward on a nuclear bomb. Further, while having the impact of a treaty between two nations, the Obama administration chose to call the agreement by another name and, in so doing, bypassed the United States Senate. This political commitment by President Obama to Iran is the reason for these two bills today. The first bill, H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, targets the finances of Iran’s ruling class. Its goal is threefold: One, aid U.S. authorities in their efforts to eliminate money laundering by the Iranian regime; two, expose the sectors of the Iranian economy that are controlled by Iran’s rulers; and three, show the Iranian people how their corrupt government accumulates wealth for itself at the expense of the people. The Iran deal removes sanctions on many of the known corrupt government entities. This bill will provide the transparency necessary to reveal the level of corruption within Iran and to inform Congress and others about how to combat the flow of money to terrorists. It further exposes the ruling class by publishing this information in the most common languages spoken within Iran. The second bill that will be considered under this rule is H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act. This bill will instruct the Treasury Department to report on transactions of financial institutions related to the export of aircraft to Iran. Under the Iran deal, President Obama removed restrictions on the sale of American aircraft to Iran. In 2016, the Treasury Department authorized the export of more than 200 aircraft to Iran Air, Iran’s stateowned air carrier. Yet we know that Iran Air has been the transporter of choice for Iran’s revolutionary guards as they have ferried weapons systems around the Middle East. The absurdity of this deal to increase the revolutionary guards’ capacity to move weapons is selfevident. The bill before us today will require certification by financiers of the aircraft exportation deals that none of the aircraft exported will be used for terrorism or Iran’s weapons of mass destruction program. Due to Iran Air’s continued role in transporting materials used for terrorism, this is one step that we should take to help hold lending institutions accountable for their support of aircraft exports to Iran. Mr. Speaker, many of us in Congress know how bad the Iran deal was for our security and our allies’ security. That is why there was bipartisan opposition to the deal last Congress. While in the end we were unsuccessful in prevailing upon the administration to abandon its bad idea, we should continue to stand in the gap against Iran’s ongoing efforts to undermine peace in the Middle East and destroy our friends and, ultimately, the United States. Today, we have two bills that will help our ongoing efforts to thwart Iran’s terrorist ambitions. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and these bills. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes of debate. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, when the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action came before Congress, I made my objections very clear. I believed then, as I do now, that the Iran deal too quickly removed the sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, allowing Iran to remain a nuclear threshold state. However, like it or not, the JCPOA is now law, and it will be wrong to undermine it for purely political reasons. Unfortunately, that is, in my opinion, what my Republican colleagues are doing here today. This is not the way to handle our country’s foreign policy. Mr. Speaker, the most important question that you need to ask yourself at this time does not have to do with the substance of the legislation this rule provides for, but, rather, why on Earth this body is wasting what precious legislative time remains to bring these bills to the floor today. The checklist of important items that need to be addressed is long and time is short. Thanks to the inability of my Republican colleagues to govern, even within their own conference, we face the specter of yet another government shutdown next week. The Band Aid that Republicans came up with last week to provide funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which insures some 9 million children, expires at the end of the year. Utah, Colorado, Arizona, California, Ohio, Minnesota, the District of Columbia, and Oregon are just some of the States that have had to inform families that CHIP funding is nearing its end. Why is this? Historically, the Children’s Health Insurance Program funding has been a largely bipartisan effort. And why shouldn’t it be? We are simply talking about helping to cover roughly 9 million lowincome children and pregnant women. It has been over 2 months since CHIP’s authorization lapsed, and it is far past time for a sensible solution to this problem. Does today’s legislation solve this issue? No, it does not. We also have 800,000plus DREAMers waiting for word from this Republican 
controlled Congress. Will my friends across the aisle allow these fine young people to remain in the only country they have ever known as home? Will you let those DREAMers who have served this country bravely stay in this country so that they may start their own families here in the United States, start their own businesses, and go to college? The idea that my friends would drag their feet on such an issue, let alone actually allow DREAMers to be deported, is anathema to what this country stands for, and it will darken the beacon this country has been for millions of people since our founding: a place where those of differing backgrounds but dedicated to freedom and the rule of law come and make a life for themselves. Mr. Speaker, Republicans control the House; they control the Senate; they control the White House; and what has that control translated into for the American people? Absolutely nothing at this point. In fact, it is looking increasingly more like the first year of a unified Republican government in over a decade will end with nothing getting done. In an attempt to distract from their failures, Republicans have taken to blaming, and I quote them, ‘‘obstructionist Democrats.’’ They point to this side of the aisle as the cause of their governing woes. That is a neat trick, but the American people are not going to fall for it, and I think you saw that last night in Alabama where new stars fell on Alabama. It wasn’t the Democrats who tried to take healthcare away from 32 million people. It was Republicans. Thank goodness they failed. It is not the Democrats who are trying to give the wealthy and rich corporations a tax break on the backs of hardworking Americans. It is the Republicans. I hope this equally misguided effort likewise fails. I have some advice for my Republican friends. If, like this side of the aisle, you spent more time working on policies that help the American people instead of the wealthy and rich corporations that are doing just fine, you would likely see more legislative success. Democrats remain ready to work in a bipartisan way to accomplish all that remains left to do this year. We are ready to fund the government and provide for smart investments for the future of our country. We are ready to pull the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers out of unnecessary limbo and provide them with the status they deserve. We are ready to provide the funding and authorization needed to give millions of lowincome children the health insurance they need. The list goes on and on. But, Mr. Speaker, if Republicans continue to not even allow Democrats in the room to address these issues and if they continue to burn legislative time on the bills we have before us today, then it won’t be just the Republican majority that pays the price. It will be the American people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, we have two witnesses on their way. We started a little bit early. I reserve the balance of time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am expecting another speaker. If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up the bipartisan bicameral bill H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. Just last week, a group of 34 of my Republican colleagues sent a letter to Speaker RYANurging a vote before the year’s end on legislation that would protect the DACA recipients. This means, if we defeat the previous question and bring up the Dream Act, the bill would garner enough bipartisan support to pass the House today. Mr. Speaker, I ask how much longer will this body be complicit in the Trump administration’s assault on DREAMers? It is time we listen to the vast majority of Americans and this body and act to protect these courageous young people. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, when my speaker arrives, I will allow Mrs. TORRES to discuss this matter further. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, at this point, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, continuing, we are faced, as I said earlier, with another government shutdown. The National Flood Insurance Program, which is particularly critical to those of us in coastal States, is set to expire. The Republican BandAid to keep the Children’s Health Insurance Program funded will run out, leaving millions of children without the healthcare they need. The authorization of an important intelligence tool to keep this country safe is set to expire, and millions of Americans in California, Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands desperately wait to find out if they will receive the resources they need to recover from the devastating hurricanes and the wildfires that we have seen this year and that are continuing in California. I have said repeatedly that FEMA is not only dealing with hurricanes and floods, they are dealing with tornadoes and with all sorts of matters, and the wildfires manifestly have kept them occupied over the course of time. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ), my good friend, as I previously noted, to discuss the proposal that I spoke of with reference to the DREAMers. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, it has been 2 weeks since I last stood here to ask the House to bring the Dream Act to a vote. Thirtyfour of my colleagues, my Republican colleagues, have sent a letter to Republican Speaker RYAN asking for action to protect DREAMers before the holidays because they understand the urgency. What are we waiting for? Republicans continue to state that we have until March to resolve this issue, but that is simply not true. 122 DREAMers lose protection every single day. b1245 That means that 122 intelligent, hardworking Americans, by every right except birth, are losing their ability to continue their education, to work and contribute to our economy. Are we willing to stop the deportations of hundreds of thousands of young DREAMers or not? This is not a partisan question. This is the question of who we are as Americans. Let’s put an end to the fear and uncertainty that DREAMers have been living with these past few months. We have been clear. This Congress must not finish this year without providing a permanent fix for DREAMers, their families, and the communities that depend on them. It is unconscionable. This is not who we are. Mr. Speaker, many of my Republican colleagues support action on the Dream Act before the holidays. Many have said so publicly. The majority of Americans want us to act now. Mr. Speaker, 1,708 DACA recipients have lost their status since I last stood here 2 weeks ago. This isn’t hard. The fix is right in front of us. It has been here all along. We all know that the votes are here today, if this body only had the courage to act. And I know that the Dream Act would pass today if we only allowed it. I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we can immediately begin to bring the Dream Act and act on the floor today. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ), the former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) for the time. I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING because these bills that we are combining today came out of his committee. I want to thank him for his leadership in bringing these important bills before us today. I rise in support of H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act. I want to thank my good friend from Maine, BRUCE POLIQUIN , for his 
work in authoring this bill. It is a critical step, a necessary step in holding the Iranian regime accountable for its money laundering, for its terror financing, and other wideranging criminal activities. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, known by its initials, its acronym, IRGC, has long been at the heart of the Iranian criminal enterprise, controlling the better part of Iran’s economy in key sectors like oil, gas, telecommunications, and transportation. The IRGC’s business empire and monopoly of these economic sectors provides the regime with billions of dollars that it uses to do what? To feed the people, to clothe the people, to educate the children? No. To repress the Iranian people and to export the terror that it has done so much damage in throughout the world, and its hateful ideology abroad. Two years ago, I held a hearing of our Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, where we explored the role of the IRGC and, again, that is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. We looked at the role of the IRGC in Iran’s economy and we raised these very concerns, Mr. Speaker. So I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING for his leadership on this issue and his consistent efforts to hold Iran accountable, because that is what we are trying to do, hold these terrorists accountable. This is one of the many issues where the Financial Services and the Foreign Affairs Committees have done a great job of working together to implement targeted sanctions against the Iranian regime for its illicit activity. For years, our Treasury Department has been working to identify and to sanction IRGC leaders. They have shell companies. We have been looking at what these shell companies are. Let’s identify and let’s sanction them. Their proxies. Let’s designate and warn foreign companies about the risk of doing business with the IRGC’s connected entities. As fast as the IRGC can create new ones, we shut them down, new ones pop up. Unfortunately, the misguided JCPOA has made the Treasury’s job even harder, with the IRGC collecting billions from their financial windfall created by new outside investments in the very sectors previously targeted by our sanctions. So it is important now more than ever that the Treasury publicizes the assets controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the rest of Iran’s corrupt leadership for two reasons, Mr. Speaker. First, so that the longsuffering people of Iran, with whom we have no problem—we want to help the people of Iran so that these people have a window into the regime’s pervasive theft and corruption that deprives them of the most basic of commodities. Second, so that businesses stop funneling cash into these criminal enterprises that are financing terror throughout the world. This bill will help shine a necessary light on these nefarious actions of Iran both inside and outside of the country, and I urge its swift passage. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I would advise my good friend that I have no further speakers and I will be prepared to close when he is prepared. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I have two more speakers. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), a member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I speak today and rise in support of the rule for H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING also for moving this very important bipartisan piece of legislation through the House Financial Services Committee. Additionally, I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who supported my bill last year. Unfortunately, it got stuck in the Senate, so we are doing it over again this year in the House. Mr. Speaker, the primary responsibility of every Member of Congress is to help keep our families safe. Embedded with that promise is to support and defend our Constitution. Mr. Speaker, moms and dads in Maine and across America are increasingly alarmed by the frequency of terrorist attacks here at home, with another attempted attack 2 days ago in New York City. Mr. Speaker, today, there are 1,000 ongoing investigations of terrorist activity by the FBI in all 50 States. Mr. Speaker, that is why H.R. 1638 is so important. It is a commonsense bill that will help keep our families safe and free. In doing so, we should never make this a political issue. Mr. Speaker, the Iranian Government is one of the chief sponsors of terrorism and instability throughout the world. Their senior political and military leaders and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps train, arm, and fund terrorist organizations around the world. They have become experts at using the internet and social media to radicalize, to recruit, and to direct terrorist attacks around the globe, including here in the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, the Iranian Government has American blood on its hands. Now, there are approximately 70 to 80 top political and military leaders in Iran that control about onethird of its entire economy. They use their power to corrupt the telecommunications, the construction, and other important industries in that country. A recent investigation by Reuters found that the Supreme Leader in Iran alone has accumulated tremendous personal wealth through a foundation claiming to help the poor. So while the corruption has grown, the average Iranian citizen earns the equivalent of $15,000 per year. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Maine. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, the citizens of Iran and the people of the world should know how much wealth has been accumulated by these chief sponsors of terrorism and what the money is being used for. Companies across the globe looking to possibly do business with Iran should also understand what they are dealing with before they invest. That is why my Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act is a straightforward, main, commonsense bill. It simply requires the U.S. Treasury Department to collect, to maintain, and to post online the list of these 70 or 80 senior political and military leaders in Iran, their personal assets, and how that money was acquired and what it is being used for. My bill requires the Treasury Department to post this information on their website in English as well as the three major languages that are used and spoken, rather, in Iran: Farsi, Arabic, and Azeri. The information should be available, easily downloaded, and shared by everyone who wants to see this. Mr. Speaker, I might also add that this information comes from publicly available sources. It is not classified information. Now, I have heard folks say: Well, this is not a good idea to expose the Iranian Government’s corruption in their funding of terrorism, because, if you do, we might not be able to work with these people. Are you kidding me? These are the radicals who regularly chant ‘‘Death to America.’’ It doesn’t make sense to hope that they will abandon their support for terrorism by not shedding light on their corruption. Mr. Speaker, hope is not a national security strategy. My bill helps make sure Congress gets its priorities straight when it comes to this issue. Protecting American families here at home and helping to safeguard our troops overseas, where they are fighting for our freedom, is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, so let’s use one click of a computer from any corner of the globe to help expose the illicit activities of the chief sponsor of terrorism in this world. Secrecy and corruption breed more terrorism by governments like those in Iran. Let us stand up, Mr. Speaker, for every peaceloving nation around this world, and let’s stand up to protect our families here at home. Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate the time and the consideration. Please vote ‘‘yes’’ for H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I would just ask, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado has 13
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ), the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to come to the floor this afternoon to support House Resolution 658, the combined rule providing for consideration of H.R. 1638 and H.R. 4324. H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, sponsored by the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), is commonsense legislation. The bill would publicize assets associated with Iran’s Government and military leadership. It would require a report to Congress on the assets that these leaders control, how they were acquired, and how each and every one of these Iranian leaders uses them. The American people, the American businesses, and the international community deserve to know who controls money and assets in Iran. I am also proud to be the sponsor of H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act. My legislation would improve congressional oversight of any financing that the Treasury authorizes for aircraft sales to Iran. Every 6 months, the Treasury would need to certify to us that finance authorizations would not benefit an Iranian person who is transporting items for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, nor providing transportation for sanctioned entities. b1300 Treasury would also have to certify to us that these authorizations don’t pose a significant money laundering or terrorism finance risk to the U.S. financial system. If the Treasury Department cannot make this certification, the Department must tell us why, and it must explain to Congress the course of action it intends to take. I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, and I urge them to support H.R. 1638 and H.R. 4324. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as we approach the end of 2017, and with just a few legislative days left, the Republican majority is focusing on the wrong things. Plain and simple, the bills before us today are more evidence of that. Over the next couple of weeks, we face a terrifyingly long todo list, the outcome of which will affect every single American. Let me be very clear. My friend from Maine and my friend from Texas, my friend from Maine, especially, passionately put forward significant matters having to do with Iran. My recollection is that I, for one, as did many members of the Democratic Party, voted for the transparency that he calls for and are likely to do so again. While this is an important matter, it is not nearly as critical at this time that we be occupying this kind of legislative time. The simple fact of the matter is we could have put this on the suspension calendar and not been exercising ourselves in the Rules Committee, occupying legislative time that could be addressing the Flood Insurance Program, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and intelligence tools that keep this country safe that are about to expire. We could have been addressing the hurricane relief for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and southwest Louisiana. We could have been addressing the fires in California, Oregon, Montana, and other areas of the country. We could have been addressing the flood in Texas that devastated portions of that area, as well as, during that same period of time, we had tornadoes and other issues indicating how critical it is that we support these matters. We could have been dealing with a real infrastructure measure. Everybody in this country knows that our roads and bridges are in despicable shape at this point, and it is not as if we do not have the ability to do something about it. We don’t have the political will. So we are wasting legislative time here today with these daunting tasks before us, and this is what the Republican majority chooses to focus on: trying to pass a tax bill, for example, that gives most of the benefits to the wealthy and rich corporations while adding over more than $1 trillion to the deficit. I have said before: Look out. When we finish whatever this tax bill is—and now it is being called what it is, a tax cut and not tax reform that is needed in this country. When we finish with that, the next words out of many of my colleagues’ mouths next year are going to be, ‘‘We need to address the entitlements,’’ meaning Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. I can assure you that that is what we will hear from my former deficit hawk friends who are now in charge of this country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican friends, for the sake of the American people, to abandon this reckless tact and return to regular order. That is something that we are not doing and have not done. We have had more closed rules in this session of Congress than in the history of the United States Congress. They need to work with Democrats in a bipartisan way. I think Alabama told us that last night, and I hope that that message is pervasive and allows for us in this body, as well as in the other body, to understand the importance of everybody, all of these brilliant people that Americans sent here to work, to work together to solve many of the issues of this country and address its needs in a meaningful way, not the needs of the wealthy few. Given everything there is to do, anything less is abdication of our duty as legislators. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as my family and I sit around the dinner table, my wife, Perry, and my two children, we talk politics, not surprisingly, and there are times where we distinguish good from bad, and we know that Iran is an enemy of the good in this world. It terrorizes the Middle East. It seeks to eliminate Israel. It pursues the destruction of the United States. And yet, for some reason, the prior administration struck a deal with the Iranian regime, the same regime that has American blood on its hands. The two bills before us today begin the difficult work of once again ensuring Iran is stopped in its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and in its support of terrorism. I thank Chairman HENSARLING for bringing these bills forward and for my colleagues from the Financial Services Committee who have joined me on the floor today to make the case for this effort. I thank Chairman SESSIONS for his leadership on the Rules Committee and for providing the debate on this issue today. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the rule, supporting the underlying bills, and putting pressure on Iran to abandon terror and embrace peace. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 658 O FFERED BY  MR. HASTINGS  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment of status of certain individuals who are long term United States residents and who entered the United States as children and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 3440. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2396, PRIVACY NOTIFICATION TECHNICAL CLARIFICATION ACT, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4015, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REFORM AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2017 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 657 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 657 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2396) to amend the GrammLeachBliley Act to update the exception for certain annual notices provided

SEC. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4015) to improve the quality of proxy advisory firms for the protection of investors and the U.S. economy, and in the public interest, by fostering accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory firm industry.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity, over the last couple of weeks, to bring a number of bills from the Financial Services Committee to the floor. We talk so much about regular order and having a process where the committees are doing their work, where the authorizers are deep into the details, and then we are bringing those bills to the floor for the entire House to vote on. We have that opportunity again today. Mr. Speaker, the rule today brings two bills to the floor: H.R. 2396, which is the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act, it brings that under a structured rule, making in order the only amendment that was offered, a bipartisan amendment, offered by Mr. CLAYand Mr. T ROTT ; and it also brings H.R. 4015 to the floor, Mr. Speaker, which is the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017. We did not have any germane amendments offered to that measure in the Rules Committee last night, so we bring that under a closed rule today. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues—as is the way of my chairman on the Rules Committee—notice was sent out to all Members, and will continue to be sent out to all Members, for each set of bills that we consider in the Rules Committee soliciting any amendments or ideas that folks may have. We sent out that notification, but, for these two bills, we received only one germane amendment. Mr. Speaker, I won’t go into great detail about these individual bills because we are fortunate to have the sponsors here on the floor for the rule today. But what I do want to say is that this is another series in a line of commonsense, authorizing pieces of legislation, things that move through committee in a bipartisan way, that are going to make life just a little bit easier for the American people. We have a chance today, if we support this noncontroversial rule, to bring these two noncontroversial bills to the floor and make that difference together, a difference we all came to Washington to make. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to consider supporting this rule as well as supporting the two underlying pieces of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. This rule that we are looking at today has two bills under it, and this is the 56th closed rule allowing no amendments that we are bringing to the floor this year. Over the past year, we have not considered any legislation under an open rule that would allow Republicans or Democrats to bring forward amendments here on the floor. When the 115th Congress opened, Speaker RYAN promised regular order bills would make their way to the floor after hearings and markups. Instead, we have seen bill after bill rushed to the floor. Many bills haven’t even gone through committee or skipped hearings. That is true for the failed healthcare bill, and it is also true for the tax bill currently in conference, the major bill this Congress. This tax bill, that somehow we understand there is a ‘‘deal’’ on before the conference committee even met, was crafted behind closed doors, and no Member was able to offer their ideas on the House floor. I offered several bipartisan amendments in the Rules Committee, but they were locked out, as were amendments from every other Democrat and Republican that chose to offer amendments. The tax legislation would explode our debt. It is a giveaway to wealthy corporations and does nothing to help the middle class. Now, the benefit of having an open process is creating better ideas: having Democrats and Republicans bring forward those ideas, see who can muster a majority of votes here on the floor of the House, and include that in a tax bill. We are a legislature. That is how we are supposed to work. Instead, a bill was crafted behind closed doors to raise taxes on 78 million Americans and add $1.7 trillion to the debt. When you add to the debt, that is a tax on future Americans. Instead of taxing them today, you are taxing them tomorrow. The taxand spend Republican Party continues to add to the deficit and add to the debt day after day after day. Mr. Speaker, we only have a few legislative days left before the end of the year, and we have very important work to do, like reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program and funding the government for the remainder of the fiscal year. There are millions of Americans who have been negatively affected by devastating hurricanes and wildfires in Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, and the Virgin Islands, and Congress has not stepped up to the plate. There are also over 800,000 aspiring Americans who are at risk of being deported from the only country they have ever known as home because of the reckless actions of President Trump. Congress needs to act to find a real solution so DREAMers can continue to work legally in the communities that they live in, and they continue to thrive and give back to make our country even greater. We have a lot of critical tasks ahead, which is why I am really surprised, with all of this work to do, and only 7 or 8 days to do it, that here we are considering two bills where we will have our debate, but they are not bills of great importance. We are using our floor time—very limited, 7 days before the end of the year—when we could be debating tax reform and offering amendments, when we could be addressing the needs of the DREAMers, where we could actually be doing something about the deficit, reining in out ofcontrol wasteful government spending. We are not doing any of that. We are doing two minor bills that are favors for public companies, or whoever they are. I am happy to talk about them. I am going to do my role in debating them. One I am even fairly supportive of. But they are completely separated from the actual concerns of the American people. 
No wonder the approval rating of this institution is under 15 percent, because we continue to debate these minor bills under a closed process, when, this very week, we could have had an open process for tax reform. We could be voting on 10 or 20 amendments a day, passing some and rejecting some. I have no problem if I bring forward some Democratic amendment and it fails. That is the process. That is fair. But we have bipartisan, commonsense amendments that should be part of tax reform. Representative SCHWEIKERT and I have a bill to provide a de minimis exemption on taxation for use of cryptocurrencies, to allow them to be used for amounts under $600 in everyday purchases and to remove the specter of IRS enforcement. Let’s put it in. Let’s have a vote on it. Let’s see if a majority of Congress agrees with me. I hope they do. If not, I am a big boy. It is my job. I can go home. But to not even be able to fight for the issues that my constituents have hired me to fight for is not only the frustration I have, and not only the frustration many Republicans have, but it is the frustration the American people have with this institution. Now, let’s get to these bills. Typically, the Financial Services Committee did not hold a hearing on either of these rules. It is a closed rule. The first one, H.R. 2396, the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act, would remove privacy notice requirements for financial institutions to consumers that share or sell a customer’s personal information with third parties. We are all for reducing unnecessary regulations. When I get to the next bill, the Republicans are actually trying to add paperwork and regulations. This one does, but it picks a very poor one to get rid of. It gets rid of privacy notices for financial institutions that tell consumers that they can share or sell their personal information. Of all of the places to cut paperwork, why would you want to cut the one piece that consumers and retail investors actually care about? Back in September, 143 million Americans had their personal and sensitive information shared widely, as a result of a data breach at Equifax. Congress should be looking at ways to better secure our sensitive information—a cybersecurity bill, better information sharing—instead of actually making it easier for our personal information to be shared more widely and giving you, as the consumer, less ability to find out where it is being shared. A hearing would be helpful to understand the full effects of this legislation to see what the unintended consequences are. We do know that it would eliminate clear disclosure to consumers about their privacy rights— never a good thing, especially in these times—including a consumer’s ability to opt out from having their information sold to certain third parties. We can do better. The other bill, H.R. 4015, the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act, makes a change to how proxy advisory firms provide information to shareholders. It would require that they make their recommendations available to companies. This bill is problematic from a number of perspectives. Here is what it does. Proxy advisory firms provide independent advisory services for investors and have fiduciary responsibility to their investors. Under this legislation, they would actually have to open themselves up to lobbying for companies and add additional paperwork. They would have to register with the SEC, whereas they now don’t, before trying to issue vote recommendations or trying to change the corporate board. Here is who the players are in this fight: On the one hand, you have public companies; on the other, you have investors, which means your pension fund, and mine, Mr. Speaker. It means university endowments. I know you all don’t like those, and you are going to tax them soon. It means, perhaps, using an individual investor, through a mutual fund or other vehicle. So investors on one side, public corporations on the other. But the problem is: it is not the shareholders of the public companies, it is the insular governance and management structure of those organizations. Many of them do need to be shaken up in the name of efficiency. There are many examples of investor pressure that has been applied to good effect: to meaningful reforms and corporate governance; preventing conflict of interest, making sure that the board oversees the CEO are not just his golfing buddies, and he is on the board, or she is on the board, of their companies, too. I have generally been on the side of investor empowerment in that: not to the extreme, not to make it impossible to be a CEO on a publicly traded company, to run a publicly traded company. But, if anything, we should make sure that the actual owners of the companies are empowered to make the changes they need to increase efficiency. b1415 This bill goes the wrong way. It adds red tape and paperwork. It adds regulations to investors and prevents them from being able to exert influence in the same way they do today, adding one degree of additional regulation and paperwork to allow them to do the kinds of good governance activities in terms of running competitive fights for boards of directors. Now, I get that there is another side. There can be a steamy underbelly to investor engagement as well. There are some investors who only care about shortterm gains, who try to institute practices or bully management around in a way that is not conducive to long term value but, rather, just pumpand dump schemes that they try to make money off of, and I totally get that. But in general, it is the owners of a company to whom the fiduciary responsibility of the directors and the CEO lie; and we should empower them, for better or for worse, to make the changes to increase the overall productivity of the company. We should not burden investors with additional red tape, as Republicans are doing, by creating more bureaucracy and paperwork and compliance costs with this bill. Frankly, I was surprised to see this bill come out of Financial Services Committee because Republicans have been fairly consistent in trying to remove regulations from DoddFrank. That has generally been the approach. I supported the removal of some of those unnecessary regulations. Others are important regulations, like this privacy disclosure that I don’t think is a good idea. But here, they are actually adding reporting requirements above and beyond DoddFrank. They are out ‘‘Dodd Franking’’ DoddFrank. Republicans are saying there is not enough reporting; there is not enough paperwork; there is not enough money going to lawyers and accountants. In Dodd Frank, we are going to require that they file even more paperwork with the SEC. I think that is the wrong way to go, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to resist this effort to burden shareholders who actually own companies with additional costs and paperwork and prevent them from making necessary management improvements to the companies that, at the end of the day, are run for them, not for the benefit of management. That is why I oppose this bill. Shareholders should have a right to impartial information about the company in which they have invested. We should minimize paperwork where possible. I have been proud to support a number of bipartisan proposals to do that. This bill goes the opposite way. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to say sometimes there is a lot of pressure on the Rules Committee. You come down here and you have got some of the most knowledgeable folks on both sides of the issue, on both sides of the Chamber, and you have got to be prepared to refute detail after detail after detail that might confuse folks back home. It gives me great pleasure today to not have to spend any time refuting anything that my friend just said because the important thing about developing a reputation is that it is just laughable to suggest that Republicans are coming to the floor today to undermine privacy. It is laughable to suggest that Republicans are coming to the floor today to increase paperwork and red tape. And it is not only laughable, 
but it is inaccurate to suggest that it is Republicans coming to do this, Mr. Speaker. These are bipartisan bills coming to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. TROTT ). His bill passed out of committee 40–20; a huge bipartisan vote coming out of committee. It went through a hearing; it went through a markup; it was everything that makes this institution work properly. I appreciate him for bringing the issue forward to talk about the tremendous bipartisan effort that he has put together. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding and for his hard work on this rule. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule today, which allows for consideration of H.R. 2396, the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act. I would like to begin by thanking Chairman HENSARLING for guiding this bill through committee, and Chairman SESSIONS for his work on bringing this rule to the floor. I also want to thank Mr. CLAY for his very helpful amendment. One of the reasons I came to Congress was to reduce the regulatory burden in our country so that businesses could have the freedom to grow, thrive, and create jobs for hardworking Americans. This bill is about modernizing one of those outdated regulations that has been a burden to businesses and consumers alike, the privacy notification rules. Now, a couple of minutes ago, my friend from Colorado gave a very nice speech about DACA, about tax reform, about the public opinion of this institution; but the speech had nothing to do with consideration of this rule today. When he finally got around to talking about the rule, he said we should not allow the rule to move forward because the underlying bill, H.R. 2396, in light of the Equifax scandal, we should not be eliminating privacy notices and allow banks to circumvent those rules because it is going to hurt consumers. None of this is correct. This bill is a very simple bill. It deals with auto finance companies and it relieves them from the burden of having to send out privacy notices to consumers year after year when the policy hasn’t changed. If the auto finance companies change the policy, they have to send out new privacy notices. If a consumer calls up and says, ‘‘I know the policy hasn’t change, but I would like to see the rule,’’ they can go on the website or they can ask that the policy be mailed to them. This bill in no way harms consumers. Now, just last year, we passed the bipartisan bill that allowed banks to stop sending privacy notices to consumers if nothing in the policy had changed. This noncontroversial measure passed by voice vote, with Members on both sides of aisle realizing that companies were wasting enormous amounts of paper and money sending out duplicative and unnecessary privacy notices year after year. The bill achieved its goal. Millions of dollars that would have been spent on paper and postage were instead put back into our local communities. My bill builds on this success and extends the provision to companies lending money to people buying vehicles. This means that those who extend credit to consumers who buy vehicles from Ford, GM, HarleyDavidson, and other iconic American companies would receive the same benefit as banks, and, more importantly, consumers would no longer be bombarded with a neverending stream of little print privacy notices and policies that haven’t changed. This is a bipartisan, commonsense measure. I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and allow debate to begin on this legislation. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I include in the RECORD the Republican bill summary from the majority on the Rules Committee for H.R. 4015. 
COMMITTEE ON RULES  Pete Sessions, Chairman—December 11, 2017 H.R. 4015—CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REFORM  
ANDTRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2017 Purpose: To improve the quality of proxy advisory firms for the protection of investors and the U.S. economy, and in the public interest, by fostering accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory firm industry. Background and Legislative History: Each year, public companies hold shareholder meetings at which the company’s shareholders vote for the company’s directors and on other significant corporate actions that require shareholder approval. As part of this annual process, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires public companies to provide their shareholders with a proxy statement before shareholder meetings. A proxy statement includes all important facts about the matters to be voted on at a shareholder meeting, including, for example, information on board of director candidates, director compensation, executive compensation, related party transactions, securities ownership by certain beneficial owners and management, and eligible shareholder proposals. The information contained in the statement must be filed with the SEC before soliciting a shareholder vote on the election of directors and the approval of other corporate actions. Solicitations, whether by management or shareholders, must disclose all important facts about the issues on which shareholders are asked to vote. In general, state corporate law governs shareholder voting rights, including the types of corporate actions that require shareholder approval. However, Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules governing the solicitation of proxies for most public companies. SEC Regulation 14A governs proxy solicitations and sets forth the categories of information that must be disclosed in proxy solicitations. Largely as a result of the SEC’s regulations, proxy advisory firms now wield outsized influence in the U.S. proxy system. In particular, regulators, market participants, and academic observers have highlighted potential conflicts of interest inherent in the business models and activities of proxy advisory firms. For example, as indicated above, proxy advisor firms may feel pressured by their largest clients—many of whom are activist investors—to issue vote recommendations that reflect those clients’ specific agendas. In addition, proxy advisory firms often provide voting recommendations to investment advisers on matters for which they also provide consulting services to public companies. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the reason I do this is, my colleague from Georgia somehow said that it was laughable, this characterization that it is adding paperwork. That is exactly what this bill does. In fact, in this exhibit, this is a Republican summary of their own bill. It says: ‘‘The information contained in the statement must be filed with the SEC. . . .’’ The whole bill is about adding paperwork. That is what the bill does. You can argue it is paperwork all you want because corporate CEOs want it and many existing board members want it. Investors don’t want it. But we are talking about additional paperwork, and there is nothing in that statement that you can refute because the Republican bill summary explains that that is what they are doing. I mean, there is no disagreement. And he is correct. I am sure there are some Democrats who support these bills, some Republicans who support them, some Republicans and Democrats who might oppose these bills, but that is what the bill does, it adds paperwork. That is why I mentioned I was surprised to see it come out of the Financial Services Committee that, in general, had been more interested in reducing paperwork. Here, they are interested in adding compliance cost and paperwork to investors. Mr. Speaker, I have to say that if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up SEANPATRICK MALONEY ’s bill, H.R. 4585, which would block the FCC’s rule rolling back net neutrality from taking effect to ensure the internet remains open to all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. SEANPATRICK MALONEY ) to discuss the proposal. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can turn our attention to the issue that is so critical for this body to address right now. I speak of the Federal Communications Commission’s decision and its assault on net neutrality. The FCC is expected to vote tomorrow to eliminate the rules that protect 
our internet. They are about to fix something that is not broken. Now, maybe the words ‘‘net neutrality’’ make your eyes glaze over, but this issue is critical to anyone who uses the internet, which is really all of us, and it is not that complicated. We call the rules that protect the current internet ‘‘net neutrality’’ because they, more or less, keep the internet neutral for everyone. A neutral internet means we all have access to the same legal content and services no matter where or how we get our internet. These rules aren’t new, and they are working. In fact, when you think about it, one of the last places where quality really reigns in our society is on the internet. We don’t discriminate against the content or the intellectual creations of one young entrepreneur versus a big business or an established entity. It is one of the few places left in America where we are all on equal footing. That is the current net neutrality system that we must protect. The folks who want to end net neutrality say they need to rewrite these rules to spur innovation. Really, Mr. Speaker? It is hard to look at the internet as it has blossomed in America and say we lack innovation. Innovation is everywhere. Look at all the new apps, websites, devices, and services that we all rely on every day. This innovation exists not in spite of net neutrality. This innovation exists, in large part, because of net neutrality. Net neutrality is not a bug, Mr. Speaker. Net neutrality is a feature, and that is why we must protect it. Of course, the real reason that people want to end net neutrality is money and profitability. Getting rid of net neutrality would expose consumers to all sorts of practices that, right now, are banned; practices like throttling, which means the internet company doesn’t have to provide the same access to all companies. So they don’t like one company, they can slow down your access to that site. They could block the site entirely. They could tell a streaming service, like Netflix, that they have to pay more or make their site work differently. These extra costs for Netflix are going to get passed on to all of us, the consumers. While some of us have a few choices when it comes to internet service providers, most of us don’t. How many have more than one option when it comes to internet in your home or office? These companies have a functional monopoly, so many of them can do basically whatever they want and not lose customers. That is why we need some commonsense rules in place to protect consumers. These rules are called net neutrality. So what can we do to stop the FCC from harming this free internet? Well, I have introduced legislation in just the last couple of days that would block this proposal and protect the internet. H.R. 4585, the Save Net Neutrality Act, would simply prevent the FCC from relying on this process they have used to roll these rules back. It is really that simple. And we know the FCC’s rulemaking process was so messed up, so corrupted, so screwed up that it is being investigated right now by the New York attorney general. So I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defeat the previous question so we can move to debate my bill, the Save Net Neutrality Act, and address this critical issue. This is our chance to protect the internet, as it has always existed, an internet that is working fine as it is. To the FCC, we say: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to say that I agree with my friend. I, too, said to the FCC in 2015: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. I thought the first 20plus years of the internet were marked by innovation and freedom, and I wanted to keep that innovation and freedom flowing. The Obama administration wanted to insert itself into the internet infrastructure in ways that it had never inserted government in infrastructure before. And from the numbers that I have seen—my friend may have different numbers—suggests that infrastructure investment has declined over those 2 years, first time in the history of internet infrastructure investment. Mr. Speaker, reasonable men and women can disagree, but, understand, internet freedom and innovation is exactly what we all want to protect. Unfortunately, it is not what this rule is focused on today. This rule today is focused on simplification and expansion coming out of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. Speaker, one of the gentlemen I had the pleasure of being elected with in 2011 is the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ). He is one of the sponsors of one of these bills we have before us today. He has been a leader in the financial services field in his 7 years here. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ) to talk about the impact that his legislation will have on the process today. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time. Before I get to my bill, if I could just address a few points that have been brought up in this debate, which I am surprised at the fact that the Rules Committee doesn’t actually talk about the rule. We talk about a whole bunch of different issues, but maybe I am new to this game. I have to say that the gentleman from Georgia is correct. Infrastructure investment in the internet has gone down over the last 2 years. I would agree: If it is not broken, why did President Obama try to fix it? It was working really well for 20 years, and we had great innovation. In regard to the tax bill, that is being debated. I think we are looking at some unique arguments that are being made. The Democrats are over there and they are fighting for the poor middle class American, and all Republicans are fighting for the rich. It is a great line. I love the line. But let’s look to the wealthiest communities in America. b1430 Go look right outside of D.C. Look in Northern Virginia. Are those wealthy communities, those counties in Virginia, are they Republican or Democrat? They are Democrat. L.A., San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, New York are all really rich communities that elect Democrats. The wealthiest and biggest corporations, think of the tech industry in California or the biggest in America. What are they? They are Democrats. And that is why. When the tax debate comes up, you see Democrats fighting for loopholes and preferences for their big, wealthy friends. And that is why, when Republicans here in this House said maybe to write off the mortgage interest on a $1 million home, that might be a little too much, maybe we should lower it to $500,000 of mortgage interest deductions, my Democratic friends freaked out. Oh, no, the poor, middle class people in my community who have a $1 million mortgage, they are just having a tough time getting by—that was the argument that was made, fighting for the loopholes and preferences for the wealthiest Americans, while we are fighting for the middle class. You talk about investment in my bill? You want to talk about pension funds? What has happened to pension funds in America? What has happened to American 401(k)’s? They have gone through the roof because we are lowering rules and regulations in a smart way, and we are going to reform our Tax Code to let families and businesses keep more of their income because they can spend it better than anyone in this town. They do it well. So if you want to tank the markets, do what you have been doing and tank tax reform. I want to get to my bill. This is on proxy advisory firms. I have taken awhile to get here, but the role of proxy advisory firms in the U.S. economy and shaping corporate governance is profound. These firms, they counsel pension funds and mutual funds and institutional investors on how to vote the shares of the corporations that they own. You think, well, that is pretty benign. That is not a big issue. Well, the shares of institutional investors’ ownership in 1987 was 46 percent. Today, institutional investors own 75 percent of American corporations, billions of shares institutional investors control and look to proxy advisers for advice. 
There are just two firms that control 97 percent of the market. So two companies, basically, are having a huge influence on American corporate governance, and they are involved in the writing and analysis and reports and voting recommendations that affect fundamental corporate transactions like mergers and acquisitions, approval of corporate directors and shareholder proposals—a huge impact on corporate governance. And they are not immune from conflicts of interest. For example, in addition to providing recommendations to institutional investors about how to vote, proxy advisory firms may also advise companies about corporate governance issues, rate companies on corporate governance, help companies approve those ratings, and advise proponents about how to frame proposals to get the most votes. I am going to come back to that in a second, but there was a Stanford University study that said institutional investors with assets under management of $100 billion or more, they only make 10 percent of the voting decisions, which means they offload 90 percent to proxy advisory firms. So I don’t know if you are familiar with the Mafia, but you have got the old storekeeper on the block, and he is robbed one night—right?—gets beaten up and robbed, and the next day, the thugs come in and go: Hey, hey, I hear you were robbed last night. You pay a little fee, we’ll take care of you and make sure you are not robbed anymore. That is exactly what proxy advisory firms are doing. They are like: Oh, you got a bad recommendation. Let me tell you what. You buy our services, and we can help you in the future. Just pay the ransom, and we will help take care of you in future recommendations. This is not the way corporate governance should work. So my bill brings transparency and accountability to proxy advisory firms. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin, the sponsor of this legislation. Mr. DUFFY. I thought that is what Democrats want: making them more responsive; bringing more competition into the industry; making it better for investors; specifically, again, a bipartisan bill. Republicans and Democrats voted for this legislation. But we will ensure that proxy advisory firms are registered with the SEC. Oh, how bad is that, registering with the SEC, a little oversight? We are going to disclose potential conflicts of interest. How radical is that idea? Shouldn’t we tell people that we have a conflict of interest, and shouldn’t all parties be aware of it? I don’t know why my friends across the aisle, or the gentleman from Colorado would be opposed to that. Maintain a code of ethics. That is not shocking. I think most people would agree to that point. And make publicly available the methodologies for formulating proxy recommendations and analysis. Again, this is transparency. This is a commonsense bill that both Republicans and Democrats have voted for because we have recognized—and again, I am not a big regulation guy, as the gentleman from Colorado had pointed out. But when you consolidate a great deal of power in two companies that have a huge impact on American corporate governance, that makes a lot of people uncomfortable; and to have a little more oversight, to have a little more transparency, to have a little more accountability is a really, really good thing. Some of the smallest companies have been the biggest complainers about how these proxy advisory firms have held them hostage. So let’s support the small innovators, the big job creators in America that are complaining about the big proxy advisory firms. Let’s stand with them and the families that they employ, and the future families, if they are successful, that they will employ, and let’s give a little more control to proxy adviser firms. I ask all to support this great bill. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I can see my good friend, Mr. DUFFY , is very excited about this, very engaged. It is a hard issue. I don’t think many Democrats are that excited either way. They are all going to decide where they stand because it is just a fight between corporate CEOs and big institutional investors. They are both fine. I mean, you have got to pick one or the other in voting ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ on this bill. I think, as Democrats, we are more interested in how the people are doing who are working for those companies. How are we doing about sustainable practices over time? Yes, every Democrat and Republican will cast their vote here either for institutional investors or for corporate CEOs and insular boards. Fine. It does add paperwork. We talked about that. Mr. DUFFY said: Oh, it adds paperwork. Democrats should like it. Yes, maybe there are some. I think some Democrats voted for it in committee. There are Democrats that want to increase paperwork. I am not one of them. I want to decrease paperwork and streamline it. But, no, I am sure there will be some Democrats who support it. There are probably Democrats who, themselves, agree with the corporate CEOs over the institutional investors. I have taken a company public. I have run private companies. I have seen this world. I think it is a good thing that the share of institutional investment has increased. I don’t have the statistics in front of me. The gentleman from Wisconsin said something along the lines of 46 to 75 percent of the capital is institutional. The big problem in public corporate governance is not too much shareholder engagement; it is not enough. When you have a diffuse shareholder base, when you don’t have institutional investors, when you have, proverbially, 200 people who each own half a percent of the company or even more and they never talk and don’t know each other, the ability of management to run amok in their own interests, to the detriment of the shareholders, plagues our public marketplaces. So to have sophisticated, active investors who own enough and can work together, sometimes through these proxy fights when it comes to it, to be able to maximize longterm value is a good thing. It is a good thing. Of course, everybody can point to times that it has been good for companies and times it has been bad. Generally speaking, this bill is adding paperwork to move the bar the wrong way, to move it towards management, away from shareholders. I agree you need a balance. I wouldn’t support a bill that moved it all the way to shareholders either. You are just encouraging agitators to get in on a shortterm basis and speculative basis. But I think we are close to the right place; and if you ask me where I would move it, I would move it a little the other way to empower shareholders. In fact, I have a bill that does that. It is part of a bigger bill, but it is a bill that gives shareholders more of a direct say over the pay of top executives because, again, there is a problem with insular corporate boards. Part of the answer is empowering institutional investors and empowering individual investors. So, look, Democrats will hold their nose and vote for either corporate CEOs or for big investors, and that is fine. I firmly think that the best interests of our economy and the people and sustainability lie in moving it toward the investors. This bill moves it the wrong way and adds paperwork and costs to the investors. So I really think it moves the wrong way, which is why I oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ There was also a discussion, Mr. DUFFY mentioned why aren’t we just talking about the rule. It is because, Mr. Speaker, like 56 other rules, it is a closed rule. What else can we say about closed rules? We have said everything. There are no amendments. I could spend an hour complaining about how they are not allowing amendments in and it is closed and so are 56 other rules, but it is more productive to get to the underlying issues because we have had the debate on closed rules 56 times just in the last 10 months. That is a record, Mr. Speaker. You should be proud of presiding over a record number of closed rules for a United States Congress. But it is not very interesting to talk about for another hour. 
So they will talk about an interesting bill, a minor bill. I think I discussed that. I mean, we have a government shutdown; we have an issue with tax reform; we have DREAMers; we have a million things we could be doing. This is a minor bill. Okay. Let’s talk about the merits of giving the current corporate boards that might be too insular and the current CEOs and management a little more power, like this bill does, by increasing red tape and paperwork on investors versus the merits of empowering investors. Fine, we will have that discussion. We will cast our ballots. We will see what happens. Another issue that is very important and timely that this Congress should get to is the one my good friend Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY raised. When we defeat the previous question, we can bring up an issue that, again, is not a partisan issue. As the cofounder of Apple, Steve Wozniak, said, the end of net neutrality would end the internet as we know it. It is an issue every American citizen is looking to us to take leadership on. In my time in office, I have had to make a number of controversial votes, whether it is for the Affordable Care Act or repeal of this or that, and oftentimes I hear from constituents on both sides. I remember we got thousands of letters for the Affordable Care Act, thousands of letters against it—very typical. Net neutrality has been a unique and singular experience in my 9 years in Congress. We received 1,500 calls and over 5,000 emails about the issue, and I asked my staff to doublecheck this because I didn’t believe this, and they did. One hundred percent of the emails and calls were for net neutrality. That is right. Not a single constituent of mine contacted me on the other side. In a district that has a plurality of unaffiliated voters and a similar number of Republicans and Democrats, they are never shy to contact me. So it is not partisan. It certainly united Republicans, unaffiliated voters, and Democrats in my district to be unanimously for net neutrality, which surprised me. But it also means that Congress should not be tone deaf to that, and that is why it is important to defeat the previous question. Republican Senators like Senator THUNE have come together to call on colleagues to come together and protect net neutrality. My good friend and colleague from Colorado MIKECOFFMAN  announced that we should—the FCC should delay their vote and that we should protect net neutrality. It is common sense, Mr. Speaker, and by defeating the previous question, we can get on to an issue that the American people care about rather than a fight between CEOs and investors and which side you take. It is about protecting your internet in your home so you can access the content of your choice—a consumer issue and an issue for small businesses. We had a digital roundtable last night, Mr. Speaker. I think thousands of people from my district watched as I had several experts, including several small businesses from Colorado, talk about the importance of net neutrality to them in creating jobs and being able to have a predictable and sustainable business model, and then being able to compete with large, entrenched companies and be disruptive with new innovation. So I hope that we can defeat the previous question and get on to that. If we don’t, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the bill that adds paperwork and costs, requiring SEC filings for the investors who are fighting bills, who are fighting proxy fights, and then I urge my colleagues to look closely at the privacy bill. That one, again, I would not characterize as a major bill. I will be voting ‘‘no.’’ I understand there might be some Republicans and Democrats voting ‘‘yes’’ on that one as well. But, you know, whether they delete that clause or not is hardly the game changer for the economy that tax reform will be. I have ideas, bipartisan ideas, bills that I have sponsored with my Republican colleagues that should be part of tax reform, that would help the economy go, that would create far more jobs than a twosentence disclosure, whether it is there or not, and, frankly, more important, also, than this, whether the proxy fight people have to file with the SEC. I mean, I am sure they will be able to do it. I mean, yes, you Republicans want to give them more paperwork and create more bureaucracy, but I am sure they will survive. b1445 But let’s do something important like open process tax reform. We could be debating amendments right now and voting on them like our job—you know, like 100 amendments from Republicans and Democrats. I would even be open to let’s just consider bipartisan amendments, throw out amendments that only Republicans support or only Democrats support. To be fair, you are in the majority, Mr. Speaker, how about just amendments that Republicans alone support or are bipartisan? You don’t have to do any Democratic amendments only because let’s just have an open process. Let’s allow some amendments. Every amendment was locked out of tax reform. I offered like, what, 16 myself? I remember my colleague Mr. WOODALL was there. They were commonsense ideas. There was a little fix I did with Mr. TIPTON from Colorado for Kombucha, that is fermented tea, and it had to do with the tax treatment, de minimis. Senator CORY GARDNER supports it in the Senate, our Republican Senator. Noncontroversial, nexttono fiscal impact, and the Rules Committee still didn’t even allow me to debate the amendment on the floor for 10 minutes, for 5 minutes, for 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, enough with these closed rules, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we have a couple problems with this rule. First of all, the rule brings to the floor the wrong bills. These are minor bills. I will give a recap in a moment, but oh, my goodness. Two sentences of a disclosure and a little more filing costs for pensions and investors. Okay. We will get past that. They probably won’t become law anyway. You can blame it on the Senate, you can blame it on the House, but most of these things we do don’t become law. I understand that many of my colleagues are frustrated with the Senate, but whatever the case, we just do these things. But there is stuff that might become law, that could become law, like tax reform; like the fact that the government is shutting down next week if we don’t continue the funding. We have a clock ticking on our debt ceiling. We have 800,000 aspiring Americans who don’t even know if they can go to work legally, like they can today, in another few months because of President Trump’s decision to end their provisional status. These are real issues—the cost of healthcare going up for my constituents and yours. But we are not doing that. We are bringing up two bills. I will give you the summary of them. Even these two bills, closed process, no amendments. If I was able to offer floor amendments, as I said, I could offer an amendment that would actually move the balance the other way toward investors and empowering investor activism, perhaps even look at giving them a safer pay, if you will, over executive pay, and reining in some of the problems of this bill. But we are not allowed. We are not allowed to offer any amendments here on the floor. Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again. That is 56, by my count. That is 56 times Republicans have brought bills to the floor and haven’t allowed Democrats or Republicans to offer amendments. Look, my colleagues can say: Oh, Democrats weren’t great on this, and they had too many when they controlled it. You know what? First of all, Republicans set a record. This is the most number of closed rules ever. Secondly, I am not here to defend the Democrats. If the Democrats were in 
charge, they should offer more open amendments. There is no question. But Republicans, whatever they complained about the Democrats, they outdid them by a big factor. Ten months, 56 bills that no single Member of the House is allowed to offer an amendment on just to have a fair upordown vote. It is wrong. It is wrong. That is why I hope my colleagues can defeat this rule to say: Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker, we have to defeat this rule and move on to the issues important to the American people, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Colorado is right. Time management is an important issue here on the floor, and we have got to manage it, whether it is closing statements or whether it is floor time throughout the day. Every bill we bring to the floor is not going to be the most important bill that we bring to the floor, Mr. Speaker, by definition. I hope that my colleagues were listening intently to my friend from Colorado, not necessarily during his opening statement, and certainly not during his closing statement, but during the middle statement where he was talking about his vast knowledge of corporate boards and corporate structures. I have the pleasure of serving on the Rules Committee with Mr. POLIS, Mr. Speaker, and there are not going to be many Members of this institution who have either been more successful in their private life, not just talking about it, but doing it, when it comes to leading institutions, and Members who work harder to try to find some common ground to move things forward. I was just telling Ms. Rossi on my staff, Mr. Speaker, that it troubles me more when Mr. POLIS is on the floor and we can’t find agreement, because I believe very often he tries harder than most to find that agreement here. Mr. Speaker, you see it on the front page of the newspaper day after day after day, folks talk about this institution as if we will never find agreement with each other. There are some issues of principle where finding agreement is hard, where we just fundamentally disagree with one another. It is not the case today, though, Mr. Speaker. Today, the case is that we have two bills that moved through regular order in the Financial Services Committee. That means, Mr. Speaker, that the committee took up the legislation first, that the committee sorted out the legislation first, and, Mr. Speaker, these bills, both of them, passed the Financial Services Committee with big bipartisan votes. There are many opportunities for us to come to the floor and talk about things that divide us that we will never find agreement on. That is not today. Today, we have a chance to come to the floor and talk about differences that we can make together. Differences that are not just bipartisan, but differences that are nonpartisan; good ideas that can make a difference one life, one bill at a time. Mr. Speaker, these bills are coming today under a closed rule for one, under a structured rule for the other. That is true. For the uninitiated, Mr. Speaker, that means that amendments aren’t going to be offered. It doesn’t mean that amendments weren’t allowed, Mr. Speaker. We sent out the call to the entire House of Representatives, 435 Members. We said we have two bills coming before the Rules Committee; we want you to send us all of your ideas, all of the different ways that you think these two bills can be improved. We got back one idea. One. And we made it in order for a vote on the floor of the House. Dadgummit, Mr. Speaker, I think it is going to make the bill better. I intend to support that amendment that we made in order. It is a Democrat amendment. It came from my friend Mr. CLAYon the other side of the aisle. I intend to support it because I think it is going to make the bill better. Are there issues that are complex, that are partisan, that are structured in such a way that having an open rule isn’t the choice that gets made? Of course there are. Of course there are. I think my friend is right to criticize the majority when the process gets closed down in this way. But today, Mr. Speaker, I think my friend is wrong to suggest that the process is being closed down. The process was opened up to the entire institution. One amendment was received, one amendment was made in order. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that will be a practice that we continue going forward. Two good bills today, Mr. Speaker, if my colleagues support this rule: one from my friend Mr. TROTT , one from my friend Mr. DUFFY , and the bipartisan amendment offered by my friend Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, and then I hope they will come back to the floor and support the underlying bills as well. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 657 O FFERED BY  MR. POLIS At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 4585) to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from relying on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the matter of restoring internet freedom to adopt, amend, revoke, or otherwise modify any rule of the Commission. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 4. Cause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 4585. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution ....  [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal 
to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DAVIDSON ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 658 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1638. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1456 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1638), to require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees on the estimated total assets under direct or indirect control by certain senior Iranian leaders and other figures, and for other purposes, with Mr. MITCHELL in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, introduced by my colleague and dear friend from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ). This legislation requires the Treasury Secretary to report to Congress on the assets held by the Islamic Republic of Iran’s most senior political and military leaders, and on the probable sources and uses of those assets. A classified version, if necessary, would be available, as appropriate, to Congress, and a public version of the report would be posted on the Treasury Department’s website in English and in the major languages used within Iran that could easily be downloaded. The genius of this latter point is that it will allow the average Iranian to understand and circulate information of how their leaders are, in a phrase, robbing them blind, as well as aiding and abetting terrorists. Iran’s top political, military, and business leaders, if there is much of a distinction between those roles in Iran, fund terroristrelated activity, we know this, and through intricate financial arrangements that give them great flexibility in moving their money. According to the nongovernmental organization Transparency International, Iran’s economy is characterized by high levels of official and institutional corruption, and there is substantial involvement by Iran’s security forces, particularly involving the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Unsurprisingly, then, members of Iran’s senior political and military leadership have acquired significant personal and institutional wealth by using their positions to secure control of major portions of the Iranian national economy. Some estimates put their iron grip at a third or more of the country’s economy, and some individual holdings in the billions of dollars; all at a time when the average Iranian citizen earns the equivalent of about $15,000 a year. The unwise sanctions relief provided through the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran resulted in the unwarranted removal of many Iranian entities that are tied to government corruption from the list of entities sanctioned by the United States. b1500 Thankfully, however, the Trump administration has, in recent months, levied a number of needed new sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities. Still, the Transparency International index of perceived public corruption in Iran is higher than ever. As well, the Treasury Department has identified Iran as a country of ‘‘primary concern for money laundering.’’ Separately, the State Department has continually identified Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism. Iran is, the State Department tells us, a country that has ‘‘repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,’’ and ‘‘continues to sponsor terrorist groups around the world, principally through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.’’ The bill before us today, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, requires the Treasury Department again to list the known assets of senior Iranian officials in a form that is easily understandable and accessible to individual Iranians, as well as to those in the financial or business sector who might be concerned—hopefully concerned—about inadvertently doing business with a corrupt Iranian entity. The bill also requires the Treasury to evaluate the effectiveness of existing sanctions against Iran and make any appropriate recommendations for improving the effectiveness of sanctions. The bill passed the Financial Services Committee last month with a bipartisan support vote of 43–16. The House approved a nearly identical bill just 18 months ago by a very strong vote of 282–143. As passed by the committee, this year’s version has an important addition, a sense of the Congress section, that urges the Treasury Secretary, in addition to other sources, to seek information for the report from private sector sources that search, analyze, and, if necessary, translate publicly available, high veracity, official records overseas, and provide methods of searching and analyzing such data in ways useful to law enforcement. These source of services provide information that could augment information that is gathered, often by classified means, and provide a final public report that helps give the world a better picture of the true nature of Iran’s economy. Mr. Chairman, I urge immediate passage of Mr. POLIQUIN ’s thoughtful and bipartisan bill. I appreciate his leadership to bring us here today, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, December 6, 2017. Hon. JEBHENSARLING , Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN HENSARLING : Thank you for consulting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act. I agree that the Foreign Affairs Committee may be discharged from further action on this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the Floor, subject to the understanding that this waiver does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. The Committee also reserves the right to seek an appropriate number of conferees to any House Senate conference involving this bill, and would appreciate your support for any such request. I ask that you place our exchange of letters into the Congressional Record during 
floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES , Washington, DC, December 7, 2017. Hon. EDROYCE , Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN ROYCE : Thank you for your December 6th letter regarding H.R. 1638, the ‘‘Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act’’, as amended. I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on H.R. 1638 so that it may move expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although you are waiving action on the bill, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is in no way waiving its jurisdictional interest in this or similar legislation. In addition, if a conference is necessary on this legislation, I will support any request that your committee be represented therein. Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this letter in our committee’s report on H.R. 1638 and in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the same. Sincerely, JEBHENSARLING , Chairman. 
Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the legislation before us now, H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, represents what the Republican majority has become very good at doing, advancing bad public policy while claiming to advance the public interest. H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, would require the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress on the estimated total assets under direct or indirect control of certain senior Iranian leaders and other figures, along with a description of how these assets were acquired and are employed, regardless of whether such individuals are subject to U.S. sanctions. Although increasing transparency into corrupt regimes is a laudable goal, H.R. 1638 works counter not only to its own stated objectives, but also U.S. national security interests. First, the level of scrutiny that would be needed to produce a credible report would place a very real strain on the Treasury Department, diverting significant resources away from Treasury investigators who are tasked with targeting conduct that is actually sanctionable; implementing existing U.S. sanction programs; and uncovering illicit conduct across the globe, including, importantly, efforts to identify the web of business interests that continue to enable North Korea to evade U.S. and international sanctions. In addition to diverting scarce and critical resources, the bill’s required report will have little use as a compliance tool, given that the most important parts would be classified, undercutting the legislation’s own stated objective to help make financial institutions’ required compliance with remaining sanctions more easily understood. In fact, the creation of such a list, which would not be tied to any prohibition or legal action, would more than likely create confusion among the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s regulated public and also mislead companies to believe that the Treasury list replaces the due diligence efforts that they should otherwise be doing prior to engaging in business in Iran. Moreover, because the report would be largely classified, the bill would do little to draw the Iranian public’s attention to the corruption and unjust enrichment of their leaders, which is another stated purpose of the bill. In fact, any classified portion would inevitably be rejected by both the Iran regime and its people as U.S. propaganda, and a predictable attack on the country’s government by the United States. The true purpose of this legislation is to create reputational risk for companies that might seek to do legitimate business with Iran. For this reason, the bill would be a strategic mistake, as its report would undoubtedly be seized upon by Iran as an intentional effort to discourage international investment in Iran, which would be viewed by Iran and likely by the major world powers who joined us in the JCPOA as well as a violation of the expressed U.S. commitment under the nuclear deal not to interfere with the full realization of the relief provided to Iran under the accord. When a nearly identical version of this bill was considered last Congress, the Obama White House threatened to veto the bill, stating that it would, ‘‘endanger our ability to ensure Iran’s nuclear program is and remains exclusively peaceful.’’ Moreover, the Obama administration cautioned that the report called for in the bill would also compromise critical intelligence sources and methods. On that score, I would also note that the reporting requirement in the legislation calls for information about how sanctions evasion and illicit conduct is practiced, and potential countermeasures. It seems far from prudent to give tips to our adversaries about how we learn about their misconduct and how we plan to respond. This legislation would have very limited practical utility, despite the huge diversion of resources it would take to produce. It also fails to meet its own stated objectives, including serving any usefulness as a compliance tool. Finally, the measure would also likely have a negative impact on the continued viability of the nuclear deal, which is clearly a central objective. I am hardpressed to think of a single piece of legislation that works so strongly against every single policy goal it claims to advance. Few issues are more important to global peace and security than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. This bill would do nothing to advance that goal. In fact, if enacted, it could do grave damage to the important progress that has been made. Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds simply to remind the ranking member that in the State Department’s latest Country Reports on Terrorism, Iran is labeled the ‘‘world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism.’’ Why we would want less information as opposed to more information on that rogue state is beyond me. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), the sponsor of the legislation and a distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of my bill, and I am grateful to you for moving this very important bipartisan bill through the House Financial Services Committee. I also want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who supported this bill last year. Unfortunately, it got stuck in the Senate, so we have got to do it again this year, but I am thrilled to be here. Mr. Chairman, the primary responsibility of every Member of Congress, whether you are on the left side or the right side of the aisle, no matter what State you are from, what part of the country you are from, the major responsibility, the primary responsibility is to support and defend our Constitution. To me, that means protecting our families and those American citizens abroad. Now, our moms and dads in Maine, Mr. Chairman, and across this country, are increasingly alarmed by the frequency of terrorist attacks here at home; another attempted 2 days ago in New York City. Today, Mr. Chairman, there are 1,000 investigations dealing with terrorist activities across this land in all 50 States. That is why H.R. 1638 is so important. This bill will help keep our families safe and keep them free. In doing so, we must make sure this issue is not a political issue. National security never should be a political issue. Mr. Chairman, the Iranian Government, as Mr. HENSARLING just mentioned, is the chief state sponsor of terrorism and instability in this world. These senior political leaders and their military leaders, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, they train, they arm, and they fund terrorist organizations around the world. They have become experts at using the internet and social media to radicalize, recruit, and direct terrorists around the globe, including here in the United States of America. 
Mr. Chairman, the Iranian Government has American blood on its hands. Now, Mr. Chairman, there are approximately 70 to 80 top political and military leaders in Iran that control about onethird of their domestic economy. They use their power to corrupt the telecommunications industry, the construction industry, and other important ones in that land. Reuters has conducted an investigation through publicly available information that found the Supreme Leader of Iran alone has accumulated tremendous personal wealth through a foundation claiming to help the poor. Now, while the corruption has grown in Iran, the average citizen there earns the equivalent of $15,000 per year. Mr. Chairman, the citizens of Iran and the people of this world should know how much wealth has been accumulated by those that sponsor terrorism and what that money is being used for. Companies across the globe that are looking to do business with Iran should understand what they might be getting into. So I disagree with my colleague from California, the ranking member, who says that this is going to possibly create confusion; that it will possibly cause businesses around the world to hesitate from investing in Iran. Well, guess what, Mr. Chairman. That is a good idea. My Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act is a straightforward, main, commonsense bill. It simply requires the Department of Treasury to collect, to maintain, and to post online the list of these 70 to 80 senior political and military leaders and the assets, their personal assets, how this money was acquired, and what it is being used for. As Mr. HENSARLING mentioned, it will require the Treasury Department to post this on their website in English as well as in Farsi, Arabic, and Azeri, the three languages that are mostly used in that country. I might also add that my colleague on the other side of the aisle might be a little bit confused about this issue, but the information posted on this website will be that that is publicly available. There will be no information that should not be posted there that only Congress should have access to. I have heard, Mr. Chairman, critics of this bill saying: Well, you know, it is not a good idea to expose the Iranian Government’s corruption in funding of terrorism because, if you do so, well, the Iranian political and military leaders might not want to work with us. Are you kidding? These are the radicals who regularly chant ‘‘Death to America.’’ The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Maine. b1515 Mr. POLIQUIN. Hoping that these folks also abandon their support of terrorism by not shedding light on their corruption doesn’t make any sense. Hope, Mr. Chairman, is not a national security strategy. My bill makes sure that Congress gets its priorities straight. Protecting American families here at home and safeguarding our troops around the world who are fighting for our freedom is what we should be doing every way we can, and that is what this bill does. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that using one click of a computer from any corner of the globe to help expose illicit activities by the chief state sponsor of terrorism is a very, very good idea. Let’s stand up for all the peaceloving nations in the world. Let’s stand up to help our families protect their kids. Let’s stand up to protect our homeland. I ask everyone, Republicans and Democrats, please vote ‘‘yes’’ for H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee and who is my friend. Mr. HECK. I thank the ranking member, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. Mr. Chairman, this bill targets the leadership of Iran, and, frankly, that is probably a worthy goal in some regards. I think it eventually envisions publicizing negative information about them, and that might be an effective tool as well. We all know that. We have been through campaigns. We know negative advertising works. That said, I oppose this legislation, and I do so for two reasons. The first is resources are finite. They are not unlimited; they are finite. Tracking down all the assets of these named Iranian leaders takes significant time, effort, and personnel. Where are those resources supposed to come from? All around this city, everybody is agitating for deeper cuts to nondefense discretionary accounts. If we are going to make cuts, we are going to have to make some tough choices. The personnel responsible for implementing this bill would be diverted from terrorist financing and money laundering. Let me say that again. The people, the personnel responsible for implementing this bill would be diverted from terrorist financing and money laundering. Propaganda about corruption of Iranian leadership—which I stipulate to here up front—could be valuable, but it can’t be more valuable than stopping actual terrorist financing. Terrorist financing should be our target. Money laundering should be our target, not gardenvariety corruption. We had a lengthy discussion in committee just yesterday about using money laundering authorities to fight human trafficking. For God’s sake, that has to seem more valuable than propaganda. It has to. So until we solve these tight budget constraints, I think we need to make the hard choice about what our priorities are and how to prioritize resources for stopping, again, money laundering and terrorism financing. Leave this effort for a world where the sequester has been lifted. The second reason why I oppose this legislation, I can’t help wondering: Shouldn’t we apply this principle more broadly? The idea here is that we should investigate and publicize it when a country’s leadership has undisclosed assets, especially if those are overseas. That is the point of this legislation. We should investigate and publicize it when a country’s leadership is using government resources to enrich itself. But why—why—just apply that principle to Iran? I am informed in my point of view here by wisdom I found in this black, leatherbound book that I gratefully received when I was sworn into office 5 years ago. In fact, the passage that I will cite you actually occurs in two places. Let me share it with you now: ‘‘How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you, yourself, fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.’’ So I wonder: When is this Congress going to turn its attention to the plank in our eye? Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the arguments on moral equivalency with respect to Iran, the reality is that this is a government that starts its morning prayers with: ‘‘Death to America. Death to Israel.’’ The Ayatollah makes it clear he means it. So, yes, we should try to remove the plank from our eye, but we should not remove our eyes from the fact that what we have in terms of policy being directed from the Ayatollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a policy that calls for the destruction of the United States of America. Now, Mr. Chairman, this bill has a powerful goal, and it is to expose the corrupt nature of the Iranian regime. But when we talk about why, the answer is because the personnel responsible for carrying out these assassinations, that have us concerned about carrying out terror are, in fact, the leadership in Iran of these organizations that we attempt to identify here. That is the job of doing terror research and cutting off terror finance. That is what we are supposed to be doing. This regime claims to be more than a government. It claims to be a revolution. They call themselves the Islamic 
Revolution. But when you look at it closely, as this bill requires the Treasury Department to do, the regime in Tehran resembles something else, a criminal enterprise, because, from the Supreme Leader to the Revolutionary Guard, these socalled servants of the Revolution control onethird of the Iranian economy because they seized it. They seized everybody’s private property in terms of these companies. The Supreme Leader’s empire alone is worth $95 billion. This is called the Execution of Imam Khomeini’s Order, or Setad. It holds stakes in just about every sector of the Iranian industry, including finance, oil, and telecommunications. These funds are not simply used to enrich Iranian officials. That is not our problem here. It is not that they are propping up the regime. It is thanks to Iran’s lack of money laundering control they are easily used to destabilize the entire region. That is what they are doing now by funding terrorism abroad and fueling Iran’s ballistic missile program at home. These ICBMs, by the way, they announce, are intended for us. So that is why, as this bill says, the Treasury Department—and the bill notes this—has identified Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. This means that any transaction with Iran risks supporting the regime’s ongoing illicit activities, their terrorists activities. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, Mr. POLIQUIN , for introducing this bill and Chairman HENSARLING for working with us to get it to the floor. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ), who is a longtime supporter of diplomacy with Iran and a strong supporter of the nuclear deal. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman’s courtesy, and I appreciate her advocacy on this. This is serious business. There are people—no secret—in the administration and there are people in Congress who would like to undermine this agreement. The mixed signals that have been sent by the administration are truly disturbing. One has to wonder what North Korea is thinking about, that there are people who suggest that we ought to go ahead and blow it up when, in fact, they are abiding by the terms of the agreement, and officials in the administration agree with this. What sort of deterrent is that to North Korea in terms of its reckless action with nuclear weapons? It seems to reinforce that behavior. But there are also elements in Iran, hardliners who didn’t agree with this agreement, who felt that it was too evenhanded, who felt that the leadership gave up too much, and who don’t want closer relationships with the United States or the other Western powers that worked with us—including China and Russia—to enact this historic agreement, which, as I pointed out, was agreed to even by officials in the Trump administration that Iran has abided by. Are they a nation of bad actors? Absolutely. There are forces within the government that are very destructive. But the point is we focused on something that all of us agree is absolutely critical, and that is not having Iran rushing forward to become another nuclear state. We have seen that the breakout time under this agreement has lengthened. It is acting as we intended. It was also one of those rare areas where we actually had Germany, Great Britain, France, Russia, and China working with us to negotiate an agreement. Now, this is going to be perceived as an effort by the United States to undermine the agreement. Should we give them and the hardliners in Iran an excuse to walk away because we violated it? What is going to be the assessment of our allies who are deeply committed to this and have resisted efforts to unravel it? We need all the help we can get in the international arena. We have watched this administration systematically isolate us, this last week with the reckless decision to go ahead and relocate the Embassy—or at least claim we are going to relocate the Embassy—condemned by virtually everybody else in the world. We are standing alone with an action to destabilize a very volatile situation. This comes forward at a time when Iran is abiding by it, to go ahead and crank up the report on the assets of a variety of Iran’s senior political, religious, and military leaders, including people who aren’t subject to the sanctions. It is placing, it has been mentioned, strain on the Department that has finite resources—it needs to focus on things—taking away resources from efforts to target on actual sanctionability. It seems to be decidedly wrongheaded. It is interesting that Congress had until this week to reimpose the sanction lifted under the agreement per Trump’s decertification in October. Congress chose not to. I think that was a wise decision. To me, it indicates, at least, that the agreement has been largely successful. But, if we are going to jeopardize the framework, giving the hardline elements an opportunity to claim that we are repudiating, while giving a green light to some of the folks there who have no intention of being able to work on a cooperative basis, we ought not to fan the flames. We ought to be trying to nurture opportunities for cooperation. We should focus on areas where they are doing things we don’t agree with. If you want to target some specific sanctions that we somehow haven’t imposed that are within the purview of the framework and wouldn’t violate it, go ahead. But having these actions, I think, sends the wrong signal. It is the wrong resource. Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to reject this legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), who is a hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Chairman, since our founding, and as Ronald Reagan emphasized regularly, America has stood as a shining city upon a hill whose beacon light guides freedomloving people everywhere. Today we have an opportunity to shine a little brighter. As we continue our battle to defeat terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran remains dangerously corrupt. While the average Iranian earns a mere $15,000 a year, corrupt, top political and military leaders control an estimated onethird of the nation’s total economy. These same leaders are, more often than not, the same ones who repeatedly provide support for acts of terrorism in the Middle East and continue to sponsor terrorist groups around the world. Unfortunately, the Iranian Government continues to tolerate this corruption, which is why the State Department has named Iran as a country of primary concern for money laundering and it continues to be listed as a state sponsor of terrorism. These officials who perpetuate such destructive and destabilizing behavior should and need to be exposed. Today, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act. This bill will require a list of the known assets of senior Iranian officials to be made publicly available in all three of Iran’s major languages. Specifically, the U.S. Treasury Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the assets held by Iran’s most senior political, military, and business leaders and on the probable sources and uses of the assets. b1530 This report will serve as yet another tool in the toolbox of businesses and financial institutions, both foreign and domestic, to better comply with existing sanction regimes and international financial restrictions. It will provide clarity and certainty for companies when determining the legitimacy of their business partners if they decide that doing business with Iran is in their interest. Moreover, with this information, with better knowledge of where their money is going, Iranians who wish to invest not in terrorism or in corruption, but in freedom, can. Today, we can help the freedomloving people of Iran. We can help shine a light on Iran’s corruption, and America can continue to be a shining city on a hill. I appreciate the work of my colleague from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), 
whom I am proud to serve with on the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee. I thank Chairman HENSARLING and Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee Chairman BARR for moving such an important bill through the committee and to the floor today. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 1638. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I would like the author of this bill, Mr. POLIQUIN , and perhaps the chairman of our committee, Mr. HENSARLING , to answer the question that I am about to propose, and that is this: We have allies with us in this agreement. This is an agreement that was worked on for a long time. We have Russia, China, Germany, England, and France. What are our allies saying about our attempt to interfere with the agreement? What are they saying about whether or not we can be trusted to live up to the commitments that we have made? What are they saying about our attempts to add to, lengthen, and create new, really, what have become obstacles to peace? I would ask my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, as they talk about targeting certain leaders—I don’t know what leaders they are talking about— and wanting to know about their assets and where their assets came from and how they are being used, I ask my friends on the opposite side of the aisle: Are you willing to do that for certain leaders in our own country? I just heard from one of the speakers, I believe it was Mr. ROYCE from California, who identified the worth of one of the supposed leaders. It seems to me that it did not nearly match the worth of many of those who are in our Cabinet and who are in higher places in our government. And I wonder what we are trying to do. First, answer the question, if you will, about what our allies are saying. And secondly, answer the question about disclosure as it relates to those at the highest office in our country and those who are serving in the Cabinet. Also, when you talk about money laundering, answer the question about the relationship between the leader of this country and Deutsche Bank, that is known as a money laundering bank, that is involved with the President of the United States. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ), who is never an apologist for the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. He is a proud member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chairman, I just have to say, I am in shock. I am listening to the kind of thinking that, if it had caught on in the eighties, may have allowed the Cold War to continue. When I enlisted in the Army, I was privileged to serve in Germany, wear our country’s uniform, and see the fruit of generations of work. I also saw the concern that Germans had that Ronald Reagan was going to cause World War III and that actual leadership was somehow a problem. Instead what we saw was that Mr. Gorbachev didn’t tear down the wall. The United States of America didn’t tear down the wall. The East German people tore down their own wall. And why did they do that? They did that because they knew the truth of what was on the other side. Mr. POLIQUIN ’s bill is a major effort to try to help the people of Iran get their country back. They are under a strong authoritarian leadership system that has oppressed their people and caused harm throughout the region and, in fact, throughout the planet. Meanwhile, I am so thankful that this is a bipartisan bill. The Members opposed to this would have asked more public disclosure of public company CEOs than they would of enemies of our country, and that is hard to understand. Mr. Chair, I was sent here to represent the people of the Eighth District of Ohio and to support and defend the United States of America. I don’t think there is anyone who has sworn an oath to support and defend 80 leaders in Iran. This bill does not violate the JCPOA. It doesn’t touch it. It simply says we are going to gather this information. As far as diverting resources, this is the leading state sponsor of terror. It is precisely focused on the problem, and it gives the people of Iran a chance for freedom that so many people of the world enjoy. I am thankful that we have the opportunity to try to make this difference. I encourage every Member of the House to vote for it, and those who thought they were opposed, to reconsider a rational, measured action to try to change the world for good. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ) will give some information that I think is very important to understand how this bill would work. The gentleman who just spoke said that this has nothing to do with the agreement. Then what is it you are adding to? What is it you are trying to change or make better? If it has nothing to do with the agreement, then why are we doing it? Mr. POLIQUIN. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Maine to respond to that description of what this bill is all about. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, to the gentlewoman from California and to the other side of the aisle, I do want to make sure I make a few things clear. First of all, I am not sure if it was the gentlewoman or someone else saying: Why in the dickens would we divert resources away from fighting terrorism to post this information on the Treasury website? It costs too much. Well, with all due respect, the CBO estimates it will cost $500,000 to do this for 2 years. The United States Treasury Department has a budget of $14 billion per year. That is number one. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Reclaiming my time, I thank you for wanting to talk about something else, but I yielded to you to see if you could help me with information about what was stated that the gentleman who spoke before you said that this bill had nothing to do with the agreement. Mr. POLIQUIN. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Is the gentleman prepared to respond to the question that I have raised? If you are going to talk about what this bill has to do with the agreement, when the gentleman said it has nothing to do with the agreement, then I yield to the gentleman from Maine. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, the dangerous Iran nuclear deal that was put together a year and a half or 2 years ago has absolutely nothing to do with exposing the wealth that has cumulated through corruption by the top 70 to 80 Iranian political and military leaders and posting that for the world to see. I am sure the ranking member knows this has zero to do with the Iran nuclear deal. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Reclaiming my time, we know that there are individuals who are sanctionable in the deal. What I thought you were attempting to do is to expand that and to identify more leaders and try and understand where the assets come from, what they use them for, whether or not they are involved in money laundering. But the gentleman said it had nothing to do with the deal. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. JODYB. H ICE of Georgia). The Chair would remind all Members to direct their remarks to the Chair, please. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say in the time the ranking member was speaking, I went back, yet again, to read the ninepage bill. Nowhere is the JCPOA mentioned in the bill. Iran was the leading state sponsor of terrorism before the JCPOA. They remain the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism after the JCPOA. We ought to know something about the leadership of this terrorist nation, and I think the next speaker will tell us even more. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD), another outstanding member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of Mr. POLIQUIN ’s bill, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue. It is not uncommon these days to see Iranian fingerprints all over the instability and unrest that plague the Middle East. That is why our own State 
Department classifies Iran as a country of primary concern for money laundering and international terror financing. Just this weekend, Mr. Chair, we saw their handiwork yet again. This time, it was Lebanon, where the now largely Iranianbacked Hezbollah influenced government called for economic sanctions on the United States. Why? Simply for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Just a few at the top in this corrupt Iranian regime are flush with cash, but they support illicit causes and terror in the Middle East, all the while the average Iranian gets by on an average salary of $15,000 a year. Accountability for those profiting at the top, at the expense of those suffering at the bottom, is long overdue. Luckily, Mr. POLIQUIN ’s bill helps us to achieve this goal by requiring that the Treasury Department provide a report to Congress on the financial assets of these senior Iranian officials involved in corruption and illicit finance. Also, if enacted, this bill will shed light on Iranian terror activities and let the Iranian people know how their leaders actually operate. This is a key aspect of the bill, since most news is disseminated through governmentcontrolled outlets. True information is hard to come by. The bottom line is this: This is an important piece of legislation that I believe will help disrupt the Iranian terror network. I urge all my Democrat colleagues to support this measure. Let’s send a message to this regime that this body, the people’s House, is united on this front, and let’s send a message to the Iranian people that we are with them as well. I again thank my friend, Mr. POLIQUIN from Maine, for his leadership on this issue, and I urge adoption of his legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. May I inquire as to how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California has 10
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I have here a Statement of Administrative Policy from the previous President, where he advised us when this bill came before the House before that it would be vetoed by the administration. I will read to you from one of the paragraphs in the veto message. He said, in addition: ‘‘This bill’s required public postings also may be perceived by Iran, and likely our Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, partners as an attempt to undermine the fulfillment of our commitments, in turn, impacting the continued viability of this diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.’’ If the JCPOA were to fail on that basis, it would remove the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran’s nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America’s leadership and our commitments to our closest allies. I think that is a very powerful statement. I do know that Iran is in compliance. We have a very strict and strong monitoring program, and they are in compliance. b1545 So the questions become: If indeed they are in compliance, why would we interfere with the plan? Why would we jeopardize this plan that has been worked on with our strong allies in an attempt to try and find another way to say that Iran must be scrutinized? Everything in this plan has to do with discontinuing the development of nuclear capability. I think we should respect the work that we have done with our allies and discontinue all of these attempts to undermine the deal that we have entered in with and caused our allies to distrust us. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, and I thank Chairman HENSARLING and Representative POLIQUIN for their leadership on this issue. We must be scrutinizing the financial dealings of senior Iranian political and military leaders. It is in the national security interest of the United States to understand the international web of finances that supports terror operations and other nefarious causes. I am pleased that this bill includes an amendment I proposed to target the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, a position currently held by Ali Akbar Salehi, to the list of Iranian leaders named in this legislation. Given Iran’s violations of international law and its clear ties to international terrorism—it is, after all, the leading state sponsor of terrorism across the globe—we should be monitoring the finances of the head of its nuclear program to ensure compliance with sanctions and other laws. For years, the Iranian regime has been mired in institutionalized corruption, to the detriment of the people of that great country. In the nexus of nuclear weapons, statesponsored terrorism, money laundering, secret financial agreements, and mass pilfering from the Iranian people is cause for great alarm. This legislation is a response to all of that. It is completely bipartisan in nature. It is the way we should act in the House of Representatives in a bipartisan capacity. The national security interests of the United States know no partisan bounds. Mr. Chairman, we need all of the tools at our disposal to investigate the finances of this terrorist regime. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on Mr. POLIQUIN ’s legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining on my side? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 5
1⁄2minutes again to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), the sponsor of the legislation. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I did want to respond to the gentlewoman from California and to other folks who are on the other side of this bill. First of all, I think it is very clear to the world that the Iranian Government has been cheating on the nuclear deal almost since day one. I think it was within months, Mr. Chairman, that they testfired both mediumrange and longrange ballistic missiles, in violation of an 8year ban on developing those conventional weapons. So I think it is kind of silly for us to be debating here about a government that sponsors terrorism and vows to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth and kill as many Americans as they can, as a leadership regime that is going to abide by this agreement when they have proven they are not. Second of all, as I have mentioned several times, my bill has nothing to do with this agreement. But, then again, someone on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, also said: Well, we think American officials, American leaders, should be responsible for disclosing that. Well, here is the difference: America does not sponsor terrorism. The Iranian Government does. That is exactly what we are trying to get at, Mr. Chairman. I am trying to understand what folks who will not support this bill are going to say when they go back home at Christmastime, when they had an opportunity to shed sunlight on the top political and military leaders in Iran who are ripping off the Iranian people and who are sponsoring terrorism, why it is a bad idea to make sure this information is public to the world as well as to the Iranian people. I would like to understand what they are going to say when they go back home and talk to their constituents. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for this opportunity. This is a terrific bill. It does something very common sense: put pressure through sunlight, through transparency, on the chief sponsor of terrorism in the world—the Iranian regime. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the information that is being shared by my colleague, Mr. POLIQUIN . I am going to yield more time to him to explain to me: The missiles that he is describing in Iran, that are not a part of the deal, of the plan, are they similar to the missiles that are being fired with nuclear warheads from North Korea. 
Mr. POLIQUIN. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Maine. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, can the gentlewoman repeat the question again? I didn’t understand it. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I said: The missiles that he is referring to, that he is concerned about with Iran, that are not a part of the plan, are they similar to the ballistic missiles that are being fired from North Korea with nuclear warheads possibly on them? Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, the missiles that I was referring to are very clear to the gentlewoman from California. They deal specifically with the Iran nuclear deal, which is a dangerous deal for this world and for this country. It has nothing to do with any issue dealing with North Korea. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Are they more dangerous than the missiles from North Korea? Mr. POLIQUIN. What difference does that have to do with the—— 
Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I will tell Mr. POLIQUIN what difference it makes. 
Here we are with threats from North Korea and the President of the United States unwilling to be involved with diplomacy, who, rather, would like to basically mimic and mock the leader of North Korea by calling him ‘‘Little Rocket Man,’’ and by telling the Secretary of State: Don’t talk to him. It is no use to talk with him. So here we have North Korea, who has already indicated that they have missiles that will reach us right here in the United States, anywhere in the United States, and Mr. POLIQUIN is telling me about his concern about missiles in Iran that are not a part of the nuclear deal. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers, and I believe I have the right to close. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California has 6 minutes remaining. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD a statement from J Street that is in opposition to this legislation. 
J STREET , December 12, 2017. MEMBERS OF THE U.S. H OUSE OF REPRESENTA TIVES , Washington, DC. DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS : J Street urges Members to oppose H.R. 1638 and H.R. 4324, which would undermine or violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear activities. J Street again urges Members to oppose the ‘‘Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act’’ (H.R. 1638). As we noted in our statement opposing the bill when it was introduced last year, it risks harming the U.S. Government’s ability to ensure Iranian and third party compliance with the agreement and to counter Iran’s dangerous nonnuclear behavior by redirecting and tying up the very USG personnel and resources charged with those tasks. J Street also urges Members to oppose the socalled ‘‘Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act’’ (H.R. 4324), which is clearly intended to lead to a U.S. violation of the JCPOA. This bill would impose additional certification requirements on the administration in order to carry out current U.S. obligations related to commercial aircraft sales under the JCPOA. These new obligations require the administration to certify that Iran is not engaged in certain nonnuclear activity, or issue a national security waiver saying they’ll allow the planes to be sold anyway. In other words, it imposes new, unilateral terms for continuation of the JCPOA that are unrelated to Iran’s nuclear conduct. It has been widely reported in connection with the president’s recent refusal to make the necessary certification to Congress under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act that the president resents having to undertake official actions to keep the United States in compliance with the JCPOA. Proponents of this legislation clearly hope to make use of the president’s apparent resistance to taking such steps by adding a new certification requirement that they hope he will also fail to meet—thereby blocking the sale of commercial aircraft and forcing a U.S. violation of the agreement. Anyone doubting that this is the point of the bill need look no further than the first finding, which makes clear that this bill is a gratuitously antiObama, antiJCPOA vehicle, and not a serious. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I also include in the RECORD a Statement of Administration Policy from the previous Obama administration, which I read a paragraph from. 
TRANSPARENCY ACT  The Administration shares the Congress’ goals of increasing transparency and bringing Iran into compliance with international standards in the global fight against terror finance and money laundering. However, this bill would be counterproductive toward those shared goals. The bill requires the U.S. Government to publicly report all assets held by some of Iran’s highest leaders and to describe how these assets are acquired and used. Rather than preventing terrorist financing and money laundering, this bill would incentivize those involved to make their financial dealings less transparent and create a disincentive for Iran’s banking sector to demonstrate transparency. These onerous reporting requirements also would take critical resources away from the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s important work to identify Iranian entities engaged in sanctionable conduct. Producing this information could also compromise intelligence sources and methods. One of our best tools for impeding destabilizing Iranian activities has been to identify Iranian companies that are controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) or other Iranians on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) to nonU.S. businesses, so that they can block assets or stop material transfers. This process is laborintensive and requires the judicious use of our national intelligence assets. Redirecting these assets to preparing this onerous public report would be counterproductive and will not reduce institutional corruption or promote transparency within Iran’s system. In addition, this bill’s required public postings also may be perceived by Iran and likely our Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) partners as an attempt to undermine the fulfilment of our commitments, in turn impacting the continued viability of this diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. If the JCPOA were to fail on that basis, it would remove the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran’s nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America’s leadership and our commitments to our closest allies. As we address our concerns with Iran’s nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains cleareyed regarding Iran’s support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region. The United States should retain all of the tools needed to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to disrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and proliferationsensitive technologies. This bill would adversely affect the U.S. Government’s ability to wield these tools, would undermine the very goals it purports to achieve, and could even endanger our ability to ensure that Iran’s nuclear program is and remains exclusively peaceful. If the President were presented with H.R. 5461, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, we are opposed to this bill not because we are not concerned about the security of our country and security of our allies in the Middle East. The Members on the opposite side of the aisle don’t care any more than we care, but we respect when our leadership and our country gets involved and negotiates with another country, such as they have done with Iran, and they come to some agreements. We would like our country to live up to the agreement. When we have included in that agreement a description of the monitoring that will be done, and when that monitoring is being carried out, and when it is represented to us by those that we have in charge of that monitoring that that country, Iran, is in compliance, we believe them. And when we trust our negotiators, when we trust our country, when we trust our leadership, and Iran is in compliance, there is no reason to try and undo the deal. There is no reason to come behind the agreement and what has been negotiated and begin to think of ways that they believe we ought to expand that agreement. We could, in the Congress of the United States, come up with a new idea every day. With all of the Members of this House, with all of the different thoughts and, possibly, ideas, and everybody thinking they are smarter than everybody else, we could come up with all kinds of plans to interfere with that agreement. 
But I would advise the Members of this House and the Members on the opposite side of the aisle that they do not need to do this. This is a bad idea. I would advise them to put faith in the negotiations that have gone on and to accept the representations about compliance that we are being given. We are being assured that not only is the monitoring taking place, but Iran is in compliance. So, again, I am so worried about our role in this country today and the fact that our leadership is being diminished day by day because of the way that our President and the White House is handling our relationships with other countries. As a matter of fact, we see a President that is endangering us and destroying relationships constantly. I mention that we have in this deal Russia, China, Germany, England, and France. I asked the question: What are our allies in this agreement saying about our attempts to interfere with the agreement? Do they agree with them? Are they consulted? Are they unhappy about what is being done? I suppose they could do the same in their countries every day. They could come up with new ways to interfere with the agreement. They could begin to ask questions about us and why we are doing what we are doing. They could even ask questions about why are we concerned about the assets of those who are not sanctionable when we are not concerned about the assets of our own President. Mr. Chairman, this is Mr. POLIQUIN ’s bill. He wants to know about the assets of leaders in Iran. Has he seen his President’s tax returns? Does he know about his assets? Does he know about where they have come from? Does he know about how they are utilized? I don’t think so. So I think it is very, very important for us to do everything that we can to have our allies trust us, to live up to the deals that we make, not to ask more of others than we are willing to do ourselves, no. We are not sponsors of terrorism. We are a people who have always tried to avoid war. Unfortunately, we have engaged in it, and we know that it is not the best answer to trying to deal with the problems that we encounter around the world. I do believe that we honestly try to avoid war and that we work for peace. This is working for peace, and peace in the Middle East is one of the most important goals that we should have. I see the opportunities for that eroding every day. So I would ask Mr. POLIQUIN to think about what he is doing. I believe that his intentions are good, but I think it is a bad bill. Mr. Chairman, I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. It is not needed. I think it creates problems with our allies, and they begin to wonder whether or not they can trust us. We are an honorable people and we are leaders in the world, even though it is being questioned more and more. Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RODNEY  DAVIS of Illinois). The Chair reminds all Members to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3
3⁄4minutes remaining. b1600 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I find it fascinating how often the ranking member criticized our own President and didn’t have one critical comment for the President of Iran, the nation which our State Department, including the Obama State Department, has labeled as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism. But yet, in the last almost hour we have not heard one single critical word. We hear much about the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, perhaps one of the worst arrangements, international agreements that has ever been entered into by our country, but look as I may, in the legislation—and it is 9 pages long, not 900—you will not see the JCPOA in it. Mr. POLIQUIN ’s bill, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, is just that. It is seeking to have greater international transparency for the leaders of this rogue nation, regardless of the JCPOA. Let’s remember what the gentleman from Ohio reminded us, that it was because of information, including radio free Europe, that went across the Iron Curtain that ultimately brought that curtain down and freed millions. We want to make sure the Iranian people know about their own leadership. Our own State Department has said the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force along with Iranian partners, allies, and proxies continue to play a destabilizing role in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, but the ranking member says: Oh, let’s not say anything about their leadership because we might hurt their feelings. The State Department goes on to say: Iran continued to recruit fighters from across the region to join Iranian affiliated Shia militia forces engaged in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and has even offered a path to citizenship for those who heed this call. And yet the ranking member says let’s not report on the leadership of this rogue regime because they are very sensitive people. The State Department goes on to say: Hezbollah continued to work closely with Iran in these conflict zones, playing a major role in supporting the Syrian Government’s efforts to maintain control in the territory and providing training and a range of other support for Iranian aligned groups in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Yet we continue to hear from the ranking member that we shouldn’t learn anything about their leadership. Again, we might step on their toes after the JCPOA, and we wouldn’t want to do that. We wouldn’t want to be insensitive to international terrorists. In 2016, Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, boasted: ‘‘We are open about the fact that Hezbollah’s budget, its income, its expenses, everything it eats and drinks, its weapons and rockets are from the Islamic Republican of Iran.’’ I mean, how much more do we need to know? Why do we continue to have Members of the United States Congress come to the floor of this institution and somehow want to seemingly protect the leaders of this rogue regime? We want to know more information. We want to disseminate this information. We want the whole world to know about the leadership of the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism. It is exactly what the gentleman from Maine is trying to. I salute him for his leadership. I encourage all Members to vote ‘‘aye’’ for his bill. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5 minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–47. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: 
H.R. 1638 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act’’. 
The Congress finds the following: (1) Iran is characterized by high levels of official and institutional corruption, and substantial involvement by Iran’s security forces, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in the economy. (2) Many members of Iran’s senior political and military leadership have acquired significant personal and institutional wealth by using their positions to secure control of significant portions of Iran’s national economy. (3) Sanctions relief provided through the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action has resulted in the removal of many Iranian entities that are tied to governmental corruption from the list of entities sanctioned by the United States. (4) The Department of Treasury in 2011 designated the Islamic Republic of Iran’s financial sector as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern under section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, stating ‘‘Treasury has for the 
first time identified the entire Iranian financial sector; including Iran’s Central Bank, private Iranian banks, and branches, and subsidiaries of Iranian banks operating outside of Iran as posing illicit finance risks for the global financial system.’’. (5) Iran continues to be listed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) among the ‘‘NonCooperative Countries or Territories’’— countries which it perceived to be noncooperative in the global fight against terror finance and money laundering. (6) Iran and North Korea are the only countries listed by the FATF as ‘‘NonCooperative Countries or Territories’’ against which FATF countries should take measures. (7) The Transparency International index of perceived public corruption ranks Iran 130th out of 168 countries surveyed. (8) The State Department identified Iran as a ‘‘major moneylaundering country’’ in its International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) for 2016. (9) The State Department currently identifies Iran, along with Sudan and Syria, as a state sponsor of terrorism, ‘‘having repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism’’. (10) The State Department’s ‘‘Country Reports on Terrorism’’, published last in July 2017, noted that ‘‘Iran continued to sponsor terrorist groups around the world, principally through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps–Qods Force (IRGC–QF). These groups included Lebanese Hizballah, several Iraqi Shia militant groups, Hamas, and Palestine Islamic Jihad. Iran, Hizballah, and other Shia militia continued to provide support to the Asad regime, dramatically bolstering its capabilities, prolonging the civil war in Syria, and worsening the human rights and refugee crisis there.’’. (11) The Iranian Government’s tolerance of corruption and nepotism in business limits opportunities for foreign and domestic investment, particularly given the significant involvement of the IRGC in many sectors of Iran’s economy. (12) The IRGC and the leadershipcontrolled bonyads (foundations) control an estimated one third of Iran’s total economy, including large portions of Iran’s telecommunications, construction, and airport and port operations. These operations give the IRGC and bonyads vast funds to support terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas. (13) By gaining control of major economic sectors, the IRGC and bonyads have also served to further disadvantage the average Iranian.

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . SCHNEIDER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part A of House Report 115–463. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 5, line 23, strike ‘‘to contribute to’’ and all that follows through ‘‘by Iran;’’ on page 5, line 25 and insert the following: ‘‘to contribute—’’ (A) to the continued development, testing, and procurement of ballistic missile technology by Iran; and (B) to human rights abuses. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 658, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan amendment to H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act. I would like to thank my colleague from Texas, Judge POE, for joining me in this effort. Iran is a bad and dangerous actor in a volatile region of the world, which is why Congress has enacted sanctions in response to Tehran’s dangerous ballistic missile program and support for terrorist proxy groups, including Hezbollah. We must hold senior Iranian leadership accountable for destabilizing actions in the region and around the world. The legislation on the floor today is an effort to shine a light and focus our 
efforts on assets held by top Iranian officials, including the Supreme Leader, members of the Council of Guardians, members of the Expediency Council, and highranking military leaders. Specifically, the bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress information on the assets held by senior Iranian leaders. Included in this report are recommendations on how to improve the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions to prevent these assets and funding from being used by Iranian officials to further develop Iran’s ballistic missile program. My amendment simply, but importantly, expands this requirement to include Iran’s human rights abuses. We should be using every tool in our toolbox to make clear to Iran that its human rights abuses are unacceptable. The human rights situation in Iran is appalling, and abuses permeate many aspects of Iranian society. In Iran, repression and persecution of members of different religious faiths, including Sunni Muslims, Christians, and Baha’is is pervasive. The State Department’s International Religious Freedom Report of 2016 cites at least 103 members of minority religious groups imprisoned for their religious activities. Since 1979, Iran has executed more than 200 Baha’i leaders and, over the past 10 years, has conducted more than 850 arbitrary arrests of Baha’i individuals. Sexual orientation and gender identity are not protected categories from discrimination under Iranian law, and samesex acts are punishable by flogging and possibly even death. Arbitrary and unlawful killings are numerous. The State Department’s annual Human Rights Report says the Iranian Government announced 114 executions by August of 2016 and that unofficial reports suggest a total of 469 executions by the end of that year. The U.N. puts this number even higher at 530 executions in 2016. Freedom of speech is limited, media is censored, and publications have been banned and closed by the government. Harassment and detainment of journalists continue, and Iran’s citizens are not allowed to criticize the government, Supreme Leader, or official religion. The electoral system in Iran is neither free nor fair. In 2016, 79 percent of the candidates running for the Assembly of Experts and 58 percent running for the Islamic Consultative Assembly were disqualified by the Guardian Council. And we cannot forget about the Americans and other foreigners who Iran has unjustly detained and continues to hold on fabricated charges, including the following individuals whose family members testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this year: Baquer and Siamak Namazi, Nizar Zakka, and, of course, Robert Levinson, who has been held for more than 10 years. These are just a handful of examples of egregious human rights abuses by the Iranian Government. This amendment helps ensure that funds held by senior Iranian leaders do not contribute to these human rights abuses and that U.S. sanctions are best positioned to improve Iran’s human rights situation. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. SCHNEIDER for bringing this amendment. I am glad to be a cosponsor of the amendment. Mr. Chair, the Iranians are a serious threat to the world, to international security. Iran’s foreign policy is very clear. The Ayatollah has said it numerous times and continues to say that the foreign policy of Iran is: First, destroy Israel; second, destroy the United States. They have never wavered on this goal, and they are doing everything they can militarily to eventually try to reach those two goals. But the greatest victims of the mullah’s regime in Tehran are the people of Iran. They have been held hostage by the Supreme Leader who obviously cares more about ballistic missiles and international terrorism than taking care of the livelihood of the people who live under this regime. The regime has become a notorious international leader in suppression, execution, torture, and inhumanity. The world knows about what is taking place in Iran, and the good people of Iran have no political space for expression or dissent. If they decide to dissent from the actions of the Ayatollah, well, it is off to jail or they are hung in the public square. We saw what the regime did to the protesters of the Green Movement in 2009. Despite what some people still try to say, the current government is not seeking any sort of moderation. Over 3,000 executions have taken place under the regime’s socalled President Rouhani. Scores of human rights defenders and political activists are still in prison or under House arrest, and they haven’t been charged with anything and, of course, they haven’t been tried. The United States needs to prioritize elevating the voices of the Iranian people who are persecuted under oppression by this regime. These Iranians really represent the best of the Iranian civilization, and they are going to be the future of Iran. We should take note of what is happening to them. It should be the U.S. foreign policy to focus significant attention on the serious human rights violations taking place in Iran. I am happy to support and join Mr. SCHNEIDER in this amendment which will require the Treasury Department to issue recommendations as to how we can better prevent the mullahs from continuing the violent assault on human rights of the Iranian people. The United States must be at the forefront of this battle for human rights and decency for the Iranian people. We must call out the Ayatollah and the mullahs for what they are doing. They are persecuting, violating human rights of the Iranian people. The Iranian regime is the number one state sponsor of world terror, and it also rains down terror on its own people. We need to put the squeeze on them even if it hurts their little feelings. I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague, Judge POE, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman once again for bringing this amendment to the floor. I gladly support it. And that is just the way it is. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MS . MENG  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part A of House Report 115–463. Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 6, line 3, strike ‘‘and’’ at the end. Page 6, after line 3, insert the following new paragraph (and redesignate the subsequent paragraph accordingly): (7) an assessment of the impact and effectiveness of U.S. economic sanctions programs against Iran; and 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 658, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. MENG) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York. Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that I think every Member of this body can support, no matter how they intend to vote on final passage of H.R. 1638. This amendment simply seeks to insert a single new requirement into the report required by H.R. 1638, and that new requirement is as follows: ‘‘an assessment of the impact and effectiveness of U.S. economic sanctions programs against Iran.’’ b1615 Whether you voted for the Iran deal or against it, or whether you think economic sanctions are an effective diplomatic tool or something that sounds better than it is, I hope Members will support this amendment. We should make evidencebased policy decisions in this body, whenever 
possible, and, toward that end, we should know whether or not the sanctions that we pass here work. If we are going to require a new report from the Treasury in this bill, and that report must include ‘‘a description of how Treasury assesses the impact and effectiveness of U.S. economic sanctions programs against Iran,’’ I think it is only appropriate to ask for the assessment itself; and that is what this amendment does. Let me put it another way. Understanding how we count votes in America is important, but at the end of an election, I want to know the final tally. Who won? Who lost? What did we learn? Similarly, I think it is important that if the Treasury is going to have to produce a new report on sanctions against Iran pursuant to H.R. 1638, that we understand exactly how the Treasury intends to assess the impact and effectiveness of those sanctions. Even more importantly, though, I think this report should include the results of that assessment, particularly when it comes to sanctions we have authorized. That is all this amendment seeks to require, and I hope everyone in this body will support it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York for her amendment. I note that she was a supporter of H.R. 5461, a nearly identical bill that passed the House in the last Congress. I think that her amendment is a valuable addition to H.R. 1638. Indeed, we should always know the effectiveness of the programs that we promote. In this case, we do need to understand how effective economic sanctions may be. So I appreciate her leadership. Mr. Chairman, I would urge all Members to vote ‘‘aye’’ on the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MENG. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. MENG). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1638) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees on the estimated total assets under direct or indirect control by certain senior Iranian leaders and other figures, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 658, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, due to severe illness, I missed today’s vote series. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 676, ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 677, ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 678, ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 679, and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 680. 
STRENGTHENING OVERSIGHT OF IRAN’S ACCESS TO FINANCE ACT Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 658, I call up the bill (H.R. 4324) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to make certifications with respect to United States and foreign financial institutions’ aircraftrelated transactions involving Iran, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 658, in lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–48 is adopted and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: H.R. 4324 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act’’. 
The Congress finds the following: (1) Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), informally known as the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama administration agreed to license the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran, the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism and a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. (2) In April 2015, prior to the adoption of the JCPOA, Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew, in publicly advocating for its provisions, stated: ‘‘Make no mistake: deal or no deal, we will continue to use all our available tools, including sanctions, to counter Iran’s menacing behavior. Iran knows that our host of sanctions focused on its support for terrorism and its violations of human rights are not, and have never been, up for discussion.’’. (3) In March 2016 remarks to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Secretary Lew, in reference to U.S. commitments under the JCPOA, stated: ‘‘While we have lifted the nuclear sanctions, we continue to enforce sanctions directed at support for terrorism and regional destabilization, and missile and human rights violations.’’. (4) In an April 2016 forum at the Council on Foreign Relations, Secretary Lew stated that, under the JCPOA, the U.S. committed to lifting its nuclear sanctions, ‘‘but the U.S. financial system is not open to Iran, and that is not something that is going to change’’. (5) In September 2016, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued licenses permitting the export of up to 97 aircraft for use by Iran Air, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s flagship stateowned carrier. These licenses included authorization for U.S. financial institutions ‘‘to engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services’’ in order to effectuate the sales. In November 2016, OFAC licensed an additional 106 aircraft for purchase by Iran Air, which are also eligible for financing authorized by OFAC. (6) The Department of the Treasury had sanctioned Iran Air in 2011 for its use of commercial passenger aircraft to transport rockets, missiles, and other military cargo on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics, both of which had been designated under Executive Order 13382 for weapons proliferationrelated activities. In October 2017, the IRGC went on to be designated under Executive Order 13224 for its support of the IRGCQods 
Force, which has provided support to terrorist groups such as Hizballah, Hamas, and the Taliban. (7) Among Iran Air’s sanctionable activities, the airline delivered missile or rocket components to the Assad government in Syria, which like Iran is classified as a state sponsor of terrorism. (8) The Assad regime is responsible for a civil conflict that has claimed an estimated 400,000 lives, including through the government’s deployment of chemical weapons and barrel bombs against unarmed civilians and children. (9) Despite being delisted in 2016, Iran Air has continued to fly known weapons resupply routes to governmentcontrolled areas of Syria. According to research by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, between Implementation Day of the JCPOA on January 16, 2016, and May 4, 2017, Iran Air operated at least 134 flights to Syria, which included stops in Abadan, Iran, a suspected IRGC logistical hub for airlifts to the Assad regime. (10) In November 2016 correspondence to the Chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services, the Department of the Treasury noted that the commitment to delist Iran Air under the JCPOA ‘‘does not affect our ability to designate, or redesignate, any Iranian airline that engages in sanctionable activity. The United States retains the ability to designate any individual or entity that engages in sanctionable activities under our authorities targeting conduct outside the scope of the JCPOA, including Iran’s support for terrorism, human rights abuses, ballistic missile program, and other destabilizing activities in the region.’’. (11) In April 2017, Iran announced a deal for Aseman Airlines to purchase up to 60 commercial aircraft, a transaction that would require authorization by OFAC. Aseman Airlines’ chief executive officer, Hossein Alaei, has for decades served as a senior member of the IRGC.

Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 4324, which is a commonsense piece of legislation sponsored by my good friend and fellow Texan, Mr. WILLIAMS . His work as a member of the Financial Services Committee and as vice chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee has been invaluable. Mr. Speaker, as our colleagues know, under the Iran nuclear bill, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the Obama administration committed the U.S. to license the sale of aircraft to Iran. In addition to authorizing the sales, these licenses have authorized banks to engage in financing, even though Iran remains classified by the Treasury Department as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. On top of that, the State Department continues to label Iran as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism. The recipient of these aircraft would be Iran Air, the stateowned airline that was sanctioned as recently as 2011 for supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which itself has been designated by the Trump administration as a terrorist organization. So, Mr. Speaker, so far, so bad. And yet, while I and many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle find these aircraft sales and their financing deeply disturbing, Mr. WILLIAMS ’ bill is about something far, far simpler. All 
his bill would do is bring about the implications of the aircraft finance for Iran out into the sunlight. In other words, Mr. Speaker, it is a reporting requirement—nothing more, nothing less. It would simply require Treasury to help Congress understand who is involved in these transactions. If it is an airline, has that airline stopped supporting terrorists or other sanctioned persons. If it is a bank, does that bank have the due diligence in place to guard against the immense illicit finance risk endemic to Iran. All this legislation does is have Treasury certify this information for Congress. And, if Treasury can’t make those certifications, it simply has to notify us what plans it has in response, even if it has no plans in response. So, when we hear today from the other side of the aisle how this bill may impose new conditions on Iran or somehow stand in the way of commitments under the JCPOA, I suggest, again, everyone read the bill. It is simple. It is common sense. In fact, we should be considering this under the expedited process of the suspension calendar. This legislation provides, again, for a simple reporting requirement, Mr. Speaker; that is it, a reporting requirement. If my friends who oppose this bill don’t care enough to even request the information from the executive branch, especially information that may reveal the use of their constituents’ bank deposits for the benefit of enablers of terrorism, well, Mr. Speaker, that is a sad, sad day for congressional oversight and a sad day for the United States Congress. But there are people who have read the bill, if everybody in this institution hasn’t, people, for example, associated with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who wrote recently in a November 22 policy brief for the Foundation’s Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance: ‘‘The proposed bill supports Treasury’s robust licensing approval process by codifying steps that are likely already central to the Department’s evaluation process.’’ They go on to write, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘While not imposing any new standards for the approval of sales to Iran, codifying the existing standards in law through this bill makes the licensing process more transparent and gives the American people—through their elected representatives—a clear picture of a significant component of the sanctions relief provided to Iran under the nuclear agreement.’’ Mr. Speaker, I include this report in the RECORD . 
[From the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Nov. 22, 2017] CONGRESS SUPPORTS FINANCIAL  TRANSPARENCY FOR IRANIAN TRANSACTIONS  (By Annie Fixler, Tyler Stapleton) The House Financial Services Committee approved last week the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act, which codifies in law a set of conditions that the U.S. Treasury must use to evaluate licenses for the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran. The bill requires the secretary of the Treasury to report within 30 days whether transactions related to the export and reexport of aircraft to Iran pose a ‘‘significant money laundering or terrorism financing risk to the United States financial system.’’ The secretary must also determine whether the transactions benefit any Iranian person that has knowingly transported or otherwise supported the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or provided material support to persons included on Treasury’s sanctions lists. If the secretary cannot certify that the transaction meets these conditions, he must explain whether the licenses authorizing the transaction will be revoked, modified, or remain valid despite the potential for illicit transactions or benefits going to sanctioned persons. Under the July 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the United States committed to allowing the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran provided the planes are used ‘‘exclusively for commercial passenger aviation.’’ The JCPOA specifically states that if aircraft are either used for a prohibited purpose or transferred or resold to individuals or entities on Washington’s sanctions lists, the U.S. would view this as grounds to cease its approval of aircraft sales—but, by implication, not abrogate the nuclear deal in full. Upon the implementation of the JCPOA in January 2016, Treasury issued a Statement of Licensing Policy (SLP) and additional guidance reiterating and expanding on the relevant language from the nuclear deal. The SLP and related guidance indicate that Treasury would view license applications favorably but would review applications on a casebycase basis and ‘‘include appropriate conditions to ensure’’ that no sanctioned persons were involved in the transaction. The SLP and related guidance are clearly consistent with the JCPOA, which does not require the United States to issue licenses for aircraft sales without conditions. Accordingly, the SLP does not guarantee that all applications will be approved. If Washington determines that certain criteria are necessary in order to ensure that commercial aircraft are used appropriately, it is permitted to reject an application that does not meet those criteria. The proposed bill supports Treasury’s robust licensing approval process by codifying steps that are likely already central to the department’s evaluation process. First, for more than two decades, Treasury has been at the forefront of efforts to implement global antimoney laundering and counterterrorism financing standards. The bill emphasizes that these standards should be a critical component in the evaluation of licenses visa`vis Iranian aircraft transactions. Second, the bill’s requirement that no persons knowingly supporting proliferation benefit from the deal mirrors Treasury’s statement that no persons on sanctions lists be involved in the transactions. While not imposing any new standards for the approval of sales to Iran, codifying the existing standards in law through this bill makes the licensing process more transparent and gives the American people— through their elected representatives—a clearer picture of a significant component of the sanctions relief provided to Iran under the nuclear agreement. The most novel component of the bill is that it requires the secretary of the Treasury to issue a report listing all U.S. or foreign financial institutions that have conducted authorized transactions in connection with the export or reexport of commercial aircraft to Iran. While not classified, this information is not currently part of the public record. Objections to the publication of a list of companies and banks involved in aircraft sales revolve around exposing businesses to reputational risks for transacting with Iran. Yet it is unavoidable for there to be reputational risk for doing business—even legal business—with the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Mr. HENSARLING. In closing, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman, my fellow Texan, has given all Members an opportunity, no matter what their views on the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, to simply support transparency and Congress’ right to basic information. I hope that my colleagues will seize that opportunity. And, again, I thank Mr. WILLIAMS  from Texas for his leadership and his excellent work. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. HIMES), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully disagree with the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. This is not simply the gathering of information. This is not simply oversight. Under H.R. 4324, a condition would be imposed on the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran. The Iran nuclear deal was very clear. It is broadly committed to ‘‘allow for the sale of commercial passenger aircraft and related parts and services to Iran.’’ The only condition on the U.S. commitment is that ‘‘licensed items and services be used exclusively for commercial passenger aviation.’’ H.R. 4324 would impose a new condition, a new condition which would require certification by the Secretary of State and all of the process that would ensue. It is not a stretch—in fact, it is fairly clear—that if H.R. 4324 were to pass, the Iranians and others could credibly claim that we have violated our obligations under the JCPOA. Now, nobody should be surprised by that. Despite the advice of his National Security Advisor, despite the advice of the Secretary of Defense, despite the advice of pretty much everyone around him, President Trump chose not to recertify Iranian compliance with the Iran nuclear deal. We have seen bill after bill, including the bill just voted on, attempting to reverse the Iran nuclear deal, and we have heard this since this deal first came to the floor. Let’s reflect for one second on what the implications are: This bill puts the Iran nuclear deal at risk. It arguably takes American aircraft manufacturers out of competition for lucrative contracts. My colleague from Washington will address this shortly. 
I don’t understand how putting American jobs at risk and taking American manufacturers out of contention in favor of companies like Airbus is about keeping America great again. I don’t understand why, when we focus on jobs, this should be an action we should take. However, I will say something, and I speak as a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Prior to the passage of the Iran nuclear deal, it is not an exaggeration to say I didn’t worry every night in a way that we worry today about North Korea. I went to bed every night thinking about Iranian centrifuges spinning, about military technology being created that could ultimately deliver a nuclear weapon to Israel or to Europe or to the United States, and our intelligence community believed that we were 2 to 3 months away from an Iranian nuclear weapon, kind of where we are today on North Korea. I suspect everybody in this Chamber doesn’t want to be where we are on North Korea with another state, with Iran. I understand the skepticism on Iran, and I agree with everything that the chairman said with respect to Iran being a state sponsor of terrorism, with Iran being a location of money laundering, and I could go on, with Iran being an absolutely appalling regime. But I speak as a member of the Intelligence Committee for a lot of people in this room when I say that, for the first time in a long time subsequent to the passage of the Iran deal, whatever you think of Iran—and not many of us think much of Iran—we don’t go to bed every single night worrying about the possibility of waking up to a nuclear weaponized Iran. Why would we put that at risk? I agree with the chairman that transparency is important, and I agree with everybody that Iran needs to be watched very, very skeptically. But why would we want to be with Iran exactly where we are today with North Korea? Is this effort, which, in my opinion, is simply a continuation of the efforts to end the Iran deal, to reverse President Obama’s legacy, is it worth going to bed at night not just worried about North Korea, but worried about Iran? I would suggest that it is not. I don’t want to go back to the pre Iran deal era when I became an expert on centrifuges, on Uranium235, on hardened bunkers and the weaponry that we produced to penetrate hardened bunkers and to the realization that, if we had to go to war against Iran to prevent a nuclear Iran, the consequences would be as awful as if we went to war with North Korea to prevent a North Korea nuclearweaponized state. Why would we do this? Why would we put at risk a deal that has given comfort to a lot of us for some period of time? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, this deal is not a perfect deal. I don’t know that there are perfect deals in this realm. But I do know that, for the next 7, 8, or 9 years, we are not going to have the worry that so many of us had before the Iran deal. Let’s engage on that. Let’s figure out what comes behind the Iran deal. Let’s figure out other ways to address the behavior of Iran with respect to terrorism and the money laundering. Let’s remember that this deal was about removing the existential threat, not making Iran a perfect regime, but removing the existential threat to the United States of America, and let’s not put that deal at risk. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, and I urge a strong ‘‘no’’ vote against this legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ), my friend, the sponsor of this legislation, and a great member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, it is truly a privilege to speak in support of my bill, H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4324 will improve congressional oversight of any financing that Treasury authorizes for aircraft sales to Iran. Every 6 months, Treasury would need to certify to us that finance authorizations would not benefit an Iranian person who is transporting items for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction nor providing transportation for sanctioned entities. Treasury would also have to certify to us that those authorizations don’t pose a significant money laundering or terrorism finance risk to the U.S. financial system, and that any banks engaging in this business have appropriate due diligence procedures in place. If the Treasury Department cannot make this certification, the Department must tell us why, and it must explain to Congress the course of action it intends to take. I note that my bill was reported out of the Financial Services Committee last month by a vote of 38–21, with five of my Democratic colleagues voting in its favor. b1745 Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will label this bill as a simple attempt to dismantle the Obama administration’s Iran nuclear deal. We have already heard it. Mr. Speaker, this debate is not about U.S. commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. It is not about reimposing nuclear sanctions. It is not about prohibiting these aircraft sales or the financing of these sales. What this legislation is about is providing Congress with information on the implications of these deals so that we can better understand their impact on the integrity of our financial system. I would like to take a step back and discuss how we got to this point and why this legislation is necessary. As most of you know, under the JCPOA, the Obama administration committed the United States to license the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran. In addition to providing licenses for aircraft sales, the licenses also allowed for banks to engage in the financing of these aircraft. All of this was permitted, despite the fact that Iran remained classified as a jurisdiction to primary money laundering concern by the Treasury Department and as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terror by the State Department. Let us be abundantly clear on the facts. It was the Obama Treasury Department that highlighted the role that Iran and Iranian aircraft played in the destabilizing activity across the Middle East and in supporting the atrocities committed by the rogue Assad regime in Syria. On September 9, 2012, David S. Cohen, the Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence under President Obama, released the following statement: ‘‘The identification of Iranian aircraft also further highlights Iran’s ongoing effort to support the Assad regime’s weapons of mass destruction programs and crackdown against the Syrian people.’’ This quote followed the Treasury Department’s announcement to impose sanctions against entities that support the Assad regime in Syria. So quoting from the same September 9, 2012, Treasury statement: ‘‘As a result of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, foreign financial institutions that knowingly engage in significant transactions with . . . Iran Air, Mahan Air, or Yas Air, including any of 117 aircraft operated by these airlines, risk losing access to the U.S. banking system.’’ Mr. Speaker, this week I received a memo from the National Iranian American Council urging members to oppose my bill. This is the same council that opposes President Trump’s travel ban, which was recently upheld by a Supreme Court decision of 7–2, and the same organization that took concern with new sanctions imposed on Iran’s support for Hezbollah. This memo and the proIran principles that it represents could not be a better endorsement for the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act. I would ask this to my colleagues on both sides: At what point did we relegate ourselves to negotiating with those who wish us harm? At what point did we prioritize the interest of a rogue government that paints their bombs with sayings like ‘‘Death to Israel’’ and ‘‘Death to America’’? When did that happen? 
There are simply two sides to this issue. You can either protect the interests of the United States, her citizens, and the U.S. financial institutions, or you can make important the wishes of the Ayatollah and his revolutionary guard. Which side do you choose to be on? That is the question. I represent the red, white, and blue. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. WILLIAMS. My commitment to the safety and wellbeing of these United States is unwavering. I urge my colleagues to do the same: support the red, white, and blue, and support H.R. 4324. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act, would impose a new and unilateral certification requirement on the administration in order to meet current U.S. obligations under the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, with respect to the sale and financing of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran. This certification requirement would call for the Treasury Secretary to consider factors that fall well outside the scope of the nuclear deal and beyond the specific conditions that the U.S. is allowed to place on the license of commercial aircraft to Iran under the nuclear accord. By moving the goal posts on our commitments under the deal, H.R. 4324 clearly aims to force the United States into a violation of the agreement. Under the Iran nuclear deal, the United States is broadly committed to allow for the sale of commercial passenger aircraft and related parts and services to Iran. This involves licensing the sale of aircraft and related parts and services to Iran, including the financing for such sales. Under the JCPOA Annex II, the only condition on the U.S. commitment is that licensed items and services must be used exclusively for commercial passenger aviation. Moreover, the only allowable conditions the U.S. can place on authorizations for the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran apply to the licensed aircraft themselves and the use of such licensed aircraft, not on activities or services provided that have no relationship to the licensed aircraft or related goods or services. Yet, H.R. 4324 would impose new conditions on the licensed sale of aircraft to Iran, including, notably, the condition that the recipient airline has not used nonlicensed aircraft for purposes other than commercial passenger aviation. That is, under this bill, the administration would have to certify that Iran is not engaged in certain activity unrelated to Iran’s nuclear conduct but also unrelated to the use of the aircraft itself. If the Treasury Secretary is unable to make such a difficult certification, the Secretary must then report to Congress as to whether the Secretary intends to suspend, revoke, amend, or approve, notwithstanding such noncertification, any license facilitating the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran. Supporters of the bill will likely note that the bill will not require the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend or revoke an authorization in the event that the Secretary is unable to make the necessary certification, but the obvious political conclusion is that the Secretary will be forced to revoke such license if the Secretary is unwilling to make the certification. As we have now seen, the President detests the fact that his administration has to take affirmative steps to keep the deal in place, and he refused to do so. In the case of the last recurring 90day congressional certification requirement, proponents of this bill undoubtedly hope Trump will react the same way to these additional certifications and block the sale of commercial aircraft, which is a key element of the deal. In a break from reason and logic, this legislation plays directly into the hands of the President, who is desperate to find any pretext to say that Iran is in violation of the deal or to force Iran to walk away, and thereby, avoid having to take the blame for pulling the plug on the deal. But let me be clear. By seeking to render impermissible that which is expressly permitted by the JCPOA, the legislation is clearly intended to undermine the nuclear agreement. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), the chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act introduced by my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ). Since the seizure of the U.S. Embassy and the taking of 66 American hostages during the 1979 revolution, Iran has taken a long view on its global ambition, supporting terrorist proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen. From 1983, when Iransupported Hezbollah bombed a U.S. Marines barracks in Lebanon, killing 243 servicemembers, to the killing of over 500 soldiers in Iraq by the elite Quds Force leader, Qasem Soleimani, Iran has earned its reputation as the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Most recently, Iran Air, an Iranian stateowned airline, was sanctioned by the Treasury Department in 2011 for using its commercial passenger aircraft to transport weapons to terrorists helping the Assad regime in Syria and for transporting military cargo to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is in addition to what the world already well knows, that the Iranian regime has covered up and lied about its nuclear program for decades, deceiving international inspectors, agreeing to intrusive inspections, and then allowing those inspections to be implemented only provisionally and selectively. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, regularly chants ‘‘Death to America’’ and ultimately calls for the annihilation of the Jewish people. In 2015, the Obama administration made a historic mistake by agreeing to the illconceived Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or as it is also called, the Iran nuclear agreement or JCPOA. The agreement removed financial sanctions on Iran, enabling greater financial resources for Iranianfunded terrorism. Adding insult to injury, later, in 2016, due to the agreement, the Obama Treasury Department authorized the sale of more than 200 planes to Iran, the same Iranian airline that was sanctioned in 2011, and the Department also authorized U.S. banks to finance these transactions. But there is evidence that the carrier has continued its illicit behavior. According to an April 2017 hearing in our subcommittee, Dr. Emanuele Ottolenghi, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, testified that Iran Air operated at least 114 flights to Syria between January 16, 2016, which was Implementation Day of the JCPOA, and March 30, 2017. These flights are known as weapons resupply routes and stopovers in Iran with a suspected IRGC logistical hub that supports airlifts to the Assad regime. In communications with the committee, Dr. Ottolenghi later confirmed that Iran Air had run at least 134 such flights between Implementation Day and May 4, 2017, which means the Iran nuclear agreement facilitated Iran helping the brutal murderous regime of Assad. In exchange, what did the United States get out of this? Only managed access to suspect nuclear sites in which international inspectors must appeal to Iran, Russia, and China in a bureaucratic process that takes at least 24 days, during which Iran can remove anything covert and in violation of the agreement. International inspectors have also been denied access to military sites, the most likely places in Iran where illicit nuclear activity is occurring. But even if the JCPOA was delivering on its core promise of a denuclearized Iran, the agreement was sold with specific assurance that the JCPOA would not limit the United States’ ability to stop Iran’s nonnuclear activities and their support of terror activities. Then Secretary of State John Kerry, in defense of the agreement, selling the 
agreement to Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, testified that: ‘‘If we catch them funding terrorism, they are going to have a problem with the U.S. Congress.’’ Mr. Speaker, apparently not, because Members of Congress don’t have a problem with this evidence that Iran is funding terrorist proxies and the Assad regime. For these reasons, it is imperative that Congress pass the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act, which would require the Treasury to provide a report to Congress describing these connections. This is a reporting bill. Even if you support the JCPOA, you should support congressional oversight. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK), a member of the Financial Services Committee, so he can clear up some of the information that we just heard. Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I want to start with a question. Why is this bill so long? Last year, we had a bill, H.R. 5729, to block the sale of Boeing aircraft to Iran. It was short and clear. It was only 2 pages long. I didn’t like it and I didn’t support it; but the truth is, I always respect people putting forth their honest beliefs. H.R. 5729, last year, blocked the licenses to sell U.S. planes—straightforward. Torpedoing the plane sales endangered the JCPOA because, as we have indicated, it is an affirmative requirement and an obligation on the U.S. to approve plane sales if a sales agreement is reached. That was part of the deal: You won’t build or continue to develop nuclear weapons, we will do certain things, including sell you planes. Everyone knew what the bill would do and they could decide if they thought that was a good idea or a bad idea. It was very straightforward. It was effectively a proxy on the JCPOA. This year, we have another bill to block the sale of aircraft to Iran. It is neither short nor clear. In fact, it is six times as long as last year’s bill. b1800 It subjects the licenses to an ongoing and complex certification requirement. It literally names and shames U.S. banks providing financing. And, again, it does this purposefully so that it might deter the sale of airplanes so that it might undermine the JCPOA. Frankly, what I interpret, what I have heard this evening, is tantamount to that. This is, yet again, a proxy on the JCPOA. If you are against the JCPOA, vote ‘‘yes.’’ If you are for it, vote ‘‘no.’’ This bill, however, obscures its end purpose, that objective of undermining the JCPOA behind process and ambiguity. Why? If you oppose the sale of aircraft, oppose it. Have the courage of your convictions. Don’t just engage in this fearmongering. No matter how many times you say that people in Iran chant ‘‘Death to Israel, Death to America,’’ and whatever other form of fearmongering you engage in, at least have the courage of your own convictions. You did last year. Stand up for what you believe in. If you want Iran to buy Airbus aircraft instead of Boeing aircraft, then say that. Stand up for yourself. Stand up for what you believe. But let’s be clear. That is what this bill will do. Don’t dance around. For my part, I think blocking the sale of American planes is a big mistake on so many levels. Let’s be clear. It doesn’t deny Iran the use of aircraft; it just will deny them Americanmade aircraft. It will deny American machinists jobs to work on them. And need I remind anybody here what it means to be an engineer or a machinist at an aircraft company in this country? It means the kind of jobs that we all aspire to for our constituents. You know the kind; the kind that pay enough that you can buy a home, have decent healthcare, save enough money to send your kid to college if you want to, have regular vacations, and have a secure retirement. Those are the kinds of jobs we are taking away if we pass this bill. It doesn’t just prevent Iran from misusing aircraft, as has been suggested. It just prevents Americans from having maintenance and service agreements that keep eyes on the aircraft because, you see, if Airbus sells them these planes, we have no idea. If they are Americanmade planes, they come with aftersale maintenance and service agreements. We will have eyes on the planes. It doesn’t force Iran back to the bargaining table. It just jeopardizes and cuts the legs out from under the gains we have made in the JCPOA that I thought my colleague and friend from Connecticut spoke about so eloquently. We don’t go to sleep at night worried that Iran is getting closer to a bomb, as we would have, as North Korea has. So my friends, in summary, passage of this legislation will do three things: Number one, it will cost America jobs, and goodpaying jobs; Number two, it will make us less safe because it will undermine the JCPOA and, in so doing, not allow us to ensure that these planes are not being used for a nefarious purpose; And number three, it will actually make us less safe as well, in the sense that if it does, in fact, defeat the purpose of JCPOA— The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WALBERG ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK. If it does cut the legs out from JCPOA, as is its purpose, as is clear, then, of course, we are back on the track of Iran developing nuclear weapons as North Korea has. Fewer jobs and less safe; not sure what it is about that proposition that would be appealing to anyone. So, my friends, I urge you, in the strongest terms possible, be for American jobs. Be for America being safer. Be for us living up to our commitments, and vote ‘‘no’’ on this legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4324, which I cosponsor, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act, introduced by Congressman ROGER WILLIAMS . I stand with the courage of my convictions while I listen to others stand with the courage, apparently, of a conviction to coddle the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism. I have a problem, and I am not going to apologize for it, and my colleagues aren’t going to apologize for it; when we have an adversary of our Nation overthrowing foreign governments, financing terror, developing intercontinental ballistic missiles in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, calling Israel the Little Satan and America the Great Satan, pledging to wipe Israel off the map, chanting ‘‘Death to America.’’ Just a few weeks ago, the CIA dropped 470,000 documents collected in May of 2011, in the raid of Osama bin Laden’s compound. In those documents, it shows a strong relationship between Iran and alQaida, and Iran offering finance and arms for carrying out attacks against America. I signed up to run for the United States Congress and take an oath to protect this country, and, right now, while we are here this holiday season— tonight is the second night of Hanukkah. We are about to have Christmas, New Year’s—we have people who are overseas, sometimes on their 8th, 9th, 10th deployment, willing to risk everything in defense of our freedoms and liberties, putting themselves in harm’s way. So when 10 Navy sailors end up getting held hostage and embarrassed with photography and videography, being shamed by the Iranians, and then we say, as a matter of response, thank you? That was our response when they released our 10 detained Navy sailors. And you want to question the conviction of Congressman WILLIAMS introducing legislation that is incredibly important for protecting the United States and our servicemembers and our allies; and you want to mock us for having a problem with them chanting ‘‘Death to America?’’ Whose side are you on? For anyone who has the courage of conviction to coddle the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. Since the U.S. entered the JCPOA, Iran’s stateowned airline, Iran Air, 
has used its access to the U.S. aviation industry to purchase planes that aided the Assad regime in carrying out its war crimes in Syria against its own citizens, innocent women and children. Courage of convictions to stand with the United States, with our allies, and on behalf of the women and children being targeted by the Assad regime in Syria. We have a problem with that, and we want to do something about it. Don’t try to shame us into being apologetic and unwilling and afraid to stand up for all of those right principles. That is the courage and conviction that I stand up with today, with Congressman WILLIAMS , with Chairman HENSARLING , and all the others who are encouraging a strong ‘‘yes’’ vote for more accountability, for a stronger national defense, for a better future. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like everybody to know we are not trying to shame anybody. If we were going to shame someone, we would shame them and that party about connection to Russia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), an ardent supporter of the Iran nuclear agreement. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to this bill. The Iran nuclear agreement stands as a major diplomatic achievement that has destroyed Iran’s capacity to develop a nuclear weapon. Detractors point to Iran’s bad behavior in other realms—ballistic missiles, support for Hezbollah, violations of human rights. We acknowledge these problems. Nobody is talking about coddling Iran or apologizing for Iran. I resent that implication by the last speaker. The fact is, we take these problems and these challenges very, very seriously; but we also note that there is not a one of them that wouldn’t be much more serious if we were dealing with a nuclearcapable state. So we have got to protect this agreement. We have got to be wary of any proposals that would directly or indirectly threaten it. And that brings us to the bill before us, H.R. 4324, the socalled Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act, which would make it much more difficult for Iran to purchase commercial aircraft from firms that do business with the United States. Now, as we all know, Iran’s ability to replenish its aging civil aviation fleet, which was depleted by decades of sanctions, was a key incentive for Tehran to sign on to the JCPOA. Kenneth Katzman of the Congressional Research Service said: ‘‘Iran would view the bill’s enactment into law as a breach of the JCPOA. The agreement contains a clear U.S. commitment to undertake such sales to Iran.’’ But this bill imposes reporting and certification requirements that could well prompt the Treasury Department to cease issuing licenses allowing for such sales if this certification were to be contingent on nonnuclear factors, factors outside the deal. Richard Nephew, the lead sanctions expert for the U.S. negotiating team, put it this way. He said: ‘‘My take on this bill is that, if implemented the way I expect, it probably would violate the JCPOA.’’ Now, I suppose we have to entertain the possibility that that actually is what the authors of this bill have in mind. Maybe that is the idea, to give the Trump administration and the Iranian hardliners a way of sabotaging the agreement. Already, President Trump has tried to undermine the JCPOA by refusing to certify Iran’s compliance with the deal when, by all accounts, Iran is, in fact, complying. Now, by directly blocking a specific provision of the agreement, namely, the permissible sale of commercial passenger aircraft, this legislation would send a clear message to Iran that the United States does not negotiate in good faith. It would imply that we expect to have it both ways, with Iran dismantling its nuclear facilities and getting nothing in return. The bill before us today would also break faith with our P5+1 negotiating partners in a reckless and dangerous way. Because of this agreement, Mr. Speaker, the breakout time for Iran to develop enough weaponsgrade material for a nuclear weapon went from 2 or 3 months to more than a year. Because of this agreement, the international community has 24/7 access to Iran’s nuclear sites, an unprecedented degree of access, intrusive inspections. And because of this agreement, we possess an enforcement mechanism to ensure Iran’s compliance. Why on Earth would we give up these capabilities by failing to uphold our end of the bargain? That is the way agreements work. We uphold our end of the bargain. We don’t sabotage agreement by deceptive legislation like that bill before us. So, in light of renewed tensions on the Korean Peninsula, now is especially not the time for the United States to go back on its word to our allies and to the international community. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 4324. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), an outstanding member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. WILLIAMS , for introducing H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act. This act is needed. Tonight, we are not here to rehash the failings of the JCPOA, but we are really here to honor Secretary Kerry’s commitment of oversight of Iran outside that agreement. He made it quite clear to Congress in his briefings that we would monitor the world’s largest exporter of terror around the world; that we would do everything outside the agreement to enforce sanctions; that we would not stop reviewing their behavior. This piece of legislation comes at an important time, as the Trump administration is taking significant steps to protect our homeland by reviewing actions around rogue regimes and sponsors of terror around the world, including Iran. Now, my friend from Washington brought up the subject of the American worker, and, of course, we all are blessed by the brilliance and success of Boeing. We couldn’t come to our jobs without them. But there are 5,000 airlines in the world, Mr. Speaker. There are 10,000 Boeing aircraft in service, and there are 5,700 airplanes on order from the Boeing corporation to help make up that $41 billion of annual revenue. The question here is not about selling airplanes, the question here is about protecting the homeland and interests of our country around the world. Unfortunately, civil aviation is commingled with military Quds Force action; not just in what has been said tonight about transporting military action to Syria, supporting a war that has killed some 500,000 people, but what about Boeing transport from Damascus to Caracas? b1815 What about the Boeing aircraft operated by the Iranian regime back and forth between Russia and Iran, back and forth between Tehran and Damascus, between Damascus and Venezuela? It is not just the civilian aircraft, Mr. Speaker, and that is why we want to be alert, and our American citizens need to know if their bank deposits are being used to extend credit to a regime that seeks pleasure in murdering innocent people, murdering our men and women in uniform and even innocent civilians in their own country. We may differ on our views on the JCPOA, but we can all agree that nothing in the nuclear deal prevents the sharing of information between an administration and this Congress about financing aircraft for the world’s largest state supporter of terrorism. That is what this piece of legislation is trying to achieve. That is what Mr. WILLIAMS ’ point is in bringing it to the floor, and I appreciate his thoughtful work to implement this muchneeded policy and to help keep the citizens in my district safe from Iran’s global terror advance. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am going to read a letter addressed to the Members of Congress from a highly respected organization that is proIsrael and propeace advocacy. I am a member, and I look to the recommendations, the advice, and 
the assistance of this organization on all issues related to the Middle East and related to Iran and related to Israel. It is known as J Street, and I am a proud member and a proud participant. J Street urges Members: 
Oppose the socalled Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act, that is H.R. 4324, which is clearly intended to lead to a U.S. violation of the JCPOA. This bill would impose additional certification requirements on the administration in order to carry out current U.S. obligations related to commercial aircraft sales under the JCPOA. These new obligations require the administration to certify that Iran is not engaged in certain nonnuclear activity or issue a national security waiver saying they will allow the planes to be sold anyway. In other words, it imposes new unilateral terms for a continuation of the JCPOA that are unrelated to Iran’s nuclear conduct. It has been widely reported in connection with the President’s recent refusal to make the necessary certification to Congress under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act that the President resents having to undertake official actions to keep the United States in compliance with the JCPOA. Proponents of this legislation clearly hope to make use of the President’s apparent resistance to taking such steps by adding a new certification requirement that they hope he will also fail to meet, thereby blocking the sale of commercial aircraft and forcing a U.S. violation of the agreement. Anyone doubting that this is the point of the bill need look no further than the first finding, which makes clear that this bill is a gratuitously antiObama, antiJCPOA vehicle and not a serious attempt to legislate on a bipartisan basis on threats emanating from Iran. No one who wants to see the JCPOA continue to be implemented should support this bill. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, Dylan Williams, the vice president of government affairs who signed this bill, said: 
Congress just gave the administration powerful tools to conquer other countries, support of the Assad regime when it passed new sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North Korea a few months ago that the President signed into law. Implementation and assessment of the impact of that law should occur before consideration of any new sanctions legislation. 
Again, in addition to the supporters of this body who have worked very hard to try and convince the Members of this body to be on the side of peace, to try and get the Members to understand the seriousness of undermining the JCPOA, the Members of this body who work very hard for peace and who join with groups like J Street and advocate for peace are trying to make sure that the United States stands up to its agreements, understanding how this undermines our leadership in the world. If we sit down and we negotiate with other countries, as we have done on the JCPOA, and they expect us to live up to the agreements and then they hear that we have various Members of Congress with ideas of their own putting together legislation that is supported by the opposite side of the aisle, coming in not with one piece of legislation, not with two pieces of legislation, but we don’t know how many will continue if they are successful in passing the legislation that they are putting before us, if this continues, then I am certain that our allies will not trust us. They will not want to negotiate with us on other deals that are important to peace in this world. I would simply ask the Members on the opposite side of the aisle to pay attention to highly respected, credible organizations like J Street and take their advice about how to give support to the JCPOA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD), a hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Mr. WILLIAMS ’ legislation, H.R. 4324. I want to thank him for his leadership on this front. Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that much of the terror funding and the civil unrest that we see in the Middle East can be traced directly back to Iran. Since we have lifted sanctions on that regime—and, in particular, against stateowned entities like Iran Air—we have opened up ourselves to potentially financing Iran’s destabilizing activity in the region. Congress has a right to know if banks are linked to financing or doing business with Iran, again, the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. This bill is significant, considering what we have recently seen with Iran Air. As recently as 2011, Iran Air was transporting weapons and missiles on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; and even this year—not 2011, but this year—we have seen Iran Air continue to fly wellknown weapons resupply routes to proAssadcontrolled areas of Syria. Iran will always continue to find new and creative ways to bypass sanctions and to fund their worldwide terror network. We have to be on constant alert. Mr. WILLIAMS ’ legislation gives us the tools to do exactly that. His bill gives the people’s House, this House, more oversight on business that the Treasury Department authorizes with Iran. This is important because it conveys the importance of staying alert about our financial institutions when they get involved financially with Iran. Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank my colleague and my friend, Mr. WILLIAMS , for his leadership on this issue, and I urge adoption of this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ), the chairman emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and chairman of its Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed leader for this time, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act, authored by our good friend Mr. WILLIAMS  of Texas, who is swinging for the fences. When the Obama administration signed this terrible Iran nuclear deal, in addition to the lifting of sanctions and sending billions of dollars to this hideous regime, it also authorized licenses for the export of commercial passenger planes to Iran. After selling the world a bill of goods, the administration then turned around and agreed to allow the sale of planes to the world’s biggest exporter of terror. Not only that, but U.S. financial institutions would be needed to finalize these sales, meaning American taxpayers’ dollars could be used to finance these sales. The results were predictable, Mr. Speaker. Iran has been using its commercial planes to transport fighters, to transport weapons, to transport material to Hezbollah in Syria, just to mention one. The list could go on and on, many illicit activities. This is not something that Americans would be supporting, let alone underwriting. That is why Mr. WILLIAMS ’ bill is so important, and I thank Mr. HENSARLING for bringing it to the floor. It protects the U.S. financial system, and it protects the taxpayers by giving us in Congress greater oversight. That is what this bill is about: oversight over business that the Treasury authorizes with Iran. As we have heard speaker after speaker, Iran is the number one leading state sponsor of terror. It is responsible for the deaths of countless brave American men and women fighting overseas. It is the destabilizing force in Syria, to name just one of the countries. The Supreme Leader calls for the destruction of our most trusted ally, the democratic Jewish State of Israel; and the calls for ‘‘death to America,’’ Mr. Speaker, they go on and on, and it is written on walls. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, the JCPOA was flawed. We all know that. It was weak and it was dangerous. Let’s ask our constituents, our taxpayers, if they want their dollars to fund the purchase of planes for the number one state sponsor of terror. I think that the answer would be ‘‘no.’’ We are actually being asked to supposedly support American jobs by helping Iran, the number one terror state, to buy planes so this horrid human rights abuser of a country, this killer of Americans can use these very planes to continue exporting its terror activities throughout the world. 
This is preposterous. It is a false choice. Mr. Speaker, this bill protects the American consumer; it protects our constituents; it protects the taxpayer; and it gives us in Congress the proper oversight. Let’s pass what this is: a commonsense bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 4 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 5
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. On October 13, 2017, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency—that is, the IAEA, the U.N. nuclear watchdog that, since January 2016, has been monitoring and verifying Iran’s implementation of its nuclearrelated commitments—released a statement noting that, ‘‘At present, Iran is subject to the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime,’’ confirming that Iran remains in compliance with its JCPOA commitments. The same day, President Trump announced that he had refused to certify the national security value of the Iran nuclear deal, which gave Congress 60 days to fatally undermine the agreement by reintroducing some or all of the suspended sanctions; although, Congress did not do so. Despite the fact that the President did not withdraw from the nuclear accord, his disdain for the agreement has always been clear. In a highly confrontational speech, President Trump forcefully denounced the Islamic republic and attacked the deal for failing to curb Iran’s destabilizing regional activities, despite the fact the accord was never meant to address every aspect of Iran’s maligned activities. It was always intended to focus on Iran’s nuclear program. As an arms control agreement, the deal has, so far, been successful. b1830 Trump has threatened to upend the nuclear deal unless Congress amends it to make its terms more restrictive. The President is looking to find any rationale he can to walk away from the deal without having to take the blame. This legislation is precisely what he has been looking for. But American unilateralism, at this point, would be a disaster and would make forging a common front against Iran nearly impossible in the future. That is one way of ensuring failure at the outset of a diplomatic effort to pursue a new multilateral agreement, would be to violate an existing one with the same partners. The President’s insistence on renegotiating the JCPOA to extend the duration of several of its constraints make inspections more intrusive and expand its coverage to missiles. It is dangerous and unrealistic, given that every other signatory of the agreement has objected to changing its terms while Iran remains compliant. If Congress passes this bill, it would give the administration the path it needs to rip up the nuclear card without the constraints placed on Iran by the deal. The administration’s hostile attitude towards Iran and stark absence of diplomacy will inevitably put the United States on a path of escalation with Iraq. There is an obvious link with North Korea here as well. Hopefully, at some point, the President may determine that diplomacy has a role in managing the North Korean nuclear missile challenges. But America’s ability to offer a credible, diplomatic path will be seriously undermined if we cannot be trusted to stand by our agreement dealing with Iran to destabilize regional activities. Its ambition to remake large swaths of the Middle East in its image entails a broad range of challenges. Without the JCPOA, however, those challenges become even more daunting. I urge my colleagues not to give up on our best chance of containing Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons through peaceful means and to join me in rejecting this terrible bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ), a member of the Small Business Committee. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for yielding. This really isn’t that complicated. The JCPOA is a failed policy that was put up by a President who had no interest in protecting this country as it should be. President Trump is finally bringing this back to this country. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act. This important legislation is critical to hold Iran accountable and ensure the integrity of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank ROGER  WILLIAMS for his great work on this legislation. The Iran deal allows the United States to license the sale of passenger aircraft to Iran to update their civilian commercial airliner fleet. Despite the deal, Iran’s behavior has not changed, and they still remain a principal state sponsor of international terrorism, a direct contributor in propping up the Syrian regime, and a major facilitator of money laundering. However, enabling commercial aircraft sales could only fortify Iran’s rogue behavior. Many, including the Department of Treasury, are concerned that commercial aircraft could be used for noncivilian purposes, considering the statecontrolled airline, Iran Air, has facilitated Iran’s destabilization of Syria by transporting missile and rocket components to the Syrian regime. Justice Louis Brandeis once stated that, ‘‘Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants,’’ and that is what this legislation seeks to do. It simply adds a crucial layer of reporting requirements, certifying that the sale of passenger aircraft does not pose a money laundering risk or violate U.S. sanctions. Iranian continues to threaten the stability of the Middle East, and it poses a threat to U.S. national interests. Holding Iran accountable and preventing them from continuing to destabilize Syria should not be controversial at all. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully urge all of my colleagues to strongly support this legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 4 minutes remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, from time to time in my Congressional career I come to the House floor, and I have a surreal moment. Iran is the world’s foremost state sponsor of terror, and we have Members on the other side of the aisle saying: Well, we shouldn’t learn anything about them. We shouldn’t learn about who is financing their aircraft. We shouldn’t learn whether or not aircraft will be converted for military purposes. Iran is a regime where every day the leadership wakes up shouting: ‘‘Death to Israel, Death to America.’’ Yet I have friends on the other side of the aisle who say: Well, we shouldn’t have any reporting on Iran because it might hurt their feelings. This is a surreal moment, Mr. Speaker, an absolute surreal moment. We have been told over and over that somehow this stops the JCPOA, the nuclear deal with Iran. I wish it did, but it doesn’t. I would suggest to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if they actually read the bill, it is 10 pages long, 6 pages of findings. You can put the findings aside and read the 4 pages. It is a reporting bill. It has certifications. And guess what the implications are if the administration can’t give the proper certifications? Nothing. The deal continues to go on. It is perhaps the single worst foreign policy agreement in the history of America that legitimizes Iran’s nuclear program and, on its best day, slows up their nuclear weapons by maybe a few years, at best, on its best day. When the JCPOA was sold to us by the previous administration, we were told: This would be for civilian aircraft use only. Don’t worry about it. This is not going to exacerbate terrorism in any way. But we know Boeing itself says their aircraft, which are being sold to Iran, can be used for combat purposes, and, in fact, have been. Iran Air was cited in 2011. It was sanctioned for supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has been designated as a terrorist organization. 
This isn’t just theory, Mr. Speaker. It is a fact. Then we had my colleague, the gentleman from Washington, say: Well, it is important that we sell aircraft to Iran so companies can make profits. Well, using his logic, maybe we ought to sell weapons to North Korea if some company can make a profit. I think not, Mr. Speaker. There are some things that are more important. Our security is even more important than the profit of any one particular company. So, again, this is a simple reporting requirement. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ) for his leadership here. It is incredibly important that we understand from those who sold us this terrible Iranian deal, they need to make good on their promises. We need to make sure that civilian aircraft are being used for civilian purposes. We need to make sure that the banks who are financing these deals are not financing terrorism. Yet those on the other side of the aisle say: No, let’s put our heads in the sand. Let’s just trust—let’s trust the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism. They will do the right thing. Let’s just ignore this terrorism thing. No. No, Mr. Speaker. That is why it is so important that we enact H.R. 4324, and I urge all my colleagues to vote for it. It is important to America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act, introduced by my friend ROGER  WILLIAMS . This bill is critical to Congress’ sustained effort to roll back the most egregious concessions from the Obama Administration’s disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken many times about how the Iran deal endangers our national security, namely by acquiescing to Iran’s ambition to become a nuclear threshold in less than a decade. As if this concession—and the woefully inadequate inspections regime President Obama agreed to—were not troubling enough, the deal came with dozens of additional sweeteners for Iran that were folded into the main text of the agreement and an unknown number of sidedeals. These inducements were wrong on principle and they are downright dangerous in practice. On principle, Iran should not be gently incentivized to come clean about its nuclear program—it should be strictly compelled to comply with international norms. In practice, these numerous U.S. concessions to Iran effectively handed the world’s largest sponsor of terrorism more resources to advance its campaign for regional hegemony. By providing $115 billion in sanctions relief, a $1.7 billion ransom payment, and an $8.6 million payment for excess heavy water that violated the terms of the deal, the Obama Administration’s calamitous deal generated a windfall for the Iranian regime. Mr. Speaker, one especially troubling concession was the Obama Administration’s agreement in the text of the deal to sell commercial passenger aircraft to Iran while at the same time lifting sanctions on Iran Air, a national carrier notorious for ferrying Iran’s military manpower and materiel around the region. Iran Air was sanctioned by the United States in July 2011 under Executive Order 13382 for ‘‘for providing material support and services to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics.’’ Lest we believe Iran Air has straightened up its act since 2011, the Washington Free Beacon reported in August on images from this summer showing Iranian militiamen flying Iran Air to join the civil war in Syria. Mr. Speaker, it’s also clear that Iran has never had a greater incentive than it does today to double down on its hegemonic schemes as it expands its footholds in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere in the region. We have long known of Iran’s genocidal intentions toward our critical and democratic ally, Israel. For years Iran has poured money and resources into Hizballah and Hamas to develop proxies that can threaten Israel on its borders. Today, however, Iran is closer than ever to achieving its own toehold near the Israelicontrolled Golan Heights from which to menace Israel and terrorize its people. Why, in this context, would the United States knowingly furnish Iran with aircraft it needs to move its military assets around the region? Yet, as we speak, a sale of 80 Boeing aircraft to Iran Air, worth as much as $16.6 billion, is on track to proceed unless the Administration wisely intervenes or Congress hits the brakes. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4324 is crucial to applying necessary and thorough scrutiny to this deal or others like it. This bill will require the Department of the Treasury to certify that the beneficiaries of any such deal do not include Iranians known to be involved in transporting materiel or other resources for designated individuals or groups. Given Iran Air’s sinister past, it is only logical to demand this sort of certification. Furthermore, the bill would require the Treasury to certify that any such transaction does not pose a ‘‘significant money laundering or terrorism financing risk to the U.S. financial system.’’ Again, considering that Iran remains the world’s largest financier of terrorism and on the Financial Action Task Force’s blacklist of countries that pose a high risk of money laundering, it is only responsible to establish this sort of standard for major U.S. transactions with Iranian companies. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to support H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, introduced by my friend BRUCE POLIQUIN . This bill requires common sense reporting to Congress on the terrorism financing and money laundering threat posed by Iran to help us address it more effectively. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these timely and critical measures. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . GAETZ  
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BANKS of Indiana). The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 6, line 18, strike ‘‘or’’. Page 6, after line 18 insert the following (and redesignate the subsequent subclause accordingly): (II) has knowingly transported items used to establish in Syria a permanent military presence of either Iranian military forces or Iranian backed militia; or The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 658, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman HENSARLING , for his guidance and leadership in assisting me with this amendment. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ) for ensuring this Congress takes the strongest possible position as it relates to Iran and ensuring that we use every arrow in the proverbial quiver, financially speaking, so that U.S. assets and U.S. resources are not used to proliferate terror in a way that is consistent with Iran’s paradigm and their budding hegemony. Across the Middle East, we see Iran funding terrorist proxies, destabilizing the region, threatening their neighbors, and functioning as an eyesore for the world. So I am glad to be here offering an amendment to ensure that, as we use the tools at our disposal to limit Iran’s power to be a destabilizing sponsor of terror, we pay particular focus to the activities going on currently in Syria. In Syria now, a ceasefire has had an unintended consequence of giving Iran space to be able to move in and make attempts to harden longterm military assets, installations, so that troops could be housed and potentially launch other attacks and fund and equip Iran’s terrorist proxies throughout the area. It is no surprise that the facility that Iran most recently worked on would have housed upwards of 5,000 soldiers. It is believed that, potentially, Israel took action to ensure that the construction did not continue on that particular facility. My amendment, Mr. Speaker, conditions the provisions of this bill on an attestation that Iran has not set up permanent, present military in southern Syria. I think that is critically important. In the last conversation I had with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he indicated that Israel was most concerned, in all of the world, about the risks posed by Iran setting up a permanent military presence in southern Syria, and that that would cause potentially kinetic conflict, war, and even more dramatic, catastrophic outcomes. Again, I thank Chairman HENSARLING  and Mr. WILLIAMS for their strong leadership. I offer this amendment to back our ally, Israel, and to ensure that Iran does not have the capability to establish a permanent military presence in southern Syria. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question 
is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ). The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Swalwell of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4324 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 6, line 23, strike ‘‘and’’. Page 7, line 7, add ‘‘and’’ at the end Page 7, after line 7, insert the following: (iv) no financial institution participating in such transaction is engaged in business with a foreign entity that has been found by the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to have engaged in or authorized cyberattacks targeting any election held in the United States; 
b1845 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to a final passage vote, as amended. My amendment would add an additional certification requirement from the Treasury Secretary for financial institutions. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleagues across the aisle. Iran is a threat to our national security, and we should seek to hold them accountable, protect Americans, and defend our allies. The first major step in the last decade to do so was with the Iran nuclear agreement taking a nuclear power off the table. But we should also seek to hold accountable Iran’s chief enabler and best friend in the world, Russia, which my amendment will seek to do. My amendment would add a requirement that the Treasury Secretary certify that an institution financing the export of commercial aircraft to Iran did not engage in business with any foreign entity which engaged in or authorized cyber attacks targeting American elections. This is a commonsense provision to ensure that companies are aware of the effects their financial dealings have on supporting those who engage in election interference. We should think carefully about letting financial institutions do business with countries that choose to conduct this new cyber warfare. While it may have been unthinkable before 2016 that a foreign adversary would interfere in one of our elections, we know now that the threat is all too real. Our intelligence community concluded that Russia interfered in our 2016 elections; and it also concluded that this was ordered by President Vladimir Putin, with the goal of helping its preferred candidate, Donald Trump. Why this is something that the President and some of my colleagues across the aisle still question is beyond shocking. It is also a slap in the face of the dedicated men and women who serve and toil for our intelligence communities. The 2016 election, Mr. Speaker, is behind us. We shouldn’t relitigate it. We should learn, though, from how a foreign adversary, a friend of Iran, sought to influence the American voter. This is not a Democratic Party or Republican Party issue. It is about our freedom of choice: who gets to choose when we go to the ballot box. Iran is not our friend. Guess who else is not our friend? Iran’s friend Russia. But if you don’t believe me, if you are cynical enough, as the President is, to dismiss the findings of our intelligence community, then believe the Russians. Believe their own declarations. In September, a Duma parliament member, Nikonov Vyacheslav, stated that the United States intelligence community slept while Russia elected a new United States President of the United States. Does anyone in this House want to do something about that? In this attack, did Russia work with the Trump campaign? That is a serious question that remains outstanding. Every day seems to bring new revelations about the connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. We must do all we can to allow Bob Mueller and his team to pursue that evidence unimpeded by Presidential obstruction. We also must be able to conduct our investigations on the House Intelligence Committee to do all we can to get to the bottom, to tell the American people how we were so vulnerable, who in the United States was responsible, whether the U.S. Government response was adequate, and what we can do to make sure it never happens again. I fear, Mr. Speaker, that the President and many of his own enablers in Congress are seeking to fire Bob Mueller, which would set us back and greatly affect our ability to prevent another attack by Russia. But what we can do with this amendment today is not only stand up to Iran, but also stand up to their chief enabler, someone who finances them and assists the terror that they enact across the globe. Vote for this motion to recommit, and, by doing so, Members will show their concern not only about Iran, but also about their chief enabler. Members will show their concern for our democracy and the interference that Iran’s best friend, Russia, carried out in our last election. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to be schizophrenic. They can’t seem to figure out whether they want to coddle Iran or to ‘‘stand up to’’ Iran. We were also told that H.R. 4324 was designed to ‘‘blame and shame’’ financial institutions, and now they offer a motion to recommit to blame and shame financial institutions. So here is what is going on, Mr. Speaker: What we have is a regime that wakes up every morning shouting ‘‘Death to America; death to Israel,’’ and yet we have a motion to recommit trying to relitigate the 2016 Presidential election. We have a regime which has been certified as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism whom we are trying to hold accountable and from whom we are trying to get information, and our friends on the other side of the aisle are trying to relitigate the 2016 Presidential election. We know that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps supports the Assad regime in Syria. According to the U.N., the Assad government, with the help of Iran, has now carried out 27 chemical weapon attacks since the start of the Syrian conflict, including an April 2017 sarin gas attack that killed more than 80 people, including scores of women and children, and my friends on the other side of the aisle want to relitigate the 2016 Presidential election. Mr. Speaker, Iran continues to imprison foreign nationals, including Americans—including Americans—including 81yearold Baquer Namazi, who has lost his teeth in prison due to malnutrition. We have had another American prisoner, a student at Princeton, who has suffered health problems, and yet my friends on the other side of the aisle, with their motion to recommit, want to relitigate the 2016 Presidential election. This is a serious moment, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4324 by the gentleman from Texas is an important piece of legislation to ensure that civilian aircraft sales to Iran remain civilian aircraft and that our financial institutions are not unwittingly helping to finance this rogue terrorist regime, and it is no time to relitigate an election that my friends on the other side of the aisle lost. 
We need to reject the motion to recommit, and we need to enact H.R. 4324. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO SURF LEGEND BRUCE BROWN (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to surf legend and filmmaker Bruce Brown, who, at 80 years of age, died this week. Bruce Brown challenged a generation of Americans to follow our dream and to find our perfect wave. He reached out to introduce us to the magic experience of being propelled by the power of nature on an ocean wave. Adventure and a rush of excitement was only as far away as a local beach. Bruce Brown made movies about surfing. ‘‘Endless Summer’’ was his best known. But his films were more than entertainment. He spoke to our soul and our spirit of adventure. He inspired us to go for it, to take on towering waves, just as other Americans scaled the tallest mountain peaks and even journeyed to the Moon. Isn’t that what America was all about? Isn’t that what America is all about? My first surfboard was a large, singlefin Velzy. Dale Velzy owned a surf shop in San Clemente and financed Bruce Brown’s first film, ‘‘Slippery When Wet.’’ The surf culture Bruce Brown helped get born is still here. Outsiders are intrigued by it. You know when you are part of it. Bruce Brown showed us the way. A few days ago, he passed on and is paddling into the distant sunset. He followed his dream, he found his perfect wave, and he rode it as far as it would take him. f 
TAX REFORM ON STUDENTS (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, education is supposed to be the great equalizer, but instead of investing in our students, Republicans, through their tax scam, are attempting to widen that equality gap. Young people want to pursue higher education, and Republicans want to punish them with higher taxes so we can give away benefits to millionaires and billionaires. Students are gaining knowledge that can actually make a difference in this world, but the Republicans’ tax plan will only serve to deter them from that goal. It is right here in black and white. Republicans are trying to eliminate student loan interest deductions. They want to tax college endowments that provide scholarships and student aid. They are taxing graduate tuition benefits that would make graduate school unattainable for low and middleincome students. So this Republican attack on college and graduate students says loud and clear: Low income? No rich parents? Good luck. Pay up. It is an absolute disgrace. 
RECOGNIZING WOODWARD TOWNSHIP SUPERVISOR CLYDE GLOSSNER FOR 47 YEARS OF SERVICE (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Clyde Glossner, who has served the Woodward Township in Clinton County as supervisor for nearly 50 years. Supervisor Glossner, who is 84, will retire this year after 47 years of service. Next Tuesday, he will oversee his last board of supervisors meeting. Supervisor Glossner has been a resident of the township his entire life. He is a member of the Forty and Eight organization and the Masons in Lock Haven. He and his wife of 60 years, Wilma, were married in 1955 in First Evangelical United Brethren Church in Lock Haven. In September 1955, Clyde and Wilma purchased their home in Woodward Township. They still live there today, and they have three grown sons. In his earlier years, Supervisor Glossner worked as a food inspector for the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. He has shown his dedication to his neighbors through his years of public service, and the community will gather next Tuesday, December 19, at the Dunnstown Fire Hall to honor him. Mr. Speaker, I commend Supervisor Glossner for a life of service, and I wish him well in his retirement. f 
TAX REFORM (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, what is happening in Washington? With the holidays coming up, I would like to know why the Republican majority seems so intent on putting coal in the stockings of everyday Americans. Last week, the House passed a continuing resolution that did little but move the threat of a government shutdown to just a few days before Christmas. The Republican tax bill is a brazen attempt to put money in the pockets of the superwealthy and wellconnected at the expense of seniors, our students, middle class families, and hardworking Americans. The American people don’t deserve this tax hike. It is a billionairesfirst Republican tax scam, and they don’t deserve a government that reels from shutdown crisis to crisis doing nothing but creating uncertainty in our country. What we should be doing is fixing CHIP. The Children’s Health Insurance Program provides real, permanent tax relief to those who need it most: our 9 million children, 250,000 in my district. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. They deserve better jobs, better wages, and a better future. 
b1900 FIVEYEAR ANNIVERSARY OF SANDY HOOK SHOOTING The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of tonight’s Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Connecticut? There was no objection. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, December 14, marks the 5year anniversary of the horrific school shooting in the home community of Sandy Hook Elementary School. That day shocked the Nation. Twenty schoolchildren and six educators—20 6yearolds and 7yearolds—were ripped from the community of Newtown and from the United States. I remember that day. I was a newly elected Member of Congress learning about what it means to serve in this 
august body. I was with about 40 or 50 of my colleagues learning about our duties when I started to get emails and text messages that something terrible had happened at home. By noon, I learned the worst. Dozens of children had been gunned down, in cold blood, along with their teachers. I threw my things in the back of the car and I drove from Boston. I called my mother, I called my minister, and I prayed for wisdom and I prayed for guidance and the courage to face those families. I arrived in Newtown while families were being notified that their children who they had put on the bus that morning, thinking about Hanukkah or Christmas or thinking about the snow that was already on the ground, would never come home. It is sad. It is sad and it is inexcusable that I stand here 5 years later. In that time, this Chamber, the people’s House, has not taken up the people’s business. As of this fall, in fact, over 90 percent of Americans still support having universal background checks on all gun sales to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Over 90 percent of American households that have guns also support that commonsense legislation. Yet, in this House, we have not been given the opportunity to vote on that legislation. In those 5 years, 170,000 Americans have lost their lives to gun violence. Think about that: 170,000. Newtown, like my hometown of Cheshire, is about 30,000 people. That is multiple Newtowns all day, every single one. Every single one of those Americans was a son or a daughter of someone and had friends and neighbors and loved ones. Again, in that time, this body has not acted. Two weeks ago, I was in church in Danbury, Connecticut. I was at services with a congregation I try to get to every 6 months or so. I saw a couple of people I didn’t expect to see. I saw the mother of one of the little girls who was killed 5 years ago. I saw the daughter of the principal. They were there for guidance, for wisdom, for courage to fight the battle that the American people are waging for this House to take action on. The American people know the right thing to do. Our law enforcement know the right thing to do. The vast majority of responsible gun owners know the right thing to do. Yet, somehow, this body has failed to act. But it is never too late. Now is the time for us to step up. Now is the time for us to shoulder our responsibilities so that no other community has to go through what Newtown has gone through. Although, in that time, we have now seen Las Vegas, we have seen Charleston, we have seen Orlando. There are killing fields now in America. That is not right. It doesn’t need to be. I am joined tonight by several of my colleagues who are passionate advocates for gun sense and gun safety in America. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ). Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Congresswoman ESTY, for leading this Special Order hour and for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I will never forget the Sandy Hook tragedy that happened 5 years ago tomorrow. It was like yesterday. I was at Harvard University. I was seated next to Congresswoman ESTY when the news broke about the shooting in the district she had just been elected to serve. The more we learned that day, the more devastating and heartbreaking the news became. Innocent children were taken away from their parents, from their brothers and sisters, and from their community. I hoped and prayed that day that we would never see a tragedy like Sandy Hook. But, of course, our country continues to be unique in the number of people we have lost to mass shootings and gun violence. As a Member of Congress, I cannot stand by and allow our communities to continue to be upturned by the loss of innocent lives. There are too many things we can do to address this epidemic. We should allow Federal agencies to study gun violence as a public health crisis, because it is. We should keep guns out of the hands of individuals on the terrorist watch list and those convicted of hate crimes. We should close the gun show loopholes, Mr. Speaker, and reinstate the assault weapons ban. You will note that none of the proposals I just mentioned would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment or limit the ability of Americans to protect themselves or their families. So there should be no reason why our Republican colleagues can’t join us and pass sensible reforms that will save lives, like the lives we could have saved at Sandy Hook. I hope and pray that this Congress has the courage to curb this epidemic of gun violence, because I don’t want to continue to see the Sandy Hooks, the Charleston Nines, the Orlandos, or what we saw this year in cities like Las Vegas or small towns like Sutherland Springs. One of the things we can do to honor the memory of the victims of those tragedies and all victims of gun violence is to make sure that no more families have to experience the same senseless loss. Again, I thank my colleague and friend for being courageous and for standing up and fighting for better gun laws so that we can save lives. I thank her for being a champion and leading tonight’s effort. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ), my friend and the leader in our effort, who is an expert in guns. He has experienced more than his share of gun violence as a decorated servicemember fighting our Nation’s battles, and he has now led us for the last 5 years in our efforts for a safer, better society and a better world as the head of our Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and also for her leadership in regard to gun violence prevention and all the work that she has done and all of the effort she has put forward to try and bring some common sense to this issue. The speaker before me said that she will never forget what happened at Sandy Hook and where she was when that tragedy took place. I don’t think there are any of us who know what Sandy Hook was or were in Congress when Sandy Hook happened or care about this issue who will ever forget where we were. For me, I was in my home State of California, in the Sacramento Valley, in a duck blind. I was duck hunting. Yes, I am a hunter. I am a gun owner. I carried a weapon in Vietnam during the Vietnam war. I strongly support the Second Amendment. But I truly and passionately believe that, as a responsible gun owner, I have a responsibility, as does every responsible gun owner in the United States of America, to speak out to make sure that everyone who handles and owns a firearm does it safely and responsibly and that we do everything we can to make sure that people who shouldn’t get their hands on firearms don’t. I know you can’t stop everybody, but we should be doing everything we can to minimize the likelihood that someone who shouldn’t have a firearm—a criminal, a domestic abuser, someone who is dangerously mentally ill— doesn’t get their hands on firearms. Last week, families who lost loved ones in the Sandy Hook massacre came here to Capitol Hill to share their grief and to call for action to deal with this terrible, terrible thing we call gun violence. This was a day after the House passed the dangerous Concealed Carry Reciprocity bill that would let criminals convicted of violent crimes carry loaded concealed guns in virtually every State in the country. Instead of honoring the 20 precious little children and the 6 brave and dedicated educators who were slaughtered at Sandy Hook, the Republican leadership put the gun lobby ahead of State laws and ahead of gun violence prevention. We have had 40 moments of silence since Sandy Hook. Forty moments of silence. Meanwhile, there have been 1,500 mass shootings since that awful day in December, 5 years ago. 64,000 people in the United States of America have been killed by someone using a gun. Last week, the families of those victims asked us one thing. They asked us to honor their loved ones with action, stop the gun lobby’s reckless and profitdriven agenda, and stand up 
for communities all across this country. As I have said before, I am a gun owner. I have owned and used guns all of my life. I support the Second Amendment. I am here tonight to call on the Republican leadership to come to the table. Let’s move commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will keep us safe, keep our communities safe, and still honor the Second Amendment. I care about the people in my district, as I know all of you care about the people in your districts. I have a son who is a deputy sheriff. I certainly don’t want him to go out on a call and meet up with somebody who shouldn’t have a gun. I have got grandchildren in my community. I certainly don’t want them exposed to people who shouldn’t have guns. I am here tonight to call on the Republican leadership to do something about this. Let’s move this commonsense, bipartisan legislation. We can start by expanding background checks to make it harder for criminals and the dangerously mentally ill to get their hands on guns. This should be the first line of defense. Congress should make that happen. Ninetytwo percent of the American people believe we should expand background checks. What is the harm in checking to ensure that someone is not a criminal or to ensure that someone is not dangerously mentally ill before we allow them to buy a gun and take it off into the community where they can possibly do some harm? We put these ideas up before this leadership and there has been silence. No hearings on the bill, no votes on the bill. Well, if the Republican leadership doesn’t like our ideas about how to curb gun violence, then how about putting together a select committee of both Democrats and Republicans? Charge that select committee with working on the issue of gun violence prevention and to come up with some ideas that will keep our communities safe. b1915 We owe it to the families of Sandy Hook and to all those who have lost someone to gun violence. We dishonor their memory when we do nothing, and that is what is happening under this leadership: we are doing nothing. That is shameful. We need to make sure that we do everything we can to help prevent gun violence. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations of the House Judiciary Committee and vice chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I thank her for her leadership. I am sure she is leading on this devastating day and devastating loss in her district that she would much prefer not to do. As I listened to my colleagues, each of us giving our own separate story of where we were the day of Sandy Hook, all I can say, and what I remember, is that I became breathless; I became unbelieving. It was a very painful day. It was a sickening day, horrifying, and I was questioning: Is this really happening, or did this really happen? As a member of the Judiciary Committee, and as I have listened over the years of some of the more descriptive accounts of Sandy Hook, some of the stories of such bravery of the principal and teachers who lost their lives, or those who tried to intervene on this deranged gunman—who, by the way, killed his mother before he came to that school—there is nothing more that you can say. Breathless. Similar to the actions of former President Barack Obama. I can distinctly remember him being before the national audience, the people of the United States, as I recall, in the White House, and wiping a tear, or tears, away from his eyes. I think the whole Nation, at that time, crumbled. A Commander in Chief, known for his strong, stoic leadership, could not comprehend what had happened to these children at Sandy Hook. I think all of us believe this would be a galvanizing call to action. All of us took notice. We never expected Las Vegas with 50plus killed in 2017, never expected Orlando in 2016 with 50 killed, or Virginia Tech that happened a few years before. It amazes me that we are here in commemoration and not here in celebration of what we accomplished for those who yet live: the little ones who go every day to school, the college students, the people who go to clubs, the churchgoing people. What did we accomplish? Why are we being rebuffed? Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the Sandy Hook families, of whom I met as well, what brave men and women. Here they are spending their time trying to be the soldiers of reason around gun safety. It is horrifying to admit that gun violence now seems to be a staple of American life. The United States ranks number one in the world in terms of firearms per capita, with 88.8 guns per 100, and has the highest homicide by firearm rate in the developed world. The problem is so endemic that gun violence is now the third leading cause of death for children in the United States. How many parents crumble themselves or fall over a casket of a dead child? We know in Chicago that children die by driveby shootings through no fault of their own. Chicago has tough gun laws, and there is a mockery being made by those who oppose gun safety laws, but you recognize that the surrounding areas that Chicago is in the midst of—the States—they have no constraints of much, so the guns are transported into States like Illinois and cities like Chicago. An average of 1,297 children die annually from gunrelated injuries. And our colleague and friend, ROBIN KELLY , reminds us all the time of the gun violence that continues in cities like Chicago. Guns are linked to roughly 33,000 deaths in the United States per year. About twothirds of them are suicides. According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans across partisan lines support gun policy proposals, such as barring people with mental illness from buying guns, prohibiting gun purchases by people on Federal nofly or watch lists, something we have been trying to pass forever—a reasonable response to the safety of Americans. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I cannot imagine why that would not be a unifying legislative initiative—and background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows and universal background checks. There is always the rebuttal: ‘‘Guns don’t kill, people do.’’ But people with varying conditions take up guns because they are allowed to do so with unfettered gun purchases. It is well known—the percentage of membership of the NRA. That is why I was glad to listen to Chairman THOMPSON , who is a gun owner, a gun user, but how fortunate we are to have him lead the committee, because he can unabashedly, as a war veteran, combat war veteran, say that it doesn’t make sense in America to be able to have unfettered gun use. The majority must cut its close ties to the powerful gun lobby to facilitate useful gun control legislation necessary immediately. America has six times as many firearm homicides as Canada and nearly 16 times as many as Germany. The United Nations data shows that America far and away leads other developed countries when it comes to gunrelated homicides. America has 4.4 percent of the world’s population, but almost half of the civilianowned guns around the world. In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself—someone who had killed his mother before he came. Since then, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 1,715 people killed, and 6,000 wounded. Who would have ever imagined that a man would be at the top of a hotel and massively kill so many. Who would ever imagine that there is a law on the books that prevent the Centers for Disease Control and the NIH to study the impact of gun violence as a health crisis. This Congress has. Republicans have. So, in spite of mass shootings, we have unfortunate opposition and downright obstructionism on getting good gun safety legislation on the floor of the House. I am not a stranger to this. I come from Texas. There are a lot of guns in 
Texas. And I would like to think that a majority of my fellow Texans handle their guns safely and understand the value of gun safety legislation. But when I introduced the first city ordinance to hold parents responsible for children that got guns and shot each other, it was an uprising, a revolution. It was a packed chamber. People were wearing their colonial clothing, playing flutes, singing patriotic songs, and saying that we were stepping on the Second Amendment. But medical doctors and parents who had lost children because those children had gotten guns and shot their sibling, they understood that it was a small measure to stop children from getting their parents’ guns on a summer day, or after school, and injuring or killing their little brother or sister. Is there any common sense? So today, I join in honoring the Sandy Hook families, an honor that I know they did not wish to have. They would rather have their precious little ones. As I close, I want to make two points: There is no doubt that people are dying because of gun violence, that we exceed the rational civilized perspective of how many guns are in this country, and that our children are dying. Seven children and adolescents lose their lives to gun violence each day, 75 percent of which are under the age of 12 years old. A lot of these are through accidental shootings where children get guns. I leave you with this perspective: a great nation. Yes, we send young people into war. That is one of the arguments: 18yearolds have guns, yes, as they stand up for their country, in an organized, regularized manner to defend this Nation, and we thank them for their young patriotism. But I venture to say, as I visit faraway places—war zones—young soldiers understand the difference of an AR–15 or an AK rifle in war, as opposed to being on the streets. And our officers, who are doing their duty, good officers, who are in the course of good police work, who have to do a stop, and they run into someone who now has been given latitude to the concealed carry reciprocity bill, to just carry a gun any way you want, and if you come to a State that has strict and positive gun safety laws, that officer has to be able to be judge and jury to determine whether your random license from somewhere else is credible. As my colleague said: That is the Christmas gift that they are giving to the children of America, rather than the universal background check or the forbidding of individuals on a terrorist list carrying guns. That is not the gift that they are willing to give. They are giving our children, under the twinkling of the lights, rather than the loving arms of safety and security—they are giving them bullets and automatic weapons and the right for people to go on the streets and kill in churches, like that in Texas and that in South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I finish by saying that even the smallest of amendments, when we did the concealed weapons carry, the one that would disallow those with convictions of domestic violence and stalking, my Republican friends voted it down. Or an amendment that said that if you committed a hate crime, and convicted of such, my Republican friends voted it down. So I am not giving up, and I thank the gentlewoman for having us come today. My celebration tonight is of the courage of families who suffered so much to continue their journey to stand up and be counted for what is right in America, and that is real gun safety legislation. Mr. Speaker, on October 1, 2017 the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States occurred in Las Vegas, Nevada when, in a heinous act of terror and hatred, 58 persons were killed and 515 others were injured in a shooting at an outdoor concert near the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Until then, June 13, 2016 marked the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States in Orlando, Florida, when, in another heinous act of terror and hatred, 49 persons were killed at Pulse, a popular nightclub, meeting place, and sanctuary for Central Florida’s vibrant and dynamic LGBTQ community; sadly, the Las Vegas mass shooting surpassed that dreadful shooting in numbers of dead and injured. The horrifying events in Las Vegas mark the 273rd mass shooting in the U.S. in the 275 days that have passed so far in 2017, according to Gun Violence Archive. Mass shootings are a near daily occurrence in America, but what happened in Las Vegas stands out: It was the deadliest such incident in U.S. history, with more than 58 killed and 515 injured. Including that massacre, the four deadliest U.S. mass shootings have occurred over the past 10 years. A mass shooting is defined by Gun Violence Archive as any incident in which four or more are shot and/or killed in a single event, at the same general time and location not including the shooter. Recent U.S. mass shootings include: 1. Las Vegas, 2017: 50+ killed 2. Orlando, 2016: 50 killed 3. Virginia Tech, 2007: 32 killed 4. Sandy Hook, 2012: 27 killed 5. San Ysirdo, 1984: 21 killed 6. San Bernadino, 2015: 14 killed 7. Edmond, 1986: 14 killed 8. Fort Hood, 2009: 13 killed 9. Columbine, 1999: 13 killed There have been more than 11,600 deaths linked to gun violence so far in 2017, which is roughly equivalent to nearly four 9/11 attacks in terms of the total number killed on September 11, 2001. Comparatively, more than 15 thousand were killed by gun violence in 2016, and there were 383 mass shootings. It is horrifying to admit that gun violence now seems to be a staple of American life. The United States ranks No. 1 in the world in terms of firearms per capita—with 88.8 guns per 100 people—and it has the highest homicidebyfirearm rate in the developed world. The problem is so endemic that gun violence is now the third leading cause of death for children in the U.S. An average of 1,297 children die annually from gunrelated injuries. Guns are linked to roughly 33 thousand deaths in the U.S. per year; about twothirds of them are suicides. According to Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans (across partisan lines) support gun policy proposals such as barring people with mental illnesses from buying guns; prohibiting gun purchases by people on federal nofly or watch lists; and background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows. The majority must cut its close ties to the powerful gun lobby to facilitate useful gun control legislation necessary immediately. America has six times as many firearm homicides as Canada, and nearly 16 times as many as Germany. United Nations data shows that America far and away leads other developed countries when it comes to gunrelated homicides. America has 4.4 percent of the world’s population, but almost half of the civilianowned guns around the world. In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and himself. Since then, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded. The fairly broad definition of ‘‘mass shooting’’ includes not only shootings in which four or more people were murdered, but shootings in which four or more people were shot at all (excluding the shooter). Even under this broad definition, mass shootings make up a tiny portion of America’s firearm deaths, which totaled more than 33,000 in 2014. On average, there is more than one mass shooting for each day in America. Whenever a mass shooting occurs, supporters of gun rights often argue that it is inappropriate to bring up political debates about gun control in the aftermath of a tragedy. For example, former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a strong supporter of gun rights, criticized former President Barack Obama for ‘‘trying to score cheap political points’’ when Obama mentioned gun control after a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. But if this argument is followed to its logical end, then it will never be the right time to discuss mass shootings. Under the broader definition of mass shootings, America has nearly one mass shooting a day. So if Congress is forced to wait for a time when there is not a mass shooting to talk gun control, Congress could find itself waiting for a very long time. States with more guns have more gun deaths. Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide. Higher populations, more stress, more immigrants, and more mental illness does not correlate with more gun deaths. States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gunrelated deaths. 
A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence—a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives. The good news is that all firearm homicides, like all homicides and crime, have declined over the past two decades—although that may have changed in 2015 and 2016, with a recent rise in murders nationwide. There is still active debate among criminal justice experts about why this crime drop is occurring—but one theory that researchers have widely debunked is the idea that more guns have deterred crime—in fact, the opposite may be true, based on research compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Center. Although America’s political debate about guns tends to focus on grisly mass shootings and murders, a majority of gunrelated deaths in the U.S. are suicides. Research that shows greater access to guns dramatically increases the risk of suicide. The states with the most guns report the most suicides. Perhaps the reason access to guns so strongly contributes to suicides is that guns are much deadlier than alternatives like cutting and poison. Reducing access to guns can be so important to preventing suicides: stalling an attempt or making it less likely to result in death makes a huge difference—it opens the opportunity for someone to help or for the suicidal person to reach out to someone to help. That is why limiting access to lethal means is so powerful. Since police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, 2014, police have killed at least 2,902 people as of May 2017. Given that states with more guns tend to have more homicides, it is not too surprising that, as a study in the American Journal of Public Health found, states with more guns also have more cops die in the line of duty. Researchers looked at federal data for firearm ownership and homicides of police officers across the U.S. over 15 years. They found that states with more gun ownership had more cops killed in homicides: Every 10 percent increase in firearm ownership correlated with 10 additional officers killed in homicides over the 15year study period. The findings could help explain why U.S. police officers appear to kill more people than cops in other developed countries. For police officers, the higher rates of guns and gun violence in America means they not only will encounter more guns and violence, but they can expect to encounter more guns and deadly violence, making them more likely to anticipate and perceive a threat and use deadly force as a result. Over the past 20 years, Americans have clearly shifted from supporting gun control measures to greater support of ‘‘protecting the right of Americans to own guns.’’ This shift has happened even as major mass shootings, such as the attacks on Columbine High School and Sandy Hook Elementary School, have received more press attention. Although mass shootings are often viewed as some of the worst acts of gun violence, they seem to have little effect on public opinion about gun rights. That helps explain why Americans’ support for the right to own guns appears to be rising over the past 20 years even as more of these mass shootings make it to the news. Although Americans say they want to protect the right to bear arms, they are very much supportive of many gun policy proposals—including some fairly contentious ideas, such as more background checks on private and gun show sales and banning semiautomatic and assaultstyle weapons. This type of contradiction is not exclusive to gun policy issues. For example, although most Americans in the past said they do not support Obamacare, but most of them also said they like the specific policies in the healthcare law. On average, 7 children and adolescents lose their lives to gun violence each day, 75 percent of which are under the age of 12 years old. So many people die annually from gun violence in the United States that the death toll between 1968 and 2011 eclipses the total lives lost in all the armed conflicts in the history of the United States. On June 7, 2015, a gunman shot and killed nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church Charleston, South Carolina, one of the oldest and largest black congregations in the South. On November 11, 2009, at Fort Hood, near Killeen, Texas, a gunman shot and killed 13 people, and wounded 30 others. On August 5, 2012 in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, a gunman shot and killed six people, and injured three others, at the Sikh Temple of Oak Creek. On July 7, 2015 in Chattanooga, Tennessee a gunman shot and killed five people, including two U.S. Marines and a Naval Officer, and shot and injured two others at a recruiting center and U.S. Naval Reserve Center. On December 2, 2015 in San Bernardino, California, two gunmen killed 14 people and injured 21 others at the Inland Regional Center. On December 14, 2012, a gunman murdered 26 persons, including 20 children and 6 school administrators and teachers, at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. On August 8, 2015, a gunman brutally murdered his exgirlfriend and her six children and husband in one of the most notorious cases of domestic violence in the history of Houston, Texas. On April 16, 2007, a gunman killed 32 persons and injured 17 others at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia. Mass shootings occur more frequently in states that do not require background checks for all gun sales. Analyses of mass shootings in the United States between 2009 and 2015 document that the majority of mass shootings occur in venues where the carrying of firearm is not restricted. In states that require background checks for all handgun sales, including guns offered in unlicensed sales online and at gun shows, there are 52 percent fewer mass shootings. Congress must take action to prevent other incidents such as the recent act of terror and hatred in Las Vegas, Nevada that resulted in the tragic loss of 58 innocent lives. We extend our deepest sympathies to all those affected by this tragedy and recognize the skill and heroism of the law enforcement officers and first responders who came to the aid of others. We commend the efforts of those who are working to care for the injured and investigate this horrific incident. We extend our heartfelt condolences and prayers to the families of the fallen, and to all those affected in the community of Las Vegas and in the United States. And I pledge to continue to work to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shooting. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, as we have heard so eloquently from my colleagues, everyone agrees that we should keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. But, in fact, this House and this administration have been moving in the opposite direction. Just last week, hundreds of Americans whose loved ones had been killed by guns in the last few years came to Washington for a longplanned memorial vigil, a national vigil, to honor those whose lives had been taken from us from gun violence. On that very day, this House decided to call up an offensive dangerous piece of legislation on concealed carry permits. This bill will make it easier for domestic violence abusers to pursue their victims across State lines carrying loaded concealed weapons into States that do not allow that, overriding the choices of States like mine in Connecticut that have strict laws to protect domestic violence victims, who are five times more likely to be killed if there is a gun in the household. That is why my State has taken action to protect women and children from death by gun from domestic abusers. But now my State—if this law gets passed by the Senate and signed by the President—my State’s choices will be overridden. The law enforcement in my State will be at greater risk. b1930 That is not protecting the American people. That is putting them at risk. Recently, the administration decided to take the names of all fugitives. One of the categories of those who are not permitted legally to own weapons are people who are fugitives from justice. It seems like a fairly sensible rule, just like it is a sensible rule to not have those who are believed to be terrorists to legally purchase guns. Yet, this administration recently took tens of thousands of names of people who have been on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System as prohibited from purchasing a gun legally. Because of their criminal history, the fact that they are fugitives from justice, tens of thousands of those names have been taken out of the records. They have been sent back to the States, saying they should look at them again. In so doing, how long is it going to be before one of those dangerous people buys a gun because the name is no longer in the system? And who knows if it is going to be 
one or your neighbor. That is not what we are sent here to do. The families of Newtown have persevered. Despite all odds, they have found the courage to get up every day. Some are pursuing brain research to figure out how to encourage empathy. Some have written beautiful music, composed poetry. Some have started programs in schools to teach children how to be kind to each other. Some have stepped forward as extraordinary citizen activists and come to Washington and pound the halls, the marbled halls of State capitols around the country. They are true American heroes fighting for what they believe in and a better society. And some, in some ways I think the bravest among them, have chosen to bring new children into this world—the sort of optimism and courage that I can’t fathom if my child at 6 or 7 years old had been gunned down in those classrooms in the Sandy Hook Elementary School. But if they can have that resolve and that courage and that faith in this country, so can we. A good and a great nation takes care of its citizens. A good and a great nation responds to the cries of the people. A good and a great nation, above all, protects its children. Madam Speaker, we have the opportunity to do that. Thoughts and prayers and moments of silence are not enough. The American people deserve action. When I get on a plane tomorrow to fly back to Connecticut to attend memorial services on the 5year anniversary of those tragic and shocking murders of children in Sandy Hook Elementary School, I would like to be able to tell them that we are doing our job and our duty in this House by taking action and honoring their memories with truly taking action to protect them. I want to thank my colleagues for joining me here tonight. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the State of Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), my colleague. Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues who are here this evening. I also want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman ESTY, for her indomitable efforts and work in making sure that we focus our time and our attention to the prevention of gun violence. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor and to commemorate the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, 5 years ago. We lost 20 beautiful innocent children and 6 wonderful caring adults. While the grief and pain of the families who lost a loved one at Sandy Hook endures, we can all find hope and strength in the resilience of Newtown, and, together, we must honor their loss with action. Tonight, I want to share an essay from ‘‘Bullets into Bells: Poets and Citizens Respond to Gun Violence.’’ Abbey Clements, a teacher at Sandy Hook, wrote the following: ‘‘154 shots. They heard them all. I thought they were folding chairs falling. We huddled into the coats and backpacks. Some of them cried. Some of them laughed— how could they know? And if they knew, how could they believe? We shared a water bottle, a blue one, passing it around. Little arms poking out to take it. We waited. We had to believe the police were who they said they were. I opened the door. They scattered. A few in my outstretched arms. We ran. We were lucky. Surviving is a gift and a burden. What do you do with that? ‘‘For me, as soon as I could, I started to fight. I fight to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. I fight to keep guns locked up and away from curious toddlers and depressed teens. I fight against arming teachers, and I fight to keep guns out of college dorms and classrooms. Lockdowns, active shooter drills, and backpacks that morph into shields aren’t the answer. ‘‘Parents shouldn’t have to worry about whether or not their kids will make it home from school. A year or two after the tragedy, one mom told me that, every day after school, she left a gift for her daughter sitting on her bed—a celebration for making it home.’’ Those are the words of Abbey Clements, a teacher at Sandy Hook. It is our job to make sure that those children get home safe from school. We have the ability to do that in this institution. What we need is the will to do it. Again, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman ESTY, for her leadership in this effort. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for her stirring words. Abbey Clements is an extraordinary woman, and her daughter, Sarah, is now a college student here in Washington and is helping take up that charge of being one of the citizen activists and one of the citizen leaders who understands that democracies empower and charge us to correct that which is wrong. What is happening in this country is wrong. These are not tragedies from above. These are not natural disasters. These are manmade tragedies and manmade deaths, and it is up to us to do better. Again, I want to thank my colleagues for joining me here this evening. I will take their wishes, their words, their energy, their passion, and their commitment to action back with me to Newtown tomorrow evening. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LETTER SUPPORTING SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT S. MUELLER The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. HANDEL ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) for 30 minutes. GENERAL LEAVE  
Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, for the past several days, there has been an organized attempt to discredit and undermine the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. I rise today to speak on behalf of many Members of Congress who believe Special Counsel Mueller is doing a great job. At this time, I am circulating a letter, and other Members of Congress are joining me. This is a letter of support for Special Counsel Mueller urging that he not be interfered with and that he is allowed to continue this very important investigation in the interest of the security of our country. I will be circulating this letter for another 24 hours. However, at this time, I would like to read the contents of the letter into the RECORD . This, again, is a letter in support of Special Counsel Mueller. The letter is addressed to the Honorable Rod J. Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice. The letter reads as follows: 
Dear Deputy Attorney General, We write to express our support for the work of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III, and to urge you to ensure that he be allowed to continue his investigation—unfettered by political influence or threats to his authority—to its natural and appropriate conclusion based on the law, the facts, and the evidence. The Special Counsel is Conducting a Methodical Investigation, Yielding Results. It is unimaginable that Republicans would seek to intervene, discredit, obstruct, or terminate the special counsel’s investigation. Thus far, from every public indication, it appears that Mr. Mueller is conducting a thorough and methodical investigation. He and his investigators have not sought, and instead avoided, the public spotlight. His team has not leaked or hinted at criminal allegations for which they have yet to develop charges. Furthermore, the charges that have been filed to date have been sufficiently strong and well founded as to elicit guilty pleas from President Donald Trump’s former National Security Advisor, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, and a former policy adviser to Donald Trump’s Presidential campaign, George Papadopoulos. The Appointment of a Special Counsel Was Necessary and Proper. As you know, pursuant to U.S. Department of Justice Order Number 3915–2017, which you issued on May 17, 2017, Mr. Mueller was appointed to serve as special counsel and authorized to conduct an investigation into matters, ‘‘including any links and/or coordination between the Russian Government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and any other matters within the scope of 28 CFR 600.4(a),’’ which includes ‘‘authority to investigate and prosecute Federal crimes committed in the course of, and 
with intent to interfere with, the special counsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.’’ 
Your decision to appoint a special counsel to conduct such an investigation was necessary and proper, given the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that ‘‘Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. Presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process’’ and that ‘‘Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President Trump’’; the obvious potential that individuals, who had served on President Donald J. Trump’s campaign, as well as individuals currently serving as political appointees in the Trump administration, could be targets of, or witnesses in, any such investigation; and Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from ‘‘any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.’’ The Selection of Robert S. Mueller III to Serve As Special Counsel Was Very Much Appropriate. Under the circumstances described above, your selection of Robert Mueller to serve as the special counsel to conduct the investigation was an appropriate and commendable decision. Mr. Mueller has earned a reputation as a nonpartisan, professional investigator, making him an ideal choice to lead the investigation into the highly important, complex, and sensitive matters to which he has been charged. Mr. Mueller’s record demonstrates that he would not allow bias, influence, or other extraneous considerations to impact his investigation, and any suggestion otherwise is just not credible. Mr. Mueller is a former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, who was originally appointed by a Republican President. He was vetted and, twice, unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Specifically, when appointed in 2001 by President George W. Bush, Mueller was confirmed as FBI Director by a vote of 98–0 in the Senate, and when Mueller was nominated for a second term, in 2011, during President Barack Obama’s administration, he was again unanimously confirmed in the Senate by a vote of 100–0. Mr. Mueller has earned bipartisan support. Republican Members of the Senate attested to Mr. Mueller’s integrity and professionalism during Mr. Mueller’s confirmation hearings, which took place on July 30 and 31, 2001. For example, with regard to Mr. Mueller’s nomination to serve as FBI Director, then Senator, now Attorney General, Jeff Sessions stated: ‘‘It is great to see Mr. Mueller, nominated to take one of the most important positions in our country. It is a position that requires, in my view, serious experience, great integrity, and a proven record of accomplishment. And you have all of those things, Robert Mueller. When I was in the Department of Justice, Robert Mueller’s reputation was known throughout the Department of Justice, and he was known not for any political reason, but because he was recognized as a professional’s professional, a man whose skill at doing the job assigned to him was second to none. There is no doubt in my mind that there is no more professional prosecutor, no more professional person in America with experience in the Department of Justice, ready to handle the job of FBI Director than Robert Mueller.’’ Likewise, Senator MITCH MCCONNELL stat ed: ‘‘I believe Mr. Mueller will provide strong and effective leadership. Mr. Mueller has both impressive management and law enforcement experience. He is wellschooled in avoiding the problems and pitfalls inherent in criminal investigations and prosecutions. Mr. Mueller is not ‘of’ the FBI, and therefore I believe institutional loyalty will not blind him to making the hard’’ decision he needs to make. Senator MCCONNELL also expressed his belief that Mr. Mueller’s commitment ‘‘to vigorously enforcing the law without regard to politics or partisanship.’’ Speaker of the House PAULRYANhas also commented on Mr. Mueller’s lack of partisan bias. As reported in a July 24, 2017, Washington Examiner article, Speaker RYANsaid: ‘‘I don’t think many people are saying Robert Mueller is a biased partisan. He’s really, sort of, anything but.’’ On October 11, 2017, Kenneth Starr, who was appointed in 1994 as the independent counsel who was tasked with investigations involving President Bill Clinton and then First Lady Hillary Clinton, commented on Robert Mueller and the manner in which his investigation is proceeding. Mr. Starr stated that Mr. Mueller is conducting his investigation ‘‘aggressively and professionally.’’ Mr. Starr also stated: ‘‘We’re not seeing ‘leaks’ out of the investigation as far as we know, and what we know of Bob Mueller and his background is that he is someone of total, rockribbed integrity.’’ Regulations Limiting the Removal of a Special Counsel Must Be Followed. Mr. Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation and should not be threatened with removal. However, a few Republicans have indicated their support for Mr. Mueller, for his ouster. Notwithstanding the overwhelming reasons for Mr. Mueller to be allowed to continue and complete his investigation, the rule of law demands that the Trump administration follow executive branch regulations, which restrict the circumstances under which a special counsel can be removed. Specifically, 28 CFR 600.7(d) regarding the removal or discipline of a special counsel provides: ‘‘The special counsel may be disciplined or removed from office only by the personal action of the Attorney General. The Attorney General may remove a special counsel for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of departmental policies. The Attorney General shall inform the special counsel in writing of the specific reason for his or her removal.’’ Since Attorney General Sessions is recused, you, in your capacity as acting Attorney General—that is, Mr. Rosenstein—regarding Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, are the only individual empowered to remove Mr. Mueller under regulation. Furthermore, the regulation clearly states that Mr. Mueller may only be removed for good cause, which has not been demonstrated. The administration is required to follow its own regulations and not remove Mr. Mueller from his investigation. Politically Motivated Challenges of Special Counsel Mueller and His Investigation Must Not Be Allowed to Threaten the Investigation. Despite Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation of integrity, as attested to by these Republican leaders, and despite the clear progress that Mr. Mueller is making in his investigation, the rightwing media, some Republican Members of Congress, and Donald Trump, himself, have attempted to advance a false narrative that Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation is biased—this is what they say—and some have advocated for Mr. Mueller’s removal. On June 15, 2017, referring in general terms to the Russia investigation, President Trump stated on social media: ‘‘You are witnessing the single greatest witch hunt in American political history—led by some very bad and conflicted people.’’ In Congress, four Republican Members, led by Representative MATTGAETZ and includ ing former Representative Trent Franks, who has now resigned amidst an Ethics Committee investigation into his own conduct, have cosponsored a resolution calling for Mueller to step down. Those Members have attempted to advance baseless claims of the existence of a conflict due to Mr. Mueller’s previous service as FBI Director. Those arguments do not have merit, and appear intended, at best, to redirect the public’s focus toward matters that are wholly unrelated to the investigation to which Mr. Mueller has been tasked. At worst, those arguments are intended to stop or preemptively tarnish the perception of the special counsel’s work. The issues referenced in that Republican resolution pertain to allegations against former President Bill Clinton and former Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton related to a 2009–2010 matter, which has nothing to do with Mr. Mueller’s directive to investigate ‘‘links and/or coordination between the Russian Government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.’’ As quoted in a December 12, 2017, Politico article, Representative MATT GAETZ stated that he told President Trump that he was ‘‘concerned’’ that Mr. Mueller’s investigation ‘‘was infected with bias.’’ Representative GAETZ said the President responded: ‘‘That’s why you guys have got to do your job.’’ Representative GAETZ further stated that he informed the President that you would be testifying—that is, Mr. Rosenstein—before the House Judiciary Committee on December 13, 2017, in response to which Representative GAETZ said President Trump ‘‘encouraged us to exercise our oversight responsibilities.’’ This conversation, as described by Representative GAETZ , suggests that President Trump is encouraging the ring leaders of the recent criticisms against Mr. Mueller in order to pressure you to affect the investigation through the congressional oversight process. That is unacceptable. Some have alleged that Mr. Mueller’s removal of a member of this team, Peter Strzok, over text messages sent by Mr. Strzok that were critical of President Trump suggests bias or a lack of objectivity on the special counsel’s team. However, upon learning of the text messages, Mr. Mueller immediately removed Mr. Strzok from the investigation. In reality, this incident and Mr. Mueller’s swift response demonstrates Mr. Mueller’s integrity as well as his desire and commitment to conduct an investigation that is beyond reproach. You must not allow the targets of the investigation, or issues being investigated, to escape thorough independent inquiry through the removal, or hindrance, of the special counsel. We thank you, Mr. Rosenstein, for your careful attention to this matter, and we stand ready to support you in upholding the rule of law. 
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the letter that I am circulating to Mr. Rosenstein. This is the letter that is being signed on by other Members of Congress. This is the letter that I will circulate for the next 24 hours so that we will give Members the opportunity to sign on to this letter. b2000 This letter should be on your desk very soon. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio, Representative MARCY KAPTUR , who signed up to speak here this evening. Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman and ranking member of the Financial Services Committee for this very important Special Order and for her incredible work in assuring justice in our country on so many, many fronts. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight because of deep concern regarding our Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who are attempting to kick the legs out from under Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in our elections last year. Yes, they called Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify on whether bias has tainted that investigation. You know what is interesting about this? All of the intelligence agencies of our country agree that there was more than meddling in last year’s elections. I actually pray for Robert Mueller every night because what the involvement of Russia in our elections has meant, you know, that’s not a country that really welcomes debate and open conversation. They kill their enemies. Robert Mueller is going to get at the very core of what Russia is doing not just in our country, but what it will instruct us Russia is doing in Europe and many other places around the world. I listened to some of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee today, and I just want to put this on the record: Robert Mueller has given his life to this country through his entire years of service. I have never personally sat to dinner with this man or I don’t think I have even shaken his hand, but I admire him for his true patriotism. I watched some of the individuals on the Judiciary Committee today and wondered if they knew that he had been in the Marine Corps during Vietnam. He actually rose to the level of captain. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with the Combat V for victory. He is the recipient of the Purple Heart. He was a Navy and Marine Corps captain and got the Commendation Medal for his valor in combat. How many of those individuals questioning his integrity can even compare to that with their little fingernail? Combat Action Ribbon, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross. That was his early career. As an attorney, he went into service to our country as an assistant U.S. district attorney on one coast, and then on the other coast as U.S. district attorney. He is very evenhanded, and he worked his way up then in the Justice Department, rising to the level of Deputy Attorney General. He had been an Assistant Attorney General. His entire life has been spent in dangerous jobs. To take on Russia, you put your own life in someone else’s hands, actually. I can read a list—but I won’t tonight—of all of the leaders and rising leaders of countries that wish to be free that Russia has summarily killed, for which there is no justice. Madam Speaker, I rise somewhat out of outrage tonight listening to some of our colleagues here who demanded that we disband Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. Counsel Mueller is a Republican. I should not like him for that reason, right, because I am a Democrat? But I know there is something bigger to him, and that is defending the American people against all enemies, foreign and domestic. He has put his life on the line since he was a teenager for this country. Our country was founded on the principle of equality under the law. Our democracy, in the safeguarding of those principles, depends on genuine free elections. Not only must we pass laws here that assure that, but they have to be enforced. We have to unequivocally confirm the truth behind the extent of Russian meddling in our election. That is what we need. We know they did. Now we want to know every piece of it. How did they hack those voting machines? How did they use special ads that appeared around the country targeted to special audiences? We have to restore the faith of the American people in their very vote in order to maintain this democratic republic. Throughout his career, Special Counsel Mueller has proven himself time and time and time and time again to be a man of integrity. I might say, this comes from a woman who tried to become an FBI agent when she was in college and was rejected not because she didn’t have the academic abilities, but because in those days they didn’t admit women to the FBI. Times have changed a lot, but I know that Robert Mueller is the best that America has. Due process is one of the most carefully guarded of our constitutional protections, and we must see this investigation through to its ultimate end. There can be no chicken hawks in this House or those who point fingers whose careers do not demonstrate the kind of patriotism Robert Mueller has demonstrated throughout his career. Madam Speaker, I was actually shocked at how the questioning went this afternoon without the kind of respect and understanding of what it takes to preserve a republic that is free and independent of outside meddling. I want to thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak. I am embarrassed at some of the questions that the Republican majority has been hammering over in the Judiciary Committee and some of the other committees as the investigation intensifies and becomes more complete. The American people have a right to know. I guess the question every American has to ask: In whose hands would you place your life? A man who has served this country, who is now, I believe, 73 years old—over 70 years old? He has proved everything, but he has proven also that he has been a total patriot. I would ask the same of those who so frivolously waste their words in efforts to try to suppress an investigation that we know is essential to the preservation of our vote and our freedoms. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield to Representative JACKSON LEE. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me and for her leadership on this very important issue. She is standing in the gap because all that we have heard from Republicans and their media advocates is that their intention, of course, is to create a 21st century Saturday night massacre. In my questioning of the Deputy Attorney General, that is the exact terminology that I utilized, which is: Was the Deputy Attorney General and the Department of Justice prepared to defend Special Counsel Mueller against a potential Saturday night massacre? Of course, that is the Watergate massacre perpetrated by President Nixon in firing the Attorney General, and then requiring and firing the special prosecutor and—getting someone to fire—literally creating a institutional crisis. Madam Speaker, it is clear, as evidenced by the words of Sean Hannity on December 5, FOX News, who led off his broadcast with the outrageous charge that Mueller is frankly a disgrace by the American justice system and has put the country now on the brink of becoming a banana republic. Not surprisingly, disgraced former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who enthusiastically praised the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel as a superb choice to be special counsel because his reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity, has done a complete 180degree turn and now declaims falsely that the very top at the Justice Department and the FBI have become corrupt. I was pleased to join this letter and to join with Congresswoman WATERS , along with my other colleagues, for a very important statement. I also believe that this statement must be backed up with legislation, such as H.R. 3654, which I have offered, the Special Counsel Independence Protection Act. But basically I think we have a situation where if we do not make this a public announcement of indicating that between the administration, the President, and others, along with Republicans in this House, there is an entrapment being set up for Special Counsel Mueller to be considered biased because of the staffing actions of which, by the way, those individuals have been replaced or they have been transferred to other positions. There is no doubt that a man who served in Vietnam, a man who came 
back to the Justice Department as an entrylevel employee to be able to serve his country, there is no question that there is no evidence of any corruption. Madam Speaker, I would conclude my remarks by saying the importance of this legislation and this letter is because Director Mueller is working his way into the White House, and the issues of Russian collusion and the issues dealing with criminality are approaching the front door. We must protect this investigation. Madam Speaker, in recent days, the shrill but politicallycharged attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller have reached a deafening roar. For example, on December 5, Fox News host Sean Hannity led off his broadcast with the outrageous charge that ‘Mueller is frankly a disgrace to the American justice system and has put the country now on the brink of becoming a banana republic. Not surprisingly, disgraced former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who enthusiastically praised the appointment of Robert Mueller as Special Counsel as a ‘superb choice to be special counsel’ because ‘his reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity’ has done a complete 180degree turn and now declaims falsely that at ‘‘the very top, the Justice Department and the FBI became corrupted.’’ These despicable accusations by Trump acolytes and ultraconservative zealots against a distinguished public servant and veteran who has served his country with honor and unimpeachable integrity for more than a half century are outrageous. But the public sees them for what they are: a thinly disguised attempt by a panicked White House and its rightwing media allies to inflame and persuade base Trump supporters to question the impartiality of the Special Counsel’s investigation that daily uncovers more evidence of wrongdoing and collusion by operatives of the Trump campaign, transition, and White House. In light of the barrage of baseless attacks against Special Counsel Mueller by Trump apologists and rightwing media, it is urgent that Congress act immediately to protect the independence and integrity of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, including questions surrounding collusion between Russian operatives and Trump campaign officials. That is why I am calling upon the House leadership to bring H.R. 3654, the ‘Special Counsel Independence Protection Act,’ to the floor for debate and a vote by the full House at the earliest time possible. This legislation, which I introduced on August 15, 2017, insulates the Special Counsel from the whims of this President by permitting the removal of the Special Counsel only where: The attorney general files an action in federal district court in Washington, D.C., and files a contemporaneous action with the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee; and A panel of three federal judges sitting in Washington, D.C., finds removal appropriate based on a finding of misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest or other good cause. We are on the verge of a constitutional crisis as Trump operatives try to dismantle, destroy, and undermine Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. This cannot be allowed to happen. The state of our democracy hinges upon our ability to ensure the integrity of our elections and the rule of law. And the necessary and ongoing work of the Special Counsel must be insulated against outside influence and interference. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I thank both of the Members of Congress who came down here this evening and shared in the information that we are going to forward to Rod Rosenstein because it is so important that we let him know that our special counsel has support. We appreciate what he is doing and we are going to stand with him. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. SENSENBRENNER (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for today on account of illness.
