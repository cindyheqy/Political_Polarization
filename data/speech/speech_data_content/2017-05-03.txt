Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the backbone of the American economy: small business. Whether I meet with an owner of a family restaurant that has been on the same street corner for 50 years or a programmer for a startup tech company trying to land its first big break, I am always inspired by the amount of dedication and ingenuity that goes into running a small business. These men and women work hard, and their passion can always be seen in the products and services that they produce. The district I serve is home to so many thriving small businesses, and each one has a great story behind it. Such is the case with M.J. Neill, Incorporated, a familyowned heating company located in Bernardsville, New Jersey. This is M.J. Neill’s 100th anniversary. Business has not always been easy for M.J. Neill. The company has been overcoming obstacles since David W. Neill started it in 1917. It has had to navigate through the Great Depression, the OPEC oil crisis, and the 2008 financial crisis. It has had to make the move from coal to more efficient fuels. But through four generations, M.J. Neill has always been able to adapt and expand its business. M.J. Neill continues to be a household name in heating in the Bernardsville area. It caters to other local small businesses and families all around Somerset and Morris Counties, and it is known for its 24/7 service and familyoriented approach. Some of its customers even date back to when the company first began, testament to the value of the honest service that M.J. Neill provides. Today I congratulate current owner David Neill on the centennial of the company. The entrepreneurial spirit and innovation the Neill family has exhibited over the past 100 years is truly exemplary and serves as an example to all of us. The stories we hear about successful small businesses are not the only evidence we have that they are pivotal to our economy. The statistics also prove that point. We have over 29 million small businesses in the United States, and nearly twothirds of the jobs created in this country come from those businesses. It is undeniable that a thriving small business sector is critical to bolstering employment in this country. The same is true in New Jersey, which is home to 843,000 small businesses, accounting for over 99 percent of the total businesses in the State. These same small businesses employ 1.8 million people in New Jersey, more than half of our total workforce. With so many people relying on work from our small business community, it only makes sense that Congress does everything possible to support them. That is why we must use this week, National Small Business Week, to continue to talk about the ways we can help rid small businesses of harmful regulations and equip them with the tools they need to grow and to prosper. Last year we made great strides in the House by passing legislation such as the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act and the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, but we need to do more. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to support prosmall business legislation. Families like the Neills work hard their entire lives to serve their communities. It is imperative that those of us in Congress work to serve them as well. 
b1015 AIRLINE ACCOUNTABILITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the CEO of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, apologized to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for his company having dragged a passenger off of one of their aircraft. Mr. Munoz highlighted the policy changes the airline has made since the wake of the incident. Mr. Speaker, I believe that Congress should hold the airlines accountable and ensure that the events like what happened to Dr. Dao are prevented. When United Airlines had Dr. Dao forcibly removed on April 9, the airline more than just created a disruption for him and other passengers; it sparked a national outrage. Dr. Dao was bumped from his flight by a crew member of United in line with the thenairline’s policies that crews could book seats on United flights until flights departed. An airline’s lack of preparation for its own staff’s travel should not result in the disruption of the lives of its paying customers. Now crew members of United are required to make mustride bookings at least 1 hour prior to departure, and they are not able to displace customers who are already on board. However, today, I believe that we need to go further. This still has travelers at risk. So today, I am introducing the Hands Off Passengers Act or the HOP Act. This bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to modify a regulation regarding the involuntary deplaning or the denial of boarding of a flight by any passenger on an oversold flight merely to accommodate a member of the airline flight crew or staff. In other words, it prevents an airline from bumping ticketed passengers of an overbooked flight merely for the travel of one of the airline’s crews. Airlines should be better prepared on the movement of their crew to avoid the disruption of the lives of paying customers. 
OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL) for 5 minutes. Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment that, yet again, Congress needs to resort to another omnibus spending bill. We are in a bind right now, finishing fiscal business that should have been completed last year, long before I came to Congress. At this moment, the choice is stark and binary: We can vote to shut the government down, or we can vote for this massive funding bill. Neither is a good option, but shutting down the government is reckless. It would stall military pay and send a sign of weakness to the world. At a time when North Korea is becoming increasingly aggressive, Europe is unstable, and Russia is posturing, we cannot afford to shut down. I have always said, and I believe, that effective leadership needs to say what you mean and do what you say. If I voted ‘‘no’’ on this legislation, it would be disingenuous because I know a shutdown would be disastrous. This is a hard vote to take, but it is unavoidable at this point. We must continue to pay our troops and other uniformed personnel. We must fund critical programs included in this omnibus. Certainly, the legislation is not perfect and doesn’t accomplish everything I want as a conservative, but it does achieve some objectives. It cuts 150 Federal programs. It reduces the EPA bureaucracy to the lowest level since 1989. The legislation also funds critical programs Republicans have been fighting for: It strengthens our military with an increase in defense spending, enabling the purchase of new warships, aircraft, and weapons. It provides a meaningful increase in salary to our uniform personnel. It provides additional funds to thwart the global war on terror and fight ISIS. It is part of an overall $1.52 billion increase in resources for border security, meaning more agents, enhanced technology, updated infrastructure to stem the flow of illegal aliens and drug activity across our border. It includes funds to fight the opioid epidemic, funding grants, treatment, and prevention efforts. It also provides increased funds for the National Institutes of Health to continue disease research that impacts every family. For Michigan, important programs such as the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative are fully funded. It appropriates $5.6 million to study the potential invasion of Asian carp into the Great Lakes. While there are beneficial components in this omnibus, I want to underscore that using an omnibus is not how this body should function. We should be passing targeted, individual spending measures that address each agency, rather than a takeitorleaveit massive spending bill. Going forward, we must change what has become business as usual in Washington. That is why I ran for Congress. There is no doubt, that won’t be easy. I am learning every day how much our system needs significant reform. Only four times since 1977 were all appropriations enacted by the start of the fiscal year. That is four times in the last 40 years that the appropriations process has been effectively completed. Given that, it is unsurprising we find ourselves making this unfortunate choice yet again. Madam Speaker, I stand here to say we can do better; we must do better. I urge this body to come together to address the shortcomings in our appropriations process and develop better solutions for the future. Given today’s options, I am voting to keep our government open, but we must end this series of shortterm funding measures. We can do better. Our constituents deserve better. f 
OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise to address the body about my position on the omnibus spending bill, which funds the government through September 30. This spending bill does nothing to accomplish my mission to balance the Federal budget, today or any time in the future. I do not like the appropriation process and its lack of transparency in how we got to this point today. I do not like the lack of meaningful debate, nor do I like the inability to file floor amendments to the spending bill. It is inexcusable that Congress continues to wait until the last minute to perform its most important duty, which is to fund the government. I am a freshman Member. I came to Congress to make a difference. I represent the good people of the First Congressional District of Kentucky, not a political party or any special interest. I will always put my people’s best interests above politics. My objective is to fight hard for what I believe is the best for my district and then form a consensus to get things done. Madam Speaker, I understand that I am 1 of 435 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. And as I always mention in speeches back home in Kentucky, this is a very diverse body, diverse in ideology, diverse in geography. We all have different ideas, objectives, and goals. I respect this institution and the Constitution. In the 5 months I have been here, I have advocated for a balanced budget and term limits; and I will continue to fight to see that those two items of my agenda become law. I have also worked hard to see that some badly needed projects in my district receive funding. I am proud to say that the following projects are funded in this bill: $270 million for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant deactivation process, which will keep 1,200 West Kentuckians working in goodpaying jobs and continue to prevent illness and environmental issues in McCracken and Ballard Counties. I am proud to represent Fort Campbell. The bill provides a pay increase for our troops and fully funds health and benefits for them and their families while providing the funding to begin rebuilding our military; language to redesignate the Pennyrile Parkway as I–169 from south of Madisonville to Hopkinsville; funding for muchneeded dredging of the HickmanFulton Riverport, which is located just off the Mississippi River; language which prohibits the Army Corps of Engineers 
from charging the residents of Russell and Clinton Counties for water from Lake Cumberland; and a permanent fix to ensure healthcare benefits for retired coal miners. Though I am disappointed in many parts of the overall bill and the appropriations process as a whole, I am very happy with the badly needed items successfully addressed for my district in this shortterm funding bill. For that reason and because I do not ever want to see a government shutdown, I will vote ‘‘yes’’ on the shortterm omnibus. I will continue to work hard for conservative principles and fiscal discipline. I will continue to demand transparency through the appropriations process. I came here to get things done for the people of my district. I am sure I will never get 100 percent of what I want, but I will always try. At the end of the day, I will try to build consensus and do the things that Congress is supposed to get done, whether it be tax reform, healthcare reform, or to fund the government. We have many responsibilities in this great body, and I pledge to be one Representative who works with our President and every Member of this body to make America great again. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF MIAMIDADE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we approach Peace Officers Memorial Day, I would like to honor the service and the sacrifice of law enforcement officers in my south Florida community who bravely lost their lives in the line of duty. On April 29, through the project that is called Project Honoring Every Resting Officer, or Project HERO, the MiamiDade Police Department embarked upon its annual mission to pay tribute to the memory of each fallen officer in every department. By placing an American flag and a Blue Line flag at the resting location of these valiant men and women in uniform, we remember their sacrifices and ensure that their memories will be immortalized. I would like to thank the director of our fine police department, Juan Perez, for spearheading this noble cause on behalf of the families, friends, and colleagues of all of our fallen officers and also for Director Perez’s work in making our community a safer place in which to live. I encourage all south Floridans to also remember the fallen and to attend the MiamiDade Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Ceremony on May 4 at 7 p.m. at Tropical Park. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I recently visited PortMiami, one of the prime economic engines in MiamiDade County. Located in my congressional district, PortMiami is known as the cruise capital of the world. With its exclusive geographic location, the port is accessible to many international markets. In 2016, it handled an impressive 9 million tons of cargo and close to 5 million passengers. With such large numbers, we can already imagine the powerful impact of PortMiami. It grows our economy. It creates jobs in MiamiDade County and, indeed, throughout our great State of Florida. Recent investments in infrastructure have been instrumental in guaranteeing that PortMiami remains a world class cargo and cruise port. Throughout my years in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of our port. A project to dredge the channel to accommodate megacontain er vessels was completed in 2015. Also, four gantry cranes were purchased in order to operate the higher cargo volume. The completion of a tunnel has also accelerated the port’s capacity to increase the volume of trucks that travel to and from the marine terminals, further strengthening the competitiveness of PortMiami. PortMiami is currently undergoing some additional infrastructure projects, such as a new cruise terminal, security enhancements, and cargo yardrelated improvements, all very important so that PortMiami continues to be a world class cargo and cruise port. The Port of Miami is very important to my congressional district, to our south Florida economy, and I will continue to embrace this enterprise and economic force for our residents. LUPUS AWARENESS MONTH  
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, May is Lupus Awareness Month. Lupus is an autoimmune illness that has the ability to attack any part of the body and unfortunately has no cure yet. According to the Lupus Foundation of America, more than 1.5 million Americans, including my lovely stepdaughter Katharine, are living with lupus; and millions have already sadly lost their battle with this terrible disease. So this month, we raise awareness and educate our communities about lupus; and we also thank the researchers, doctors, and scientists who work around the clock to research, diagnose, treat, and eventually cure this disease. I would like to highlight the wonderful work that the Sylvester Cancer Center at my alma mater, the University of Miami, is doing to get closer to finding safer and more effective treatments. I have been honored to join forces with the Lupus Foundation and my colleagues in the Congressional Lupus Caucus to secure new Federal funding to advance lupus research, education, and awareness. These funds will help foster new scientific breakthroughs to better understand the disease and to help patients living with lupus. Finally, I want to recognize the hard work and the dedication of caregivers and advocates who raise awareness for lupus who create a better life for those impacted by this terrible disease. In particular, I want to highlight the Florida Chapter of the Lupus Foundation. From their local Walks to End Lupus to their tireless advocacy on behalf of patients and caregivers, they have been an instrumental source of hope, guidance, and comfort to those living who have been transformed by this disease. So I invite our entire south Florida community to join them and the Miami Marlins on May 10 at Marlins Park for Lupus Awareness Night. Mr. Speaker, this month, let us remember those who we have lost and those who are currently impacted by this terrible disease. Let us thank the advocates and caregivers, empower researchers, and, most importantly, let us work together for the day when no one will be diagnosed with lupus. f 
b1030 VENEZUELA REFUGEE ASSISTANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COMER ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CURBELO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, for over a decade, thousands of Venezuelans were forced to flee the brutal Chavez dictatorship, and the situation has only worsened under his handpicked successor, Nicolas Maduro. Over the last several years, the people of Venezuela have increasingly spoken out against the Maduro regime, and time and time again he has attempted to silence them. In the last few weeks alone, the world has seen countless examples of the regime’s thuggish tactics, unethical behavior, and lethal force against innocent civilians. Top opposition leaders like Leopoldo Lopez remain locked up in Maduro’s prisons, while the dictator continues to stop at nothing to try and control all branches of government. Thousands of opposition protesters have been arrested and dozens have been left for dead or killed. So in response to this continued political crisis, I have joined with my colleagues DARREN SOTO, ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN , and D EBBIE WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ to introduce bipartisan legislation allowing Venezuelan nationals who have made a new home in the United States to remain here if they choose to do so, since it is too dangerous to return to their home country. Instead of returning to the instability and uncertainty in Venezuela, these individuals would be granted legal permanent residency, so long as they do not have a criminal record and have never been involved in the persecution of others, eliminating any possibility of human rights violators or 
Chavista thugs accessing our legal immigration system. The people of Venezuela deserve the American people’s support and admiration for their continued fight against the brutal Maduro antiAmerican regime. Honest and hardworking Venezuelans who would be persecuted or imprisoned unjustly should they return to their country should be allowed the opportunity to take refuge here in the United States. 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the critical issue of reforming and reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program. For my constituents in south Florida and the Florida Keys, and for coastal communities across the country, flood insurance is an absolute necessity to protect against natural disasters. But the program is flawed and saddled with $23 billion of debt. We have a unique opportunity in the coming months to address the issues that matter most to our constituents, providing for optimal coverage at rates that are affordable to policyholders and based on accurate flood maps. There are numerous solutions I am studying, such as expanding the use of Write Your Own policies and growing the private insurance market, as long as strict oversight protocols are established and a Federal backstop is in place. We should also promote stronger building standards for new construction projects that will better withstand flooding and strong winds. In Florida, we are a payee State, a donor State into the NFIP, but have also adopted strong building standards to reduce cleanup costs after the damage of a natural disaster has been done. As Congress works to reform the NFIP, I will find commonsense solutions with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure our constituents have access to reliable coverage at fair and appropriate rates. 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the seven MiamiDade County schools that were recently named to the USA Today’s top 100 public schools in the country, including Archimedean Upper Conservatory Charter School in my own district. The rankings are based on graduation rates, reading, and math scores on State standardized tests, including how lowincome and minority students fared in comparison to the State average, and the number of students taking collegelevel advanced placement courses and scoring well on the corresponding tests. As a former MiamiDade County Public School Board member, I am incredibly proud to see the tremendous growth and success of these schools in south Florida. MDCPS was in the midst of a financial and moral recovery when I was on the board just a few years ago; and during my time there, we improved the quality of education and put students and teachers first, resulting in major gains in student performance and graduation rates. Today, Superintendent Carvalho and the board continue to make great progress. The teachers, staff, administrators, and parents at these schools are working to ensure our students have the best education possible. Congratulations on this honor. I look forward to visiting the Archimedean Owls back home in the very near future. f 
NEW DETAILS ON IRAN DEAL PRISONER SWAP The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, we recently learned troubling details surrounding the terms of the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran from early last year. As I have said before, the more details we learn about this deal, the more apparent it is that it was neither prudent nor transparent. The safety and security of the American people and our allies around the world should remain a top priority for the United States. But we are learning, according to reports, as part of this prisoner swap with Iran in 2016, the Obama administration released seven prisoners and dropped charges and international arrest warrants of 14 fugitives, many of whom had been directly involved in supplying Iran with U.S.built equipment or sensitive information that could be used for military systems, primarily Iran’s nuclear program. The administration downplayed the security threat that these men posed. In a variety of ways, these individuals deliberately worked to undermine the United States and smuggle American military technology to Tehran. In one instance, a man was allegedly part of a conspiracy to steal sensitive software information from a defense contractor in Vermont. Another one of the men was in the middle of serving an 8year prison sentence on charges related to a separate conspiracy to provide satellite technology and hardware to Iran. Three of the fugitives were allegedly working to lease an aircraft from Boeing for an Iranian airline that authorities say supported Hezbollah, which the United States, of course, has designated as a terrorist organization. And the list goes on as these are just a few of the cases. All of this poses a serious threat to our national security as sensitive military information and technology could be used to bolster Iran’s weapons programs. As you may recall, this comes after we learned last fall that, as a part of the deal, the United States paid $400 million that was contingent on Iran releasing four American hostages. This broke from longstanding United States policy to not pay ransoms to rogue nations because it encourages bad actors like Iran to take more hostages. Again, this was not made known to Congress or the American public. We only learned about it nearly a year after the deal was finalized. What makes this most concerning or more disconcerting is the Obama administration’s lack of transparency on the backgrounds of these prisoners. These are not merely civilians or businessmen, as the President and his officials referred to them on multiple occasions. The administration left the impression that these individuals were nothing more than violators of sanctions and not as dangerous as they truly were. Each of these men pose very real threats that the administration hid from the American people. This isn’t a partisan talking point, Mr. Speaker. Even President Obama’s own Justice Department had accused many of these men of being involved in terrorist activities. I support diplomatic efforts with Iran, and I am hopeful that we can continue to engage in diplomacy and secure a good deal at some point, but this latest news continues to exemplify why both Republicans and Democrats could not and did not support this deal. Iran continues to push every boundary, exploit every loophole, and avoid as much oversight as possible, all while it is antagonizing the rest of the world. It continues to reap the benefits of this deal at the expense of our national security and that of our allies, such as Israel. We continue to learn something new and bad about this deal that wasn’t shared with Congress or the public. Our national security is too important to put at risk, and no President’s legacy is worth taking that risk. This new information validates many of the concerns that led to the bipartisan opposition to the nuclear deal. 
RECOGNIZING THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE OF GRETA JOYNES AND CHRIS SARLEY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come down to the floor to recognize and thank two of my major staffers in my office who are leaving to pursue other opportunities. The first one is Greta Joynes. Greta recently left as my legislative director; and as you know, Mr. Speaker, that is your top adviser in the legislative field. So not only running the legislative office, she also had some personal expertise in the telecommunications regions. But Greta is from northern Illinois, north of I–80, originally from the Chicagoland area, and is a graduate of Northern Illinois University, NIU. She started as a staff assistant in 2003 and worked her way up through the ranks, as I said, becoming legislative director 
in 2011, and then served as deputy chief of staff from 2013 until she left recently in March. She focused on telecommunications as her expertise, and we primarily in our office dealt with 911 issues, especially the Next Generation 911 Advancement Act. She also spearheaded the Next Generation 911 Caucus in my office. She is married to Bob and has two children, Gavin and Hadley. We already miss her activity and work in the office, and we pass on best wishes. Next is Mr. Chris Sarley, who has a 14year career on Capitol Hill. This is his tenth year with me, and I think it is uncommon in many offices for people to stay that long. I think it is a tribute to my chief of staff, Craig Roberts, and the fact that I don’t meddle too much how they manage the office and get their job done. Chris has served 10 years with me. In addition to handling health care and energy policy in my office, Chris has served the committee under Chairman WALDEN and Chairman Emeritus U PTON  as policy coordinator for the Subcommittee on Environment since 2011. Chris has been an invaluable member of my team, and some of his achievements include: Before he came to my office, he worked on the Medicare part D rollout. Under my office, he advanced several medical device titles in the 21st Century Cures Act. He worked on what we call the ADAPT Act and the GAIN Act, which target the antibiotic threats that hopefully will not occur in our country, but we need to be ready to respond. He was very involved in ADUFA, Animal Drug User Fee Act, and enabling the FDA to approve drugs used for pets and livestock. But for all of us on the Energy and Commerce Committee, he was one of our primary House negotiators during the first major rewrite of a United States environmental protection law in over 2 decades, and facilitated passage of the Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amends the Toxic Substances Control Act, which is the Nation’s primary chemical regulation law. I think the public really would appreciate if they knew the work that our staff members do on long hours and over the weekends. We mention it all the time, especially when we are fighting across the aisle, because it is primarily the staff that is trying to get to the point where they can share language where we can then give a thumbs up or thumbs down, and it is very seldom that we say thanks for those. A Member is only as good as the folks he has who work for him and who he or she surrounds himself with. I wanted to take this time, Mr. Speaker, to call out two great government employees who served their Nation well and served me well. And it also sends a signal about all our other staff members who do tremendous work under great stress to serve this country. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Rabbi Richard Boruch Rabinowitz, Aish International, New York, New York, offered the following prayer: May we humbly ask You, God Almighty, to help us focus on the beauty and good of this great country. God, we thank You for giving wisdom to Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald J. Trump for proclaiming May as Jewish Heritage Month. The Jewish people of this country are grateful and indebted to You, God, for the opportunity to contribute in making the United States a great nation. Aish founder, Rabbi Noah Weinberg, of blessed memory, would say to young people: ‘‘When older people see your idealism, they might say, ‘you’ll grow up,’ but what they really mean is ‘you’ll give up.’’’ Rabbi Weinberg would say: ‘‘Never give up—get tougher instead.’’ Let us pray for the Members of Congress and this great Nation: God, please grant us clarity and courage to always do right and never give up on our principles. God bless the United States of America. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
HONORING LYDIA STRUNK (Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this is Lydia Strunk’s last week working on the House floor. Before I talk about Lydia, I want to talk about the work that she and all the people here on the floor do for us, for the people’s House, on both sides of the aisle. They are the ones who keep the floor running on time on a dayto day basis. They make sure that the votes are counted and conducted impartially. They make sure that every Member, majority and minority, is treated fairly. And though the hours are long and unpredictable, they always set a fantastic tone of decorum. No one better exemplifies this professionalism than Lydia Strunk. She has been a part of this institution since 2008, when she started out in the Republican Cloakroom. We all knew her so well then and enjoyed watching her rise to these great responsibilities that she now holds. For more than 4 years now, Lydia has served as the Speaker’s deputy floor director. As it turns out, she accepted this job on the night of her wedding. How is that for commitment? Lydia’s quiet dedication to the people’s House comes through in almost everything that she does; and because she does her job so well, almost no one ever notices. Think about it. If you ever wondered how a joint meeting with a foreign leader or a State of the Union goes off without a hitch, it is because of Lydia’s doing. One of her jobs, of course, is to keep us on schedule. So I will make one last point before she tells me to wrap this up, because I assume that is what she will be doing in a minute. I want to thank Lydia’s family. I want to thank Lydia’s husband, Jeff, and I want to thank, in particular, her children. Graham and Evie, I want you to know that your mother is an incredible public servant. She has done so much for us, for this country and this institution, and we are grateful to you for sharing your mom—and your wife— with us. This whole House is in her debt. 
HONORING LYDIA STRUNK (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I agree with almost everything the Speaker just had to say, and I may repeat some of it. What I do not agree with, however, Mr. Speaker, is that we didn’t notice. I noticed. My staff has noticed. My staff has not only noticed, but appreciated the extraordinary work that Lydia has done for this House—yes, for your office, yes, for the Republican side of the aisle, but for this House and for the American people. Lydia and I have a great relationship, but probably more importantly, she has a great relationship with Shuwanza Goff, who runs the floor on our side of the aisle. What a privilege it is to rise and say to Lydia, thank you—not as a Democrat, not as a Republican, but as an American who appreciates the role that you have played, Lydia, in making a difference. I always say that, when the House runs well, it is the staff’s work. When it doesn’t do so well, it is the Members’ responsibility and fault. So you have been absolutely terrific. And Jeff and Graham and Evie, I join with Speaker RYANin saying that your mom is a great American, a wonderful human being. You know that personally. You see it every day in your own lives. But for the past 9 years, Lydia has been a presence on this floor first in the Republican Cloakroom as an assistant, later as a staffer with the Rules Committee, and then, as the Speaker just pointed out, deputy floor director for the Republican side of the aisle. They are the majority party, so Lydia’s responsibility really is institutional—not partisan, but institutional—and she has performed that in the best traditions of the best of this House. It is a testament to Lydia’s skill and professionalism that she has earned the respect not only of her own colleagues on the Republican side, but also those who work on my staff and the Democratic leader’s staff on this side of the aisle. That is why, Lydia, I said we have noticed, we have appreciated it. In many ways, Mr. Speaker, public service is a family affair for Lydia Strunk. She grew up around it when her father worked in the George H.W. Bush White House handling legislative affairs. Her dad is a good friend of mine, so perhaps I am not objective. I am also the father of three daughters, so perhaps I am not objective. Nick Calio is one of the great people with whom I have served through the years. I think he is here in the gallery somewhere with his wife. Thank you, Nick, for your service, and thank you for being such a wonderful example for your daughter. She has brought that same kind of cooperative, collegial, inclusive spirit to her work that you brought to yours not only working in the public sector, but also in the private sector. Let me end. She grew up in a great State: Maryland. Again, perhaps making me more subjective than I otherwise would be. After she began as a Cloakroom assistant, she met and later married Jeff Strunk, who then worked on Speaker John Boehner’s floor staff, also very effectively and productively. And when Jeff left Capitol Hill in 2013, Lydia was promoted to take his place, a somewhat incestuous operation, but it worked extraordinarily well, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful. We ought to all be grateful. The American people ought to be grateful for her efforts, her know how, and the dedication she brings to the task of ensuring that our work, Americans’ work, the American people’s work here on this floor and on behalf of all of us can continue smoothly each day. Lydia, thank you. We wish you the very best. We know that whatever you do, you will be extraordinarily successful in doing, and that you will be perceived by your colleagues and by those with whom you work in the same very positive and very appreciative way that we view you today. Godspeed. f 
CONGRATULATIONS TO GERING HIGH SCHOOL (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Gering High School, one of three national winners of the 2017 Samsung Solve for Tomorrow contest. The team of 19 Gering students took top honors out of thousands of entries and 10 national finalists. It is exciting to see young innovators from western Nebraska, especially my alma mater, recognized nationally for their ideas on how to advance agriculture. The students designed a drone powered system to reduce herbicide quantity by allowing farmers to directly target specific areas rather than spraying entire fields. I applaud each of them for their hard work and the dedication they put into their winning project. Congratulations go to Curtis Anderson, Jonathan Blanco, Dakota Boles, Blake Brunner, Gabriele Castro, Cody Catron, Eric Crane, Jeremy Forella, Michael Haworth, Xavier Horst, Elexus Johnson, Kaiden Reinmuth, Trevor Satur, Tyler Smith, Joel Torres, Carson Wallace, Skylier Ward, Payton Welfl, Joshua Wilson, and their teacher, Mr. Justin Reinmuth. 
TODAY IS WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, today is World Press Freedom Day, a day that deserves commemoration now more than ever. Undermining the credibility of the free press and attempting to turn the American people against the media is reminiscent of authoritarian tactics, not the conduct of the leader of the free world. Yet the President has referred to the press as the ‘‘enemy of the people’’ for simply doing their job: reporting the facts and holding all of us accountable. He has also dismissed distinguished publications as fake news, again, for simply doing their job and has threatened to change libel laws that will weaken the First Amendment, making it easier for him to attack and sue the press. This antagonistic relationship between the President and the press is not only beneath the dignity of the office, it is also dangerous for our democracy. We have seen strongmen and autocratic countries suppress the media through intimidation and by discrediting the integrity of the very institution of journalism. It is hard to believe that I have to say this in this country at this point in our history, but as Thomas Jefferson said: ‘‘Our liberty cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited without danger of losing it.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HARPER ). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
MATKINS FLOWERS AND GREENHOUSE CELEBRATES 90 YEARS IN BUSINESS (Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a small business in my district that is celebrating its 90th anniversary this week. Matkins Flowers and Greenhouse in Bentonville, Arkansas, has served the northwest Arkansas region since 1927, when Henry Lenny Matkins, Sr., founded the company. Throughout the last nine decades, this Arkansas small business has persevered in good times and bad, and it serves as an example of how you make a small business sustainable with integrity, accountability, and hard work. Working through the Great Depression, World War II, and the modern era, the Matkins family has continuously exhibited the importance of the family owned small business to the American economy. Now in its fourth generation of leadership with Jim and his son Jeff, it is worth celebrating this important milestone. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent this outstanding family and offer my thanks and admiration for the success of Matkins Flowers and Greenhouse. 
b1215 HEALTHCARE SCAM (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, for the third time in 90 days, Republicans are trying to take away patient protections for Americans with preexisting medical conditions. Fifty percent of all Americans and 86 percent of Americans ages 55 through 64 have preexisting conditions. There is a genetic influence in many people who have preexisting conditions, meaning that tens of millions of Americans are born into a predisposition for certain diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s, and heart disease. The Republican healthcare scam would obliterate protections for preexisting conditions. For example, if you have a dad with a kid who is stuck with childhood cancer, the dad could buy a policy, but that policy would not have to cover his kid’s cancer treatments. That, Mr. Speaker, is a deliberate intent to deceive the American people. 
TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, next week marks Teacher Appreciation Week, which recognizes the special role educators make for American families. As the husband of a retired schoolteacher and a grateful dad of four sons with eight grandchildren, I know firsthand the positive impact educators have for students. South Carolina’s Second Congressional District is filled with dedicated and talented teachers and administrators, and it is always a pleasure to visit with them at their school or when their classes visit Washington. I would also like to recognize the 2017 Teacher of the Year, Jennifer Wise, of Hand Middle School of Columbia, which my mother attended. As a math teacher, Jennifer motivates her students for mathematics to energize their lives outside of the classroom. The success of our teachers is amplified by the leadership of State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, working with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and the parents, teachers, administrators, and locally elected school boards who are making a difference for the students of South Carolina for job opportunities and meaningful lives. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
VIETNAMESE BLACK APRIL (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday we commemorated the 42nd anniversary of Black April and the fall of Saigon. On this day, we are reminded of the pain of losing your homeland and of the sacrifices made in search for freedom. When Saigon fell in 1975, thousands of families were forced to flee their home, and many came to America with nothing but hope and their dreams to keep them alive. Today I am proud to have represented Little Saigon, the largest concentration of Vietnamese outside of Vietnam. Each and every one of them has a personal connection to the sacrifices that their families have made and to the loss of their homes. This shared experience has made the Vietnamese community and culture thrive in Orange County, California. I am honored to represent this community and mourn alongside with them. I am proud that America gave them shelter in their time of need. The U.S. must always be a beacon of hope to those without hope. We must continue to stand up for human rights and religious freedom. f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF MATTHEW MCCLANAHAN (Mr. HARPER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Matthew McClanahan. Matthew was a loving and devoted family man, a friend to so many, a respected employee who worked among our congressional community for the Office of the Architect of the Capitol. Born in Annapolis, Maryland, Matthew made his home in Glen Burnie, Maryland. As part of the maintenance division team of the Capitol Grounds, he was only 30 years young when he passed away. Respected by his colleagues and exemplifying hard work and dedication to his trade, he was known as being good humored and someone always ready to lend a helping hand. Our entire congressional community mourns the loss of one of our own, following the terrible accident that took place last month on April 18. Later today, I will stand with my House colleagues in a moment of silence to honor and remember Matthew McClanahan. My entire staff and I join with the Architect of the Capitol team in offering his family, especially his wife, Lauren, and children, Evie and Matthew, our prayers and deepest sympathies. 
TERRIBLE HEALTHCARE PLAN (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Republicans in Congress and now President Trump are twisting arms and trying to make a deal to get their terrible healthcare bill through this House of Representatives. It is so interesting to note that they are working really hard to make sure they can have a vote, if they can, before Members have to go home and speak to the people that they work for. Why would that be? Why would they be so fearful of having to go back and explain what is happening? They would rather go back and say: It is too late. I already voted for it. Sorry. They do that because they know this is a bad piece of legislation. Don’t just take it from me. Other Republican Members have said things like: This legislation provides health care in name only or it torpedoes protections for people with preexisting conditions. No one should be fooled by this last minute ditch effort to put some money on the table as if it is enough to provide support for preexisting conditions. Let’s be clear, this change eliminates the guarantee that you can get coverage if you have any sort of preexisting condition. We should reject it. f 
MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD AWARDED UNIT OF THE YEAR (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a Minnesota National Guard unit for recently receiving the prestigious John J. Stanko Army National Guard Unit of the Year Award. During their deployment, which included soldiers spread across multiple locations, the Bravo Company 2 of the 211th General Support Aviation Battalion completed more than 300 missions across Afghanistan, enduring some of the most difficult and dangerous environments imaginable. Additionally, they moved an incredible 1 million pounds of cargo and participated in highrisk missions and deliberate operations to support forces on the ground. Due to their overall excellent performance, the Bravo Company soldiers have been awarded three Bronze Stars, several Air Medals, eight Combat Action Badges, three Meritorious Service Medals, five Army Commendation Medals, and 14 Army Achievement Medals. The Bravo Company’s achievements have earned them the reputation as one of the best Army aviation units serving in Afghanistan. We are proud to know that these soldiers call Minnesota their home. I want to thank these soldiers for their brave service to our Nation, their unwavering dedication to their unit, and the honorable way in which they have served. You are the reason the United States Armed Forces are the best in the world. 
USPS FOOD DRIVE (Ms. SPEIER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, in advance of the 20th annual Letter Carriers’ Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive next Saturday, let us recognize the unsung heroes within our communities: our letter carriers. Take David Crestik from San Diego, who carried an injured elderly woman out of a burning mobile home, called 911, and then finished his route; or Shawn Kang from Stockton, who rescued a person trapped underneath his car. On May 13, letter carriers will stock struggling food pantries across our country through the Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive. Last year, they collected over 80 million pounds of nonperishable canned goods, a record. Let’s remember, one in six Americans don’t know where their next meal is coming from. So let’s honor and recognize the tremendous leadership, compassion, and dedication of our letter carriers. They serve our communities and they are a vital part of them. 
SMALL BUSINESS WEEK (Mr. PERRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the first week in May as Small Business Week in the United States and to applaud the contributions of the 1 million smallbusiness owners from across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The entrepreneurs at the helm of these businesses take on great risk. As a former smallbusiness owner myself, I fully understand that risk as well as the colossal responsibility associated with signing the front side of a paycheck. Small business is the backbone of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, employing millions of people, roughly half of the private sector workforce in our Commonwealth. Their success is our success. We thank them for all they do to drive innovation forward and create and sustain careers of tomorrow. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING SERGEANT JOSHUA RODGERS (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor Sergeant Joshua Rodgers, who made the ultimate sacrifice last Wednesday night in Afghanistan. Sergeant Rodgers was a native of Bloomington, Illinois, in my congressional district, and was one of two American soldiers killed during a raid targeting an ISIS prison last week. Sergeant Rodgers graduated from Normal Community High School in 2013, where he competed on the track and football teams. His teammates and coaches remember him as a hard worker and a great leader. He had a true sense of duty and believed it necessary to serve his country. After graduation from high school, he enlisted in the Army, achieving the position of Army Ranger. In his short career, he did three tours in Afghanistan. He would go on to receive numerous medals for his service, such as the Army Achievement Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Sergeant Joshua Rodgers was a man of courage, and he gave his life on the battlefield fighting against the evil of ISIS and terrorism. His bravery and sacrifice in the name of liberty and freedom will not be forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with Joshua’s family during this difficult period. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would ask that the House rise and take a moment of silence to pay tribute to Sergeant Joshua Rodgers for his service and sacrifice for our country and for free people everywhere. f 
THANKING AMERICA’S TEACHERS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Sunday marks the start of Teacher Appreciation Week nationwide. The National Education Association and the National PTA have teamed up to celebrate America’s hardworking, dedicated, and passionate teachers. Tuesday, May 9, is the official Teacher Day. Mr. Speaker, I think every Member of this House can think of a teacher who had a positive influence on not only their education, but their life. Our teachers push students to achieve their best and they show students how to realize their full potential. Teachers are often the most underrated, yet powerful professionals in the entire world. They truly do shape young minds. Teachers lend a caring hand and extend a loving heart. They make differences in the lives of our students academically, emotionally, and physically. So to every teacher in America, I say to you: Thank you for the job that you do, for the hours that you work, for the patience you show, and for the impact you have on so many lives. Happy National Teachers Week. This Nation would be lost without you. 
b1230 SMALL BUSINESS WEEK (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, today, as we celebrate Small Business Week, I rise to recognize, commend, and stress the importance of small businesses of this country. I have the honor of serving on the House Small Business Committee every day, and I am reminded that small businesses are the pillars and the cornerstones of the American economy. The National Small Business Association recently met in our Nation’s Capital. They communicated to me their biggest concerns were health care and government overregulation. That is why we believe doing nothing with health care is not an option. That is why this Congress must strive to end the overburdensome regulation this government does to kill jobs. All across Kansas, and this country, small businesses are driving economic opportunity, innovation, and growth. This week, and every week, we must keep their contributions at the forefront of our decisionmaking. f 
SMALL BUSINESS WEEK (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Small Business Week. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and the main driver of our local communities. In fact, twothirds of all new jobs in the United States are created by small businesses. It is crucial that our entrepreneurs and smallbusiness owners have the support that they need; and as legislators, it is incumbent upon us to create an environment that allows them to succeed. I am proud to be a member of the Financial Services Committee as we mark up a bill today that will give our small businesses the boost that they need. The previous administration enacted rules and regulations that helped some big companies and some big cities but slowed growth for our small businesses in rural communities. The Financial CHOICE Act will repeal DoddFrank’s onesizefitsall regulations and finally allow small businesses to access the capital they need to grow and to prosper. I am grateful for this opportunity to celebrate the remarkable small businesses in the Eighth Congressional District of Tennessee, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass financial regulatory reform that will revive our economy. 
NATIONAL TRAVEL AND TOURISM WEEK (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Travel and 
Tourism Week, which runs from May 7 to May 13. I grew up in Tarpon Springs, Florida, where our historic sponge docks, authentic Greek communities, and beautiful waterways draw visitors from around the State, country, and the world. As a young kid, I worked in my grandfather’s bakery in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Many of our customers were tourists coming to sample Greek pastries on their visit to Tarpon Springs. Today, tourism remains important to businesses in our community. And in 2015, both business and leisure travelers spent $2 billion in Florida’s 12th Congressional District. Travel and tourism is one of the largest industries in the United States. Last year alone, it generated more than $2.3 trillion in economic output, and it is responsible for 15.3 million jobs nationwide. In honor of National Travel and Tourism Week, I thank the people who work each day to welcome travelers and keep this important industry strong. 
REPEAL AND REPLACE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I hope that tomorrow the House has the opportunity to deliver on the promise that the President made and Republicans made to finally repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act which is crumbling around us. Mr. Speaker, we do everything we said we would do. Maintain coverage for preexisting conditions and guarantee it, check. In fact, with the MacArthur amendment and the Palmer amendment, we establish highrisk pools that will actually bring down the premium costs for people with preexisting conditions, as it will for all Americans. Guarantee coverage and renewability, check. Coverage for people up to age 26 on their parents’ plan, check. No discrimination based on gender, check. And most importantly, in the Medicaid program, we not only preserve but strengthen coverage for our elderly, sick, disabled, and pregnant women on that plan. Mr. Speaker, it is about time we repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 244, HONORING INVESTMENTS IN RECRUITING AND EMPLOYING AMERICAN MILITARY VETERANS ACT OF 2017 Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 305 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of two very important measures. First, the resolution provides for consideration of Senate amendments to H.R. 244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of the FY 2017 Intelligence Authorization Act as an amendment to the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us is the first successful bicameral, bipartisan negotiation of the Trump administration. It has broad bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress. All Members can feel good about the work of the Appropriations Committee, especially our chairman, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN of New Jersey, and our Ranking Member, Mrs. LOWEY of New York. In the House, the work must continue today but, hopefully, will be concluded today. The package in front of us not only keeps the government open and operating through the end of the fiscal year, but it also represents a successful completion of key member priorities on both sides of the aisle. This bill provides for a $25.7 billion increase in defense spending, notably including an additional $7.3 billion for Department of Defense readiness and training, as well as the largest pay raise our troops have received in 6 years. These funds will help us enhance our military readiness and marks an end to the erosion of our national military strength. Importantly, we accomplished this without a dollarfordollar increase in nondefense discretionary spending, a practice which was imposed upon us by the previous administration. That practice threatened to drive our national deficit even higher. I am pleased that we broke that connection, for we should never operate under such a formula in the future. This measure also provides for an increase of $1.5 billion in funding for border security. $772 million is available for key administration priorities like border security technology enhancements and infrastructure improvements. It also increases funding for Customs and Border Patrol to improve operational effectiveness. And, I note, the President has wide authority and latitude to deploy these dollars where 
they should do the most good. This is the largest increase in border security funding in almost a decade. Domestically, this bill funds hundreds, if not thousands, of Member priorities. We reached a bipartisan agreement on opioid funding, redirecting over $500 million to combat this epidemic affecting every district in the Nation. We funded health care for miners, a key priority for many of our Members. We secured the second consecutive $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, the Nation’s lead biomedical research organization and a key driver of the hope of treating new diseases, saving countless lives, and, incidentally, driving down healthcare costs. We also secured an increase for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will help enhance our readiness to combat pandemics and respond to public health crises. We increased funding for GEAR UP and TRIO, two essential programs that help firstgeneration college students actually go to college, and increased funding for Head Start by $90 million. Every Member of this House has a victory someplace in this bill, and this was done, Mr. Speaker, by cutting spending in other less essential areas and making tough choices. In the LaborH provisions of this bill, for instance, we actually spend $2.8 billion less than President Obama requested, and $1 billion less than we actually spent last year. Finally, and most importantly, this bill is the product of a successful bipartisan, bicameral negotiation. This shows all of us that we have the ability for the President, the Republicans in the House and the Senate, and the Democrats in the House and the Senate to sit down and work together on important issues. I am heartened by this success, and I believe it suggests our ability to work together in the future on other crucially important pieces of legislation like tax reform and infrastructure improvements. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2017. As you know, this $1 trillion omnibus will provide discretionary funding for most of the Federal Government for the remaining 5 months of fiscal year 2017. Before moving to the specifics of the legislation, we need to get a few things straight. It bears repeating that the appropriations measures contained in this bill should have been passed months ago. While I am glad that we have arrived at this compromise, and the words of my good friend from Oklahoma, I certainly support with regard to the extraordinary work of the chairman and the ranking member, and their respective staffs, as well as all the appropriators, generally, and their staffs, they have done a good job with reference to the measure, as far as compromise is concerned. But the fact remains that the bill is 7 months late. The House Committee on Appropriations is already hard at work for fiscal year 2018, and yet this body is still trying to fund programs for the current fiscal year. The root cause of this disarray does not lie with the Appropriations Committee but with the majority’s leadership, or lack thereof, in this Congress and in the White House. b1245 I also need to level another critique at my friends across the aisle who have time and again brought us to the brink of a government shutdown. We needed months of negotiations and three continuing resolutions to keep the government funded. Much of the time, poison pill riders gummed up the works. Among other things, the majority continuously tries to strip funding from women’s healthcare organizations, slash environmental protections, and end protections for Federal employees through the appropriations process. Well, here we are, Mr. Speaker, 7 months later, with a bill that does none of these things. Yet we do it again and again, lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. I said yesterday or the day before in the Rules Committee that we will be back here with a stopgap measure and repeat this same crisis routine that we have done for many of the years that I have had the privilege of serving in this body. Mr. Speaker, maybe next time we will skip the grandstanding and start off with a commonsense measure from the getgo. This brings me to the bill itself. The measure includes $1.07 trillion in base discretionary budget authority, including $551 billion in base defense spending, $518.5 billion in base nondefense spending, $62.1 billion in overseas contingency operations defense spending, and $16.5 billion in overseas contingency operations nondefense spending. More than 160 partisan toxic riders were floated but kept out of the legislation. Despite Donald John Trump’s insistence on draconian cuts, the omnibus includes $1.2 billion in additional nondefense budget authority. It provides funding to alleviate Puerto Rico’s emergency budget shortfall and their underfunded Medicaid program. It increases funding for the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion. It provides $1.1 billion in disaster assistance for regions affected by storms and flooding in 2015 and 2016, and it includes $900 million in humanitarian assistance to alleviate international famine. Toward that end, with reference to famine in the world, we are witnessing a rising number of countries that are experiencing famine. Without identifying them all, it is estimated that some 20 million people in the world are at risk of dying from starvation. In this country, too many people are in a position of being hungry during the course of a day. In the land of plenty, we can do better. In this vein, I was pleased to see the inclusion of language that will positively impact the district that I serve and every other district that faces the threat of natural disasters. Toward that end, my good friend from Oklahoma is absolutely correct. In the compromise measure, there are some things that will impact all of our districts, and that is, in my judgment, as it should be. Additionally, I am one of few Members around here who continuously argues that Members should have earmark responsibilities so that they can be held accountable for things that are vital in their districts rather than allowing the bureaucracy to dominate that sphere. The language clarifies a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act, codifying the Department of Labor’s views on lifting the work restrictions on insurance claims adjusters responding to disasters. When a natural disaster strikes, like a hurricane or a wildfire, insurance adjusters are there to help those affected piece their lives back together and get back on their feet. By ensuring that adjusters can quickly and readily respond to disasters, this codification helps them complete their important work. I did say in the Rules Committee, and I have said for 20 years here, that this Congress needs a disaster relief committee that is constituted of all of the chairs of the committees of jurisdiction. It is not complicated. It is something that is done in other countries so that when these disasters occur—be they fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, or any disaster—we can respond more quickly than we do now, rather than allowing for the residual remains of the kinds of disasters that we experience in this country. Just this past weekend, at least 16 lives were lost and many people were injured in tornadic activity in the States of Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas and floods in Missouri, and we need to respond to those. Additionally, something else that I want to say that I consider to be important are the responsibilities of FEMA. While I believe they do an extraordinary job with what they are allowed to work with, I don’t know what it takes to get across to people that FEMA can only react when there are a certain number of people that have lost their homes. Please know this: when 1 person loses their home to a natural disaster, it is just as important as if 1,000 or 100,000 lost their home; and we, 
this Congress, need to be able to respond to that 1 the same way we do to 1,000. Furthermore, I was glad to see that the bill includes yearround Pell grants to provide 1 million students in this country with an additional average award of $1,650, and it permanently extends health insurance benefits for retired mineworkers. I might add that that has been and will continue to be a bipartisan effort to provide for the health of those mineworkers. Hopefully, in spite of all the talk coming out of the White House, we may, one day, find a way to help those that have lost their jobs because of the industrial changes transition to good jobs. But what is included in this bill is just as important as what is not. In his first major budget negotiation, Donald John Trump made many demands that were defeated. He requested $30 billion in additional defense spending and $3 billion to fund construction of a U.S. Mexico border wall and is around crowing that there is money in this bill to do something about the wall, and there is not. The President wanted policy riders to restrict sanctuary cities from receiving Federal grants. He wanted to defund Planned Parenthood and undermine health care. As I have already said, there were 160 riders that were floated here in this measure but are not included. Rather than governing responsibly, Donald John Trump and the House Freedom Caucus have spent a good deal of time and energy pushing partisan interests, from repealing health care to gutting the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and successful programs like community development block grants. All of these programs are fully funded in this measure. As the President gets cozy with authoritarian strongmen around the world and revisits the history of the Civil War—and for your information, Donald Trump, it was slavery that caused the war—Congress has stepped up and asserted itself, and I am glad. I have said repeatedly that the legislative branch has given too much authority not to this President but to the one before him, the one before him, and the one before that one. We have continuously ceded our authority. So it is understood by virtue of this action and, I hope, future action that the legislature is an equal branch of our government, and we need to act like it. Funding the government is one of the most important responsibilities Congress has. There are, undeniably, differences in policy priorities between Members in this body, Democrats and Republicans, and differences between Democrats and differences between Republicans in this body, but holding the Federal budget hostage is not the way to work through these problems. This measure is a responsible compromise that serves the interests of the American public, and that is what we came here to do. My good friend from Oklahoma, last night in the Rules Committee, said that the people that win in this measure are the American people, and I agree with him. That is why I was even dismayed and, quite frankly, disturbed at the irresponsible comment that Donald John Trump tweeted yesterday morning that what this country needs is ‘‘a good shutdown’’ in September. I made it a point, when we were in the Rules Committee, to ask the fine young gentleman that works with me to learn the context because I just can’t believe that this man comes out and says that this institution needs to have ‘‘a good shutdown.’’ Donald John Trump, there is no such thing as a good shutdown. The President champions a government shutdown not only to his but to his party’s peril. The hardworking and working poor Americans are at peril with that kind of undertaking. He does so to the peril of our men and women fighting overseas, to the peril of working families and their health care, to education, and to safe, clean, and secure communities. Donald John Trump may think he can run the country on Twitter while daydreaming of taxpayerfunded jaunts to his private golf club, but he needs to wise up. We don’t need a good shutdown. We need a good leader. If he continues and isn’t prepared to get serious, then he needs to get out of the way. As my colleague Congressman MCGOVERN said yesterday, rather than a shutdown, the President ought to shut his mouth. I will put it another way from the vernacular: zip his lip, put that Twitter off somewhere on the side and let birds tweet while he talks sensibly to the American people. Maybe the President thinks that if the government shuts down people suddenly don’t need to pay taxes and that national parks become free. Maybe he thinks that if the government shuts down—if we have a good government shutdown—every regulation suddenly stops and corporations are free to run wild without complying to clean water or clean air standards. I don’t know what he is thinking. I don’t think anybody else around here knows what he is thinking. I am not even certain he knows what he is thinking. And to be honest, I would be afraid to see what is going on in his head. But here is what I do know. According to the financial ratings agency Standard & Poor’s, the 2013 government shutdown cost the United States—the American people—$24 billion. According to a report from the Council of Economic Advisers, it sidetracked the creation of as many as 120,000 jobs. I hope you are listening, Donald John Trump, because these aren’t alternative facts. The furloughs amounted to more than 5.5 million days’ worth of Federal employment lost spread across dozens of agencies. Businesses that relied on tourism lost out on more than a half billion dollars. The Small Business Administration couldn’t process some 700 applications for $140 million in small businesses loans. b1300 According to the U.S. Travel Association, the 16day shutdown cost $152 million per day in lost travel spending. According to CNBC, 2 weeks into the latest shutdown, the Internal Revenue Service reported a backlog of 1.2 million verification requests that could not be processed. Mr. Speaker, we don’t need a good government shutdown. We don’t need a shutdown at all. We just got through a 7month negotiation to keep the government open. Naturally, the media picked up on the fact that Donald John Trump got virtually none of his priorities. When the report started to air, he threw a political temper tantrum and took to Twitter to undermine the compromise. I will be honest at this point: it is nothing new, so it shouldn’t surprise anyone; nor should the backlash that ensued or his sudden change of heart. In just a few hours, Donald John Trump went from condemning the deal and whining about the rules of the Senate to hailing it as a great compromise. I must have missed that chapter in his ‘‘The Art of the Deal.’’ So let’s leave it at this: we need to do more, not less, to strengthen our communities and help working families. I urge President Donald John Trump to move past the campaign rhetoric and get serious. I hope you are listening, sir, because you can put that in a tweet. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience. Also, Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. To respond to a few of my friend’s points, Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by agreeing with my friend, actually. As he knows, I agree with his point that this should have been done many months ago, and could have been done, in my view, many months ago. We should have done this in December. I don’t think we did the country or ourselves or the President any favors by delaying that. So my friend is right about that decision, and I hope we all learn a lesson from it. I also agree with my friend that, because we delayed, the 2018 appropriations process will be extremely difficult and truncated. It will make work harder. We may find ourselves back here in a number of months asking for 
some brief extension as we continue to work through our problems. I hope not, but my friend’s observation on that point I agree with. I want to disagree with my friend pretty strongly about his observation about the 160 riders that we decided in the negotiation not to press, and I want to explain why we decided not to press them. Frankly, we don’t need to press them anymore. Almost 160 of those were designed to limit or reverse rulings of the last administration—either rules or executive decisions. Well, Mr. Trump is now the President of the United States and he is going to have the ability to do almost all of those things on his own. He doesn’t need legislative instruction from us. He will certainly get support as he works through that list with the executive branch, which he runs. I also want to add, just to clarify, it is important to note that there is nothing in this bill that funds Planned Parenthood in any way, shape, or form. As a matter of fact, there is a family planning title and grants are awarded out of that title by the Department of Health and Human Services. Sometimes in the past, Planned Parenthood has received money in those grants. Now there is new management at the Department of Health and Human Services, so we will see how this goes. This Congress has never appropriated money directly to Planned Parenthood and, frankly, I suspect never will. Finally, in defense of the President, I want to point out that we are adding billions of dollars to defense of this country, which is desperately needed because, frankly, his predecessor had allowed it to erode. That is because of the President’s leadership. We are making the most substantial investments in border security in a decade. That is because of the President’s leadership. Finally, we have broken this terrible oneforone formula that the last administration imposed on us. In other words, to defend the United States of America, we had to spend more money domestically, whether we needed to or not, whether we could afford it or not. If it weren’t for President Trump, that formula would still be in existence and we would be frittering away money in places where we don’t need it and denying support to our troops and our forces in the field when they desperately need it. I am very grateful to the President for making that possible. Again, with his leadership, it could not have occurred. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ), my good friend, a fellow Rules Committee member, and also a distinguished member of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. I appreciate his leadership to get us here both on the Rules Committee and the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Speaker, despite what you may hear in the media, this funding bill is a positive step forward for the American people and a big win for the Trump administration. I want to highlight a few reasons why. First, delivering on President Trump’s promise, this bill makes long overdue and muchneeded investments in our military. The bill boosts military spending by $21 billion, which will help boost military readiness and fund the largest pay raise for our troops in 6 years. Importantly, the bill finally rejects demands of Democrats to only increase defense spending if all other spending is also increased. This bill ends that harmful precedent. The bill devotes important new funding for border security. In fact, it contains the biggest increase in border security funding in almost a decade. This will allow us to make improvements to the wall at the border, put more Customs and Border Protection agents on the ground, and end the disastrous practice of ‘‘catch and release.’’ The bill includes important prolife protections to ensure taxpayer money is not used to fund abortions. Just as important, the bill does not contain a penny of funding for Planned Parenthood. I am going to say it again: there is not a penny in here for Planned Parenthood. The bill includes important Second Amendment protections, increases funding to help fight crime, supports funding for Israel, provides money for missile defense, and sets aside additional resources to defeat ISIS. Even more, the bill cuts funding to the EPA, freezes funding for the IRS, and reduces the Federal Government’s role in education. Finally, the bill makes progress and priorities important to my folks in southwest Alabama. For example, the bill fully funds three littoral combat ships, which are built, in part, by Austal USA in Mobile. These ships are critical to the United States Navy and are necessary if we are to reach the 355 ship fleet that President Trump wants. This funding bill will ensure we continue to build these first class vessels in Mobile. The bill also includes a provision important to our red snapper fishermen. With the help of Senator RICHARD  SHELBY , we were able to secure a permanent expansion of State waters out to nine nautical miles. Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect— no compromise ever is—but I commend President Trump in negotiating a good bill to begin the process of implementing the priorities the American people sent him and us to Washington to accomplish. President Trump has called on Congress to pass this funding bill while we work to make even more progress in the upcoming fiscal year 2018 funding negotiations. I intend to do just that, and I call on my colleagues to do the same. I am glad to support President Trump, this rule, and the underlying bill. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, would you be kind enough to advise how much time remains? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 11 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Oklahoma has 191⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, news flash here for those that might have been trying to make plans for leaving here tomorrow morning: it appears that House Republicans are intent on trying to bring TrumpCare back to life. The Republican healthcare bill was bad the first time, bad the second time, and its latest iteration is even worse. In addition to kicking 24 million people off their health coverage, gutting Medicaid in order to give a trilliondollar tax cut—mostly to the richest Americans—and dismantling the requirement to provide the essential health benefits, the latest proposal completely guts protections for people with preexisting conditions and imposes an unlimited age tax on older Americans. Now we see in the press that the Republican leadership is trying to cut yet another backroom deal on expensive, highrisk pools to try and muster enough votes to pass this monstrosity. Mr. Speaker, this bill has not gone through regular order from the start. There have been no hearings. There is no CBO score. We are reading in the press that even more changes are on the horizon. I wish I could start reading in the press or looking at television and just have people that have the responsibility and leadership to inform those of us that are in the minority just what the plan really constitutes and when it will be put forward. Every single Member in this institution should be as outraged as I am, regardless of party. This is a bill that will affect every American. Therefore, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule that would change the rules of the House to prevent any healthcarerelated legislation from being considered if it does not have a CBO cost estimate; or if it would deny health coverage or require higher premiums due to preexisting conditions; impose lifetime limits on health coverage; prevent individuals under age 26 from being covered under their parents’ plans; reduce the number of people receiving health care under the Affordable Care Act; increase costs to seniors by reopening the doughnut hole and raising prescription drug costs; require people to pay for preventive services, including cancer screening; reduce Medicare solvency or change the Medicare guarantee; or reduce Federal taxes on the 1 percent of the population with the highest incomes or increase taxes on the 80 percent of hardworking Americans earning moderate to low income. 
Every American deserves affordable, highquality health care. This amendment would ensure that the Republican bill can’t sacrifice that goal in favor of giving tax cuts to the wealthy. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), the ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means, to discuss the proposal. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge HASTINGS for yielding. The previous question I offer with Congresswoman SLAUGHTER would prevent any legislation from being considered if the legislation would deny coverage or require higher premiums for preexisting conditions, increase costs for seniors for prescription drugs, or reduce Medicare solvency. I have listened to the previous three speakers on the Republican side talk about national defense. That is understandable, but might we, for the purpose of this discussion, also acknowledge the following: real national defense also means providing health security for members of American families. That is part of the balance that we should be recognizing. The priorities on the other side are the following: they are going to turn the issue of preexisting condition back to a voluntary nature at the State level. As one who comes from local government, we should recognize the following: every time there is an economic downturn, you can be certain that Governors are going to use the money that was intended for health care to balance the budgets, and they are going to call it good management. They are undermining the health security of the American people with their proposal on TrumpCare. b1315 They have been threatening to eliminate coverage for millions of Americans for years, and now they are telling us they are on the eve of accomplishing just that. But what does it mean for the American family? They want to go back to the days when you could be denied routine health insurance because you might have been born with diabetes, you might have had a liver transplant in midlife, you might have had a diagnosis of cancer in midlife, and you can no longer be insured despite the fact that you have spent a lifetime paying those premiums? And we are going to make this an option of the States to decide? This is going backwards on the issue of health security. But that is not enough, as we know. They also are going to ask you to pay more for hospital care, more for prescription drugs, more for mental health and substance abuse treatment, more for pediatric care, and certainly more for cancer care. And they are going to call this an improvement in health care delivery? Well, their recent improvements have made it clear. Let’s not forget the previous bill had an underlying $1 trillion tax giveaway that would drain $75 billion from the Medicare trust fund and cut $840 billion from Medicaid, all for the purpose of providing a $1 trillion tax cut to the people at the very top. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts an additional 2 minutes. Mr. NEAL. Fewer covered, higher costs, and fewer protections for the American family. The previous question that LOUISE SLAUGHTER and I are going to offer is the following: We would prevent any of this legislation that is proposed that would be considered harmful to the consumers, as the Republican bill is. Americans need assurance about health care and, by the way, some predictability. During my time of service here, I have seen how difficult it is to do health insurance. I think there is only one person in Washington, by the way, who said: Who knew health insurance could be this complicated? Well, for those of us who have served here for any extended period of time, I can assure you, we all knew that health care was complicated in terms of delivery and economic consequence. But that is not enough for our friends today. They want to change the basic tenet of the guarantee of ending preexisting conditions. I had a Republican friend I talked to yesterday. He said: I wish I was still back in the House because I would vote against that bill. He said: My daughter had a liver transplant, and now they are saying, with preexisting conditions, it is going to be up to the Governor of a State to decide whether or not she can continue to get care? We need the guarantee of Medicare coupled with the expansion of Medicaid, which has now offered insurance to 24 million Americans that didn’t have insurance prior to the Affordable Care Act. I would say this as well. And remember, half of that number, that is private insurance. We kept the private sector alive for the purpose of offering discipline to price. It has accomplished that. Healthcare spending in America has plateaued. But, again, on this occasion, we won’t let the facts get in the way of a rigid ideology that says we need to change the Affordable Care Act because Barack Obama offered it. That is what the test is now for the American people: Who sponsored legislation? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. NEAL. We have debated health care since Harry Truman was President. We have debated health care since Lyndon Johnson offered Medicare and Medicaid. Bob Dole and Mitt Romney and Richard Nixon all understood you needed the mandate to provide health care to all members of the American family. They are going to shun that today and tomorrow by turning their backs on preexisting conditions. Remember, real national defense also means providing health care for members of the American family. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Before I go to my next speaker, I want to take a moment to respond to my friends. Mr. Speaker, I actually came here to debate the appropriations bill, which is a great bipartisan compromise, but I am always happy to engage in the healthcare debate as well, if that is what my friends choose to do. I am happy to do it because I remember the conditions under which ObamaCare was passed. I remember the promises that we would save $2,500 a family—not true. I remember, if you liked your plan, you could keep it—not true. I remember, if you liked your doctor, you could keep that individual—not true. This was sold, frankly, on a tissue of fabrications and some predictions that were outlandishly false. Those people who say this is a good system, come to my State. We are down to a single provider—one. That provider, by the way, I always say thank God for them, because they are losing money. We are down to one. Our rates are going up 69 percent. So anybody who thinks this is a successful system should go look at it. If it were successful, my friends would probably still be in the majority instead of the minority. It has not been successful. The American people have, in election after election, rendered a verdict that this particular system is not meeting their needs, and it badly needs to be overhauled and changed, if not rooted out completely. Frankly, again, as, I think, through the President’s actions and what my colleagues in the leadership of my party are doing, I am very glad they are working overtime right now to try and make sure that we have something better for the American people than my friends delivered on the other side of the aisle when they had the opportunity to do so. It is not working. I hope very much we have to cancel travel plans so the next day or two we can actually vote on this. I would be ecstatic to do that. So, again, I would be happy to debate that. When the time comes, we will. But I look forward to engaging in that debate because I am absolutely convinced we can do a lot better for the American people than we 
did when ObamaCare was passed, and we can implement something a lot better for the American people than we did when it was rolled out. And we certainly can avoid some of the catastrophic consequences. As for my friend’s concerns about preexisting conditions, frankly, they are not going to be reversed, but I happen to live in a State where I trust my Governor and my legislature to make smart decisions. Frankly, I trust them a lot more than I do anybody in Washington, D.C., to understand what is going on in my State. I suspect most people in here actually trust their Governors and their legislature to be more in touch with the needs of their people than anybody in Washington, D.C., happens to be, so I am happy to see a devolution of decisionmaking from Washington to other parts of the country. As I read the Constitution, we call that federalism. It has worked very well for the American people for almost 240 years. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Fourth District of Michigan (Mr. MOOLENAAR ), my good friend in his second term, but a new member of the Committee on Appropriations. I am very glad to have him on my Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman COLE, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , and the entire Committee on Appropriations, as well as the President and congressional leaders in both the House and the Senate for their work on this bipartisan appropriations bill. This legislation is not perfect, but it addresses many priorities for the people of Michigan and the United States. It funds the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which protects the Great Lakes. It instructs the Army Corps of Engineers to turn over its report on stopping Asian carp from invading the Great Lakes. It funds important scientific research at Michigan State University, and it continues support for vaccines against emerging threats. It also commits funding for cures research at the National Institutes of Health, including the fight against Alzheimer’s, so we can work on stopping this nefarious disease that steals golden years from our seniors. For the rural communities in my district, this legislation increases funding for rural development grants and the Farm Service Agency. This legislation promotes border security and integrity, providing more money for Customs and Border Patrol and increasing the number of Border Patrol agents hired. This legislation will ensure that our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to keep us safe from threats, including North Korea, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. This legislation makes important cuts, including eliminating wasteful funding for U.N. programs that overreach and run counter to the ideals of our country. Finally, this legislation extends prohibitions on funding for abortion that have been in place for years. This legislation addresses many important priorities for the people of Michigan and our entire Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ), my friend. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the omnibus spending agreement that is before us today, which will finally fund the government for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The bill before us is not a perfect bill, but it represents a good bipartisan compromise. Mr. Speaker, we need to engage in good faith discussions about our values and priorities, not participate in posturing to social media. It is my hope that my congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle will continue the constructive tone that this agreement represents. This fiscal year 2017 agreement delivers on many priorities important to Rhode Island. It restores the year round Pell Grant Program or summer Pell eligibility, allowing summer students to receive Pell grant funds to help them finish their degrees on time. Rather than slash funding as the President had requested, this compromise also adds $2 billion in funding to the National Institutes of Health, which conducts vital research in our efforts to treat and cure catastrophic diseases and drives innovative economic development. On the defense side, this agreement funds vital national security programs, including the continued procurement of Virginia class submarines and ongoing development of the new Columbia class, work that I am proud to say happens at Quonset Point in my district. I want to thank all those involved in these negotiations on both sides of the aisle for their commitment to achieving a good faith compromise that will keep the government open and working for the American people. I hope we can continue on a similar bipartisan agreement as we plan for the next fiscal year. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. DENT), my very good friend and my fellow member of the Committee on Appropriations and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation, which is the product of a lot of effort on the part of a lot of people on a very bipartisan basis. I would first like to thank and congratulate our distinguished chair and ranking members for their work on the 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act and for their leadership in bringing this legislation forward today to address a number of timely issues facing our Nation. I certainly want to thank the gentleman, Mr. COLE, to my immediate left for his strong work on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies bill, which I will mention at some point here as well, but his leadership has been extraordinary on this issue. I would like to draw special attention to some of this legislation’s provisions that will further support our veterans and enhance our military’s readiness. Division L of the underlying bill provides supplemental funding to augment the appropriations that were provided to MILCON and the VA accounts, military construction and the VA accounts, last September. Specifically, this bill will allow us to further address the opioid epidemic that has escalated within so many communities across the country and affected individuals and families from a broad range of backgrounds and professions. The 2017 bill will provide $50 million in additional currentyear funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve opioid and substance abuse prevention and treatment for veterans. Those funds will allow the VA to achieve full implementation of their responsibilities under title IX of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. I just raised this issue less than an hour ago with VA Secretary David Shulkin in this morning’s hearing. He stressed the importance of these funds to stay ahead of this challenge and provide comprehensive treatments to our veterans. It is my hope that the lessons learned from this public health crisis will be remembered so that we can prevent similar episodes from occurring in the future. In addition, the FY17 Consolidated Appropriations Act will support readiness and infrastructure improvements and facilitate future force structure growth by providing all our military services with the full amount requested for military construction efforts. Mr. Speaker, I agree with so many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle that we need to make investments in our military readiness. I would like to stress that the investments in the infrastructure and military construction programs that support our troops at home and abroad are critical aspects of our overall readiness posture. This bill will move us in the right direction by addressing needs for both our ActiveDuty and our National Guard and Reserve forces. b1330 I would also like to talk about some other aspects of this legislation, too, in the underlying bill. Many pressing needs are addressed here. 
Specifically, we are talking about a very significant pay increase, a 2.1 percent pay increase for our troops. It is the largest pay increase in 6 years. This legislation makes a substantial downpayment on our efforts, and the Trump administration’s efforts, to enhance and increase military spending to address the various threats that we are seeing throughout the world. I just returned from South Korea and Okinawa, Japan, and we have many challenges in Northeast Asia, that I won’t go into here today. But we all know that we have some real obligations, particularly for our United States Navy. I also wanted to mention, too, my good friend, Chairman COLE. He led the effort, along with Senator ROYBLUNT , to increase funding for medical research, critical lifesaving medical research to the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion in this legislation, taking the funding level from $32 billion to $34 billion. And that is on top of what we heard in fiscal year 2016, which took us up $2 billion, as well, from $30 billion to $32 billion. So the commitment of this side of the aisle to medical research, I think, is strong, and we are backing it up with our dollars. We had to set some priorities, and Chairman COLEdid that in the labor health bill. He set those priorities, and we said: This is one of them. I am proud that we as Republicans are stepping up on medical research. I am also pleased, too, that many of our Democratic friends are supporting this in this effort as well. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to point out that this legislation, in addition to this robust increase for medical research, the chairman also provided substantial support for early childhood, a priority to him and to many of us. And there are other areas, too. Pell grants made some great changes, too— yearround Pell grants for so many students who are struggling with college affordability. I also want to point out, too, on border security, a downpayment has been made here as well. This legislation provides $1.5 billion additionally for border security. This will help us move closer to establishing greater operational control of our border, which is something I think we all agree needs to be done. These are just a few of the provisions of this legislation beyond what I am responsible for—military construction and VA—that are worthy. I would urge support of this bill. I would also like to point out that we did pass the Military Construction and VA Appropriations bill back in September on time. It is the first appropriations bill passed on time since 2009. I want to take a little credit for that. But these other 11 bills that have been discussed here today need our support. We need to keep this government running. We have done it in a very thoughtful, bipartisan, measured way, and we have been very responsible. This bill needs to get to the President’s desk immediately. Again, I urge support for this legislation, and I support the rule as well. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. The President has said that Americans would win so much, they would be tired of winning. I think for once he and I may be in agreement. Today’s measure advances medical research, protects coal miners, fights back against the opioid epidemic and international disasters, and protects funding for science, education, and health care. It should not have taken us 7 months to get here. But I hope this measure will give the Appropriations Committee a springboard for fiscal year 2018. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank my good friend. It is always a pleasure, honestly, to engage in debate with him because it is going to be spirited, but it is going to be civil. So I thank my friend for that. And, frankly, when my friend points out that he and President Trump are actually on the same side for once, I think the second coming may not be very far. So we are all in a pretty good mood here. But I do want to echo a couple of points that my friend made, and made, as always, with great skill. There is a lot in this bill that brings us together. This was a product of genuine compromise. We have Republicans in the House and Democrats in the House, Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the Senate, and, obviously, the administration. It is really a fivecorner negotiation. I think we ought to step back a little bit and reflect that, in the course of that, while all those parties began with very different positions, and some verbal fisticuffs, as well, they actually moved closer together over the course of discussion. And that has effectively meant that we are going to have the first bipartisan, bicameral negotiation in this administration that has been successful. I would hope it becomes a model for some of the things that lie in front of us, things like infrastructure, and like tax reform. I recognize we won’t always agree. But, to me, this agreement shows that we can work towards agreements, if we will sit in good faith and compromise with one another. I think the President, frankly, did a lot of good things from his point of view here. I think the additional money for our men and women in uniform, the raise in pay for those we have asked so much from, and who have never let us down, is something he can be proud of. I think the additional money on the border, where we know we have a security problem, we may debate the best way to address that. That is fair enough. But that is an achievement that he deserves credit for. And I think, frankly, breaking this artificial linkage of domestic spending and security spending was something that is really important. Sometimes we will actually need more domestically than, perhaps, we need in defense. But we are going to have to look at those things logically, not create artificial formulas. I actually fear sometimes my side might do that in reverse by demanding cuts in exchange for military spending when those cuts are, in themselves, not wise. Finally, I look at things where we find a lot of common purpose here. My friend, Mr. DENT, mentioned a number of those. Things like more money for the National Institutes of Health and the Center for Disease Control. Believe me, pandemics and bioterrorists don’t care if you are Republican or Democrat, or Liberal or Conservative. We have to maintain this effort. It is extraordinarily important. I think, again, and my friends pointed out, we worked together to provide additional funds for early childhood, to provide additional money through programs like GEAR UP and TRIO, to help those who have never had an opportunity to go to college and succeed. And, frankly, things like the year round Pell grant, that, again, as speakers from both sides of the aisle pointed out, are going to help students actually succeed and help them wrestle with the financial burden. So there is a lot in here to be proud of. Now, our vote on the rule is always a partisan exercise, so I recognize that. But I am very proud that, after that vote, we will have substantial numbers of Members from both sides of the aisle voting together on something they worked on together and achieved. It will be sent over to the Senate, and I think we will see the same result there, and eventually to the desk of the President of the United States, and I think he can sign it with a great deal of pride and a recognition that: hey, occasionally, bipartisanship and negotiation actually work. With that, again, I want to thank my very good friend for the debate. And I want to point out in closing that this is so much better than a continuing resolution. This is real governance at work. This is us working together, exercising oversight, and appropriately funding, and compromises on occasion, important functions for the American people. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. Stated against: Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, May 3rd 2017, I was not present for rollcall vote 246.

Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, a very destructive storm system moved across my home State of Texas, the Midwest, and the Southeast, killing 15 of our fellow citizens and destroying whole communities in its wake. In Van Zandt County in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, which I have the privilege to represent, four constituents lost their lives in a series of four violent tornadoes that shattered homes, shattered lives, and devastated neighbors in the Fifth District and the Fourth District of Texas. These storms also tragically killed seven people in Washington, Carroll, and Madison Counties in Arkansas; two people in Rankin and Holmes Counties in Mississippi; one person in Nashville, Tennessee; and one person from Billings, Missouri. Many more, Mr. Speaker, have been hospitalized. Joining me here today are some of the Members whose communities were affected: Congressman WOMACK and Congressman CRAWFORD of Arkansas, Congressman HARPER of Mississippi, Congressman THOMPSON of Mississippi, Congressman COOPER of Tennessee, Congressman LONGof Missouri, and my fellow Texan, Congressman JOHN RATCLIFFE —again, Mr. Speaker, all who represent communities that were tragically affected. Mr. Speaker, our citizens who were lost have left a void in their families and left a void in their communities. Our hearts are heavy. Our prayers are sincere for the loved ones they leave behind and for those who recover from their wounds. For many of us, in our faith, there is a time to mourn. Mr. Speaker, now is the time to mourn. But as we have, in our faith, a time to mourn, we also have faith, Mr. Speaker, that one day our citizens will heal and they will heal and rebuild their communities as well. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would ask the House to help us in honoring those who lost their lives in these deadly storms and the families and loved ones they leave behind by joining us in observing a moment of silence. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, 5minute voting will continue. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
‘‘This division may be cited as the ‘Honoring Investments in Recruiting and Employing American Military Veterans Act of 2017’ or the ‘HIRE Vets Act’. 
The concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. 
b1645 PAKISTAN (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for years, Pakistan has provided support for America’s enemies with American blood on their hands. Pakistan has supported the Taliban providing them safe haven, cash, and weapons. It is no coincidence that the leader of the Taliban was living in Pakistan when a United States air strike took him out last year. Pakistan harbored the number one enemy of the world, Obama bin Laden, until our SEALs brought him to justice. Pakistan’s intelligence services has been dubbed the veritable arm of the terrorist group Haqqani Network. They have even cut off supply routes for our troops in Afghanistan. The Ambassador to Afghanistan has said that Pakistan supports terrorist groups in Afghanistan, but still Pakistan is considered a major nonNATO ally of the U.S. This status means that they get priority for significant benefits in the areas of foreign aid and defense cooperation. I am introducing a bill that removes Pakistan from this list of trusted allies. Pakistan is playing both sides. It is time to call it like it is. Pakistan should not be counted as a major non NATO ally of the United States. And that is just the way it is. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF GENERAL AMEDEO ‘‘ARMIE’’ MEROLLA (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory of General Amedeo ‘‘Armie’’ Merolla—a dedicated patriot, a passionate legal mind, a community leader in Rhode Island, and someone whom I was proud to call a dear friend. Armie’s distinguished military career spanned 36 years, during which time he served in the United States Marine Corps and the Rhode Island National Guard. He served as assistant adjutant general for the State and retired as the first brigadier general of Italian heritage in the history of the Rhode Island National Guard. As an accomplished attorney for more than 60 years, he provided legal counsel and advice to several public officials—myself included—and maintained a very successful private practice. As a tireless community leader, he served as chairman of the Warwick School Committee and held leadership positions in local branches of charities and children’s organizations. Above all, he prioritized his family, whom he loved dearly and to whom he devoted his life’s work. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to remember Armie on the floor today, just as it was to consider him a trusted friend and adviser. Mr. Speaker, he made a difference, and he will be greatly missed. f 
ARE WE LOSING OUR DEMOCRACY? (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, are we losing our democracy? CNN has censored and refused to air an ad by Trump for President, claiming that it is inaccurate. Of course, that is their opinion and they are entitled to it. What they are not entitled to do is violate the Constitution’s protection of free speech. Where are all the editorial boards of the media who rightly advocate for free speech? Why are most silent? To censor a political ad because CNN disagrees with it is to threaten our democratic form of government. 
2017 CONTINUED APPROPRIATIONS (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the continued appropriations for 2017 and to say: Say it isn’t so. When the Trump budget was presented—the skinny budget—$600 billion was cut out of NIH, which would impact a major research in diseases that impact Americans. Thank goodness that we worked for a $2 billion increase for the NIH in this appropriations bill. And, equally so, how important it is that we can announce in Houston that the Houston Housing Authority will be able to reissue vouchers for homeless families because $654 millionplus was put in the section 8 vouchers, $40 millionplus was put in for veterans who are homeless, and $10 million was put in for the disabled. In addition, we added to the Cops on the Beat program and, as well, provided additional dollars to enhance the Civil Rights Division some $897.5 million. The budget or the appropriations should be a road map for serving Americans, not a nickelanddime approach to undermine. I am glad the resistance remains strong, and that is why we have a budget or an appropriation that listens to the people and the healthcare subsidies are being paid for, so that people can have that health insurance. f 
ANTIQUITIES ACT (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this week in the Natural Resources Committee, we conducted an important hearing and review on the Antiquities Act. This is the process for which these days the President unilaterally can declare national monuments, thereby placing acres that are deemed to be preserved into a monument, which then cannot be touched by human hands as it is interpreted and enforced these days. Under President Obama, twice as many acres were placed into that type of monument status as all other Presidents combined over the history of the country. Now, what this means is that you can’t have access for forestry, fire protection, and other things you need to do for human activity. Even access for hunting and fishing is oftentimes limited. What we need is to have a process where Congress can have approval of the Antiquities Act if one of these proposals comes into place. We need to have that so that the people will have access to their lands so they can be managed if need be. The size of the monument, yes, we have areas we need to declare and protect. But the size of the monument is very important as well because it doesn’t need to be always hundreds of thousands, even millions, of acres. Indeed, under the act, the idea is that it would be under the smallest possible size to preserve the object. 
NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize this week as National Small Business Week and to applaud the vast contributions of smallbusiness owners and entrepreneurs across my district— the 10th Congressional District of New Jersey. National Small Business Week is the perfect opportunity to recognize the 
importance of small businesses, entrepreneurs, and the diversity of businessowners. In New Jersey, small businesses employ nearly 2 million people and make up 99.6 percent of all businesses in the State. Over the last decade, women owned businesses have increased by 45 percent and generated over $1.6 trillion in revenue. Minorityowned businesses have produced over $1.3 trillion and created 7 million jobs. Small businesses are truly the backbone of our Nation and economy. As Members of Congress, we must do our part to support all efforts to open the doors of opportunity for small business growth. Their success is our success. 
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH STONE (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as co chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, I rise to commemorate the precious life of Joseph Stone of Tucson, Arizona. The 36yearold American was serving his part of an official international peace team monitoring the border conflict between Ukrainian Government troops and Russianbacked separatists who invaded Ukraine. Mr. Stone was working with a German and a Czech peace monitor when an explosion—likely a mine—damaged their vehicle in Pryshyb, Ukraine. The two other monitors are hospitalized in stable condition. Stone is the first Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitor killed in that very important mission. Stone’s career in foreign assistance missions brought him to Afghanistan and Liberia before Ukraine. Before entering the aid community, Stone worked at American Medical Response in southern Arizona for 9 years, starting out as an EMT and rising to the level of paramedic. He graduated from Pima Community College. He is survived by his mother, two brothers, a longtime companion, and 13yearold daughter. Since its establishment in 2014, the OSCE has played a vital role in monitoring the Minsk agreements designed to bring peace to eastern Ukraine after Russia’s brutal invasion of a sovereign neighbor. This fateful tragedy makes clear the absolute brutality of Vladimir Putin’s threats to liberty and democracy in Ukraine. It also instructs us about the unrecognized selfless heroes among us who define the meaning and cost of liberty. May our recognition of his selfless sacrifice bring comfort to those bearing this great loss, and may he be remembered always in the protracted struggle for a free Ukraine. 
THE OMNIBUS BILL (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we found a solution to keep the government open through October and that this deal does not include funding for President Trump’s border wall, nor does it eliminate money for sanctuary cities. These are several issues that I am proud to champion in addition to programs such as the NIH, Child Care and Development Block Grants, Pell grants, nutrition programs for seniors, Planned Parenthood, affordable housing, and Head Start. However, the devil is in the details, and after further reviewing this total package, I cannot, in good conscience, support it. This bill will increase funding for homeland security and is essentially $1.2 billion of President Trump’s original proposed $3 billion request for border security and interior enforcement. We fully know that any funding for homeland security and border security will be used to increase raids and detentions, essentially funding the President’s mass deportation agenda. In addition, this omnibus bill does not provide a longterm solution to Puerto Rico’s economic crisis, leaving Puerto Rico’s Medicaid funding with only onethird of the funding it needs. Finally, the bill comes at the same time that Trump and House Republicans continue to push to eliminate ACA. The devil is in the detail, and that, too, will be a nightmare in hell for many of us. f 
CHANGES TO AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT DO NOT REMEDY BILL’S SHORTCOMINGS (Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise because evidently, in the House of Representatives, we will be taking up the possible passage of a revised but, as yet, unseen American Health Care Act. I rise to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against this. The CBO has not scored it, so we don’t know how much it will cost. We don’t know how many Americans will be thrown off their health care. I want to quote Dr. Andrew Gurman, who is the president of the American Medical Association, who said this today: ‘‘Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance coverage for millions of Americans, the legislation would, in many cases, eliminate the ban against charging those with underlying medical conditions vastly more for their coverage.’’ This is a bad bill that has gotten worse with time. We haven’t seen it. It hasn’t been scored for money or how many patients will be thrown off their health care. It will hurt patients, it will hurt medical providers, it will hurt hospitals, and it will hurt this country. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT (Mr. RASKIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in opposition to this suddenly undead GOP plan to strip millions of Americans of their health insurance and Medicaid coverage and dramatically increase our monthly premiums. Just when you thought we had actually slain the zombie, the repealandreplace plan comes back again with no hearings, no witnesses, no budget score, and no policy coherence. It is like the bloody hand emerging from the grave in ‘‘Carrie,’’ even as the credits are rolling and the people in the audience have already left for their cars. Mr. Speaker, let’s return this so called American Health Care Act to its own preexisting legislative condition: dead on arrival. What makes anyone think it improves the appeal of this plan to strip preexisting coverage from the American people? The fact that you have a preexisting condition is why you need medical attention. It is not the reason to deny it to someone. In the last round, I heard colleagues complain that, under the current system, healthy citizens have to pay for other citizens when they get sick. Yes, my friends, that is what insurance is. Any Member who believes that the currently healthy should not help insure the currently sick must believe no one in his or her family will ever get sick. That is magical thinking. But in America, as Bruce Springsteen says: We take care of our own. 
MATH AND FACTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, we have a whole hour here, and we may actually use the whole hour. This is an opportunity to actually walk through three areas that I care an awful lot about. One, I actually want to walk through something called math, and math in regards to health care. Some of this is actually to deal with—and I don’t want to be mean, because I am going to try to do this in as nonpartisan a way as possible, but some of the things that we have just heard moments ago that lack just sort of basic roots in math and facts. 
b1700 Let me move this easel back just a little bit so we can get this. We are going to do a little bit of showandtell here to sort of help. First off, a conceptual problem, since, I believe, it is 1986, we in the United States have had statutes that say, if a sick person walks into a hospital and they have cancer, they are bleeding, they are going to get health services. This is a really important concept for us all to get our heads around. There is no such thing as not receiving care in this country. It may not be the care you want at the place you want, but it is the law. It has been the law for 30 years. If we are going to be brutally honest, much of the debate and discussion we are having here, whether it be the ACA or prior to the ACA where it was uncompensated care, where it was disproportionate share within our hospitals, or our reform legislation, it is not whether someone gets coverage or doesn’t get coverage; it is who and how it is paid for and where is it paid for. Remember, these costs are already in the system. Does it go as a loss on a hospital balance sheet? Does it get pushed over to other populations within an insurance pool? That is the math we are actually working on. A couple of moments ago, you had a handful of Members come up and talk about preexisting conditions. If you hear someone use the term ‘‘preexisting conditions,’’ they basically are years out of date. There functionally is no such thing anymore. There is guaranteed issuance of insurance. We are going to go through this in more depth. Someone like myself, I am a severe asthmatic. I walk around with an inhaler in my pocket. I can grab any insurance today and I get guaranteed issue. Whether it be in the current ACA— ObamaCare, as many know it—there are variations in what we refer to as community rating. There are age levels. If you are a smoker, you get a different pricing. Some of those same mechanics we are doing in our reform bill. We are going to walk through why the way we are doing it we think actually will ultimately lower prices. We are trying to get that efficiency of the young and healthy to participate in the insurance pool, because they are not participating today. We are going to keep this board close by because this is important for everyone to understand conceptually. I know the chart is hard to see, but 5 percent of the population is 50 percent of the healthcare cost. Think about this. Of our brothers and sisters who have chronic conditions, they are 50 percent of the healthcare costs, even though they are only 5 percent of the population. That is why we did the risksharing model that is being attached to our legislation. We are going to walk more through that. If you start to think about this curve—for those who want to do some math—it looks like a hockey stick. The healthiest 50 percent only use 3 percent of healthcare dollars. So 50 percent of the population only use 3 percent of the healthcare dollars. Then it comes along and explodes up like a hockey stick. The top part of this hockey stick, this 3 percent of the population up here, whether it be because they are hemophiliacs or uncontrolled diabetics or have other types of great difficulties, that population is 50 percent of the entire cost. What happened in the current ACA is, let’s face it, the model did not work. You remember the whole discussion: keep your doctor; $2,500 savings; fewer visits to emergency rooms, which, actually, emergency room visits have skyrocketed or gone up substantially. Their model did not work, and mathematically it is imploding. We are going to go through some data, particularly from my home State of Arizona, on how much trouble we are in. One of the reasons it has not worked is less than half the population of those buying in that individual market are buying. Particularly, if you look at our healthy 20yearolds, our 30yearolds, that 50 percent of the population that only uses 3 percent of health care, they are not participating in the insurance pool. Well, how do you spread risk when you have millions and millions and millions and millions of Americans who are choosing not to purchase because it is too darned expensive or, because the contribution before you receive health care is so expensive and the number of waivers, it is just cheaper to pay the penalty? So what happens when you are trying to do the math and you have your brothers and sisters here in this body on the other side who either make up facts or just say, ‘‘Well, just keep it as it is’’? I am going to make the argument that the cruelty of that is just stunning. We are going to start to walk through a little bit more of these so we can actually help folks sort of understand this is the underlying math, this is why we must have a substantial change. Let’s go back prerecession, just before the recession. Let’s go back here to 2007. We had about 14.6 percent of our population going uninsured. That is unacceptable. Today after having spent almost—as some data says, as much as $1 trillion, but we will stick with a half trillion because that I can absolutely document—$500 billion of subsidies, losses, if you actually add up the losses insurance companies have had, if you add up the copays individuals had, if you actually add up the money that has been spent through the bureaucracies, we have dropped, say, a halftrillion dollars, today we are at 10.9 percent. If you are on the left, this is the grand success of ObamaCare. The grand success of the ACA is that you have gone from 14.6 percent of the population is uninsured, and today it is 10.9? Where is some of the intellectual credibility around this place to at least tell the truth of the math? If you start to divide up how much we have spent—and we were just doing this on the back of a napkin a little while ago. If you add up the population that has now gained insurance through the exchanges that did not have insurance or access to insurance before, some of the math comes to around only 6 million people. If you divide that by a halftrillion dollars, that is $84,000 per life for 3 years of coverage. We could have bought them their health insurance and a really nice car. You understand how absurd the current model is. I am not questioning the good intentions of wanting to help our brothers and sisters have access to health coverage. Great. Now let’s make the math actually work. This chart is really important. This is actually not coming from me. This one, I think, is from Gallup. Most of the other data we are going to get is going to come from Kaiser or the Congressional Budget Office. I want you to understand I am going to be Arizonacentric because that is my home State. I am blessed to represent the PhoenixScottsdale area. But let’s take a look at my little State down here. We are going to burn through these fairly quickly. I have about 6.7 million residents in Arizona. Okay. There are 6.7 million residents in Arizona. This is from Kaiser. Let’s switch to the next board. Of that 6.7 million residents in Arizona, my citizens, how many buy their health care on that individual market? That is what we are talking about. When you keep hearing the grandiose ‘‘the world is coming to an end,’’ how many of my brothers and sisters buy on the individual market? About 278,000 people. That is a lot of people. But if you divide it by our population, it is 4 percent of my population. In my congressional district, it is somewhere around 2 percent of my population. The elegance of actually being honest about that piece of math is that it helps you understand we can fix this. This is the individual purchasing market. Let’s take one step backwards. The majority of Americans receive our health care from our employers. Then we come over here: Medicare, VA, Indian Health Service, TRICARE, a number of these things. What we are talking about in the ACA and our replacement is that sliver of our population that is in the individual market and how to reform Medicaid. That is all. But often when something is complicated, it comes ripe for political hyperbolic language, acting like the world is on fire, instead of being honest and making the math work so we can 
serve our brothers and sisters with the health coverage we want. Remember, we have just come back here to Arizona. Only 4 percent of my population is in the individual market. In my congressional district, it is only 2 percent of the population. Now, you need to understand that when you hear many of us get behind these microphones and we talk about the system, the current ACA— ObamaCare, as it is known; but I think that is unfair, so let’s just call it the ACA—is imploding. For my State, it is. We are going to show you how few choices happen in my State. This is only between 2016 and 2017. Do you see this blue right here? If you were in that county, if you were in that individual market, you would have three or more choices. Do remember that, when this law went into effect, we were promised dozen of choices. Should we hold the left to their own promises? It hasn’t happened. What is happening now, if you take a look all over the country, when you see this chart, county after county after county now has one choice. I want you to see what has happened in my home State. First off, statewide in my State, if you were buying the mean exchange plan, that Silver plan, statewide, last year, a 116 percent price hike. That is if you are in Maricopa County and you are buying the mean Silver plan. Maricopa County is the fourth most populated county in the United States, so it is not just a little outlier. It is the fourth most populated county. It is 64 percent of my State’s population in one county. If there were ever an example of a county that should have had health care efficiency and pricing, it is Maricopa County. It is a large population. If you were in that mean Silver plan, you had a 145 percent price hike last year. How can I see people get behind these microphones and act like this system is working? Do you understand the crushing you are doing to people in my State, hardworking people who just want to say: I am the neighborhood plumber; I would like to buy health care? Either the deductibles have gotten so huge or the underlying price has gone up so high, we are actually seeing something fascinating in the uninsured curve. The uninsured population has now moved into our hardworking middle class because of the number of them that work for themselves that can no longer afford to participate. We will just say it was one of the unintended consequences of the current ACA. But it is one of those occasions we all see the data, and yet how many people get behind these microphones and tell the truth about how many people we are crushing from these deductibles to the current pricing? You saw the previous chart. We have gone from 14.6 percent of our population uninsured before the ACA to, now, 10.9 percent. We dropped about a halftrillion dollars. That is $500 billion. That is not counting Medicaid expansion. That is just the numbers over here. We have had testimony in the Ways and Means Committee that we believe only about 6 million Americans were newly insured, newly covered for that halftrillion dollars. Look, it is great they have coverage, but the math doesn’t make sense. We could have done this so much more elegantly. So let’s actually take a look at Arizona. This is 2014. If you go before that, it was even bigger, but take a look at my county. See all those little squares? Those were health insurance providers that were available to you in 2014. If you go a couple years before that, we had counties that had 15, 18 different possible insurance choices, companies who would provide; today, 2017, you see one little blue square. We are being told that we are going to have entire counties in my State— and Arizona is unique in that we have only 15 counties in the entire State. We are going to have entire counties with no insurance provider to that individual market. This is a system that is working? Take a look at my State. This is one of the reasons we have been working so hard, why we did the risksharing model. This is reality. This is Arizona. This is my home. My folks have had these massive, tripledigit price hikes. Now they have a single choice, and they are being told next year they may have no choice. This is the reality we are at. b1715 So let’s actually talk about solutions. How do you deal with this? How do you actually help our brothers and sisters be able to afford insurance? How do you encourage providers to come in and actually participate in providing coverage to that individual market so there are options, there is competition, there is choice? If you actually think about what drives that price, so why the explosion in price? Well, the current ACA, because of the way it has these three tiers within, we will call it, the community rating—that is where you take all the people in your community who are participating in this insurance population, and say: You don’t all get the same price. There are certain adjustments, and some of the adjustments were for age. So the ACA, ObamaCare, the current law, had three adjustments plus adjustments for smoking and a couple other externalities, and it made the concentration of cost and risk so expensive that—remember our 50 percent of the population who only use 3 percent of health care—they have chosen not to buy, which, in some ways, is a perfectly economically logical reaction to the current cost, to a world where it is so expensive it is cheaper to pay the penalty, so we have to find a way to drive down that cost for that population so they participate. When you were in school and you would hear the story in your economics class of there are occasions where by lowering the price you make more profit because you sell more units? The concept is pretty much the same here in insurance. If we can lower the price for our healthy population, more participate; we spread the risk over a larger, healthier population; we lower the price for that 5 percent of our brothers and sisters who are in that chronic category; plus we are going to overlay a couple other things to help mitigate that cost to get the price efficiency for everyone. It is important. I know some of these slides are a little hard to get our heads around, but we have put together something called an invisible risk pool. If you are that American who has bought, who is participating in this individual market but has a chronic condition, you never do a traditional risk pool today because what we learned from the data over the last 30, 40 years of risk pools, there have been a couple successes, but most risk pools, hey, the cost goes up, you hit that sort of threshold, and you dump that person, saying: Hey, you are now the risk pool’s problem, or you are the State’s problem. We wanted a continuity of care. We wanted the sick person to receive services where the medical provider, the insurer, and the patient themselves all have skin in the game. They all have a need to participate, to manage, whether it be the individual’s diabetes or some other ailments. That is the beauty of sort of this risksharing model, that for the population that is our sickest brothers and sisters, as their cost graduates up, there will be participation from this risksharing pool. Why is this absolutely fair? Remember how we talked about how most Americans receive their health care in the employer market? Well, your employer gets a fairly substantial tax deduction for providing that health care. They get to take it off their taxes. Well, we don’t do that for when you are in that individual market. When you are in that individual market, for you to be able to take it off your taxes, so we have tried to come up with this methodology to make it fair, so we have come up with this tax credit. But we want you to have the money to help purchase your policy in the beginning, so there is this whole term, sort of this madeup new language that says a prefundable tax credit so you can buy your health insurance in that individual market. So that is on the front end. On the back end, to make sure the premiums, what we call premium efficiency, have stayed low and affordable, we are actually doing this risk sharing up here to help mitigate that spiking of cost so we can lower the prices for everyone so we maximize participation. There is some elegance in the math, and I think actually there is a great 
love for our brothers and sisters who have preexisting conditions up here because it is an invisible risk pool. They never know whether their cost is being subsidized by this pool, nor should they. We made a societal decision 30 years ago that someone walks into an emergency room, someone walks into a hospital with a condition, they get services, so the cost is already in the population. What we have been debating now for years is how do we pay, how do we move the chairs around? But if we are going to get efficiency in lowering premiums for everyone, remember, we need our healthy population over here to participate in this, and then there is a couple other things we are going to talk about. So functionally what we have done with the risk sharing, it actually accomplishes a couple really great things. One is the obvious part, if you are the insurer, and let’s say you are the actuary at the insurer, and you are doing your math, you actually know what your risk exposure is on each life. Why that is important is you don’t have to build what is often referred to as a shock absorber in your rates, saying: Dear heaven, what happens if tomorrow I get a handful of folks with a very difficult chronic condition that blows the cost off the charts? I have to build cushion into my rates. Well, with the risksharing model, they no longer have to have the rates padded for that externality that might happen. It becomes this multiplier effect where if I don’t have to put that in the rates, I have lower costs over here. If I have lower costs over here, the model says I get a lot more participation in the health care pool, and everyone benefits. That is what we are trying here. So what do you actually do, if the argument I am making, whether it be the ACA, whether it be our replacement, in many ways what we are discussing is how to pay for the health care that is already in our society. Remember, as we have been talking, there is no such thing, if you are going to be completely honest, as a preexisting condition denying you coverage. There are some cost stratas, but that is in the current ObamaCare ACA, just as in our replacement, but some of that is by age or if you smoke or other things. How do you actually lower costs? Some of that comes in the next piece of legislation because, as you all know, in the bill we are trying to move now, we have to deal with the rules of we have no one on the left in the Senate who is going to work with us. We are on our own. So we have to find a way to do this with 52 votes in the Senate. We don’t have eight Democrats who are going to work with us. That means we have to do it through reconciliation. Probably those of you who are interested in this stuff, you have read how reconciliation limits the things we can put into a piece of legislation. If you would like us to have more things, go find us eight votes on the Democratic side in the U.S. Senate. So what do you do to lower costs? We all know information. How many of you can grab your supercomputer you carry in your pocket right now, log into the hospital surgery center—your doctor—and immediately hit a button and say, Hey, the retina detachment, the cataract, the kidney problems I have, here is my cost for the services, here is my cost for the procedure? We need information. That is going to come, I believe, later this year. The next thing is, with that information, you create competition. That is incredibly important. Competition in health care comes as much from the price as it does the quality. We have done some great things in collecting quality data. With quality data and price information, we are hoping there becomes now this incentive to actually compare and move around. But what is the next revolution? I am going to make you the argument—and this is one of the elegant things I believe that is also now happening on the Medicaid side of our piece of legislation, and that is to allow creativity at our State levels. Arizona may have one of the most creative Medicaid systems, we call it AHCCCS in Arizona. We buy functionally capitated HMO policies for our indigent population. But every time we want to make a change, every time we want to try something new to service our brothers and sisters in Arizona, we have to march over to the Federal Government and get a waiver. We have to get permission from the Federal Government. Well, here is my question to you: Does a poor person—as a matter of fact, anyone, if you are in the individual market, if you are on Medicare, Medicaid, do you have the right to talk to your primary care physician on this? Of course you do. Do you have the right to wear the sensor on your body that helps you manage your high blood pressure? How about this contact lens that is going to be out probably next year that will actually sit in your eye and manage your blood glucose? No more punching a hole in your finger and doing a blood test to check for your blood sugars, your blood glucose. It will be constant, talking to your phone, talking to your pump. If that keeps some of our brothers and sisters with diabetes from crashing, it is great for all of us. It is great for society. It is great for them. It is great for healthcare costs. There is a revolution coming technologywise. One of the things I found fascinating is they actually have a little thing now where you can put your fingers on it and it does a full EKG. There is disruptive technology that is now available and is rolling out. How many of us now wear a Fitbit that helps you manage parts of your health care? This right here is about to bring a revolution in health care. A simple example, just a thought experiment for anyone who actually cares about these things: In Arizona, the majority of babies are born in our Medicaid system. Even my little girl who we adopted a year and a half ago, I believe she was born in my State’s Medicaid system. Most perfect little girl ever. We know we have a problem in this country and in Arizona, a substantial number of the moms don’t show up for their prenatal visits. When we have surveyed them, we get information back that says: It is hard waiting for the bus. It is hot out. DialaRide makes me wait. Why wouldn’t you allow that poor person to hit a button on their phone and have ridesharing pick them up? There are solutions. If we could get our brothers and sisters on the right and the left here to actually talk to each other about solutions, but instead right now health care is such a potent political issue, I can show you article after article after article where the facts that are being disseminated to the American public are completely wrong. We heard some of that just minutes ago behind these microphones where the facts are absolutely made up. It is just incredibly cruel. Let me explain the cruelty. A couple weeks ago, we were doing just coffees with residents. A group of my constituents who are on the left brought a woman, and she has tears running down her face. She is standing in front of me wanting to know why we are about to take the health care away from her husband who is across the street in the hospital. How cruel does the left have to be to lie, to say something like that to someone because none of that was true. Our bill, their bill, that just can’t happen in the language that if you are already in the hospital, if you have a preexisting condition, these things are covered, whether it be from the right or the left’s language. But to manipulate someone who is already suffering like that, what sort of cruelty is in someone’s soul to get a political advantage to manipulate a wonderful woman who is already suffering with the difficulties of her husband in the hospital? I beg of you, whether you be on the right or the left, actually read the amendments, actually read the language, understand what reality is, understand we live in a society now where all preexisting conditions have coverage. We already live under a law that has age brackets, if you smoke, variances, but very small variances. Even in the latest amendments, the discussion is, if your State wanted to do a statewide prenatal program, or my State where we have a disproportionate share of our population with diabetes, particularly with my NativeAmerican population, if my State wanted to get everyone together, whether it be Indian Health Service, the VA, private insurers, our Medicare, Medicaid system wanted to try to put together a statewide program to reach out to our brothers and sisters with diabetes, that 
would be—if the actuaries and the math works—maybe wonderful. That would be an occasion where my State would reach over to the HHS Director and say: Can we have a waiver? We no longer need to have this type of coverage mandated in these individual policies because we are going to do it at the statewide level. I beg of you, think creatively. How do we cover our brothers and sisters? How do we deal with the reality that a huge number of our population right now is choosing not to buy because of price or have been able to receive waivers substantially because of price? b1730 And if we succeed here at driving the price down by our actuarial efficiency, the risk sharing up here, and spreading out, a couple of years from now, we are going to be standing behind these microphones and saying math won out over hyperbolic rhetoric. So can we talk about a couple of other things that are really, really important? I am blessed to be on the Ways and Means Committee. So why is tax reform so incredibly important to all of us? Understand, those of you who want to see Medicare, those of you who want to see Social Security stay solvent, do you understand what is happening with economic growth and the pressures right now and what is going on? So this little pie chart up here is functioning 9 years from now. You have got to understand, in 9 years, only 22 percent of the spending will be what we call discretionary, stuff I really get to vote on, stuff that is not in the formula. Eleven percent will be nondefense. Everything you sort of think of as government—the Park Service, FDA, Education—those things where moneys come to the Federal Government that go to these things is only going to be 11 percent of our spending. Another 11 percent will be defense. Everything else is either Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, or some of the other unearned entitlement programs. This is substantial because we are graying. You all heard of baby boomers. But the reality of it is, in less than 9 years, every dime of Federal revenues—and we are going to be taking in $1 trillion more. We are going to go from $4 trillion to $5 trillion of revenue. Every dime of Federal revenue will be consumed by what we call mandatory spending, entitlements. Military and every other part of government is going to exist on borrowed money. So if you are someone who really likes education, if you are someone who really thinks drug research is important, if you are someone who thinks NASA is important, if you are someone who thinks the parks are important, you should care about this. The reality of it is the math curve, even with a substantial growth in the economy, we are going to have to look at entitlement reform. And I know that sets people off because they are fearful, but it is a lot better than hiding from it. The thing that makes it less painful is a growing economy. Tax reform, we know, is the single greatest engine, the single greatest lever we have here as Members of Congress to get the economy growing. Fixing the healthcare issue will go a long way to help. Dealing with regulatory, dealing with immigration, dealing with embracing technology into our society and government can all be very powerful for economic growth, because our future does not have to be one buried in debt. But without a revolution in the way we think around here and a willingness to do tough things—and tax reform is going to be hard, but without it, you are basically sentencing my little 18 monthold girl to a future buried in debt, buried in slow growth. For those of you who may be my age, who are hoping to receive Medicare and Social Security, you are putting those programs at financial risk, and it doesn’t need to happen. We can fix this, but you have got to move it away from the hyperbolic politics and actually start to be willing to own a calculator and start looking at the math. Why this is so important, right here on this chart, is start to understand, as you get down here—remember, 2027 is functioning 9 years from now, and, actually, only 8 budget years from now. One more time, every dime is consumed by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, and the other handful of mandatory, what we call, entitlements. This is your future. It happens in less than a decade. It is here. Please, big, bold, dynamic tax reform is the first thing we can do this year, and then we are going to have to continue to move on to technology and everything else to sort of do whatever is necessary to get this economy growing. This one is a little more difficult, but we wanted to actually hold it up just so that there is an understanding of how fast we move from right now. Today, in 2017, about 7 percent of our total spending is interest. In a couple of decades, we start getting up to where it is 20 percent, a quarter of all of our spending. And this chart, think of this. In 9 years, interest is 19 percent of the budget. Okay. In 9 years, Medicare is 22 percent of our budget, of all of our spending; Social Security is 29. Just add that up. Think of that. Interest, Medicare, Social Security, the three of those start to consume the majority of this institution’s spending. And then you add in what we call mandatory spending, other entitlements, and you start to see, in 9 years, it consumes every dollar of tax revenues. That is really, really important to understand why we need to have this twophase approach. Right now we do everything that we can to maximize economic growth and opportunity. And when we talk about economic growth, this isn’t just for the top line, big corporations. We need that economic growth of those people that pay the FICA tax. Our brothers and sisters that pay Social Security, our brothers and sisters that pay the unemployment tax, our brothers and sisters that pay into Medicare, we need their jobs to pay more. We need more of them. We need them to have more options in the workplace. So this is a tax design of how you maximize economic growth not just for big corporations, but for everyone. That concept of: Remember when we were all in school, that sort of velocity of economic opportunity, that mobility? We have been stagnant for a decade. We must, must, must bring it back. And why these numbers become so difficult—and this chart is a little hard to understand at first. These are the predictions of what economic growth was going to be this year, to understand how much trouble we are really in. In 2013, the brilliant—excuse me. Yes, let’s just make fun of them. The economists around this town were saying: Hey, it is 2013; but by the time you hit 2017, all this stimulus, all this spending, all this debt, you are going to get a 4 percent GDP growth. You all saw what we had last quarter. What was it, 0.7? Now, honestly, first quarters the last couple of years have had a distortion, I think, in the seasonally adjusted numbers. But do you think we are going to hit 4 percent GDP this year? Because that is actually what a lot of the budgets were projected on. So sometimes we will be here in a debate with my brothers and sisters on the left, and they are holding up these charts saying: Well, it is 2013; we are going to be just fine over the next 10 years. And you get into those next 10 years, and you start to realize we are going to be lucky to hit 2 percent. So much of what we have shared with the American people in the previous decade, the numbers were blatantly wrong, and not to the good side, to a much more difficult side. So when we start to look at this chart—and, once again, 2026 isn’t that long from now— you start to realize we are going to be approaching $30 trillion of debt. Why this becomes incredibly important, once again, for all my Keynesian economists out there who think we should just go more into debt, spend and we will get stimulus, now we have built up so much debt that the ratcheting effect you get if you start to raise interest rates and half your debt needs to be refinanced within a 5year period—they call it a weighted daily average—all of a sudden any new revenues you may be getting from that Keynesian stimulus are being consumed by interest. Every day we wait to deal with this we lose options on how we can protect Medicare, on how we can protect Social 
Security, and on how we can protect our economic future. The sooner we do what is necessary in tax reform and all the other reforms and stop some of the crazy squabbling—I am sorry the left lost; well, actually, I am not, but I am sorry it hurt their feelings so much— and maybe come to the table and prove to the American people you actually care about them in a fashion where you are being honest with the math, hold up a calculator and demonstrate that we actually are going to do what is right. Back to the last part. We are going to do this slide over again because this is really important. Remember, we said part of this is just math. The economic growth. The part of our society that uses 50 percent of the healthcare dollars is 5 percent of our population. It is all fixable. So there are two themes here on the first parts of this. In health care, the expense, the cost is already in the system. Whether it be our reform, whether it be the ACA, whether it be before the ACA, the total cost is already there. What we have been working on are two things. How do you move the cost around so that we can actually lower the cost for that 50 percent that only uses 3 percent so they will actually participate in the insurance market, lowering everyone’s rate, instead of what is happening today where they just don’t participate? Remember, you saw the slide. 10.9 percent of the population is not buying health insurance today. They don’t have coverage. They are uninsured. Some of that is because of the cost; some of that is because of the waivers. The only way you get them in is that thing we call premium efficiency. We have got to drive down that cost. But if we do that, I am actually pretty optimistic good things are going to happen. Now, I want to actually take you to something that there really are bipartisan solutions. I am going to make you this argument that technology is the great optionality around this, it is the great unifying thing. I am going to walk you through something, and later I want you to tell me whether this is Republican, Democratic, right, or left. I am going to make the argument it is data. I live in Maricopa County, the fourth most populous county in the United States. It is what we call a nonattainment county. It means certain types of pollutants are in excess, and on occasion it spikes up. In the past, we would get a phone call from EPA saying: Hey, one of our monitors shut off. We think we are going to shut down your building permits. Well, remember how we were just talking about we live in a society where we must have economic growth if we are going to be able to finance and pay for our promises? So I came to you and said there is a much more elegant way to keep the air clean and actually have economic growth: reward those who are following the rules and catch those who are breaking the rules when it comes to polluting our air quality. And it is data. So right now, here is how we regulate. You want to open a business. Let’s say you want to do a powder coating business in Phoenix. You have to go out and get a bunch of permits from the county, from the State DEQ. You also submit to the EPA. Depending on the types of volatile organics and other things you are using, you may have to file reports every quarter. You have to do a major audit every year. Does filling up file cabinets full of paper make the air quality cleaner in your community? Seriously, because this is our regulatory model. We basically have a 1938 regulatory model where we make people fill out lots and lots of pieces of paper. We send them in. We hire lawyers and auditors, and we hire consultants to help us fill out this paper, and we shove it in file cabinets down at the air quality regulator or environmental quality regulator. Do full file cabinets make the air quality cleaner in your community? It is an absurd model when we are all walking around with supercomputers in our pocket. There is now technology coming on the market where you, through Bluetooth, through an actual plugin, you can actually be walking around with your own air quality monitoring system. Well, think about my community. If I could have a couple thousand people driving around, traveling around, walking around, hiking around my community getting air quality samples every 5 minutes, at the end of the week I have a couple hundred thousand data points. You put it up on a GIS map, and you catch those who are sinning. Think about it. It basically is a combination of crowdsourcing citizen science. And the tradeoff is don’t make that company fill out lots and lots of pieces of paper or that organization over here fill out lots and lots of pieces of paper and fill up a file cabinet, because if I have enough monitors and sensors moving around the community, if they screw up, you catch them instantly. It is not like today’s world where a couple of years later maybe an auditor catches them; you go to the file cabinet and use the file cabinet as a tool to sue them, but yet you have had 2 years of pollutants in your air. Let’s catch the bad guys immediately and leave the good guys alone. We can do that by this sort of crowdsource data model, the idea that the entire community gets to participate in the collecting of the data. You get to look on the GIS map. The air quality regulator gets to look and say: Hey, we have a hot point over here. Let’s go find out what it is. Hey, we found some clowns painting cars in the back of a lot. Are those clowns out there getting air quality permits to do it? The folks down the street that are using the filters and are in the booth, if they are following the rules, they get left alone, but you catch the ones that have been escaping. It is a use of crowdsource data. We actually have a whole video of this on our website. We now have introduced a piece of legislation that is over at Energy and Commerce. This should be a bipartisan piece of legislation because that Republican or Democrat—it uses data to let you know what is happening in the air quality in your community. It uses data to catch bad actors, and it uses data to let you know you can leave good actors alone so they can grow their businesses, so they can pay people more, so there are more job opportunities, instead of spending the money filling up file cabinets and hiring consultants. It is an elegant solution. b1745 Is that Republican or Democrat? I will make the argument it is data. There are solutions that both sides around here can use. So the next time you have someone getting behind these microphones and saying, well, we are deregulating this— no. It is time for a revolution in the way we think. We are all walking around with these. With the new sensors, you can manage your health care, you can test your water, you can test your soil, you can check the ambient sound, but you can also do the air quality in your community. I am going to make you an argument there are actually solutions moving around here, and if I can get beyond the hyperbolic rhetoric, maybe we can start to move some of these solutions forward. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I am here on behalf of the Progressive Caucus, which is the largest valuesbased caucus within the Democratic Party—74 members strong—who are helping to lead the legislative arm of the resistance in this country. We, every year, put forth a Progressive Caucus budget, which is really a statement of the values of the Progressive Caucus and the values of the American people. This year, this week, we released our budget. But before I talk about it, let me just take a step back. One of the things that people have asked us to do, asked so many of our Progressive Caucus members in this Congress to do, is to really fight and to lead the resistance here in Washington, D.C. And we are fighting many of the 
bad ideas that get proposed, from the idea of having a wall on the Mexican border to the terrible tax plan that is going to cost tens of millions of people access to health care, to a tax plan that is going to lower rates for the wealthiest in the country and leave the working class and those aspiring to be in the working class without any benefits. The cuts that the Trump administration has proposed in their budget, there is just so many bad things, day after day, sometimes hour after hour, in Washington, D.C., that happens. And it is the Congressional Progressive Caucus that is largely leading many of those fights, saying no to the bad ideas. But it is not enough to just say no. We also have to have a positive, progressive alternative so that the American people can see there is a true alternative. You don’t have to just go by the policies of this administration. You don’t have to go down the path that really leaves so many people out so that the top 1 or 2 percent can continue to benefit. And that is exactly what the Congressional Progressive Caucus is doing. So when we put forth a Congressional Progressive Caucus budget, it is a comprehensive budget that lays out the values of the American people from everything from education, to infrastructure, to health care, to our Nation’s security. It is a document that we use throughout the year to put forth positive, progressive ideas to show that there is an alternative. You don’t have to follow the ideas that have come forth from the Republican majority in this House and the President. Let me just start by talking about the Republican budget, the budget that Donald Trump has proposed in his skinny budget he released a while ago. He will be producing a more indepth budget, but he laid out the fundamental foundation of what his budget is going to look like. That budget is a budget that has no additional revenue. It has $54 billion of additional spending for the military, and because it has no additional revenue, it has cuts to almost every other program that we see, and these are deep cuts—20, 30 percent cuts—to all sorts of agencies. So let me share a little bit about what that budget looks like, and then I will offer the contrast of what the Congressional Progressive Caucus has put forward and why it means so much to have that budget in place. First of all, that $54 billion increase means you are going to have to have a lot of cuts to a lot of other areas in the budget, and let me just point a few of those out. One that means a lot to my district, and I represent the people of south central Wisconsin, but it means a lot to everyone across the country, is funding for the National Institutes of Health, NIH. That is the area where that funding goes to researchers across the country who are finding cures for diseases so that we can live longer, and better, and have healthier lives, and it is essential funding. That is so important that, in the last Congress, one of the few things we got done in a bipartisan way is, we did additional funding for the National Institutes of Health. Just today, in the Omnibus bill to get us through funding through September 30 of this year, we upped funding in a bipartisan way for the National Institutes of Health, because we, in a bipartisan way, value the work they do. In President Trump’s budget, there is a $6 billion cut—almost 20 percent of that budget—that would happen, threatening all sorts of research across the country. For the Department of Education, there is a 13 percent cut, but that is not just a 13 percent cut. That cut would be even deeper if you didn’t count the hundreds of millions of dollars put into taxpayer funds going into private schools. It would be more like an 18 or 19 percent cut, but it is huge cuts. Just in higher education alone, Pell grants—something that I was fortunate enough to have—I grew up in a lower middle class family, and I was fortunate enough to get loans, and work through college, and get some Pell grants to help me so I could attend college. There is a $4 billion cut just in that line item. So clearly, there is not the attention to education from the K– 12 level or higher education in that budget. Programs like Head Start and others are devastated in the preK level. So there are a lot of problems with President Trump’s budget for education. When you get to transportation, there is a 13 percent cut—$2.4 billion—everything from Amtrak, to dollars going to other rail programs and transit programs, investment programs that help people in rural areas, TIGER grants for highway projects, and more. In energy, we see the nonnuclear weapon portion of the energy budget, a cut by 18 percent below the current level, and that contains programs like LIHEAP that helps provide assistance to lowincome seniors in winter. Now, maybe a lowincome senior in winter in Arizona isn’t experiencing the same thing they are in Wisconsin, or Michigan, or Pennsylvania, or New York, or a lot of our States, but it gets cold. And sometimes those heating bills can really sock a senior who is on a limited income. That money is just vital to them being able to live in their homes. It completely cuts the Community Development Block Grant program. That is things like housing programs, Meals on Wheels. I had the good fortune of going around my district and delivering Meals on Wheels about a year ago to constituents one day. It is not just that you are providing a nourishing meal to seniors who often can’t get out of their homes, who this is the only place they may get that nourishing meal, but it is also a check in to make sure that they are all right. Some are still living by themselves, and often you don’t know if you don’t have that visit to be able to check in. It would cut programs like that completely from getting any Federal funds. At the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental programs, 50 programs would be eliminated, and 31.4 percent of their budget would be gutted for all sorts of things that protect our clean air and clean water—programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative or the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Initiative. So many areas would be cut through that funding, and that just doesn’t make any sense. This is a time that we have the Flint, Michigans of the world, and we are finding that more and more communities with aging infrastructure of their waterways are having lead in their water and other contaminants. This is not the time to be cutting a program that watches out for this by 31 percent; and on, and on. There are so many cuts that affect real people. So while maybe it is good for the defense contractors to get $54 billion because, trust me, that money is not going to be shared with the people who actually protect our country. I was talking to another Member of Congress recently whose son is in the military making $22,000 a year. I can guarantee you that $54 billion is not going to be targeted to truly improve what that person is doing, what they are getting paid as they fight for our country to protect our country, but it is going to go to a bunch of new weapons systems and other things that allow the money that, again, is going to go to that top 1 and 2 percent in this Nation. So let me offer what that contrasts. Instead of putting 54 billion new dollars into defense and cutting all of those programs I talked about by huge amounts—20, 30 percent, our State Department, 28 percent, go down the list, huge cuts—we actually invest in this country, and we invest in multiple levels. The People’s Budget: A Roadmap for the Resistance—that is what we call it—does a whole lot of different things. Let me just highlight some of what we put forward this week, along with 60 organizations, major organizations that are endorsing the efforts that we put forward. First of all, we have a $2 trillion investment in our Nation’s infrastructure; $2 trillion that is going into programs to modernize our roads and bridges; modernize our water and sewer systems, our ports and waterways; investing in our transit systems; investing in our K–12 school reconstruction; investing in highspeed broadband infrastructure that we need so desperately in our rural parts of the country; investing in the VA hospitals and extendedcare facilities; and investing in the actual workers who are going to do these projects. This alone is a $2 trillion investment, and, throughout this budget, it is estimated, by the Economic Policy Institute, would create 2.4 million new jobs 
in this country, good family supporting wages, while we are reinvesting in our Nation’s bridges, and roads, and schools, and broadband, and other infrastructure. That is a key part of what we have put out there, and it is what is needed in this country. We have to invest in our country, and this budget does just that. We also look at taxes in a very different way, and we rewrite the rules in a system that often seems rigged against the middle class and those aspiring to be in the middle class. We close loopholes for big corporations that send jobs overseas. We stop CEOs from receiving millions in tax free bonuses, and we tackle income and equality by having fair tax rates—fair for those who are working, and sharing a little more for those who are the wealthiest in this country. We level the playing field for the working families across this country. In this budget, we also have a new initiative to invest $1 trillion into childcare, childcare for everyone who needs it, preK education in this country. There is no question, we know more people are working more and working more jobs, but you can’t if you don’t have someone to watch your children when you are doing that. Having this in place will allow us to make sure that those crucial years in education that really develop you for often the rest of your educational experience—K–12 and higher education—we have a plan to truly invest in every single person so that no one is paying more than 10 percent of their income for childcare. It is not just that. We are funding K– 12 schools. We are funding that infrastructure for our schools. We are making sure that people who live in rural areas have broadband so they can do the homework that you do in a modern America. At the higher education level, we have several innovative ideas offered in our budget, from refinancing of student loans to the lowest current available rate so that you are not paying some of these high 6.6 percent interest rates that don’t even make sense in today’s economy, to providing for debtfree college; to make sure that if you actually work and you want to do a workstudy job, you should be able to leave a 4year public institution debt free, and leave with a degree, compared to the $30,000 plus on average that people are leaving with now. We also tackle some of the ideas about free tuition in public institutions. So we have got some real ideas from preK, to K–12, to higher education. We also make sure that we are addressing the costs of prescription drugs because that is one of the drivers as we have this debate around health care. One of the reasons we have seen the spikes we have had is because, quite honestly, a lot of prescription drug companies have charged prices that are quite unreasonable, by any reasonable person’s standards. There is no reason why the same drug you pay for in Canada or Ireland is substantially cheaper than it is in the United States. We have measures to make sure that we can reduce the price of prescription drugs here in this country and that people don’t have to make a decision between paying for their medicine or their groceries. We also are looking at health care in another way. First of all, the Affordable Care Act, as I think now many people across this country understand and now support the concept—while they may not have supported ObamaCare, they love the Affordable Care Act. Same thing, folks. What we are finding is, there are things we need to do to improve it. And while we look at some of those, one of those is allowing States to look at going to a singlepayer system, and we provide the pathway to do that, to reduce costs and increase coverage so that even more people can have that. We also expand access to mental health care—this is Mental Health Awareness Month in this country, and we are making sure we are doing that— and treatment for opioid addiction. We also have a humane and comprehensive immigration reform proposal. We are not talking about building walls at a time we should be talking about building bridges. Instead, we are having sensible plans that provide for full implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the DACA program. We preserve funding for sanctuary cities, and we prohibit any funding whatsoever to go to President Trump’s wall. b1800 Those are just a few of the things that we have in this budget. When you contrast those deep cuts to programs that help middle class families and those aspiring to be in the middle class across the country, when you contrast it with the proactive positive alternatives we have in this budget, I think people will see that there truly is a significant difference and why we don’t have to settle for something that is out there that is not going to take care of the working families in this country. You know, a lot of people across the country talk to our Members of Congress. We see these huge attendances right now at townhalls, and every Member should be out having those townhalls. And what we are hearing from people is that they are not happy with the proposals offered by the Trump administration and by the Republicans in Congress, the healthcare proposal that they put forward that we could be voting on as early as tomorrow—the second attempt at this. I will tell you, I have learned something very interesting. When someone doesn’t want to put their name on something, in this place especially, it is usually not very good. I have found people really like to put their name on things in this town. It’s funny that the Trump administration was calling their healthcare bill RyanCare, Congress is calling it TrumpCare, people back home call it I Don’t Care. In the end, what we are finding is this is a bill that is going to cut access to 24 million people, give tax breaks of $600 billionplus to the wealthiest in this country, the top 1 and 2 percent, to insurance companies, to Big Pharma, and other big entities. That is often what it seems like it is really about. It is going to increase fivefold. People will be paying five times as much— older Americans—for their health care, and it cuts Medicaid to so many people who need it in this country. Don’t forget, Medicaid is not just for people who are poor and trying to get health care and trying to get work; it is also people with disabilities, it is seniors in nursing homes. It is, quite honestly, incomprehensible that the Republicans think it is all right to cut those programs. That is their tax plan. But here is the best part: they are making it now even worse. The words we are hearing and that they are bragging about are amendments to make it so that, State by State, they can turn down things like coverage for preexisting conditions and turn down other essential health benefits, things like prescription drug care, maternal care, emergency room visits. That is what health care is all about. If you gut everything out of health care, all you have is a shell of what you can call health care but doesn’t actually provide any of the benefits. They are doing this to bring in the Tea Party, the most conservative element of their caucus that fundamentally doesn’t believe in the functioning of government. They are going to basically do that, make sure government doesn’t have any say in what health care is. You will have no guarantees. I guarantee with what they are doing—this is according to the official nonpartisan estimates by the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, not our estimates—at least 24 million people will lose care under the old proposal. Take the new proposal, and if you start adding the States being able to make those decisions, more and more people will lose access to their health care. We will see what happens, whether or not they can get this done. I think they are having a difficult time. When we had a little conversation on the floor about it today, we noticed they didn’t quite have answers about when the bill will come up. We will see what does happen with that. But when you contrast that sort of a healthcare proposal with the fundamentals that we have in the Progressive Caucus budget, you see a stark difference. We take and expand upon the progress of the Affordable Care Act that has allowed tens of millions of people to have access. When you look at the proposals that we put forward, there was an Economic 
Policy Institute article and a Washington Post article today that I will include in the RECORD . 
[From Economic Policy Institute, May 2, 2017] THEPEOPLE ’SBUDGET , NOTTRUMP ’SBUDGET , WILLHELPWORKING AMERICANS  (By Mark Pocan) After President Trump’s first 100 days in office, it’s clear that his promises to help the working class were little more than a campaign ploy. His dismantling of Obamaera regulations like the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule and deregulation of the financial industry reveal what he really cares about— lining the pockets of America’s ultrarich. Nothing demonstrates his disdain for working people more than his budget proposal. In it, he cuts 31 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s budget, which ensures people across the country have clean air and water, and 21 percent from Department of Labor programs that provide job training to seniors and disadvantaged youth. Instead of helping working people, Trump’s budget imposes a hiring freeze on crucial federal agencies and calls for many more staff to be laid off from public sector jobs—the largest reduction in the federal workforce since World War II. The FY 2018 People’s Budget: A Roadmap for the Resistance by the Congressional Progressive Caucus stands in stark contrast to Trump’s budget. The People’s Budget is a plan to actually help working Americans who have felt left behind by an economy rigged against them. Our budget is a roadmap for the resistance, investing in the progressive priorities and kitchen table issues that matter to real people: infrastructure to create jobs and ensure public safety; education to help our kids reach their full potential; and sustainable energy to protect our precious environment. Progressives in Congress fully want to make investments in our future generations and protect programs that improve the lives of people every day. We believe our budget should strengthen Social Security and Medicare and invest in job growth through infrastructure, education, and research and development, while responsibly reducing our deficits and cutting wasteful spending and redundant programs where they exist. As a business owner from Wisconsin and a longtime union member, I understand what it means to take the economic high road. It means ensuring that working people get a fair shake at economic opportunities, that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, and that we all do better, when we all do better. I urge President Trump and Republicans in Congress to seriously consider the proposals in the People’s Budget so that we can create a fairer economy. 
FORDEMOCRATS  (By James Downie) Out of power in Washington and around the country, Democrats are struggling with how to move forward as a party. Already the jockeying for the 2020 nomination has begun. What policies the party chooses to champion will be essential to how long or short the path will be to recovery. On Tuesday, the Congressional Progressive Caucus—led by Reps. Rau´l M. Grijalva (D–Ariz.) and Keith Ellison (D–Minn.)—released its annual ‘‘People’s Budget’’ for 2018. The CPC has produced a budget for years, but with the party at a crossroads, this edition may be the most important ever. Democrats should recognize its ideas as an inspiration for the party going forward. The People’s Budget starts by acknowledging a problem that most leaders acknowledge but few have addressed: the country’s crumbling infrastructure. It provides $2 trillion over 10 years to repair bridges and tunnels, revitalize mass transit, replace contaminated water systems, rebuild public schools and more. Furthermore, weak wage growth and other indicators demonstrate that the economy remains short of where it was before the Great Recession, and infrastructure investment can provide badly needed jobs that will help propel the economy to new heights. The Economic Policy Institute projects that the People’s Budget would add 2.4 million jobs and increase GDP by 2 percent in the near term. The CPC’s plan also addresses other crucial domestic issues. While Republicans struggle to reconcile repealing Obamacare with keeping health care affordable, the CPC puts forward actual ideas to bring the cost of health care down: The People’s Budget introduces a public option—which would lower premiums—and ends the ridiculous prohibition on Medicare negotiating drug prices. The document also recognizes the dangers of climate change, puffing a price on carbon and eliminating tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry. And it funds universal prekindergarten and strengthens antitrust enforcement, fighting back against the oligopolies in health care, cable and other industries that are hurting Americans’ pocketbooks. Finally, the People’s Budget invests in communities that need critical help. It ends funding cuts to programs such as Head Start and needsbased nutrition programs—cuts which disproportionately hurt women and people of color. It invests millions to help veterans find housing, jobs and health care. And it commits money toward fighting homelessness and funding affordable housing. With all this spending, people may wonder what happens to the national debt, but the People’s Budget reduces the debt as a percentage of GDP. In addition to the savings and the carbon pricing mentioned above, the budget raises trillions while making the tax system more fair. In addition to closing numerous loopholes for businesses and high earners, there are three major changes: restoring Clintonera tax rates for income above $250,000 and higher rates for income over $1 million, going after companies that defer tax by sending income overseas, and reintroducing a financial transaction tax (which the United States had from 1914 to 1966). All told, these three reforms raise nearly $5 trillion over l0 years. The People’s Budget has no chance of becoming law in a GOPcontrolled government. But this budget is a marker for Democrats aspiring to lead the party forward. The party is increasingly seen as out of touch, even by its own supporters. The People’s Budget by contrast is built around sound policies that are also politically popular. It reflects Americans’ longstanding desires for fixing the country’s infrastructure, strengthening entitlements, lowering the cost of health care and making the wealthiest pay their fair share. These ideas, if adopted, could be the foundation of a rebuilt and resurgent party, and by embracing the goals of the People’s Budget, Democrats can reorient toward the future. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to read a little bit from The Washington Post. ‘‘This new budget points the way forward for Democrats.’’ And what this specifically is addressing is the Progressive Caucus budget. It is looking at it and saying: ‘‘Democrats should recognize its ideas as an inspiration for the party going forward. ‘‘The People’s Budget starts by acknowledging a problem that most leaders acknowledge but few have addressed: the country’s crumbling infrastructure. It provides $2 trillion over 10 years to repair bridges and tunnels, revitalize mass transit, replace contaminated water systems, rebuild public schools and more.’’ And that is what we talked about. Those are the very provisions that we put forward in that $2 trillion investment in our infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, I will go back to reading this. ‘‘The Economic Policy Institute projects that the People’s Budget would add 2.4 million jobs and increase GDP by 2 percent in the near term.’’ That is 2.4 million people with a good familysupporting job while we are rebuilding our Nation’s infrastructure and increasing our Nation’s gross domestic product. What does that mean? I have been a smallbusiness owner for 29 years. It is the rising tide that lifts all boats. The more people that have money in their pockets that can spend it, puts money right back into the economy. If we make sure that more people are working and more people have a familysupporting wage that they can buy a sofa, they can take their family out to dinner or to a movie, that creates more economic activity, and that creates even more jobs. That is exactly what we need in this country. That is, again, the Economic Policy Institute projecting what our budget would do. Mr. Speaker, let me go back to the document. ‘‘While Republicans struggle to reconcile repealing ObamaCare with keeping health care affordable, the CPC puts forward actual ideas to bring the cost of health care down: The People’s Budget introduces a public option— which would lower premiums—and ends the ridiculous prohibition on Medicare negotiating drug prices.’’ Can you believe that? We don’t use our purchasing power right now to negotiate for cheaper prices for prescription drugs. There is a reason why we pay sometimes 8 more, 20 times more, than other countries for the exact same drug. It is because we are not allowed to use that purchasing power in a way that will help create that economic savings. Mr. Speaker, I will go back to the document. ‘‘The document also recognizes the dangers of climate change, putting a price on carbon and eliminating tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry.’’ Think about it. We still subsidize gas and oil, which is one of the most profitable businesses on the planet, and we are subsidizing them with tax subsidies. We get rid of those tax subsidies. 
Mr. Speaker, I will go back to the document. ‘‘And it funds universal prekindergarten and strengthens antitrust enforcement, fighting back against the oligopolies in health care, cable and other industries that are hurting Americans’ pocketbooks.’’ These are the things that we have in our Progressive Caucus budget to make sure that real families, as you are sitting at your kitchen table trying to decide if you can afford to pay your mortgage, send your kids to college, take a family vacation this year, maybe have that one luxury of a camper or a snowmobile, only if you live up north, or a boat. Those are the things that I grew up with. I grew up in Kenosha, Wisconsin, like I said, in a lower middle class family. That was the existence of most everyone I knew. We are trying to make sure that that can be the existence again for every single person. While wages have been largely flat, the economy has come back. We have just recently had a little bit of a bump in the last year or so of the Obama Presidency. We need to do more for those families. Mr. Speaker, let me go back to this document. ‘‘With all this spending, people may wonder what happens to the national debt. But the People’s Budget reduces the debt as a percentage of GDP. In addition to the savings and the carbon pricing mentioned above, the budget raises trillions while making the tax system more fair.’’ This budget actually reduces overall debt by $4 trillion between now and 2027. You don’t see that out of almost any other budget proposed. Yet our budget, while investing in America and investing in Americans, we also help to turn back that crushing debt that this country has so often had and that we need to address. Mr. Speaker, let me just finish with reading a little more of this document. ‘‘The People’s Budget, by contrast, is built around sound policies that are also politically popular. It reflects Americans’ longstanding desires for fixing the country’s infrastructure, strengthening entitlements, lowering the cost of health care, and making the wealthiest pay their fair share. These ideas, if adopted, could be the foundation of a rebuilt and resurgent party, and by embracing the goals of the People’s Budget, the Democrats can reorient toward the future.’’ Now, that is, again, an opinion out of The Washington Post today about the budget we released yesterday. I encourage people to go to the Progressive Caucus website to learn more about this budget, to look at the work that the Economic Policy Institute has done in working the numbers of this budget, and see what the contrast can be. You don’t have to settle for second or third best. We don’t just have to make sure the top 1 and 2 percent have even more, and we hope that some of that trickles down on the other 98 percent of us. Instead, we can have a budget that invests in infrastructure and creates good jobs, that invests in our public education system from preK to higher education. We can have a budget that expands our healthcare opportunities so that even more people can have affordable health care and helps lower the cost of prescription drugs. We can have a budget that does these things, and we have put that forward in the People’s Budget, which is the product of the Progressive Caucus here in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time to be on the floor of Congress to present this on behalf, again, of the 74 Members of the Progressive Caucus, the largest valuebased caucus within the Democratic Party. We are proud to present this budget. This should be coming to the floor as we debate all budgets in the coming months. But we are proud to put ours out first. Let’s set the standard. Let’s see how we can see what the Republicans in this House will put forward, and we will see what details the President puts forward. I can guarantee no one will have more in place for the middle class in this country and those aspiring to be in the middle class than the People’s Budget that is put forward by the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
