Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleague Congressman MIKETHOMP SON in recognition of Michael Dillabough, as he retires from the United States Army Corps of Engineers after a stellar 23year career. After graduating from California State University at Chico with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil Engineering, Michael Dillabough began his professional career as an officer with the U.S. Air Force in 1979. His early work included Logistics Analyst at Westinghouse Electrical Corporation and Senior Engineer and Technical Writer at Martin Marietta Aerospace at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1988 he began working for the United States Navy as the Facility Manager assigned to Mare Island Naval Shipyard. For 6 years he managed more than 550 facilities and 25 miles of roads. He then transferred to the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1994 and began his 23year career with the San Francisco District. Initially brought on to work with the Earthquake Preparedness Center of Expertise, he became the first Project Manager assigned to a remote site, Warm Springs Dam at Lake Sonoma in 2001. In 2003, he became responsible for the district’s Emergency Management Office, Dredge Material Management Office, Office of Technical Services and Natural Resource Management, two floodcontrol/watersupply projects, the Navigational Debris Removal Section, as well as management of the Warm Springs Fish Hatchery and the Bay Model Visitor Center. In 2003 Michael Dillabough deployed to Kuwait and Iraq where he served as Senior Project Manager for the Gulf Regional Engineering Office and as the Chief Engineer for the Humanitarian Operations Center. The same year, Michael Dillabough was promoted to the position he retires from today, Chief of the Operations and Readiness Division for the San Francisco District. Over the course of his career he has been recognized with the Meritorious Civilian Service Award, two Humanitarian Medals and the Air Force Commendation Medal. We have personally worked with Michael Dillabough and seen firsthand his outstanding dedication to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the public. His career is one of steadfast service to his country and is worthy of the highest distinction. Please join us in congratulating him on his retirement and expressing our deep appreciation for his outstanding contributions to our nation. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. JASON LEWIS 
Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, on June 13, 2017, during Roll Call Vote No. 306 on the passage of H.R. 2581, the Verify First Act, I was recorded as not voting. Although I was present on the floor at the time, my vote was misreported, and I fully intended to vote ‘‘Yes’’ on Roll Call Vote No. 306. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during Roll Call Vote No. 308 due to my spouse’s health situation in California. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘Nay’’ on H.R. 2579, Broader Options for Americans Act. 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, on behalf of the men and women who have served our country, I want to apologize that the majority excluded our Nation’s Veterans when they voted for Trumpcare. Make no mistake, Trumpcare, would disallow any veteran eligible for government healthcare from receiving a tax credit even if the veteran has an individual health plan. The majority had an opportunity to fix this but they chose to exclude Veterans so they could pass their bill through reconciliation. Veterans lost in the Majority’s procedural gimmicks. Today, they are trying to fix this mess but it simply isn’t enough. The underlying bill, Trumpcare, would only make health coverage less accessible and affordable for Veterans. Political expediency should never be used as an excuse to use Veterans as an afterthought. As others have mentioned, this bill is like adding new tires to a car you’re sending to the junkyard. This bill does nothing to improve the inadequate tax credits under Trumpcare for all Americans, nothing to eliminate the agetax in Trumpcare causing older Veterans to pay more, and nothing to protect Veterans when their state opts to waive essential health benefits or reinstate lifetime caps. The majority of House Republicans voted for Trumpcare, which caps and guts Medicaid by $800 billion. Trump proposes another $600 billion from Medicaid in his budget. Almost 2 million veterans and 660,000 veterans spouses rely on Medicaid for their health services. In my home state of Alabama, around 28,000 veterans are enrolled in Medicaid. According to a study by the Urban Institute, the rate of uninsured veterans fell by 42 percent between 2013 and 2015. States that expanded Medicaid saw a 34 percent increase in the number of Medicaid enrolled veterans, whereas states that declined the expansion saw a 3 percent increase. In Alabama, percent about 13,000 uninsured Veterans would have qualified for health coverage had the state expanded. The President and the majority aim to cut Medicaid in all states, and therefore cap coverage and benefits to hundreds of thousands of Veterans across this country. Recalcitrance didn’t work for Alabama and it will not work in the rest of the country. Now is the time to build on the progress the ACA made for our Veterans, not roll it back by dismantling coverage and access for millions of Veterans. Veterans deserve better than stale lip service. f 
COMMEMORATING FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS (DACA) INITIATIVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, five years ago, on June 15, 2012, President Obama signed the DACA initiative radically changing the lives of thousands of young immigrants by giving them the opportunity to earn degrees, legalize their status and be able to openly contribute their talents to make our country a better place. President Obama’s DACA allows thousands of young people the opportunity to dream of a better place, a safer home, and a brighter and more prosperous future. Immigrants in our nation are now under siege by a divisive and misguided political rhetoric that dehumanizes their immigrant experiences by relying on hateful stereotypes. As the DACA program and its beneficiaries come under attack, we must work together to responsibly reform our broken immigration system to ensure that families in immigrant communities can live in this nation freely and without fear. According to the Migration Policy Institute, over 68,000 people in Harris County benefit from the DACA initiative. DACA beneficiaries and immigrants live among us; they are our neighbors, our family members, our classmates, and our friends. Mr. Speaker, Houston is one of the most diverse cities in the nation and immigrants are essential to create Houston’s beautiful mosaic 
of diversity that makes it one of the most dynamic and vibrant cities in America. America is a land of opportunity for those who are willing to work hard and abide by the laws. We must assure that DACA beneficiaries continue to enjoy the opportunity to pursue their American dreams. We are a better country for doing so. 
Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Hitachi Automotive Systems Americas, Inc.’s Monroebased manufacturing facility on its 20th Anniversary. It is with a great sense of pride that I rise to celebrate its achievements and the positive contributions it has made to Georgia’s 10th Congressional District. Built in 1996, the plant has undergone three expansions over the years and employs a myriad of Georgia workers in the manufacturing industry. In 2014, Hitachi continued its commitment to the citizens of Georgia by approving the latest expansion, which increased its size to include 520,000 square feet of manufacturing space and doubled its workforce to provide more than 600 jobs in the 10th District. Monroe’s Hitachi facility remains extremely competitive and was named the 2014 Manufacturer of the Year for the State of Georgia for its commitment to manufacturing in education, community service, and economic growth. These achievements are a result of the partnership of several organizations working together to improve Georgia’s economy and workforce potential. I would further like to recognize Athens Technical College, which has joined with Hitachi Automotive Systems to create an internship program as part of Georgia’s Quick Start program, providing customized training programs to fill vital skilled labor positions necessary to employers like Hitachi. For these reasons, it is my honor to recognize Hitachi’s Monroe facility on the occasion of its 20th Anniversary as well as the partners that contribute to its continued success. Furthermore, I extend my personal appreciation to those who have joined in improving Georgia’s workforce to ensure that we succeed today and in the future. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to commend to the House the admirable service of former Congressman Clarence J. ‘‘Bud’’ Brown, Jr., on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday on June 18. Born in Columbus in 1927, Bud spent much of his youth in the Washington area, as his father, the late former Congressman Clarence J. Brown, Sr., represented Ohio’s Seventh Congressional District in the House from 1939 to 1965. A Navy veteran of World War II and the Korean War, Bud was a 1947 graduate of Duke University and a 1949 graduate of Harvard Business School. Bud succeeded his father in Congress in 1965, representing the people of the Seventh District with distinction until 1983. Following his House service, he was tapped by President Reagan to serve as the nation’s fifth Deputy Secretary of Commerce. He ably filled the role of Acting Secretary for several months following the 1987 death of Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge. From 1992 to 1999, Bud served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the United States Capitol Historical Society, a congressionally chartered nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the heritage and history of the Capitol. The Society honored him with its Freedom Award in 2000, created to recognize those who advance the understanding and appreciation of representative government. Throughout his life, Bud worked in various roles at the familyowned Brown Publishing Company, a vast nationwide network of local newspapers that was in business through 2010. Bud oversaw company operations from its headquarters in Urbana, Ohio, as President and later as Chairman of the Board for many years. Bud and his wife, Joyce, are the proud parents of four children: Cate, Clancy, Roy, and Beth. Beth died in 1964 at age seven after a threeyear battle with leukemia; Bud and Joyce established the Beth Brown Memorial Foundation in her name later that year. Foundation scholarships have helped hundreds of high school graduates from Champaign County study medical and related careers in college. Bud and Joyce have both been active in promoting the Cedar Bog Nature Preserve, a 450acre site south of Urbana that is considered a crown jewel of Ohio’s natural areas. They were instrumental in building the Preserve’s endowment fund and in making its new education center a reality. This Sunday in Urbana, Bud’s family and friends will gather at an open house in his honor. I look forward to joining so many other wellwishers on this occasion to thank Bud and Joyce for their years of selfless sacrifices. Mr. Speaker, Bud Brown has been a personal friend and mentor for many years who has made service to others the foundation of his life. We are grateful that good men like Bud commit their lives to public service and inspire others to follow in their footsteps. f 
Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a world leader for her tireless work in securing peace for their home country. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia has spent decades advocating for peace and democracy in Liberia. She is a role model for all those who believe world peace is achievable through public service. Throughout her career President Sirleaf has never been afraid to stand up and speak out for what she believed was best for Liberians. Her career in public service began in 1972 as an assistant minister of finance under President William Tolbert. She was forced to flee Liberia in 1980 after publicly speaking out against the government of Samuel Doe. She returned to Liberia in 1985 to seek public office only to be sentenced to ten years in prison for her comments criticizing the government. President Sirleaf watched from afar as Liberia was terrorized and almost destroyed through two violent civil wars. She advocated for Liberians to put down their weapons and come to a peaceful resolution to the conflicts that plagued the country. In 2005, President Sirleaf was elected by the citizens of Liberia to be the country’s 24th President, shattering the glass ceiling and becoming the first democratically elected female head of state in Africa. President Sirleaf has helped her country and its people recover from the unrest and violence that preceded her presidency. Her hard work and dedication has revived national hope by strengthening the institutions of national security and good governance, leading to the revitalization of infrastructure within the country along with the national economy. President Sirleaf’s persistence in transforming the image of Liberia has restored the country’s credibility and reputation on the global stage. In 2011, President Sirleaf, among others, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in advocating for peace, democracy and gender equality in Liberia. When the Norwegian Committee granted this prize, it was their hope President Sirleaf would help bring an end to the suppression of women, to realize the great potential for democracy, and to epitomize the peace that women can represent. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate President Sirleaf for working towards that goal, for her many accomplishments, and for being a pioneer in African politics. She is truly an inspiration to not just the women in Liberia, but to women around the world. Because of President Sirleaf, the world is stronger, smarter, more diverse, and more equal than it has ever been before, and the future of Liberia is forever brighter. f 
EXTENDING BEST WISHES TO CONGRESSMAN STEVE SCALISE WHO WAS WOUNDED IN THE MASS SHOOTING AT SIMPSON PARK IN ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish our colleague Congressman STEVE SCALISE a full and speedy recovery in the wake of this most recent act of senseless violence. Wednesday morning, June 14, 2017, a deranged assailant launched an unprovoked attack against several Members of Congress, who along with some staff members, were practicing at Simpson Park in Alexandria, Virginia for the 56th Annual Congressional Baseball Game, an event designed to build amity across the aisle and raise funds for charity. 
Among the five persons wounded was Congressman STEVE SCALISE , the Majority Whip, who sustained serious injuries and remains in critical condition. Our hearts and prayers are with Congressman SCALISE and his family. Our thanks and appreciation go to the first responders who rescued and treated the wounded, and the U.S. Capitol Police officers who subdued the shooter and neutralized the threat of this vicious attack. Mr. Speaker, the damage from this mass shooting would have been much greater if not for the heroism, courage, professionalism, and skill of the U.S. Capitol Police Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who swiftly responded to sound of gunshots and both of whom were struck and injured in the line of duty. Mr. Speaker, it is no exaggeration to say that political discourse is too charged, too inflammatory, too uncivil these days, and I urge all of us in positions of leadership and influence to exercise calm and restraint and to be mindful of the impact of our words and rhetoric on others. But we also cannot ignore that Wednesday’s attack constitutes the 154th mass shooting in our country since the beginning of the year, or that the too easy access to guns helps to make these terrible attacks possible. Today, however, is not the day to debate gun violence prevention policy, but the occasion to wish Congressman SCALISE a speedy recovery and a Happy Father’s Day: and to hope he will soon be reunited with his wonderful wife Jennifer and their two children, Madison and Harrison. 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Elena Boal—a remarkable young woman who, this year, received the 2017 Congressional Gold Medal. A resident of Princeton Junction, Ms. Boal has demonstrated an immeasurable passion for theater and the arts. A crew member for a number of theater productions, buildings sets, and working backstage on shows she has made it her mission to elevate the importance of arts in her own community. She continues to give back to youth that will become our nation’s future leaders by volunteering with the West WindsorPlainsboro Alliance for the prevention of alcoholism and drug abuse and through Urban Promise Trenton serves as a tutor at the Trenton Free Public Library. Her dedication to greater good, devotion to her local community and the improvement of the lives of those around her speak to her character and is to be admired While being a pillar of hope and progress for her community—Ms. Boal remained committed to being a wellrounded student athlete as a member of the lacrosse team and skilled sailor, successfully charting a course through the Chesapeake Bay. Beyond the Congressional Gold Medal Award program, extraordinary individuals like Ms. Boal exemplify the best and brightest of our nation’s future. As a resident of New Jersey’s 12th congressional district, I couldn’t be more proud of her for taking up such a difficult challenge and making a positive change for themselves and their community. Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in congratulating Ms. Boal on her amazing accomplishment. f 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to former Pennsylvania State Senator Frank A. Pecora, who passed away on June 12, 2017, at the age of 86. He was a dedicated public servant and a wonderful, warmhearted man. It was my privilege to know him, work with him, and call him a close friend for many, many years. Frank was born on August 8, 1930, in Pittsburgh to Frank L. and Elizabeth Cristillo Pecora. Frank attended Westinghouse High School and Robert Morris College. He obtained his licenses in insurance and real estate and worked in that field. He served as a Penn Hills Township Commissioner from 1971 to 1975. Frank was then elected as a CouncilmanatLarge in 1975 and reelected in 1977. Soon after I graduated from college, I was elected to serve on Borough Council in my home town of Swissvale. Not long after that, I met Frank, who was a councilman in neighboring Penn Hills and we really hit it off. We both shared a love for the game of golf and we would discuss local government and politics during the many rounds we played together. Frank told me he was considering running for the Pennsylvania State Senate and I was proud to join his campaign team. He was considered a heavy underdog, but his hard work and determination carried the day, and Frank was elected to serve the residents of the 44th District in the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1978. Frank asked me to join his team and I had the privilege to serve as his ChiefofStaff for 16 years. It was during that time that I came to really know and learn from this remarkable public servant whose life was dedicated to advocating for the little guy. Sometimes his votes put him at odds with his Senate Leadership, but Frank never flinched. He knew who he came to Harrisburg to represent, and it wasn’t the rich and powerful. Senator Pecora was likeable and approachable. He enjoyed meeting his constituents and learning about their families. When he entered a restaurant, he wouldn’t sit down at his table until he had spoken to every person who worked there. He knew their names, he made their concerns his concern, and he fought for them in Harrisburg. He was a man of integrity, compassion and unquestionable loyalty to his family, friends and constituents. In spite of a huge registration deficit, the residents of the 44th District reelected Frank 3 more times. In 1991, reapportionment moved his Allegheny/ Westmoreland district over 200 miles east to Chester County in the middle of his 4th term. Frank was no quitter however, he was determined to keep his seat and serve the people of Pennsylvania’s 44th Senate District, wherever its boundary lines were drawn. He rented an apartment in Chester County to serve his constituents, and when the Senate wasn’t in session, he and I would drive up to the new district and meet with people in the different communities. In 1992, Frank ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 18th District of Pennsylvania. He won a 12way Democratic primary, but he lost the general election. Frank continued serving his constituents in Chester County until his retirement from the State Senate at the end of his term in 1994. The only thing Frank loved more than serving his constituents was his family. He was proud of his two children, Frank and Barbara. His wife Barbara was his best friend, his ‘‘Bella Mia,’’ and they did everything together. They were married for 60 years and were sweethearts to the very end. Frank Pecora was a good man. I was proud to know him, learn from him, work for him and love him as a second father. I miss him and think of him often. He and his family will always be in my thoughts and prayers. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. However, had I been present, I would have voted yea on Roll Call No. 308. 
Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Mattatuck Drum Band, which this week commemorates the 250th Anniversary of its founding. This band is our nation’s oldest continuously active fife and drum band and is a celebrated institution of our Waterbury, Connecticut community. The Mattatuck Drum Band was founded in 1767, and over the past two and a half centuries, the band has been an invaluable group in supporting our country’s battles and preserving the heritage of our state and country. The band was first formed to play martial music for military training exercises in the towns of Farmington and Waterbury. The fifers and drummers were some of the earliest patriots to join the American Revolution in the spring of 1775, at a time when musicians and drummers were instrumental in maintaining order and routine for military camps. The band joined many parades in support of President Lincoln’s 1860 campaign, and then joined recruiting efforts to support the Union’s fight in the Civil War. Almost a century later during World War II, despite gas rationing and the deployment of many members, the band still turned out to play in parades to support our country’s service members and maintain solidarity during a difficult time for the country. Today, the dedicated members of the band keep musical tradition alive, and the band’s performances are an essential part of our community’s celebrations. 
Mr. Speaker, the Mattatuck Drum Band celebrates our history in Connecticut and America, and its dedicated musicians and leaders have preserved an important part of our community’s heritage for the past 250 years. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor the band and everyone who has ensured its preservation and success here today.
