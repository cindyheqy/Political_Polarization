Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, every day law enforcement officers around this country protect our families from harm and keep peace and promote the cause of justice. As a former first responder myself, I am proud to support these heroes, especially those who have paid the ultimate price to keep our families safe. National Police Week is a good reminder that we need to show support and appreciation to those who serve and protect us. We set aside this week each year to honor the call to service and profound commitment to duty embodied in our law enforcement officers—both in southern Illinois and across this Nation. I join with the grateful communities around the Nation to thank our officers and honor those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. We pray for them and we pray for their families as they watch over us. 
‘‘I AM JAZZ’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor for the second year in a row to read the book ‘‘I Am Jazz,’’ a children’s book about transgender youth cowritten by Jazz Jennings, pictured here, and Jessica Herthel. After an LGBT hate group forced a school to cancel a reading of this book 2 years ago, a movement was launched. Every year since, readings have been held across the country to increase understanding and to show young people that they are welcomed and loved. Last year I read this book from the House floor, and today I am proud to join this movement to read it again. ‘‘I Am Jazz.’’ For as long as I can remember, my favorite color has been pink. My second favorite color is silver, and my third favorite color is green. Here are some of the many other things I like to do: dancing, singing, backflips, drawing, soccer, swimming, makeup, and pretending I am a pop star. Most of all, I love mermaids. Sometimes I even wear a mermaid tail in the pool. My best friends are Samantha and Casey. We always have fun together. We like high heels and princess gowns or cartwheels and trampolines. But I am not exactly like Samantha and Casey. I have a girl brain but a boy body. This is called transgender. I was born this way. When I was very little and my mom would say, ‘‘You are such a good boy,’’ I would say, ‘‘No, Mama. Good girl.’’ At first my family was confused. They had always thought of me as a boy. As I got a little older, I hardly ever played with trucks or tools or superheroes, only princesses and mermaid costumes. My brothers told me this was girl stuff. I kept right on playing. My sister says I am always talking to her about my girl thoughts and my girl dreams and how one day I would be a beautiful lady. She would giggle and say, ‘‘You are a funny kid.’’ Sometimes my parents let me wear my sister’s dresses around the house, but whenever we went out, I had to put on my boy clothes again. That made me mad. Still, I never gave up trying to convince them. Pretending I was a boy felt like telling a lie. Then one amazing day, everything changed. Mom and Dad took me to meet a new doctor who asked me lots and lots of questions. Afterward, the doctor spoke to my parents, and I heard the word ‘‘transgender’’ for the very first time. That night at bedtime, my parents both hugged me and said, ‘‘We understand now. Be who you are. We love you no matter what.’’ This made me smile and smile and smile. Mom and Dad told me I could start wearing girl clothes to school and growing my hair long. Then they even let me change my name to Jazz. Being Jazz felt much more like being me. Mom said that being Jazz would make me different from the other kids at school, but that being different is okay. ‘‘What is important,’’ she said, ‘‘is that I am happy with who I am.’’ Being Jazz caused some of the people to be confused, too, like the teachers at school. At the beginning of the year, they wanted me to use the boys bathroom and play on the boys team in gym class, but that didn’t feel normal to me at all. I was so happy when the teachers changed their minds. I can’t imagine not playing on the same team as Casey and Samantha. Even today, there are kids who tease me or call me by a boy name or ignore me altogether. This makes me feel crummy. Then I remember that the kids who get to know me usually want to be my friend. They say I am one of the nicest girls at school. I don’t mind being different. Different is special. I think what matters most is what a person is like inside, and inside I am happy. I am having fun. I am proud. I am Jazz. A TRULY OUTSTANDING AGENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Stearns County Corrections Agent Jeremy Gallagher. Mr. Gallagher recently received the Outstanding Agent Award from the Minnesota Association of Community Corrections Act Counties. Jeremy received this award because of his work with victims of domestic violence. Jeremy has served as a corrections agent in Stearns County for 11 years, 4 of which have been spent as an agent in the county’s Domestic Violence Court. Being a corrections agent in domestic violence cases can be overwhelming, but not for Jeremy. He has embraced his role to aid and protect Minnesota families. Through his assignment, he has even discovered a passion for helping children overcome the trauma that domestic violence can bring. Jeremy Gallagher has gone above and beyond his role as a corrections agent. He is so deserving of this award, and he is the first Stearns County agent to receive it. I applaud Jeremy for his dedication to Minnesota families, and especially for his dedication to our children. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an outstanding college student in my district. Megan Hedstrom is currently in her senior year at St. Cloud State University. Megan has excelled in college as a student and as an athlete. She has a bright future. Recently, Megan won a Crystal Pillar Award from the Upper Midwest Emmy Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. She received the award for a piece called ‘‘True Grit’’ that Megan wrote, edited, and produced for the university’s television station. As if her Crystal Pillar Award was not enough, Megan also pitched a perfect game this spring, leading the St. Cloud Husky softball team to victory over the University of Mary. Megan excels in the classroom as well. Just this week she was named to the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Spring AllAcademic team, which requires a minimum 3.2 GPA or higher. Megan’s academic success, her success on the softball field, and her chosen career path, deserve recognition and celebration. Congratulations, Megan. We are proud to have students like you at St. Cloud State University. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Evan DuFresne and his teacher, Christopher Stewart, of the North Lakes Academy Charter School. Evan has recently been named a Normandy Scholar, and with this, Evan and Mr. Stewart have been chosen to attend the Normandy: Sacrifice 
for Freedom Albert H. Small Student and Teacher Institute. They will participate in this prominent program alongside 14 other student and teacher teams from across the United States. After coming up shy in last year’s application, Evan doubled down on his commitment to this project. He resigned from the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program after 5 dedicated years and even chose to delay his plans to join the Army National Guard. Thankfully, Evan’s perseverance and dedication appealed to this year’s judges. The Normandy Scholar Program allows student to learn about World War II at an indepth level by researching and telling the story of a fallen soldier from their hometown. b1015 The program also gives them the chance to pay their respects to this hero at the Normandy American Cemetery in Normandy, France. Congratulations to both Evan and Mr. Stewart for being chosen to participate, and thank you for telling the story of an American hero from the Greatest Generation who paid the ultimate sacrifice. We look forward to hearing more about your educational journey in the months to come. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand in support of a local veteran who is now the last surviving member of his World War II veterans club. Jean L. DeCurtins became the last member of his club when his lifelong friend Robert Kunshier passed away. Both were among the 180 men from the Stillwater area in Washington County, Minnesota, who joined the Minnesota National Guard’s 34th Infantry right before World War II. After the attacks on Pearl Harbor shook the Nation, DeCurtins and the rest of his unit deployed to Europe where they helped defend this Nation and the world. Jean was injured twice during the war and bravely returned to fight each time after recovery. He returned to Stillwater, Minnesota, in 1944. Many of his friends did not return. The survivors in the area formed the A&D Last Man’s Club, which was named after both companies the men belonged to during the war. Mr. Speaker, men like Jean DeCurtins, and those in the Last Man’s Club, bravely fought during World War II. They did so unselfishly and without reservation. We will never forget the courage and sacrifice they displayed during our Nation’s and the world’s darkest hour, and the world will always be thankful for them. 
WELCOMING A STRANGER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. CLARKE ) for 5 minutes. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, a few days ago, I received a letter from a third grade student at the Brooklyn Friends School and the Kane Street Synagogue Hebrew School named Elijah. Elijah wrote: At our synagogue, we learned that welcoming a stranger is an important mitzvah, and I know that my people were immigrants and sometimes refugees trying to find a new home in the USA. So it is important to me that we extend our welcome to refugees from Haiti. Elijah is right. The people of Haiti have suffered through numerous tragedies over the past few years alone. They have experienced a devastating and catastrophic earthquake, tragic cholera epidemic, ongoing food scarcity crisis, deadly hurricanes, and continued flooding. For these reasons, the Obama administration designated Haiti for temporary protected status in 2010, and redesignated it four times thereafter. However, Haiti’s TPS designation will expire in July if the administration does not act immediately. That is why I organized with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus and called for DHS Secretary John Kelly to redesignate Haiti for an additional 18 months of TPS. We also asked DHS to issue a new TPS designation that would include the tens of thousands of Haitians who are in the United States but are not covered by the existing TPS designation. The continuing humanitarian crisis on the ground in Haiti should make this an easy call. But news reports indicate that the acting head of USCIS, James McCament, is looking for evidence of crimes committed by Haitians to use as a pretext for ending Haiti’s TPS designation. Such actions are part of the Trump administration’s attempt to depict immigrants as criminals. They are also part of a flagrant effort to obscure the fact that TPS is based on the conditions on the ground in Haiti rather than the actions of some TPS beneficiaries here in the United States. I call on Director Kelly to ignore these misguided voices and instead listen to people like Elijah. Human decency demands that the Department of Homeland Security extend temporary protected status to all Haitians present in the United States prior to November 4, 2016, as the country continues to rebuild. f 
CONDEMNING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN CHECHNYA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned by the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in Chechnya where hundreds of gay or perceivedtobe gay men have been harassed, have been tortured, and have been killed by Chechen authorities. On April 1, a Russian independent newspaper first reported on this detention and disappearance of gay men, which the Chechen leader has continuously denied. You see, Mr. Speaker, the leader Ramzan refuses to acknowledge that gay men exist in Chechnya, but we know from many credible reports that the Chechen Government has allegedly put these men into camps, and it plans to eliminate its entire gay population by Ramadan, which is May 26. This is disheartening, to say the least, in an era where the world is moving toward tolerance and equality for all people. To hear about these atrocities being committed is very tragic. The United States should not and must not turn a blind eye to this unwarranted persecution. All individuals, no matter their sexual orientation, their gender identity, their religion, their race, or any other basis deserve the full enjoyment of their Godgiven rights. These are universal and are for all people to enjoy. In the wake of these events, I joined several of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in sending a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to take swift action and condemn these atrocities which run counter to American values of promoting human rights and freedom and that should guide strategic decisions that we make on U.S. foreign policy. I was glad to see that the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the Department of State spoke out against the practice of the Chechen authorities and called for the immediate release of the hundreds of detained men being held at these camps. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley must be congratulated, also. She condemned these abuses and raised the issue at the first U.N. Security Council meeting. I look forward to the continued collaboration of these agencies and with my colleagues because we must send a united and clear message that we are against all forms of discrimination and all forms of violence. Mr. Speaker, we must not forget that Putin has significant influence over what goes on in Chechnya, and, to date, Putin has done nothing to help. This is simply outrageous. From restrictions on political participation, to the suppression of civil society, to the silencing of religious minorities, to the prohibition of freedom of expression, Russia has a deplorable human rights record. Just over the last few years, the Russian Government has adopted laws that restrict free speech, that restrict free association of LGBT individuals, and Russian agencies threaten the removal of children from their rightful loving homes. Chechnya’s crackdown on the LGBT community, directed by government officials, it is very clear to see that these are not haphazard events. These are statesponsored violent activities. It is time for Putin to talk to his crony Ramzan and put an end to this barbaric gay purge. No government ought to be 
able to dictate how each person expresses their individuality, and no government ought to be able to use children as pawns to punish and intimidate others. I am committed to supporting LGBT individuals under siege in Chechnya, and through the combined efforts of wonderful organizations like the Council for Global Equality, Human Rights First, Human Rights Campaign, Freedom House, and so many NGOs in Russia, we will continue to raise the alarm about Chechnya and Russia’s declining human rights record and help find a safe haven to those facing persecution. Living in a free society and a truly blessed nation like ours, it reaffirms our moral obligation and our unique responsibility to speak for those who find themselves under the shadow of oppression and tyranny. Mr. Speaker, I am against any actions that undermine the human rights of any person, and, in the coming days, I will introduce a resolution that condemns these reports of violence and persecution in Chechnya. It calls on its officials to immediately stop the abduction, the detention, and the torture of individuals based on their sexual orientation. It is just unbelievable. It urges further our U.S. leadership to continue to condemn Chechnya’s ongoing human rights violations and demand the release of individuals wrongfully detained. We remain steadfast in our commitment to protect and promote the human rights and dignity of all people. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that our colleagues would join me in this worthy endeavor. 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to act together in a bipartisan fashion to improve the state of our Nation’s infrastructure. It is long overdue. This week is National Infrastructure Week where we recognize the challenges we face in addressing America’s transportation systems, its water systems, its ports, its harbors. Sadly, what we have to recognize isn’t particularly positive. This year, the infrastructure grade that we received from America’s Society of Civil Engineers, a national organization that is made up of some of the best and the brightest engineers in our country, gave our Nation a Dplus. That is not a good grade. Never has been. As a matter of fact, this same organization has estimated that, to rectify our Nation’s infrastructure, we need to invest over $1 trillion, $1 trillion of new investments, to provide the sort of transportation, water and ports and harbors, that our Nation needs and deserves. So we must do better than a Dplus. Literally, we are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents made a generation and two ago, and it is an aging infrastructure. We know from our country’s history that the infrastructure projects that move forward most effectively are those combined with local, State, and Federal funding; all the governments doing their part with private participation. We, in California, are no strangers to infrastructure problems caused by a lack of investment, but we are stepping up to the plate to make the necessary crucial improvements. In my own district, the counties that I represent, Merced, Madera, and Fresno Counties, have all increased their local sales tax in order to pay for crucial road repairs, new road projects, highways, and other essential transportation needs. Last month, the California legislature enacted legislation that Governor Brown signed into law to increase the State’s gas tax and vehicle fee to pay for roads, bridges, and other transportation improvement projects. Clearly, these are tough decisions, and they come with policy implications and political risks. I mean, let’s face it, it is never popular, whether it is your local, State, or Federal level, to raise taxes to pay for these muchneeded improvements, but it must be done. The last time we increased the gas tax nationally was 1994. In California, Governor Brown’s decision to pursue highspeed rail, among other efforts, is a longterm commitment in the 21st century to do what is necessary to create the inner city rail and auto and air transportation, the interconnectivity that comes with that. There is a reason why we must do this. California has 40 million people today. By the year 2030, it will have 50 million people; the sixth or seventh largest economy in the world. So why are we not doing this on a national level? It is simple. What is lacking is the political will—the political will to come together on a bipartisan basis. Now is the time for the Federal Government to face this challenge headon in a bipartisan fashion. And we know we can do this. b1030 Not only has the process begun in California, but many other States across the Nation have stepped up to the plate to put in resources to rebuild their infrastructure, and we must get serious about that. President Trump has made a proposal for infrastructure, and I think we need to ensure that that infrastructure proposal also includes water. Water is critical not just in California but in Western States and throughout the country. We need to significantly improve our water storage or water delivery and our drinking water systems. We have taken initial steps to meet these challenges by acting at the State and Federal level. In 2014, California passed Proposition 1, which authorized $7.12 billion for water infrastructure projects. Late last year, after hard work by many of my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion, the California delegation passed the Water Infrastructure Improvement Act, or the WIIN Act, that was signed by President Obama last December. This law authorized vital new water projects across the State, including, in the valley, additional storage at the New Exchequer Dam, and San Luis Reservoir in Merced County, as well as funding for water recycling projects like the North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program, and it will provide 50,000 acrefeet of additional water for both Merced and Stanislaus Counties. Although we have made some significant efforts to improve California’s water infrastructure, this first good step indicates that we must build upon that and do more at all levels of government. That is what we must do on a bipartisan level. Let’s take President Trump’s suggestion and make this a bipartisan effort. This is an opportunity to invest. f 
DC CENTRAL KITCHEN HELPS THE UNDERSERVED The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, I had the privilege of visiting the DC Central Kitchen, which is a nonprofit that fights hunger and poverty here in the Nation’s Capital. But it fights hunger differently. Yes, DC Central Kitchen feeds people who are hungry. It also offers the training, empowerment, and career opportunities that allow people to finally be free from hunger and poverty. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Nutrition of the Committee on Agriculture, this visit was especially important to me, and I am grateful that I could volunteer and tour the site with my colleague and subcommittee ranking member, Congressman JIMMCGOVERN. DC Central Kitchen is located in the basement of one of the Nation’s largest homeless shelters. It focuses its services on addressing the deeper issues that have plagued generations: hunger, homelessness, incarceration, and, ultimately, poverty. CEO Michael Curtin made it very clear that DC Central Kitchen isn’t merely offering handouts to those in need. He said, ‘‘You can’t feed your way out of poverty,’’ and I wholeheartedly agree with him. DC Central Kitchen puts as much emphasis on training those who come through its doors to prepare them to earn living wages as it does to provide meals to Washington’s marginalized citizens. 
People who receive services there truly do have a chance to escape poverty. They find employment right at DC Central Kitchen or in Washington’s hospitality industry. DC Central Kitchen is helping people find jobs that pay living wages and obtain lasting careers. In 1989, a nightclub manager named Robert Egger founded DC Central Kitchen. He was frustrated with his volunteer experiences at traditional charitable responses to help end hunger and homelessness. His idea was to create a ‘‘central kitchen’’ where wasted food could be turned into balanced meals for shelters and nonprofits and jobless adults could be trained in the culinary arts. Of course, the critics said it couldn’t be done. It was unwise. It was unsustainable. The concept was just not possible, they said. Well, they were wrong. And Robert was ahead of the curve and ahead of his time. DC Central Kitchen’s successes have been celebrated nationally. Its story has been featured in outlets ranging from National Geographic to The Washington Post to The Chronicle of Philanthropy and many more places. It works every day to transform food that would otherwise be wasted into nutritious meals for homeless shelters and nonprofits. It serves farmtoschool menus to lowincome schoolchildren, all while creating job opportunities for unemployed adults who have completed its culinary job training program. The numbers are clear. Last year, 91 individuals graduated from the program; 88 percent of them found good paying jobs. Fifty percent of last year’s graduates received a wage increase within 12 months of being on that job. DC Central Kitchen has also expanded access to healthy foods by making them available at corner stores in D.C.’s food deserts. Last year alone, it supported store owners in selling more than 207,000 units of affordable, healthy snacks and produce. Mr. Speaker, DC Central Kitchen is a shining example of what can be done to truly help the underserved in our communities all across this Nation. By giving individuals career training and job skills, it allows them to break the back of intergenerational poverty that has hindered the lives of so many. No one in America should go hungry. Everyone deserves a shot at living a full, healthy, and productive life. DC Central Kitchen shows us this is possible. Mr. Speaker, I offer my congratulations to the staff, to the volunteers, to the students, and to all those who had this vision with DC Central Kitchen. 
THANK YOU, LAW ENFORCEMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to praise law enforcement across the Nation and the State of Missouri for their dedication, courage, and sacrifice in serving our communities. This week is National Police Week. We should thank police every week, but this time of year provides a special opportunity to give honor where honor is due. Law enforcement officers deserve our deep appreciation and respect. Police officers do an excellent job protecting the residents of my district, from Columbia to Waynesville, to Warrensburg and throughout Missouri. They stand ready to help wherever needed. That is why, today, I am introducing the Police Officers Protecting Children Act. This bill would allow schools that want to allow retired or offduty law enforcement officers to be armed as a security measure to protect children in our schools. If a school wants to allow offduty or retired police to protect their students, the Federal Government shouldn’t stop them. The Police Officers Protecting Children Act is even more important for schools in our rural communities where law enforcement may take a significant amount of time to respond to an emergency. A wellplaced retired or offduty officer could save lives. Law enforcement in my district have shown their support for this bill because they know firsthand that police officers have the training and experience to protect our children when it counts. They have the trust of our communities and have years of experience carrying a weapon. I thank them for their service and their willingness to protect our children while they are at school. Law enforcement officers live out the honorable duo of bravery and service. They put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities, often without the thanks they deserve. They work day in and day out patrolling our neighborhoods, getting drugs off the streets, and protecting us from criminals who seek to do us harm. In Missouri, we honor the brave men and women who carry the badge as police officers. This National Police Week, I am glad to recognize those officers and their bravery and service protecting the people of Missouri. So to the police around the Nation and in my home State of Missouri, I say to you: Thank you for your service. You make a difference every day, and we are so grateful for you. f 
GROWING UP IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT FAMILY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give a very personal thanks to our men and women in uniform during this National Police Week. I was raised the son of the chief of police and the head of the fire department of El Dorado, Kansas, for some 25 years. In that time, he taught me discipline and values. He taught me there was right and there was wrong, that some things are black and white in the world, and my father represented what the law was in my community. Today, I celebrate this week with him and the men and women who served with him who gave me a deep respect for the rule of law and those who serve daily to uphold it. Certainly, I am the person I am today because of what my parents taught me, my family, and the community, and they still do to this day. I can remember growing up and the first day my dad brought home Rene, our trained police dog, and how that dog became part of our family, a very gentle dog until one morning, we were playing football in the backyard, and one of my friends tackled me. We watched that police dog climb a 6foot high fence to come to my rescue. I remember my dad pulling people from fires. I remember riding in the back of an old Jeep that was overhauled from an Army Reserve to fight prairie fires and grass fires, something I am sure that kids wouldn’t be allowed to do today. My dad took me to the firing range time and time again, and I would watch my dad shoot 25 rounds into a small circle the size of a quarter week after week, training to do his job right. I remember him getting called out to domestic disturbances and crime scenes. I remember him disarming people with weapons time and time again, putting his life on the line. But it is just not my family, Mr. Speaker. Families across the country have loved ones who serve our communities, States, and country. Earlier this week, President Trump gave a great message: ‘‘No one asked these selfless men and women to enlist in this righteous cause or to enroll as foot soldiers in the eternal struggle against crime and violence. They joined the cause because their hearts were big and full of amazing courage.’’ Mr. Speaker, I salute the men and women in uniform and thank them for their service. f 
MY RECENT TRAVEL TO AFGHANISTAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY) for 5 minutes. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer a report on my recent travels to Afghanistan, where our Armed Forces remain engaged at a critical front of the global war on terrorism. I have been a part of several congressional delegations to Afghanistan to survey conditions there, particularly as it concerns the progress being made by Afghan women and girls to attain equal rights. I was honored once again to lead a delegation of my colleagues to the region to conduct oversight of American operations and better inform our efforts here in Congress to fulfill 
our constitutional responsibility to fund and support our military. Mr. Speaker, it has been more than 15 years since American and allied forces invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban regime and stamp out the terrorist breeding ground it harbored. Many brave Americans have given their lives in the struggle to defeat the alQaida terrorist threat and protect our homeland. It is incumbent on us as a nation to honor their sacrifice by never allowing it to be in vain. So much has been given and, because of that, so much has been gained. There is no question in my mind that our country is safer and the world is freer because of the work our military has done and continues to do in Afghanistan. That is an important truth I am reminded of in a powerful way each time I visit Afghanistan, and I am compelled to share it with my colleagues here in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I have said for years that the test for our success in Afghanistan going forward is the preservation of the gains made by women and girls. Having observed the treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan over many years now, I can tell you that the progress today is as fragile as ever. There is good news. New laws criminalize violence toward women and offer them unprecedented legal protections. Girls are attending school and going to college. Women are working in government, serving in the military, in the police force, and even running for office. There is an Afghan Women’s Chamber of Commerce that specifically works to see that women are incorporated into the nation’s economic future. For American women like me who grew up with parents telling me I could achieve anything I wanted to, those kinds of things are commonplace. For Afghan women who grew up in a culture that has subjugated them to secondclass citizenship or worse, these activities are nothing short of extraordinary. Centuries of repression are being reversed, and a new generation of women that expects and demands basic rights is taking hold. During our visit, our delegation was honored to meet with the Afghan First Lady, Mrs. Ghani, and many other women leaders. We discussed the opportunities now available to Afghan women that weren’t conceivable 50 years ago under the Taliban, and most importantly they explained just how critical these gains are to the overall stability of Afghanistan. b1045 While it is certainly encouraging to listen to these remarkable stories of hope and progress, there exists a deep concern among Afghan women about seeing these important gains backslide and their rights erode. In fact, in some areas of the country, this is already happening. The Taliban’s resurgence amid the drawdown of coalition forces presents a major threat that we must acknowledge. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this to happen. We cannot allow the gains we have made in Afghanistan to fall by the wayside. We know all too well what can happen when radical oppressive ideologies are allowed to fester in hostile nations. Make no mistake: because freedom and fairness for Afghan women is essential to the security of our Nation, it is also crucial to our own. That is why I am pleased that President Trump is reviewing our strategy in Afghanistan, including a reevaluation of troop levels and our rules of engagement. Simply put, if we are going to be in Afghanistan, we need to be willing to do what it takes to succeed. Of course, the Afghan people must take the reins of their country’s future, but the United States will play a key role in ensuring a lasting peace. Right now I fear we have tied the hands of our military through reduced force strength and limited rules of engagement. We should never send our military men and women into harm’s way without the tools and resources they need to get the job done. Reevaluating our force strength and rules of engagement is the right decision, and I look forward to hearing from President Trump and Secretary Mattis as the NATO summit approaches. Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that Congress was able to deliver a comprehensive appropriations bill that properly funds our military. Funding the government by shortterm extensions takes away the Pentagon’s ability to plan for the future. With everything going on in the world right now, including the situation in Afghanistan, we cannot hinder our commanders with financial uncertainties. One of the reasons I was so eager to serve on defense appropriations was having the opportunity to reverse military cuts that made no sense. For the last several years, we have been in constant tension with the Obama administration, whose sequestration policy threatened to hollow out our military. But not anymore. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who joined me on the delegation. 
FLEXIBLE FLOW MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MARSHALL ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO) for 5 minutes. Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw the House’s attention today to the ongoing negotiations between New York City and the States of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, regarding the Flexible Flow Management Program. The current Flexible Flow Management Program, which governs New York City reservoir releases into the Delaware River Basin, expires at the end of this month on May 31. This interstate agreement is a critically important water management tool that helps mitigate downstream impacts of New York City’s reservoirs. In addition to supporting the water allocation goals, the Flexible Flow Management Plan helps control the flow of water downstream, decreasing the likelihood of catastrophic flooding events. The FFMP also provides critical support to the Delaware River freshwater trout fishery, which is an important part of the Catskill’s regional economy. Unfortunately, if the Flexible Flow Management Plan is allowed to expire, we jeopardize the safety and wellbeing of constituents along the entire length of the Delaware River. The progress that has been made towards finalizing the FFMP agreement cannot be lost due to a breakdown in communications among decree party members. I encourage all parties to return to the table from their respective States and agree to at least a 1year extension to allow the negotiation process to continue. Mr. Speaker, I call attention to this important issue because it greatly affects the lives and livelihoods of tens of thousands, indeed millions, of people in the entire Delaware River Valley and the Delaware River estuary, which covers New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the State of Delaware. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter I sent to the four States on May 11, 2017, on this important matter.

DEARMEMBERS : As Decree Party Members, I want to thank you all for being willing and active participants during Flexible Flow Management Plan (FFMP) negotiations over the last number of years. Your past willingness to engage with all stakeholders is admirable. Unfortunately, I am disheartened to hear that a finalized FFMP has yet to be established. Despite the recent breakdown in the conversation, I believe that it is not too late to continue collaborative negotiations toward a final agreement. With the deadline fast approaching, it is vitally important that all Decree Party Members return to the table to continue the dialogue. Incredible reforms and relationships have been established over the last decade; we cannot let these efforts go to waste. I understand that several proposals to improve basin management and releases have been suggested up to this point, and I urge all Decree Party Members to consider positive reforms, including: Thermal mitigation banks to provide support to coldwater fisheries during times of thermal stress in the Pepacton, Neversink, and Cannonsville ecosystems; 
Flood mitigation improvements that will decrease the risk of disastrous flooding events both above and below the dams; Continued evaluation of the impacts of fully utilizing the F.E. Walter Dam and reservoir. Regardless of the final changes to the FFMP, it is imperative that we not sacrifice the progress which has been made over the last number of years. All parties’ specific concerns and opinions have value, but we must accept that if we are not willing to negotiate and compromise we jeopardize the safety, wellbeing, and economic viability of all communities within the Delaware River Basin. I eagerly anticipate a finalized FFMP before the May 31 deadline. If a new FFMP cannot be negotiated within that time, a one year extension should be agreed upon. Reverting back to the 1980s reservoir management approach is unacceptable. I am more than willing to provide support as needed. Sincerely, JOHNJ. F ASO, Member of Congress, 19th Congressional District of New York. f 
WESTERN WALL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, President Trump will embark on his first international trip as our Commander in Chief. I am very pleased to see that one of the first countries our President will visit is Israel, a nation that is a cherished American ally and a beacon of freedom in a troubled region. This visit comes at an important time, as recent comments by an administration official created uncertainty as to whether the U.S. Government considers the Western Wall to be within Israeli territory. Located in the heart of Jerusalem’s Old City, the Western Wall is one of the holiest sites in the world and a place where millions have gathered to pray and seek the presence of God. Jewish tradition teaches that the Western Wall was an integral part of the Temple Mount and has been an important site in Judaism for more than 2,000 years. It is vital that the United States Government recognize the Western Wall as part of Israel and that the President should affirm that position during his upcoming trip. I am hopeful that recognizing the Western Wall will be part of a process to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
REPEALING THE DURBIN AMENDMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 minutes. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, right now we are having a fierce debate in the Republican Conference over the Durbin amendment, which is a price control on debit swipe fees. Retailers have claimed that the Durbin amendment is about competition. They have claimed that it is about restoring a broken market. They have claimed that Visa, MasterCard, and issuing banks are engaged in pricefixing on swipe fees. This is a key element of this debate. A vote to keep the Durbin amendment is a vote that rests on the idea that Members are sure that there is price fixing in the debit card market. There is $6 billion to $8 billion per year at play here, and the violation of a core freemarket principle, which is the notion that government should not be telling people what they can or can’t charge. My point would be that, if you do that, if you support that degree of command and control in the economy, you have got to be sure. And should we be sure? I go back to the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlaws pricefixing. This is a criminal law. Hundreds of people have been put in jail for it. You can go to jail for up to 10 years for violating it, and the law has stood for more than 100 years. Payment networks and retailers have been fighting over whether or not Visa, MasterCard, and issuing banks are violators of the Sherman Antitrust Act for 30 years. And one of the earlier rulings goes back to 1986. There is ongoing litigation now. In fact, there are more than 15 different cases out there on this. Litigation, I would add, that the retailers have never won when cases went to trial. In the major cases that we have managed to find, they are 0–3. They are actually in the middle of another big case right now. There was a settlement, and later a higher court set it aside. A sentence of that ruling reads: ‘‘Discovery included more than 400 depositions, 17 expert reports, 32 days of expert deposition testimony, and the production of over 80 million pages of documents.’’ Eighty million pages. I have studied this issue for months, and I have not read 80 million pages. I am a retailer, and I have paid thousands of dollars in swipe fees, so I know the difference between point of sale and Square mobile payments. I have used these systems, but I still don’t know. That is why I oppose the Durbin amendment: because I am not sure that this price control is necessary. Therefore, I put the Federal Government in the role of judge, jury, and executioner for the payment industry. For me to do that, I would have to be sure. I know that the government wasn’t sure when they came up with the regulation. They originally came up with 12 cents per transaction. Then the final rule finally came in at 24 cents. Were they right the first time? Were they wrong the second time? There is no way to know for sure. I guarantee you that when we walk down to this floor and we vote on this issue and choose to uphold a policy which many freemarket think tanks have said harms consumers, Members will not have read 80 million pages. If we are honest with ourselves, most will not have read 80 pages. There is no way we could, given everything that is in front of the Federal Government, even if we wanted to. Economist F.A. Hayek got at this in his criticism of the planned economy. He said that socialism doesn’t work because of what he called ‘‘the unavoidable imperfection of man’s knowledge.’’ Hayek was referring to human beings at large. I would offer that the knowledge of politicians—speaking for myself, in particular—must be that much more imperfect. You don’t have to believe that the banks are angels, and you don’t have to disbelieve the retailers to oppose the Durbin amendment. You just have to feel a bit of doubt either way. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Pastor Glen Berteau, The House Modesto, Modesto, California, offered the following prayer: God, Your Word says that unity and light extinguish darkness and chaos. We debate opinions while not recognizing that You are the answer. Behind me the words ‘‘In God We Trust’’ are not a suggestion. God, we have told You to leave, but come back to our schools, our businesses, our streets, our families, our government. I ask You to fill the political seats in America with Godfearing, Godfollowing leaders. I pray for our Nation to stop rising up in division against one another and instead kneel down and pray for one another. Instead of petitioning opinions and protest, we petition You in prayer. I pray for hate to dissipate from the heart of our society. Lord, You are our protection, our sustaining power. Protect our first responders. Protect our powerful military. Protect the citizens of this great Nation, and let us not forget that You are our national security. In Jesus’ name. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. 
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Florida (Mr. LAWSON ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. LAWSON of Florida led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING PASTOR GLEN BERTEAU The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor today to introduce to the House our guest chaplain, Glen Berteau of Modesto, California. Glen is the senior pastor of The House in Modesto, a church of more than 8,000. Supporting his community is a priority, and, under Glen’s leadership, The House Modesto has established programs to fight against human trafficking, provided groceries on a weekly basis to those in need, repaired bicycles for the homeless, and developed mobile medical and dental clinics that provide services free of charge. The House was also recently recognized by the city of Modesto for their annual event, Unity Matters, which honors law enforcement and first responders. Glen is originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and has called California his home for over 24 years. He and his wife, Deborah, have been in ministry for over 40 years, have been married for 42 years, and they have 3 children, 5 grandchildren. Glen is a gifted speaker, teacher, and evangelist and has ministered at conferences, churches, and conventions all over the world. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Pastor Glen Berteau. We thank him for offering today’s opening prayer in the United States House of Representatives. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week. I rise today to honor the brave men and women in blue who sacrifice their safety every day to keep our families and communities safe. Each day these Americans go to work willing to put their lives on the line for the security of their fellow Americans. We often hear the remarkable stories of our law enforcement officers. These men and women work long hours and late shifts, often being called into work and called away from their families. These are the people who risk their lives to protect our very neighborhoods, schools, communities, while asking nothing in return. These professionals exhibit the greatest love of all, and that is to offer their lives to protect another. I pray for those who have lost their lives, like Sergeant Greg Meagher, a 33 year veteran of the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office who lost his life earlier this year in the line of duty. We will never forget his ultimate sacrifice. Our safety depends on these amazing people, and I am proud to honor them here today. 
INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK (Mr. LAWSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this week is infrastructure week, and today I rise to highlight the need to update our country’s aging infrastructure system. This is a topic that is important in both the rural and urban areas of our country. From the highway system in Lake City, Florida, to the port needs of Jacksonville, we must put forth the necessary resources to update our transit needs. Each year, millions of tons of freight traffic, seaport cargo, and rail cargo pass through Jacksonville as they are transported to communities throughout our country. The Jacksonville Transportation Authority is building a 57mile bus rapid transit system, which is costeffective and will support hundreds, and potentially thousands, of new jobs. They are also overseeing the development of the Jacksonville Regional Transportation Center, a transportation hub that will consolidate major modes of public transportation, making transit more accessible and convenient. While that is all good news, there is still much work to be done to improve our infrastructure in north Florida. 
REMEMBERING ROXCY O’NEAL BOLTON (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to recognize the beloved memory of a dear friend, Roxcy O’Neal Bolton, who passed away the morning of May 17. Roxcy was born in Mississippi and later moved to Coral Gables, Florida, in my congressional district, where she spent the last 53 years of her rich and accomplished life. Roxcy became a champion for women everywhere. She was on the front lines fighting on behalf of abused women and created the first women’s rescue shelter and the first crime watch in Florida to help curb crime against women. Roxcy also established the first rape treatment center in the country located at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, which serves as the model for the creation of many other such centers across our Nation. It was Roxcy’s vision that helped establish The Women’s Park of Miami Dade County, which was later renamed after Roxcy. The passing of Roxcy O’Neal Bolton is a huge loss for those of us in south Florida; and, Mr. Speaker, it is a huge loss for women everywhere. We are comforted by her outstanding legacy, which will live forever. My prayers go out to her children, David, Bonnie, and Buddy, and to all of her loved ones during this most difficult time. Way to go, Roxcy. We are going to miss you forever, my friend. 
PROTECTING PERSONAL PRIVACY (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, for years now the NSA has been collecting phone and online communications from everyday Americans from all across the country, defying the rights and liberties granted to us under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. The 2008 FISA amendments, specifically section 702, has led to massive governmentled exploitation of personal privacy through the collection of American citizens’ emails. We need serious reforms that balance the protections of our civil liberties and rights through our Constitution and also keep the American people safe. The NSA recently announced that they would stop collecting our emails and electronic communications under section 702, but what is to say it wouldn’t start up again? That is why I am introducing legislation today to keep our country from backtracking on this progress. My bill will permanently codify this policy change and ban this privacyevading collection from taking place again. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and defending our civil liberties. f 
DROWNING PREVENTION MONTH (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of the two children who die every single day in the United States as a result of drowning. I want to recognize the Young Men’s Christian Association, the YMCA, for their efforts to empower youth with the imperative skills and knowledge to prevent these tragic accidents. Drowning is the number two cause of death for children ages 1 to 4, second only to birth defects. In Texas alone, 107 children lost their lives due to drowning last year. In 2017, we have already lost 14. Mr. Speaker, these statistics are absolutely unacceptable. Both in Texas and across the Nation, there is an opportunity and a need to save these young individuals. The YMCA is example of an organization that is changing the statistics for kids across the country. It is bringing swimming safety and drowning prevention to communities that historically could not obtain them before. It partners with local schools to transport kids to the Y for yearround swimming lessons. I am proud to say that the YMCA of Austin is one of many across the country implementing the Safety Around Water program. The program strives to reduce these incidences by going into overlooked communities to provide the necessary resources for kids who otherwise would not have access to these lifesaving skills. I applaud the Austin YMCA on its tireless efforts to save the lives of our children. In God we trust. 
PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise yet again to challenge you to put country before political party. For too long, candidate and now President Trump has been playing a game of dangerous liaisons with Vladimir Putin and his Russian regime. He called on Russian spies—that is right, the KGB—to hack his opponent. He fired the Acting Attorney General who warned him. He fired the FBI Director investigating him. And he has shared highly classified intelligence with Russia, posing a direct threat to our brave assets on the ground. When is enough enough? Mr. Speaker, how much longer before you do your job and bring up the bipartisan Protecting Our Democracy Act that is cosponsored by 199 Members of this House? Show us that you have the courage to put country before political party. Show us that you meant it when you said ‘‘against all enemies, foreign and domestic.’’ Show us that you will do what is right by our country and stand up to this President. f 
b1215 CLINTON HIGH SCHOOL HONORED AS A LEADER IN SOUTH CAROLINA (Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to congratulate Clinton High School in my home county of Laurens, South Carolina, for being named one of the Best High Schools by U.S. News & World Report’s school rankings. Congratulations to my friend Maureen Tiller, the teachers, the students, and the parents. This really is an honor that goes to all of you for all of your hard work that you put forth in educating the next generation of leaders in South Carolina. U.S. News compiled and analyzed data from over 22,000 public high schools, and Clinton High was recognized as a leader in South Carolina. I want you to know how proud I am of you for all that you have accomplished and wish you the best as you continue to work to educate our children. So congratulations, Principal Tiller, on getting this great recognition. Now, as a side note, both of my sons, Graham and John Philip, have graduated from Clinton High. My third son is currently a sophomore at Clinton High. He is also allregion and allState for the Red Devils boys soccer team. Congratulations to Parker and Clinton High. 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE LABORATORIES (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and recognize our Department of Defense laboratories. I am pleased to introduce a bipartisan resolution to designate May 18 as Department of Defense Laboratory Day 2017. Mr. Speaker, Defense labs have played a unique role in countless innovations that have enhanced and strengthened our national security. Defensesupported research and development has yielded many gamechanging stateoftheart weapons systems and technologies, ensuring that we never send our men and women in uniform into a fair fight. Our Defense labs also contribute to American economic growth by spurring 
the creation of new industries, companies, and jobs across the country, guaranteeing that America leads the way in cuttingedge science and technology. Mr. Speaker, in celebration of all the work and accomplishments of our national network of Defense laboratories, and most especially the incredibly talented scientists, researchers, and support staff who support them and staff them, please join me in honoring their contributions to our security. 
CHANCE FOR PEACE (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, President Eisenhower’s most famous speech was his farewell address in which he criticized the military industrial complex. However, 7 years earlier, in April of 1953, he gave a speech, entitled, ‘‘The Chance for Peace,’’ with these words: ‘‘Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. . . .’’ ‘‘The cost of one modern heavy bomber,’’ Eisenhower added, ‘‘is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. . . . We pay for a single fighter with a halfmillion bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . .’’ Eisenhower concluded: ‘‘This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense . . . it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.’’ President Eisenhower loved the military, but he hated war. He would never have gone along with a 16year war in a place like Afghanistan, especially since it is one mainly done for personal glory for generals and more money for defense contractors. 
TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I proudly represent North Carolina’s 12th Congressional District, leader in transportation and infrastructure. We have Norfolk Southern’s stateof theart intermodal yard connecting trucking, rail, and air to East Coast seaports. We are home to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport, eleventh busiest in the Nation, nearly 700 American Airlines flights departing daily. I–85, I–77, Route 21, and Highway 115 move our 800,000 residents and products from businesses like International Paper and CocaCola Consolidated. Our LYNX and rapid bus transit lines are making our cities greener. And as we say in Charlotte, we’ve got a lot. I am committed to ensuring we remain a national leader. I am hosting a regional transportation summit to help promote Route 21 and Highway 115 projects, continue developing our rapid transit systems, move our Red Line project forward, and to ensure that our airport can complete its new terminal and runway projects. We are ‘‘One Meck.’’ Transportation has made us an economic powerhouse and southern hub of cultural diversity. During National Infrastructure Week, I urge my colleagues to work to make greater investments in our Nation’s infrastructure. f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, as we have heard, this week is National Police Week. It is a time for us to honor the service of those officers who have fallen in the line of duty and to recognize those who serve and protect our communities day in and day out. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Paul Arnold of the Franklin, Tennessee, Police Department. Sergeant Arnold is a 26year Franklin Police veteran. In July of last year, for the third time, he faced a cancer diagnosis. Through each of these diagnoses, treatment, rehab, he has maintained one demand, and that is that it not affect the work that he is doing in the line of duty with the Franklin Police Department. Today, the police department is standing together as he is receiving the Theodore Roosevelt Association Police Award, which is given to an officer who has rendered outstanding and praiseworthy service to the department and the community despite a serious handicap, illness, or injury. His dedication to service is noted. It is appreciated. We honor him and congratulate him on a welldeserved honor and say thank you to all of the law enforcement community that chooses to protect and defend. 
CALLING FOR SPECIAL COUNSEL (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, on April 4 of this year, I, along with my colleagues TEDLIEU and K ATHLEEN  RICE, sent a letter to the Department of Justice asking that they appoint a special counsel to investigate any Trump campaign collusions with Russia. Yesterday, the Department of Justice took a step in the right direction by appointing former FBI Director Robert Mueller as the special counsel to oversee the Federal investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, including potential collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials. I have worked with Mr. Mueller at Justice and recognize his past accomplishments. His appointment speaks to the urgency of bringing some stability to this process so that Congress can get back to the business of working on what our constituents need most: issues affecting Virgin Islanders and the United States of America and the world; issues of jobs, infrastructure, education. Last week I introduced H.R. 2404, the Improving the Treatment of the U.S. Territories Under the Federal Health Programs Act of 2017, a bill to remove the existing inequities and disparities that territories face under Medicaid and Medicare, and also to provide us with a fair share of funding for our hospitals. Mr. Speaker, these are the types of issues Congress must begin to work on for the American people, and I ask my colleagues to continue to put people over politics. f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 2017 (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Police Week. It is a privilege to take the time this week to reflect, remember, and honor our Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who courageously defend American citizens and protect our communities. They selflessly put their lives on the line to ensure that this Nation is one of safety and order. On November 18, 2016, the reality of that danger hit home in Georgia’s First Congressional District. Deputy Commander Patrick Carothers, a 26year veteran of the U.S. Marshals Service and a resident of Long County, lost his life in the line of duty while serving a routine warrant. He left behind a loving wife and five children. This week the House will vote on H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act. With this bill, we can put a safeguard in place that works to protect our officers and their families from experiencing the same tragedy that took Commander Carothers’ life. Thank you to the hardworking men and women of law enforcement that work each day to keep us safe, and thank you to the family of Commander Carothers, who sacrificed his life in the name of public good. You are in our thoughts and prayers. 
WE NEED TO FIX OUR FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, you know, if there is an issue that has the opportunity to pull Congress together, it is the need to fix our failing infrastructure. You all know the statistics, but suffice it to say, if your child had the grade of our infrastructure, they would be going to summer school this summer. In my district in Colorado, it is the upgrades for Interstate 25 between Denver and Fort Collins for the tens of thousands of commuters each day; it is the backup from skier traffic returning from the mountains on Interstate 70, or our Northwest line commuter rail that is 35 years behind schedule. Of course, there are people who came within a hair’s breadth of missing their flight because of interstate traffic. What is happening to my district and my State is happening across the country. But it is not just roads and bridges we need to fix. To connect and improve our communities, the true definition of infrastructure includes investments in broadband, 21st century infrastructure, clean water systems, schools, public rail, pedestrian and bike paths, airports, energy efficiency, storage, and transmission to make our country stronger and reduce costs. Now is the time to act on an infrastructure package that has true investment. It can’t just be toll roads or a giveaway to Wall Street. A fully paid for infrastructure package will be a boon for the country, for our cities, for our towns, for our rural areas, and for the middle class. Infrastructure is a today problem that we can come together and solve. We need to act now and make infrastructure a priority. 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, May is National Foster Care Month and a time to recognize the more than 400,000 foster youth in America. During this month, we renew our commitment to ensuring that every child has a safe, loving family. I am a member of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth and continue to this day to have a foster brother that I grew up with. I know firsthand how a loving, supportive home can make all the difference in a young person’s life. Mr. Speaker, if we were able to bring together all these children into one city, this city would be the 43rd or the 44th largest city in the country. More than 200,000 children enter the foster care system every year, which translates to a child entering care every 2 minutes. Approximately 254,000 will leave foster care this year; nearly 128,000 will be reunified with their families; another 52,000 will find new loving families through adoption. Mr. Speaker, I thank every foster parent, volunteer, and mentor who works to make sure the needs of our children are not only being met, but they have the opportunity to thrive in a loving home. f 
b1230 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1039, PROBATION OFFICER PROTECTION ACT OF 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 324 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on House Resolution 324, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule forward on behalf of the Committee on Rules today. The rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 1039, the Probation Officer Protection Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit and makes in order an amendment by Congresswoman JACKSON LEEof Texas. On Tuesday, the Committee on Rules had the opportunity to hear from my fellow Committee on the Judiciary members: Mr. RATCLIFFE , Mr. CICILLINE , and Ms. J ACKSON LEE. H.R. 1039 was marked up by the Committee on the Judiciary on May 3 and favorably reported by the committee without amendment. Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that we debate this rule and the underlying bill this week during National Police Week. As the son of a Georgia State Trooper, it is an honor to come before this House to help advance legislation that protects the men and women of law enforcement. The dangers our law enforcement officers face are real, and I know too well the fear that a loved one might not come home after leaving for a routine shift. This week we had the opportunity to recognize those who make our communities safer, and we are humbled to advance the policies that support their efforts, and we honor their sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, allow me to point out that the sponsor of the underlying bill we are discussing, the Probation Officer Protection Act, is a former law enforcement officer himself. My friend DAVEREICHERT from Washington State is Sheriff REICHERT also, who led the task force responsible for solving the case of the infamous Green River serial killer. Along with him, I serve on the Policing Strategies Working Group, and I commend him for his work on the underlying legislation and his tireless advocacy on behalf of the heroes who wear the badge. The Probation Officer Protection Act is a commonsense, yet modest, expansion of the Federal probation officers’ existing arrest authority. Under current law, 18 U.S. Code section 111, it is a crime for a person to forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, or interfere with any Federal official in the performance of his or her official duties. While the Federal officials described by this statute include probation officers, probation officers are limited in their ability to take affirmative actions in order to protect themselves when they face these threats not from the offender but from third parties. Mr. Speaker, while probation officers can make arrests of those under their supervision, the first party, such as a parolee or individual serving a term of probation or supervised release, the law does not allow probation officers to take action to protect themselves should a third party impede or assault them. In fact, if a third party, such as a family member or friend of a parolee, threatens or attacks a probation officer, that officer’s only recourse is to retreat and call for local law enforcement. 
Think about that, Mr. Speaker. I want to read that again. If a third party, such as a family member or friend of a parolee, threatens or attacks a probation officer, that officer’s only recourse is to retreat and call for local law enforcement. Because the law has failed to equip probation officers with the authority to arrest an aggressive third party, probation officers have limited recourse when their safety is uncertain. Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable and even defies reason. When probation officers find themselves in a dangerous situation involving third parties, they are at the mercy of happenstance. Perhaps, in urban areas, other law enforcement agents may be in proximity and able to respond. Perhaps, at times, the brave men and women who oversee offenders on release may have access to the backup they need once a third party threat has been established. But I will tell you this, in these certain areas that may happen. But it is possible, though, that without the authority to deescalate or manage a dangerous situation without the necessary authority to arrest threatening third parties, probation officers will remain unnecessarily vulnerable to attacks, violence, or even death. In rural areas, like my district in northeast Georgia, a probation officer’s restricted authority to arrest could pose an even greater risk to their well being. Local law enforcement agencies in rural areas are often smaller and more separated from backup by distance. This means that probation officers who call for help could be subject to longer response times in the very moment they need the assistance the most. Considering these facts, Mr. Speaker, it is reasonable to make a narrow, yet important, adjustment to current law in order to ensure that the probation officers have thirdparty arrest authority when they are forcibly threatened by that third party. Simply put, probation officers enter dangerous situations for the benefit of our communities and should be able to effectively protect themselves and others. The Probation Officer Protection Act would address this flaw in current law by providing necessary recourse for probation officers. Under the terms of the bill, probation officers would have the authority to arrest hostile third parties who forcibly assault, resist, or otherwise impede a probation officer as they are carrying out their sworn duties. We have heard examples of probation officers making visits to those under supervision, only to be greeted by third parties who are wielding knives or baseball bats or yelling obscenities at the officers as they attempt to serve the larger community. In these events, probation officers should not be handicapped in their ability to perform their jobs while protecting their own safety. As we know all too well, situations with agitated third parties can escalate in an instant. Officers on site need to be equipped to deescalate dangerous situations for the good of the supervisee, the probation officer, and any bystanders. This legislation does not represent an unprecedented or largescale expansion of authority for probation officers. Probation officers already have limited arrest authority for firstparty offenders. They are also bound by formal search and seizure policy and arrest procedures. Probation officers receive training that instructs them in properly detaining offenders so that they will be equipped with the necessary skills to manage dangerous individuals in circumstances that might warrant it. Mr. Speaker, the intent behind the underlying bill is but one example of a larger effort behind much of the legislation we have seen on the floor this week. Every day, law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to protect us. Every day, they face dangerous situations for the sake of their neighbors. Law enforcement officers across the country bravely walk into uncertain situations prepared to protect and defend you and me and the people that we love. I believe that our Nation’s law enforcement—be they local, county, State, or Federal agents—overwhelmingly abide by their oath to protect and serve. In turn, we should remember their bravery and sacrifices each day and thank those who risk their lives to protect us. We must also thank the families who kiss their loved ones goodbye each morning, fully aware of the risk that their service entails. Our men and women in blue should experience our gratitude every day, but this week, during Police Week, it is right for us to take the extra care to commemorate those who have fallen and to honor those who are serving. As thousands of law enforcement professionals visit our Nation’s Capital this week, I encourage all of my colleagues to thank them for their service. Also, I ask that all of my colleagues in this body look at this commonsense piece of legislation and show their support by voting ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 1039, but first and foremost, I want to make sure that we recognize and honor the work and sacrifice that our police and first responders do each and every day. This week is National Police Week and, frankly, it is an opportunity to honor every week, but in particular this week, those who run toward the gunfire, those who run toward the building on fire every day. In my own district in Colorado, I hear so many countless stories of heroic acts and going above and beyond the call of duty by those on the front lines of keeping us safe. In one example in Colorado, Officer Ross Maynard responded to a domestic violence situation. The victim’s former boyfriend had broken a living room window in the middle of January, leaving the victim and her young daughter exposed to our record cold temperatures. Maynard went above and beyond his duty and covered the window to keep out the elements. He vacuumed the shattered glass from the floor when he found out the victim didn’t have a vacuum so that the child didn’t receive cuts from the glass. In example of heroism, dispatcher Sara Demgen calmly helped a man deliver his son when his wife went into labor and they realized they wouldn’t be able to make it to the hospital. It is individuals like these who we should celebrate and support through our work here in Congress. Unfortunately, the legislation we are considering today doesn’t make anyone safer, and if we passed it, it would bring about a constitutionally dubious process that could interfere with the important work of law enforcement professionals. Part of the reason this is problematic legislation is because the process this legislation followed—like a lot of stuff that we have to vote on—was not transparent and was not regular order. There was no hearing on this bill. Even if we look back at last year’s version of the bill, there was no hearing on that one, either. Then we look at the rule that we are debating now. Mr. Speaker, a rule means what is the process for amending this bill. What we have here is a shutting down of that process, where they didn’t provide an open rule. They allowed only one amendment as part of this bill that had been offered. There was no opportunity on the floor, through what is called an open rule, for Democrats or Republicans to offer good ideas to improve this legislation. Of the six amendments that were submitted that the Committee on Rules considered yesterday, five of them were killed by the Committee on Rules and not even allowed to be voted on or debated by the House of Representatives. Now, the number of times I have had to come to this floor and argue against a closed rule or a structured rule is exhausting, and it is contrary to Speaker RYAN’s promise that he made for the world to hear that he would bring us back to regular order and give everybody input on legislation that we consider in what is supposed to be the people’s House. This rule, yet again, is not open. It rules five of the six amendments out of order. The confidence and the trust in the House of Representatives, it is hard to imagine how it could even sink much lower, but it is restrictive processes and rules like this where neither Republicans or Democrats are allowed to even offer amendments or debate amendments to improve the legislation 
that have led to the record level of distrust in this body. In a moment, I will look forward to discussing the bill itself, but I just wanted to take this occasion in particular to celebrate our law enforcement professionals on National Police Week and every week. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate my colleague pointing out certain things. Again, I think pointing out the complete story there would also be helpful, and that is that the amendments spoken of that were not made in order, following the rules of the House, the Jefferson’s Manual, and all were not germane. The one amendment that was offered was made in order for this bill. The others were not germane. If they want to be brought up in a separate bill or separate order or find a bill that is actually germane to it, then that is a different issue, but not in this one. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, it seems that with each passing day, we learn more about the tangled web of conflicts of interest and secret meetings with Russians in and around the Trump campaign and Trump administration. Last week, President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey while he was overseeing the FBI’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian Government, after reportedly asking Director Comey personally to drop the investigation into former National Security Advisor Flynn’s ties to Russia. This week, we also learned that President Trump revealed highly classified information provided by an ally to Russian officials. Without President Trump’s tax returns, we have no way of knowing if he himself has financial ties or is financially beholden to Russia or Russian interests, as news reports have suggested. The American people deserve to know whether or not President Trump has conflicts of interest, financial interests, or business dealings with Russia or other foreign governments. It is imperative that we, as the people’s representatives, hold the executive branch fully accountable. Mr. Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative ESHOO ’s bill, H.R. 305, which would require Presidents and major party nominees for the Presidency to release their tax returns. If the President truly has nothing to hide, including business dealings or being economically beholden to Russia, he should freely release his tax returns to reassure the American people that they can have confidence that he is not acting out of conflict of interest but, rather, in our interest as a nation. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our important proposal, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ). Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that the House can vote on my bipartisan legislation, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act. Mr. Speaker, in the last week, the President fired the FBI Director who was investigating him. We then learned that the President also pressured the Director to end his investigation of Michael Flynn’s Russia entanglements. These revelations, added to so many others, make it abundantly clear that we must have disclosure of the President’s tax returns in order to fully understand his connections to Russia. The Presidential Tax Transparency Act would require this disclosure for the current President, all future Presidents, and Presidential nominees. b1245 This practice has never been required by law. But if there were ever a time for Congress to codify this bipartisan disclosure tradition, now is the time. The President’s behavior has raised questions since before the election about what connections or exposure he may have to Russian officials. After the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA concluded that Russia did, in fact, interfere in our national elections; after several of the President’s associates and staff lied about meetings with Russian officials during the campaign and transition; and after the FBI opened an investigation into these Russia contacts, the President still welcomed top Russian diplomats into the Oval Office for a closeddoor meeting last week. Holding the meeting itself raised many questions. But in the meeting, the President revealed highly classified, codeword information to the Russians. I believe that this is unprecedented. No President in the history of our country has ever done such a thing. And on May 16, The New York Times reported that the President pressed the former FBI Director Jim Comey to end his investigation of Michael Flynn’s ties to Russia before he fired him. This all begs the question: Why is the President so eager to please the Russians? The appointment of former FBI Director Mueller, a highly distinguished public servant, as special counsel is most welcome. But I believe that Congress can act today to provide public disclosure of the President’s tax returns, which would provide an immediate and important window into the President’s potential Russian entanglements, and answer the critical questions of: To whom does he owe money? And who is the President doing business with? What are those entities? We know there are 564 of them. The American people deserve to know. Only with full disclosure will we know the true sources of the President’s income, the holders of his debt, and the extent of any business ties to Russia and other foreign countries. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a highly serious, bipartisan—I want to stress that— bipartisan effort to exercise Congress’ constitutional duty to serve as a check and balance on the executive branch as a coequal branch of government. As the former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on May 14: 
Our institutions are under attack, both externally . . . and internally. 
I want to thank all of the cosponsors of this bill and, most especially, the Republicans who have had the courage to do so. It takes courage to have courage. Now is the time to stand up and demonstrate courage so that the American people will have confidence—confidence in what takes place here and to answer the questions that are left unanswered. So by defeating the previous question today and voting to approve the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, Congress can create a pathway to the facts, and then the truth, that the American people have a right to know. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ), the former Orlando police chief, and my good friend. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I have taken three oaths in my lifetime. The first oath I took was in 1984, as a police officer, when I was sworn in at the Orlando Police Department. The second oath I took when I was sworn in as the chief of police. And the third when I became a Member of the 115th Congress. Although different positions, each oath stated that I would protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Speaker, I want you to know that I have taken each oath very seriously. I know former FBI Director James Comey understood the enormity of the oath he took to uphold the Constitution to seek the truth, regardless of outside influences or political circumstances. His loyalty is to the United States Constitution. The American people should have faith that no one—that includes the President, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Deputy U.S. Attorney General—should be able to interfere with the proper functioning of the FBI or its work with local and State law enforcement agencies. It is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that all our law enforcement and intelligence agencies are able to fulfill their mission: to protect and defend the United States and enforce criminal laws as appropriate. 
I filed an amendment with the Rules Committee that would prohibit the removal of the FBI Director, except for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Mr. Speaker, this amendment would insulate the FBI’s mission from political influences and agendas. Unfortunately, it appears that the Republican leadership doesn’t think that this is a good idea, or simply does not want to have this debate. The rule reported from the Rules Committee prevents me from offering this important amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, if the FBI Director is abiding by the oath he took, then he should not be removed. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to remind everyone, as we have discussed here and we hear impassioned arguments for amendments that were not germane, find proper places to put amendments, and find bills that you want to write. That is all fair. That is in our rule book. But remember, the only germane amendment was made in order. I repeat, the only germane amendment was made in order. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As the gentleman knows, we grant necessary waivers for amendments all the time. It is a very routine thing. So to argue it is not germane, the Rules Committee can grant the necessary waivers for any of these amendments. And, frankly, these amendments are more germane to what the American people care about than the underlying bill. Mrs. DEMINGS ’ amendment that states that the Director of the FBI may only be removed for inefficiency or neglect of duty or misuse of office, what could be more germane to the concerns of the American people than that? All it would have taken was granting necessary waivers, as the Rules Committee does regularly on a number of bills when it suits their interests. Another amendment from Representative KENNEDY was rejected to reinstate the authority to appoint independent counsel for purposes of an independent investigation. One from Representative LAWRENCE  was rejected to reinstate the authority for independent counsel. Representative LIEUhad an amendment to reinstate the authority for independent counsel to investigate and was not allowed. Representative MOULTON had one. So all of those amendments, even though they are more germane than any of the other items of what the American people care about, were, nevertheless, not granted the necessary waivers to be included in this bill. The bill we are considering under this bill is highly problematic. It, frankly, serves to hurt the very people it purports to protect. I know we all value the safety of our first responders and the safety of our communities. This bill would hurt the relationship police have with communities without any need. It is truly a solution in search of a problem. This legislation would give Federal probation officers authority to arrest third parties, not the person that they are working with on probation, the ability to arrest them without a warrant. When referring to third parties, that means people who are not under the authority of the police officer. It could mean a mother of someone on probation, a roommate, somebody who shares a house, and somebody doesn’t want the probation officer to come into their room because the probation officer doesn’t have a warrant, even if the parolee is in a different room. We need to remember that an individual, of course, gives up some of their rights, including their Fourth Amendment rights, as a condition of probation. But not everybody who comes into contact with that person also should be required to give up their Fourth Amendment rights. The mother in this example has not given up those constitutional rights, which read: ‘‘The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause. . . .’’ And simply being a roommate or a family member of somebody who is on probation should not mean you lose your constitutional rights as an American citizen. If in this example the mother doesn’t want the probation officer to enter her room, she has that right, unlike the parolee. But this bill would change the dynamics and allow the probation officer to say she was interfering and arrest her, something that likely violates her Fourth Amendment protections and would be overturned by the courts. This would make family and friends of individuals entering probation from prison scared of allowing the person on probation to live in their homes. This could lead to increased recidivism and increased crime. It will create a huge hindrance to the probation system and the goal of successfully encouraging people to reenter society and avoid breaking the law. If people don’t have a family member or friend to live with, successful reentry becomes harder and almost impossible. We need to remember that probation officers are part of the judicial branch, but police are members of the executive branch. Not only does this legislation complicate that, but it is a violation of separation of powers. When an individual is granted probation, as a condition of that probation they give up certain rights, and that is understandable, and under the authority and supervision of the judicial branch in doing so. Third parties have not made that agreement with the judicial branch. They are not their jurisdiction. They are not adjudicated by the judicial branch. And probation officers should not have the authority to arrest them without a warrant provided by an officer of the peace. However, even if we don’t care about the constitutional rights of citizens, which I certainly hope we care about, we should care about the fact that this bill would reduce the safety of our probation officers. This legislation creates a very unsafe situation for our probation officers who are not trained in law enforcement. On average, a Federal probation officer completes six weeks of training. That is compared to 21 weeks of training and 3 weeks of field for a police officer. That is simply not the same level of training. With the disparity, doesn’t it make sense for probation officers to use the assistance of police when they actually do need to arrest an uncooperative third party or serve a warrant based on probable cause? With additional police powers come more likelihood people could be put in harm’s way, and that is the opposite of what we want for someone who doesn’t have the proper training. I also want to talk about why the bill is so bad. In many ways, I asked myself the question: What problem are we trying to solve? Even if we look at the associations that are pushing for this legislation, the data just doesn’t show that there is a need or that this would be a productive step towards either keeping our communities safer—and this bill would also put the lives of our probation officers at risk. In a letter earlier this year, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association stated that ‘‘formal arrests by probation officers are rare.’’ And 2015 data shows that, of the 987 searches conducted, only 30 uncooperative third parties, and even less arrests. With so few incidents, it is, frankly, better for probation officers to call or use the assistance of welltrained police officers, if needed. That is the answer. The proponents of this bill claim they have brought the bill forward at the request of our first responders. But the request was not even close to unanimous. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter signed by officers, chiefs of police, probation officers, and other first responders in opposition to the bill. 
MAY16, 2017. DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS : We are current or retired law enforcement officers concerned about public safety, constitutional policing practices, and building trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve. In light of Police Week, some Members of Congress have sponsored bills that would increase incarceration rates, enhance penalties for certain crimes, and, ultimately, weaken relationships between communities and police departments. 
The idea that ‘‘law and order’’ has declined in the previous decade does a disservice to the law enforcement officers who have taken oaths to protect and serve their local communities. Those officers deserve programs and policies that fund critical training, enhance important policing skills that improve officer and public safety, and offer technical assistance and operational support. We are deeply troubled by recent legislative and executive actions that support this divisive ‘‘law and order’’ rhetoric and that chip away at our hardfought efforts to sustain long term trust between our communities and law enforcement agencies. As officers who have handled highprofile incidents and routine investigations, we know that keys to success are strong leadership and morale, officer training and accountability, and community trust and engagement. Below, we offer several recommendations based upon these principles. Programs that support mental health services for officers. A number of law enforcement agencies are increasingly recognizing the importance of regular mental health checks, crisis hotlines, peer mentoring programs, and other mental health services to alleviate the stress and trauma that officers face. Policies and programs for deescalation and crisis intervention training. As a result of such training, law enforcement agencies learn to apply strategies that reduce the likelihood of forcerelated incidents. Deescalation training is essential to reducing the number of violent confrontations between law enforcement and communities, as well as increasing methods for age appropriate responses when interacting with youth to improve their safety and wellbeing in communities. These trainings promote best practices and, as a result, reduce the risk of injury to police officers and members of the community. Policies that promote crisis intervention training incorporating the services of mental health professionals. Such professionals can assist officers in identifying and responding to a person impacted by mental illness, an intoxicating substance, or emotional distress. The public safety benefits resulting from this training are welldocumented and broadly supported by policing and public safety experts. Programs that assist officers with understanding the effects of systemic trauma and better deal with the aftermath of trauma. Trauma sensitivity or trauma informed training can help officers identify individuals showing signs of trauma related behaviors, which may include: aggression; difficulty processing information; impulsiveness; heightened fight, flight, or freeze response; and hypersensitivity to noise or physical contact. Training can help law enforcement avoid interpreting such behaviors as requiring more aggression or use of force and, instead, guide officers to respond in a more informed and appropriate manner. Policies and programs that incorporate implicit bias training into police training at all levels. Implicit bias training helps police officers mitigate racial bias during community interactions, encourage respectful encounters, and promote constitutional policing with the goal of building trust with communities. Programs that collect data on deaths and useofforce incidents by law enforcement. Specifically, we encourage you to support the Federal Bureau of Investigation National UseofForce Data Collection Program, which expands the Uniform Crime Report Program to include use of force incidents by law enforcement resulting in serious bodily injury. The Death in Custody Reporting Act, which was signed into law in 2014, must also be properly implemented. Support the Collaborative Reform Initiative of the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. The Collaborative Reform Initiative is a valuable program that offers technical assistance and operational support to local police departments to improve policing practices, transparency, professionalism, accountability, community inclusion, and procedural fairness. The Collaborative Reform Initiative enables police departments— which participate on a voluntary basis—to sustain longterm, significant reforms in a manner that improves trust between police and communities and meets the public safety goals of residents. The work of DOJ’s Civil Rights Division around policing must also be supported and sustained. During Police Week, we urge you to prioritize federal programs, funding, and legislation that support the above polices, rather than legislation that would undercut partnerships with our local communities. We invite you to reach out to us about the above priorities and ask that you support legislation and funding that champion these important issues. Sincerely, Hassan Aden, Police Chief (Ret.), Greenville (NC) Police Department; Chief James Abbott, West Orange (NJ) Police Department; Officer Nick Bucci (Ret.), New Jersey State Police; Sheriff Jerry L. Clayton, Washtenaw County (MI) Sherriff’s Office; Captain James Davidsaver (Ret.), Lincoln (NE) Police Department; Deputy Chief Stephen Downing (Ret.), Los Angeles Police Department; Former Probation/Parole Officer and Corrections Counselor Shelley Fox Loken, Oregon; Major Neill Franklin (Ret.), Baltimore and Maryland State Police Department; Officer Brian Gaughan (Ret.), Davenport, Iowa and Chicago; Lieutenant Commander Diane Goldstein (Ret.), Redondo Beach Police Department.

Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, as they state, in part, in the letter: ‘‘We are deeply troubled by recent legislative and executive actions that support this divisive ‘law and order’ rhetoric and that chip away at our hardfought efforts to sustain longterm trust between our communities and law enforcement agencies.’’ This letter is signed by many current and former police chiefs, sheriffs, and other law enforcement officials. In the letter that I included in the RECORD , which will now appear for the world to see, law enforcement professionals say that instead of pushing forward with this bill that we are being asked to consider under a closed and restrictive rule, we should focus on mental health and trauma services for officers to support them, programs and policies for deescalation and crises intervention training, better staffing for our police agencies and probation officers, programs and policies that incorporate implicit bias training into police training and probation office training, and communityoriented policing. These are the types of policies that Democrats, and myself, would love to put forward during National Police Week to support our law enforcement professionals and to keep our communities safe. Why aren’t we focusing on those kinds of ideas, rather than a solution in search of a problem? It is National Police Week, and we should be supporting legislation that protects and supports our police, not create a greater schism between our community and police through an unconstitutional bill that puts the lives of our probation officers at risk, and will likely increase recidivism among those on probation. b1300 We can do better. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule and to vote ‘‘no’’ on the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time, and I appreciate the debate today. Also, I feel, in just a little bit of ways, I am sort of Alice in Wonderland here; what is up is down and what is down is up. I am not sure how you take this bill to, number one, say that probation officers would be any more in danger. I would also, Mr. Speaker, like to include in the RECORD another letter that is from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association in support of what is going on here. 
FEDERAL LAWENFORCEMENT  OFFICERS ASSOCIATION  Cabin John, MD, May 17, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. SPEAKER AND LEADER PELOSI : I am writing on behalf of the nearly 27,000 members of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association to advise you of our 
strong support for H.R. 1039, the ‘‘Probation Officer Protection Act,’’ and to express our appreciation for the Congress’s consideration of this important officer safety measure during National Police Week. FLEOA opposes the amendment that will be offered on the floor to sunset the authority provided by the bill, as you cannot put a stopwatch on critical law enforcement officer protection measures such as H.R. 1039. The ‘‘Probation Officer Protection Act’’ is a critical officer safety measure. At a time when U.S. Probation Officers have seen their workloads increase due to changes in sentencing policy and are being asked to ‘‘do more with the same,’’ ensuring that they have the means to protect themselves when placed in harm’s way is paramount. H.R. 1039 will fully authorize a U.S. Probation Officer to arrest any third party who violates 18 USC 111. This statute has been on the books since the 1940s and makes it a crime for any person to forcibly assault, resist, intimidate, or interfere with any federal officer in the performance of their official duties. Current law, however, only allows Probation Officers to make arrests of individuals on probation or under supervised release who violate 18 USC 111. This authority does not extend to ‘‘third parties,’’ which could include a former associate of the offender or an unidentified member of the community. In many instances third parties are well aware that a federal officer’s authority is limited to individuals on supervision, and when a third party does impede or assault a U.S. Probation Officer, the Officer’s only recourse is to retreat and call for local law enforcement. While in major cities local law enforcement may respond depending on availability, the same is not true for U.S. Probation Officers who work in rural communities where response by local law enforcement may be a single officer or none. This places Probation Officers at even greater risk, particularly in those situations where retreat is not even a reasonably safe alternative. During the forthcoming debate on this bill, there will undoubtedly be those who go to great lengths to demean U.S. Probation Officers as something less than ‘‘real’’ law enforcement officers or to diminish the hazards that they face. Some may also raise inchoate objections about the constitutionality of H.R. 1039. For example, you will hear that Congress cannot extend Executive Branch police powers to the Judicial Branch, despite the fact that it was Congress that established the U.S. Supreme Court Police that resides directly across the street from the U.S. Capitol. Not only are such statements factually inaccurate, they display a basic lack of understanding about those who serve our nation as U.S. Probation Officers and the purposes behind the ‘‘Probation Officer Protection Act.’’ Make no mistake: U.S. Probation Officers are fully trained federal law enforcement officers. They attend basic training at the National Training Academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Charleston, SC, and receive ongoing inservice training throughout the year. Their training covers everything from firearms regulation and safety and defensive tactics to handcuffing, the use of force, deescalation training, and realitybased scenario training. It may be difficult for some to acknowledge, but there is an inherent risk to the work U.S. Probation Officers do—a risk that often outweighs that of traditional law enforcement. They do not enter into sterile offices, but often into environments that are uncertain. They are required to have frequent and regular contacts in the home and community and knowingly come into daily contact with individuals who have a history of violence, mental health issues, problems with authority, and troubles with substance abuse. U.S. Probation Officers are not able to anticipate what is going to occur during all contacts. There are and have been occasions when U.S. Probation Officers are threatened and/or attacked by third parties and they need the ability to take an affirmative step to protect themselves. U.S. Probation Officers are a unique profession. They have a knowledge base in law and human behavior, and a mix of skills in investigation, communication, and analysis. They strive to make our communities safer, to make a positive difference in the lives of those they serve, and promote fairness in process and excellence in service. But as the volume of approved searches they must conduct has markedly increased over the past year due to changes in sentencing policy, the absence of any authority to restrain or direct the movements of third parties places U.S. Probation Officers at a greater and unnecessary risk of physical harm. H.R. 1039 provides a modest expansion of U.S. Probation Officers’ existing arrest authority to cover only violations of 18 USC 111. It does not in any way provide them ‘‘peace officer’’ status or grant them the same general arrest authority that statelevel probation officers enjoy in many jurisdictions. Granting U.S. Probation Officers the authority to arrest third parties would not change who they are and what they are seeking. Nor will it interfere with or otherwise diminish U.S. Probation Officers’ use of the deescalation techniques that are the hallmark of their profession. It would simply afford them another tool, another avenue, if ever needed. In the end, this legislation will enhance officer safety while also protecting probationers and third parties by preventing obstruction from escalating to actual violence. Thank you in advance for your consideration of this legislation and for helping U.S. Probation Officers do their job more safely by passing H.R. 1039, the ‘‘Probation Officer Protection Act.’’ Sincerely, NATHAN R. C ATURA , National President. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I think what is interesting here is I can’t really, frankly, understand sort of the shade, I guess, or the dismissiveness that is being thrown on probation officers and their lack of training, which is 6 weeks plus 40 hours additional, which is subject to their job. The evidence that was presented here, the example of the person not wanting a search, many times a probation officer will come with a search warrant that will allow them to search anywhere. But even in the case of the lady who did not want her room searched, the bill specifically says forcible impeding, which is already discussed and talked about in law. Also, any officer who witnesses a crime or is being attacked does not have to have a warrant to make an arrest. So, I mean, it is really interesting to me why we are discussing a bill and doing so in such a way for which there are actual instances where this takes place. My friend said, well, it only happens a very few times. My question for this, as a son of a State trooper, if his name was Leonard Collins and he was actually going to do this, I would say that one matters, even if it is the only one— lives of these probation officers, one. So why we are doing this, I am not really sure. Why we would oppose this, I am not really sure. You can make stretched arguments here, but when a probation officer goes in and, in the words of the bill, is forcibly intimidated, impeded, attacked, they can arrest the person there who they have already had training in how to arrest. I am not sure, Mr. Speaker, how you can make a good argument about that. You can try. There will be debate here in just a few minutes, which this rule gives, because I would encourage voting ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and voting ‘‘yes’’ on this rule. But there is also another issue that I do want to address. In this majority, since this majority has been in control, there has never been a waiver for germaneness on a floor amendment. Germaneness matters. So, again, find the proper place. As we go forward, as we look, at least in my time here, this is one of the simple, straightforward issues. You are protecting and giving a chance for those probation officers who encounter something that most in this body now, in our current jobs, maybe in previous, have not had to face. So the question for me today is simply this. It makes sense as a commonsense update. Support it. It enables them to carry out their job, protecting themselves. The underlying bill simply provides additional resources for probation officers to protect themselves while, at the same time, freeing up the demands of other law enforcement officers in the area. When we understand the commitment that they make, I do not understand making legal sidestep arguments of hypotheticals that may or may not exist to say we should not give them another tool in their toolbox. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
b1415 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ) at 2 o’clock and 15 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. This will be a 5minute vote. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 230, noes 184, not voting 16, as follows:

Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, due to an unavoidable conflict, I missed the following votes on May 18. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 263 and ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 264. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 115. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 323, I call up the bill (H.R. 115) to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide additional aggravating factors for the imposition of the death penalty based on the status of the victim, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 323, in lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of 
Rules Committee Print 115–17 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 115 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, Federal law provides a list of 16 aggravating factors a jury is required to consider when deciding whether a death sentence is warranted in a Federal capital case. These factors include whether the defendant acted in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner; whether the defendant engaged in substantial planning and premeditation; whether the victim was particularly vulnerable; and whether the victim was a high public official. High public official, as defined in the statute, includes a litany of highranking public persons from the President, to a foreign head of state, to a judge or law enforcement officer. Currently, however, the law only contains specific protections for Federal officers, not State and local officers. H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act, introduced by my colleague, Mr. BUCHANAN , amends Federal law to add the killing of a State or local law enforcement officer as an aggravating factor for a jury to determine during the sentencing phase of a trial, when the jury is considering whether a sentence of death is justified. This legislation enjoys widespread support in the law enforcement community. And, Mr. Speaker, we can all understand why. In recent years, police officers across our Nation have laid down their lives in the service of their communities, often with little recognition or support. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 17 police officers have already died as a result of gunfire this year. Most recently, 2 days ago, Deputy Sheriff Mason Moore of the Broadwater County, Montana, Sheriff’s Office was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop. We honor Deputy Moore’s sacrifice, which is a stark reminder of how a routine event can quickly turn fatal for an officer of the law. Now, Mr. Speaker, it is true that the scenarios where the provision in H.R. 115 applies may be limited. It is true that the vast majority of homicide cases are prosecuted in State courts. It is also true that the circumstances where a defendant killed a State or local law enforcement officer during the commission of a Federal capital offense are probably limited. But H.R. 115 is, nevertheless, vitally important in the scenarios where it will apply—for example, in many terrorism cases. My colleagues may not remember that the terrorist who bombed the Boston Marathon also murdered an MIT police officer during their flight from the law. H.R. 115 would also apply to situations where a State or local officer is killed serving as a member of a Federal task force. And it would cover volunteer first responders, who are, of course, authorized by law to carry out their duties. Mr. Speaker, this legislation sends a simple message: The stalking and killing of law enforcement officers will not be tolerated. H.R. 115 is straightforward, commonsense legislation that will provide all the men and women of law enforcement, who serve and protect our communities every day, with the support they deserve. As we conclude the 2017 National Police Week, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  letters in support of the bill. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  POLICE ORGANIZATIONS , INC., Alexandria, VA, January 5, 2017. Hon. VERNBUCHANAN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN BUCHANAN : On behalf of the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to you to express our strong support for the Thin Blue Line Act. NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from across the United States that serves to advance the interests of America’s law enforcement through legislative and legal advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978, NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and associations, including the Florida Police Benevolent Association, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair and effective crime control and law enforcement. The Thin Blue Line Act increases penalties on those who harm or target for harm public safety officers by making the murder or attempted murder of a local police officer, firefighter, or first responder an aggravating factor in death penalty determinations. This bill is critical, as law enforcement officer assaults, injuries, and deaths have increased sharply in recent years. In 2016 alone, ambushstyle killings of law enforcement officers increased by 167 percent. Establishing stricter penalties for those who harm or target for harm law enforcement officers will deter crime. Any persons contemplating harming an office must know that they will face serious punishments. NAPO strongly believes that increased penalties make important differences in the attitudes of criminals toward public safety officers, and ensure protection for the community. We thank you for your continued support of the law enforcement community and we look forward to working with you to pass this important legislation. Sincerely, WILLIAM J. JOHNSON , ESQ., CAE, Executive Director. 
NATIONAL FRATERNAL  ORDER OF POLICE , Washington, DC, 9 January 2017. Hon. VERNON G. B UCHANAN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE BUCHANAN : I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 115, the ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act.’’ The ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act’’ increases the penalty for an individual who targets, kills, or attempts to kill a person who is a law enforcement officer, firefighter or any other public safety officer, while he or she was engaged in the performance of his or her official duties, because of the performance of his or her official duties, or because of his or her status as a public official or employee. Law enforcement officers have always faced threats while on duty but within the past few years, officers have become a target for violence solely because of the uniform they wear. As you know, the FOP has called upon Congress to expand the current Federal hate crimes law to include law enforcement officers for this very reason. Of the 63 deaths by gunfire suffered by law enforcement in 2016, 21 of them—that’s 33%— were ambush killings. These were deliberate and sadly successful efforts by individuals who set out to kill a police officer: The ambush attack against the Dallas Police Department; the deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11 that saw 5 officers killed from gunfire; The ambush attack against members of the Baton Rouge Police Department that saw 3 officers killed from gunfire; The ambush attack against 2 Iowa police officers, Scott Martin and Anthony Beminio who were killed as they sat in their respective patrol cars; Officer Thomas Cottrell of the Danville Police Department (OH) was killed by ambush. All of these officers died because of the uniforms they were wearing. Those in our profession have always been in harm’s way. It is our job to protect others but it should not be ‘‘part of the job’’ to be a target of someone who is looking simply to kill a cop. We do not accept that our uniforms alone make us targets because someone was driven to rage over a perceived injustice or desires to strike a blow against our civil government. On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to 
thank you for introducing this legislation and amendment. If I can be of any further help, please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in my Washington office. Sincerely, CHUCK CANTERBURY , National President. 
OFNEWYORK, January 17, 2017. Hon. VERNBUCHANAN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE BUCHANAN : I am writing on behalf of the more than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 115, the ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act.’’ For too long, members of the NYPD, along with law enforcement officers across this nation, have been targets. There has been a proliferation of groups and pundits impugning the motives and mission of law enforcement. They do so with no regard for the impact it has on our ability to protect life, property, and the freedoms we all hold dear. These constant attacks and the excessive, exaggerated rhetoric of antipolice elements have led some to declare an open season on police officers, and to welcome with cheers and praise the cowardly criminals who target law enforcement officers with acts of violence. We saw this first hand in New York City in December 2014, when Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were ambushed and senselessly murdered as they sat in their radio car on a Brooklyn street corner. Unfortunately, they are not alone. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, in 2016 there were 21 police officers killed in ambushstyle attacks. Shockingly, 20 of these officers were killed in eight multipleshooting death incidents— such as those that claimed the lives of 8 officers in Baton Rouge, LA and Dallas, TX—the highest total of any year since 1932. It is for these reasons and many others that the legislation you have introduced is so important. The ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act’’ would make the murder or attempted murder of police officers, prosecutors, firefighters, and other first responders at any level of government an aggravating factor in federal death penalty determinations. The bill applies to things like the interstate homicide of an officer, and is applicable whether the officer is murdered on duty, because of the performance of their duty, or because of their status as a public official. While we know that law enforcement officers will continue to be targets, regardless of their uniform and whether they are on duty or off, active or retired, this legislation sends the message that any action to target law enforcement officers for murder or violence will be met with the harshest of penalties. And that is a message that is long overdue. On behalf of the membership of our organization, thank you for your leadership on this important issue. We look forward to working with you to see it swiftly enacted into law. Sincerely, EDMULLINS , President. 
OFAMERICA , April 25, 2017. Hon. VERNBUCHANAN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN BUCHANAN : I write to you today on a matter of significant importance to the Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA) and all of America’s law enforcement professionals. MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs representing the Nation’s largest counties with populations of 500,000 or more. Collectively, we represent more than 100 million Americans. As Vice President in charge of Government Affairs for the MCSA, I am pleased to express our association’s support of your legislation, the Thin Blue Line Act. This legislation would make the murder of law enforcement officers, firefighters and other first responders an aggravating factor in capital punishment determinations. In 2016, one hundred fortyfour officers died in the line of duty and to date, line of duty deaths are up 10 percent. The targeting of law enforcement officers is unconscionable and those who commit such heinous acts should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Law enforcement officers and other first responders have the right to go home to their families at the end of their shifts. The Thin Blue Line Act is a step in the right direction and your work on this legislation is sincerely appreciated. We value your support and look forward to working with you in the future. MICHAEL J. B OUCHARD , Sheriff, Oakland County (MI), Vice President—Government Affairs. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, though troubled and saddened by the recent attacks on law enforcement officials, I believe that H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act, is counterproductive to ensuring public safety and only serves to exacerbate concerns with the unfair and unjust death penalty. H.R. 115 expands the list of statutory aggravating factors in Federal death penalty cases to also include killing or targeting a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder. Aggravating factors are specific factors that judges and juries consider in determining whether a sentence of death is justified for the underlying offense. Passage of this bill would add a 17th statutory aggravating factor for Federal death penalty eligible offenses. H.R. 115 has been rushed to the House floor, without a single hearing and without the opportunity to consider amendments directly relevant to whether our system of imposing the death penalty is fair, just, and reliable. Like most of my colleagues, I support measures that would actually protect our first responders, brave men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us. Unfortunately, H.R. 115 not only fails to do this but would also exacerbate problems with the Federal death penalty. First, H.R. 115 duplicates Federal and State laws that enhance sentences of persons convicted of crimes of violence against law enforcement. The very law the bill seeks to amend, 18 U.S.C. section 3592, already states that a crime against a high public official, including a judge, a law enforcement officer, or an employee of a United States penal or correctional institution, is an aggravating factor that may be considered in determining whether a death sentence should be imposed. Other Federal laws also impose a life sentence or death on persons convicted of killing State and local law enforcement officers, or other employees assisting with Federal investigations, as well as officers of the United States courts. Secondly, H.R. 115 does not address documented and systemic unfairness and racial unfairness in the disposition of the death penalty. Any legislation dealing with the Federal death penalty must also address numerous concerns related to racial disparity in application of capital punishment, the lack of qualified counsel and sufficient resources to represent those facing the death penalty, and faulty forensic ‘‘science’’ testimony ordered in support of convictions in death penalty cases. The Federal death penalty, in particular, is rife with troubling evidence of racial disparity. For example, 36 of the 61 people currently on Federal death row are African American, Latino, Asian, or Native American. If you break this down by Federal circuit, the results are even more disturbing. For example, 15 of 18 men who have received a Federal death sentence in the Fifth Circuit—Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi—in the modern era have been people of color. Third, civil rights and civil liberties organizations oppose H.R. 115. Organizations committed to the protection of civil rights and civil liberties, including the NAACP, ACLU, and the LCCR, have noted that the Thin Blue Line Act ‘‘is an unnecessary and misguided attempt to politicize the unfortunate deaths of law enforcement officers and could ultimately exacerbate existing tension between law enforcement and the communities they served.’’ b1500 And finally, H.R. 115 will not deter violence against police officers. By adding a 17th aggravating factor to the Federal death penalty statute, this legislation ignores scientific research regarding the ineffectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent to crime. It is important to note that the National Research Council of the National Academies has concluded that the studies claiming that the death penalty has a deterrent effect on murder rates are ‘‘fundamentally flawed’’ and should not be the basis of sound public policy. Accordingly, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BUCHANAN ), the chief sponsor of the legislation. Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for 
yielding and for his incredible support for our Nation’s law enforcement officers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Thin Blue Line Act, legislation I have introduced to support our Nation’s brave police officers, firefighters, and first responders. This week, we recognize National Police Week, a time to reflect on the very professional service of our law enforcement officers and their families. It is also a time to honor the lives of those brave officers who were killed in the line of duty and made the ultimate sacrifice. It is really a sad reality that attacks against law enforcement officers have skyrocketed in recent years. Their entire community endured an especially difficult and heartbreaking 2016. In fact, in the last year alone, police officer deaths from shootings have increased 56 percent, and ambushstyle killings of law enforcement officers have increased a staggering 167 percent, nationally. We need to send a very clear message: The intentional targeting and killing of our first responders will not be tolerated. My bill, the Thin Blue Line Act, would make murder or attempted murder of a police officer, firefighter, or other first responder an aggravating factor in death penalty determinations. This bill will serve as a strong deterrent to anyone planning an attack against our brave men and women in uniform who protect and serve our communities. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to police officers and first responders across the country. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to help our American heroes. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation which would expand the death penalty by adding a 17th aggravating factor—killing or targeting a police officer, probation officer, or firefighter—to the list of 16 aggravating factors already on the books. Mr. Speaker, I have the greatest respect for our Nation’s public servants, our police, our firefighters, the men and women of the Armed Forces, our teachers, and our other government employees. They serve our Nation out of a sense of duty to our country and for the honor and privilege of helping others. But I cannot, in good conscience, support the bill we have before us simply because its purported goal, though certainly not its result, is to protect our public safety officers. The legislation is unnecessary and duplicative since there are already extensive penalties at both the State and local level for the murder of law enforcement officers. As we know, numerous studies have demonstrated that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime in any event. Numerous studies have shown that what enhances the deterrent is certainty and swiftness of punishment, not severity of punishment. Therefore, adding the death penalty as a punishment is unlikely to prevent future violence against our police and our firefighters. In addition, I believe the bill is counterproductive to our goal of improving law enforcement and community relations. If you oppose the death penalty, as I do, because, in many cases, there is no appropriate access to counsel, which we know; because the death penalty has racial disparities in its application, which we know; and because, as we have seen over the past many years, there is a strong possibility of a wrongful conviction leading to the untenable situation of putting an innocent person to death, and we know that this has been done in my State and others, then you should oppose this bill and any bill expanding application of the death penalty which will result in innocent men and women being executed. This bill does nothing to correct any of these issues. If you oppose the death penalty on moral and religious grounds, perhaps because you believe that all life is sacred and that the State should not sanction death as a punishment, then you should oppose this bill as well. There is another fundamental objection to this bill. It is one thing to impose a death penalty for murder, bad as that is, or for any crime; it is another thing to impose a death penalty for attempted murder. This bill imposes the death penalty for attempted murder of police, firefighters, and probation officers. I am not aware that we have in the law, anywhere, a death penalty for an attempted crime; and here, we are establishing a death penalty for an attempt, an unsuccessful attempt. The bill imposes the death penalty on persons who ‘‘killed or attempted to kill.’’ So under this bill, if you aimed the gun, even if you did not hit the person or injure him in any way, the death penalty would be imposed. This is a fundamental change in the law for which we are given no reason at all. The law has always recognized a distinction between a terrible act and an attempted terrible act. The attempted terrible act certainly should be punished, but not as severely as the accomplishment of the terrible act. Here, we are establishing a death penalty for an unsuccessful attempt to commit the crime, and no reason is given for this fundamental break with our legal traditions. So, for all these reasons—this bill is unnecessary, duplicative, ineffective, counterproductive, and where it is new, excessive—I oppose this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ) will control the time of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ). There was no objection. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I would just briefly remind my colleague on the other side that this does not establish the death penalty for an attempted murder, as was just stated. There must be an underlying capital crime for which the defendant is convicted. That is what this bill does, and nothing more. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on July 7, 2016, while a demonstration was taking place in Dallas, Texas, and police officers were protecting the demonstrators, a sniper rang out shots. After the smoke cleared, five Dallas police officers were murdered, seven others were wounded, and civilians were wounded. The culprit was finally apprehended, and, because he would not give up without shooting, he was killed by the Dallas Police Department. Ambush on police officers by citizens increased, for some reason, last year. Locally, in Houston, Texas, Chief Deputy Constable Clint Greenwood, a friend of mine, was walking into the courthouse at 7 a.m.; and as he is walking into the courthouse, a person comes up behind him and assassinates him, and he is killed. And that criminal was captured. Attacks on law enforcement and all of the people that I mentioned were local or State police officers. They were not Federal officers. Now, we talk about discrimination. Why does Federal law discriminate in punishment of outlaws in these type of death penalty situations by not allowing the same punishment if the person is a local or State police officer instead of a Federal police officer? I think that is wrong. As stated by the other side, most cases are made by State or local officers, especially crimes of violence. What this bill does is not discriminate against police officers who are local or State because of their status in a death penalty case where an outlaw is charged with a capital offense, but it allows the outlaw to get the same punishment that an outlaw would get if they killed a Federal officer, which is the death penalty. As a former judge for 22 years in criminal courts and a prosecutor, I believe in the death penalty, and here is the reason why: Some people deserve it. They deserve it for what they did, and that is why society should have the death penalty. And that is just the way it is. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I hadn’t planned to speak again, but a gentleman on the other side was just completely incorrect in what he said, and I have the bill here. The bill does establish the death penalty for attempted killing, and here is 
the language. The bill is very short. It says: 
The law is amended by inserting after paragraph 16 the following: Paragraph 17, killing or targeting of law enforcement officer. A. The defendant killed or attempted to kill, in the circumstance described in subparagraph B, a police officer, etc. 
The circumstance referred to in subparagraph A is that the person was killed or targeted while he was engaged in performance of his duties, basically. 
States Air Force veteran. He retired as a senior master sergeant with 29 years of service. He will be remembered for his service both in the Canonsburg community as a police officer, and to the country as a veteran. Mr. Speaker, when our brothers and sisters are killed in the line of duty, we can memorialize them by building monuments. We can remember them by renaming buildings. We can support them by raising funds to help their widows and their orphaned children. b1530 But most importantly, we can make sure we do all we can so that they return home at the end of their watch and that we protect their right to raise their children and their children’s right to be raised by them. The community needs to know that we do all we can to make sure that thin blue line does not break and that thin blue line does not bend. We need to work together as a nation to protect those who protect the safety of all of us. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, every day, courageous men and women in America’s law enforcement leave the safety of their homes to go into volatile situations, not knowing whether or not they will even return home safely. These brave police officers and first responders have dedicated their lives to ensuring our safety, as well as the safety of our neighborhoods and communities. I honor these fearless men and women and recognize the sacrifice they and their families make. But merely saying thank you is not enough. The Thin Blue Line Act will protect law enforcement officials by giving harsher penalties to criminals targeting the police and first responders who put their lives on the line daily to protect and defend us. It is my duty and privilege to support efforts that give our dedicated law enforcement officials the best possible chance of coming home safely every day. Mr. Speaker, this is how I can show my gratitude. Each House Member should join me in supporting this bill. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 10 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Louisiana has 15
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear that we are all in support of the protection of our officers. I think that there is no competition on sympathy or wanting to appropriately assure that those who go up against our officers in a vile and violent manner would be brought to justice. I think the point on race disparity as relates to the death penalty is relevant. It is about life. But I want to make it very clear: Under this underlying bill, our officers who are State police officers are protected already, including the example that I used about the MIT officer in the Boston Marathon terrorist act. It is if you are in the furtherance of a Federal crime. The bill itself is all Federal. You have to be engaged in an act that is a Federal crime. Clearly, if the terrorists on 9/11 had lived, the cases of the firefighters who lost their lives certainly would have been tried—those cases of the tragic, heinous deaths of firefighters who are our friends, and certainly are my friends—under the Federal death penalty law. In the case of U.S. v. Kenneth Barrett, a State law enforcement officer was killed during a drug raid. That is one of the underlying offenses. The defendant was sentenced to death. In the case of Lashaun Casey, an undercover police officer was killed in a carjacking related to a drug transaction. A capital jury decided to sentence the defendant to life without the possibility of parole, but it was a capital jury. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. JACKSON LEE. And so I want to honor them, too, but I also want to show the disparities. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the very valuable point that Chief Justice Roberts made in the particular case of Buck v. Davis and the statistical documentation of the disparities in the death penalty cases. We cannot ignore it. Chief Justice Roberts stated before the Court, in reversing the lower court, ‘‘some toxins can be deadly in small doses,’’ when the district court wanted to ignore or diminish the fact that race was involved in this case. A psychologist had the audacity to say that being Black did increase the probability that you would commit an act of violence prospectively. How sad is that? We are saddened by the death of our officers, but we are already protecting them and the first responders. Pursuant to a Federal criminal act, the prosecutor, at their discretion, can charge the defendant with a death penalty case. I just hope my colleagues will recognize that we are not divided in our love, affection, and respect for the men and women that serve as first responders and law enforcement throughout this Nation. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to speak on the floor today not only in support of H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act, but also in honor of all of our brave men and women who put their lives on the line every single day to keep our communities safe. I am the son of a first responder myself. My father was critically injured and permanently disabled in the line of duty. I know these sacrifices very well. This country owes our law enforcement officers an extraordinary debt of gratitude for the many services they provide. Our Nation simply would not be what it is today were it not for the sacrifices of all those who take the oath to protect and to serve us. The Thin Blue Line Act is simple: It seeks to expand on certain penalties to also include the murder or targeting of a State or local law enforcement officer. Virtually every American—anyone of good conscience—is shocked and disgusted by the recent trend of our local law enforcement heroes being targeted for violent acts. I am sad to report that, in my home State of Louisiana, we have been named the most dangerous State in America for law enforcement officers. It is shocking. It is true. It saddens all of us. The Thin Blue Line Act is a commonsense response to this epidemic that we are seeing across the culture. We thank and we stand with our first responders back home in Louisiana and all across our Nation. Those dedicated public servants never question and never hesitate in the face of danger. As many people have analogized this, we consider them our sheepdogs. They protect our communities from the wolves of our society who prey upon the innocent. To honor those sacrifices, I am proud, today, to support this legislation on the House floor. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter addressed to Mr. GOODLATTE  and myself, and I want to read the first paragraph of it. ‘‘Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: ‘‘We are current and former law enforcement leaders and officers from jurisdictions across the country. We ask you to oppose H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act. We do so because we believe this bill will do little to protect the lives of police and first responders and will drive away resources proven to be effective at protecting law enforcement and preventing and solving crime.’’ 
APRIL 26, 2017. Re Law Enforcement Opposition to H.R. 115. Hon. BOBGOODLATTE , Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Hon. JOHNCONYERS , JR., Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN GOODLATTE AND RANKING  MEMBER CONYERS : We are current and former law enforcement leaders and officers from jurisdictions across the country. We ask you to oppose H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act. We 
do so because we believe this bill will do little to protect the lives of police and first responders and will drive away resources proven to be effective at protecting law enforcement and preventing and solving crime. We are all too familiar with the risks that local, state, and federal law enforcement and first responders take each day to prevent, investigate, and prosecute crime. In fact; some of us have served alongside colleagues who were killed in the line of duty. We understand the impulse to threaten those who have murdered our fellow officers with the death penalty, and some of us have experienced that desire directly. But we also know that the death penalty, as it currently operates, is poor public policy. It is ineffective, expensive, and can make irrevocable mistakes. It is also used disparately and often on vulnerable populations, which undermines our ability to create effective and trusted relationships with those in the community on whose support our success depends. That is why, while some of us may philosophically support the death penalty, we all oppose its expansion in practice—even under the auspices of supporting law enforcement. Each of us understands that it takes many and varied resources to keep our communities safe. We need strong partnerships with local government and the communities we serve. We need wellfunctioning and modern systems to collect, store and process police activities, crime data, and evidence. We need equipment to protect and assist officers as they perform their duties. One tool virtually never seen on our list of needs is the death penalty. In short, we believe H.R. 115 is an unnecessary expansion of an already flawed and ineffective policy. We encourage you to oppose this bill and instead support measures that promote the overall health, safety, and welfare of law enforcement and the communities we have been sworn to protect. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, James Abbott, Chief, West Orange (NJ) Police Department (1997–Present). John Breckenridge, Officer, Manchester (NH) Police Department (ret.).

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I would like all of my colleagues to recognize that, during our observation of National Police Week, we are reminded again of the importance of ensuring that law enforcement officers are safe so they can carry out their duties effectively. These kinds of ‘‘enhancement’’ bills like H.R. 115 do nothing to invest in officer wellness or to address the everyday challenges faced by police officers or first responders. Moreover, they are redundant, especially because there are laws that protect police officers and first responders from violence in all 50 States. Rather than advancing a bill that amounts to an empty gesture, that is damaging, at best, this Congress should focus on real reform measures that will protect law enforcement, first responders, and their communities. Providing duplicative protections to law enforcement simply cannot counterbalance the impact of fundamentally flawed death penalty legislation. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we have heard many arguments from the other side of the aisle in opposition to this legislation. Of course, they began by saying how much they support the men and women of law enforcement. But let’s consider these arguments and decide for ourselves in closing here. First, we heard that the legislation is duplicative. It is not. In fact, it closes a loophole that currently exists in Federal law. There is currently no provision in our Federal law stating that the killing of a State or local law enforcement officer shall be an aggravating factor for capital punishment. Next, we heard that this legislation is unnecessary. It is not, unless you believe that State and local law enforcement officers are not somehow entitled to the same legal protections currently enjoyed by Federal officers. That is what this legislation would correct. A third argument we heard is that this is a messaging bill. It is clearly not that. Though it may be true that this provision would apply in a limited number of cases because the vast majority of capital cases are prosecuted at the State level, this bill inserts a provision in Federal law that will be vitally important in the cases where it would be applicable, such as in the Boston bombing. On that point, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have noted that Federal law already contains provisions to ensure criminals who carry out heinous acts such as the Boston terrorism attacks are dealt with appropriately. That is, of course, true, but saying that ignores the suffering of families of fallen police officers who have lost their lives rushing to aid after such an attack. It also ignores the sacrifice of law enforcement officers themselves, for example. Officer Sean Collier of the MIT Police Department is one example. He was murdered by the Tsarnaev brothers during their flight following their horrific act. In fact, Mr. Speaker, what these arguments reveal is simply that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose this bill because it amends a Federal death penalty statute. We would point out, in response to the letter that was just entered into the RECORD , that we have received support letters that are already in the RECORD from numerous law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the Major County Sheriffs of America, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the NYPD, among many, many others across the country who believe that this is an appropriate step for us to take today. In light of all that, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject the arguments of the other side, to support the men and women who comprise the thin blue line between order and chaos in our society, and to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 323, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.

b1630 ANNOUNCEMENT BY COMMITTEE ON RULES REGARDING AMENDMENT PROCESS FOR H.R. 953, REDUCING REGULATORY BURDENS ACT OF 2017; H.R. 1761, PROTECTING AGAINST CHILD EXPLOITATION ACT OF 2017; AND H.R. 1973, PROTECTING YOUNG VICTIMS FROM SEXUAL ABUSE ACT OF 2017 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Rules has issued announcements outlining the amendment process for three measures that will likely be before the Committee on Rules next week. The amendment deadline has been set for Monday, May 22 at 10 a.m. for H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017; for Monday, May 22 at 3 p.m. for H.R. 1761, the Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act of 2017; and Tuesday, May 23 at 10 a.m. for H.R. 1973, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act of 2017. The text of these measures, Mr. Speaker, is available on the Committee on Rules website at this time, and Members can feel free to contact the Committee on Rules with any questions regarding the amendment process. f 
CITIZENSHIP FOR SURVIVORS OF FALLEN FIRST RESPONDERS (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 1970, the Kerrie Orozco Act. This coming Saturday is the 2year anniversary of the death of the Omaha Police Officer Kerrie Orozco, who was killed while serving a warrant to a convicted felon and known gang member. May 20, 2015, will forever be a somber day in the Omaha metro area. Every day all across the country, first responders put their lives on the line to protect citizens. When Officer Orozco was killed, her husband, Hector, was going through the process to gain U.S. citizenship, and her death put a halt to it. He has an enormous responsibility as a single parent, and we owe it to Kerrie to ensure that her family is provided the same protections they would have had if this unfortunate situation had not occurred. H.R. 1970 would give many of our first responders peace of mind to know that, even in death, their surviving loved ones can continue the immigration process. This legislation would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow for the surviving family members of a fallen U.S. citizen first responder to be naturalized upon compliance with all requirements. Current law allows for surviving family members of the U.S. military killed in service of our Nation to continue with their citizenship application. H.R. 1970 will simply extend that privilege to first responders. We owe it to Officer Orozco and other fallen first responders to honor their memory by passing H.R. 1970. I look forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to give our first responders the peace of mind they deserve as they head out the door each day to serve our communities. 
STROKE AWARENESS MONTH (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of May as Stroke Awareness Month. As a stroke survivor, I understand the magnitude of this disease and the hundreds of thousands of lives it touches in American families each year. 
We know that the risk of stroke increases each year, but strokes can and do occur at any age. In fact, every 40 seconds, someone in the United States suffers a stroke; and every 4 minutes, someone dies from a stroke. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, killing nearly 130,000 Americans per year. To help raise awareness on how stroke affects Americans across all ages, races, and demographics, today I am reintroducing my resolution recognizing May as Stroke Awareness Month. The resolution aims to enhance public awareness by urging and continuing the coordination and cooperation among researchers, families, and advocates for improving treatment for individuals who suffer stroke. Together, we can combat this illness and work together toward longterm solutions to prevent, treat, and improve the lives of those suffering from stroke. I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TIBERI ) for joining me as an original cosponsor of this bipartisan effort. Mr. Speaker, I ask others to please sign on. 
WE NEED A BORDER WALL (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, last week I again visited the ArizonaMexico border. I examined border fencing in the city of Nogales, on the Tohono O’odham Indian Reservation, and a working cattle ranch. As an Arizona native, I have visited the border many times, and each time I am disheartened by what I see. Much of the fencing I saw last week would do little to keep illegal aliens from crossing the border. In failing to construct a wall, we are allowing anyone to enter the United States. Border Patrol agents are outnumbered by illegal aliens, drug cartel scouts, and human smugglers. The technology in place is woefully inadequate. There is no question that our citizens along the border are in danger and our national security is in peril due to the unknown identities of those crossing our border. Mr. Speaker, President Trump won by promising to build a border wall. I unequivocally stand with him, but building the wall is only the first step to securing our border. We must also increase the number of Border Patrol agents, invest in cuttingedge technology, and fully enforce our immigration laws. These expenditures and efforts are necessary and worth the cost. It is time to do what we said we would do. 
REMEMBERING AL KARNIG (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Al Karnig, a dedicated and passionate member of the San Bernardino community who served as president for California State University, San Bernardino, for 15 years. Dr. Karnig was a fierce advocate for our students, overseeing record numbers of enrollment, diversity, and faculty, as well as raising tens of millions of dollars for the university. When Al wasn’t working on improving access to higher education in our community, he was investing his personal time to make the inland empire a better place to live and raise a family. He served on the board for KVCR Educational Foundation, Inland Empire Economic Partnership, and the Community Hospital of San Bernardino. Just last month, Al was in my office touting his latest philanthropic venture to help children, the InfantToddler Success program, working with parents and caregivers of children from birth to 36 months to help them to be ready for school and life. I thank Dr. Karnig for his tireless efforts to make our region home to a worldclass institution through Cal State, San Bernardino, as well as his advocacy on behalf of San Bernardino County families. As we mourn his loss, we give thanks for his contributions to our community, which will live on in his family, colleagues, graduates, students, children, and parents he helped through so many years of service. f 
HONORING FALLEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS (Ms. MCSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Police Week and to applaud the 900,000 law enforcement officers nationwide. Last year, Arizona lost some of our finest, those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to keep our communities safe: Officer David Glasser of Phoenix PD was killed in the line of duty last May, leaving behind his wife and two children; Senior Officer Leander Frank of Navajo Nation PD was killed while responding to a call last August, and he is survived by his wife and children; Officer Darrin Lee Reed of Show Low PD was shot in the line of duty this past November, just weeks away from his retirement, leaving behind his wife, his son, and his daughter. We can never fully express our gratitude or repay the debt for their service. I would also like to honor those who serve in law enforcement along our border. While not every community in America has the proximity to the border that my district does, we all benefit from the courage of CBP officers and Border Patrol agents. Last August, we lost Border Patrol Agent Manuel Alvarez, who is survived by his wife and four children. Just over a week ago, we lost CBP Officer Edgard Garcia, who was well loved by our Tucson community. We owe these men and their families for their ultimate sacrifice, and we owe a debt of gratitude to those who serve us today and every day in uniform. f 
WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today about the need for investment in our infrastructure. As we know, this week is National Infrastructure Week. In my district on the central coast of California, we need infrastructure investment, not just for our roads, for our water systems, and our rural broadband but for something I used growing up, the transit systems. The bus systems where I am from played an important role not just in my life but in many of my constituents’ daily lives. Parents use the system to bring their children to their doctors, students use the transit system to attend the many schools and colleges in my area, and our employees use this form of transportation when they travel to their hightech jobs in Silicon Valley, to their hospitality jobs on the Monterey Peninsula, and to their agriculture jobs in the Salinas and Pajaro Valleys. The transit system makes our businesses more accessible to their employees, to their customers, and everybody who helps the regional economy, but the benefits don’t end with our riders. With transit, our roads experience less wear and tear, and our environment is protected. I know that my district isn’t unique when it comes to the need for infrastructure investment. Our entire country needs it. So let’s continue to do our jobs here in the Congress. Let’s invest in our transit systems, in our infrastructure, so that our government can do something for our constituents, our local businesses, our home, and our families. 
HONORING BUDDY L AROSA (Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Buddy LaRosa for his countless years of service to the city of Cincinnati, having touched the lives of so many. Recently, West Elder Street near Findlay Market in Cincinnati was renamed Buddy LaRosa Way. The exact spot was picked because, according to Buddy, that is the exact spot where he sold shopping bags for 3 cents when he was 10 years old. This was the beginning of his successful pizza empire, LaRosa’s Pizza, a Cincinnati favorite. But great pizza isn’t Buddy’s only contribution to the Cincinnati area, not by a long shot. Buddy is one of the most generous people I have had the pleasure of knowing through my life. He has dedicated 
his time and energy, making many contributions supporting the people of our community and changing their lives. Naming Buddy LaRosa Way is a reminder of how the city of Cincinnati has been forever positively changed by Buddy LaRosa’s heart and soul. Thank you, Buddy. 
PLEASE READ THE NEW HEALTHCARE BILL (Mr. CA´RDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I am privileged and honored to be a Member of this House, and it is very frustrating for us to come here week after week and to not do the business of the people of the United States of America. One of those impediments is that we have a President of the United States who is trying to force and push this Congress, and many others in his administration, to do things that are not right for the people and this country. I think it is important for us to understand that when and if you get an opportunity to read the legislation called TrumpCare, you will realize that really what it is about is Trump doesn’t care about your healthcare. Please, just read it. I apologize for talking about the 24 millionplus Americans who will lose their healthcare if this bill were to become law. I apologize because I need to remind each individual that they will likely lose the ability to see a doctor if this bill becomes law. Please, please, help us. Please, focus on what is going on here in Washington and what is not going on here in Washington for everyone’s sake. 
SYRIAN ATROCITIES (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, recent State Department revelations show that Syrian President Bashar alAssad continues inflicting atrocities on his own people. The discovery of a crematorium at Saydnaya military prison will only make it more difficult to account for the thousands detained and executed by Assad. According to numerous nongovernmental organizations, the Assad regime has abducted and detained between 65,000 and 117,000 people between 2011 and 2015. Credible reports have the regime executing up to 50 people daily. Assad uses the excuse of fighting terrorism to justify this gross campaign of inhumanity against innocent civilians. We know he has used mass graves and crematoriums to dispose of the corpses of the murdered. The savagery must stop. I am proud to represent many Syrian Americans in Charleston, West Virginia. I urge my colleagues to join me in publicly condemning the atrocities committed by the Syrian regime of President Assad. Syrians deserve to be safe and free. f 
b1645 CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DR. ABRAHAM FISCHLER (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Dr. Abraham Fischler, president emeritus of Nova Southeastern University. Dr. Fischler was one of south Florida’s education pioneers and served as NSU’s second president for 22 years, as well as a member of the Broward County School Board. Dr. Fischler was an inspiration to all those who knew him, myself included. He served as NSU president when I was a member of the staff, often providing wise counsel and guidance. He understood that in order to invest in our students, we need to invest in our teachers. He was truly an educator’s educator. There are more than 10,000 students currently enrolled in the Abraham S. Fischler College of Education. He has shaped countless lives and will always be remembered for his determination to ensure our students succeed. Thanks to Dr. Fischler, our young adults face their future prepared and ready to take on all that life has to offer. My thoughts are not only with his wife, Shirley, and the entire Fischler family, but with the students, faculty, and staff. 
HONORING WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR. (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of one of our Nation’s greatest leaders and, for me, in my young career, a mentor and good friend, William Coleman, Jr., who passed away earlier this year at the age of 96. Throughout his long career, Bill helped shape the future of our country in a past full of racial tension. In 1948, Bill became the first African American to serve as a law clerk on the United States Supreme Court, and helped draft the legal brief for the landmark 1954 case, Brown v. Board of Education. Bill later became our Nation’s second AfricanAmerican Cabinet official, serving as Transportation Secretary for Gerald Ford. I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his family, his loved ones, his former law partners, and his staff. NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WEEK (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week, it is a privilege to honor the men and women of law enforcement who put their lives on the line every single day to keep us safe. In my hometown of Philadelphia and across the Nation, police officers serve our communities with immeasurable courage. Every police officer goes to work knowing that any day could be their last. In Philadelphia alone, more than 260 police officers throughout our city’s history have lost their lives. One thing in Congress that we could do to show just how much we honor their sacrifice is to enact the legislation that myself, along with Congressman FITZPATRICK , Senators C ASEY and TOOMEY , have introduced. It would provide a boost of education aid, up to the maximum Pell grant award, for the children of fallen law enforcement and first responders who have died in the line of duty. The bipartisan Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act is widely supported by the law enforcement community. Although we can never fully repay our debt to those families who have made the ultimate sacrifice, I believe this would be an important step in the right direction. 
NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WEEK (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the great men and women of law enforcement. As you know, it is National Law Enforcement Week, first established by President Kennedy in 1962. Imagine waking up every morning, rolling out of your bed, rubbing your eyes, getting dressed for work, kissing a loved one goodbye for what may be the very last time. You walk out your door not even thinking about the potential danger that awaits you, not even questioning who the person is asking for help, and not hesitating to step in the line of fire should you be required to. Notice that I said ‘‘you.’’ You, a Republican. You, a Democrat. Black, White, Brown, gay, or straight, for all types don the uniform every day. Men and women of law enforcement are a special breed amongst us. Theirs is a higher calling for service. They are part of the very fabric of our society. Without them, we would not have order, and our laws would be worthless. For those men and women of law enforcement in Virginia’s Second District, and those around the Nation, we thank you. Your willingness to put the safety of others above your own demands respect, recognition, and, for some, remembrance. 
TRUMPRUSSIA TIES (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, on May 9, President Trump abruptly fired FBI Director Comey, who was leading the investigation into ties between his administration and Russia. On May 10, the President met with the Russian Ambassador in the Oval Office, and the White House changed their reasoning for firing Comey. On May 11, in an interview with Lester Holt, President Trump admitted that the Russia investigation was a factor in firing Comey. On May 12, he appeared to threaten Comey, saying he had ‘‘better hope that there are no ‘tapes’’’ of their conversations. On May 15, we learned Trump shared code word classified intelligence with the Russian Ambassador. On May 16, Comey’s memo of his conversation with President Trump quoted him saying: ‘‘I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go.’’ Every day brings a new scandal. The appointment of Director Mueller as special prosecutor is a good first step, but it shouldn’t be our last. We need an independent commission, free of meddling from the Trump administration. Our democracy depends on it. 
TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ‘‘DOC’’ LONG (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor William ‘‘Doc’’ Long of Oak Ridge, North Carolina. Doc is a veteran who served under the command of General Patton in World War II. For his service, the United States awarded him two Purple Hearts, two Bronze Stars, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantry Badge. Doc has worked tirelessly to help his fellow citizens understand the meaning of freedom and to ensure the sacrifices made on behalf of our Nation are not forgotten. In 2014, the Carolina Field of Honor opened at Triad Park in Kernersville, North Carolina, to honor all who serve or have served in the Armed Forces of the United States of America. As one of its biggest supporters, Doc personally sponsored two of its military service monuments: the U.S. Army Monument and the U.S. Navy Monument. On Saturday, May 27, family and friends will gather to celebrate this remarkable man’s 93rd birthday. North Carolina is fortunate to call Doc one of its own. 
WHERE ARE THE WOMEN ON THE AHCA COMMITTEE? (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this is a picture of the committee our Republican colleagues in the Senate have put together and tasked with crafting a healthcare bill that will affect the healthcare of tens of millions of American women. And just a quick glance at his poster tells you that there is not one person on this committee who will ever bear a child or need maternity care. There is no one on this committee that will ever need a mammogram. No one on this committee will ever have to worry about having their access to affordable contraceptives or prenatal care taken away from them. Yet, the House bill that was delivered to the Senate callously would make healthcare services and insurance coverage either unaffordable or unavailable to millions of struggling hardworking women. So, once again, we find that our Republican colleagues are making lifealtering decisions without a single woman at the table, ignoring the very real, very cruel effects of the House passed bill on American women and families. So, once again, Mr. Speaker, we ask: Where are the women? f 
TAX REFORM FOR HARDWORKING MICHIGAN RESIDENTS (Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, tax reform is a key concern for smallbusiness owners and hardworking residents in my district. My predecessor, former Ways and Means chairman, Dave Camp, worked diligently on this issue in hopes of reforming our Nation’s burdensome Tax Code. Today, the Ways and Means Committee took up this work again because our Tax Code needs to be simpler, fairer, and flatter for Michigan families. Tax reform done right will benefit Michigan residents of all income levels by making it easier for them to calculate and file their tax returns while lowering their tax burden. The first bill I introduced as Michigan’s Fourth District Representative was legislation that would make it easier for Michigan families to pay for child care. It is my hope that this will become part of this tax reform package. Our Tax Code was last updated in 1986. It is time for a change. I hope this Congress will pass tax reform for the 21st century. 
HONORING PATRICIA BROUGHTON (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Patricia Broughton, my caseworker in San Pedro, California, who is retiring after her distinguished career in public service. Patricia has served for 32 years, and has served five Members of Congress, including me. She also served former Representatives Janice Hahn, Jane Harman, the late Steve Horn, the late Glenn Anderson, and then myself. Patricia isn’t just a caseworker, she is a miracle worker. She has handled virtually every type of case that is referred to a congressional office. Patricia has resolved Social Security and Medicare claims for seniors, helped disabled veterans who weren’t receiving their veterans’ disability checks, and assisted those who had trouble with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the IRS. Patricia has been an advocate for the frustrated, and a source of comfort for those tangled up in the Federal Government’s bureaucracy. I wish Patricia the best in her well deserved retirement from public service. f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise during National Police Week to honor the men and women who every morning put on their badge and selflessly protect and serve our communities. Many heroically go above and beyond their duty. It was a privilege of mine to invite and sit next to Kendall County Sheriff’s Deputy Tyler Johnson at last year’s State of the Union Address. On New Year’s night, he jumped into a freezing pond to rescue a motorist in a sinking car. These acts of heroism deserve our recognition. Yet, rarely do our officers receive recognition and thanks for their daytoday work serving people. A police officer is the person that helps you when you are stranded on the side of the road. A police officer scours the neighborhood with your kids looking for a lost dog. They are the Illinois police departments that tomorrow are taking part in Cops on a Rooftop with Dunkin Donuts to help raise money for the Illinois Special Olympics. To police officers everywhere: Thank you. 
COMMEMORATING THE DEDICATION OF THE WASHINGTON SPY TRAIL (Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the dedication of the Washington Spy Ring along Route 25A of Long Island’s North Shore, in my and Congressman ZELDIN ’s district. This group of American heroes is often overlooked because knowledge 
that George Washington’s Culper Spy Ring existed was not disclosed until 1930. Nathan Hale of the often noted ‘‘I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country’’ is claimed by Huntington to have been captured there and gave rise to the spy ring. One of Culper’s top spies was Robert Townsend of Raynham Hall, Oyster Bay, also known as Culper, Jr. Townsend posed as a Tory merchant in New York City. He relayed intelligence concerning troop movements, supplies, and British plots, using an expensive spy ring, coded messages, invisible ink, and elaborate signal system using everything from drying laundry to buttons on clothing. Their efforts turned the tide of the war by assisting Washington to outfox the British, even saving him from capture. As Washington said, and as is recounted to members of today’s CIA: ‘‘There is nothing more necessary than good intelligence to frustrate a designing enemy, and nothing requires greater pains to obtain.’’ I would like to thank the North Shore Promotional Alliance, Raynham Hall, the Ward Melville Heritage Organization, and the producers of the AMC television show ‘‘Turn’’ for promoting the legacy of these unsung American patriots. 
b1700 GIVING CONSUMERS A FINANCIAL CHOICE (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, in 2010, the Democratic majority passed the DoddFrank Act, a 2,300page rewrite of America’s financial laws. This sweeping law imposed significant costs on the economy, financial institutions, investors, small businesses, and American consumers. DoddFrank was supposed to help lift up our economy; instead, what we got was the slowest, weakest recovery in 70 years. It was supposed to end taxpayer funded bailouts; instead, it enshrined, permanently, Wall Street bailouts into law. It was supposed to make the financial system safer; instead, big banks got even bigger, and we have one less community bank or credit union every day. It was supposed to protect consumers; instead, higher bank fees, more expensive mortgages, fewer choices, and the most unaccountable government agency in the history of the Republic, the CFPB. The Financial CHOICE Act moving through committee and to this floor soon will give consumers the protections they need and the opportunity for investment that has been so bottled up for many, many months—even years— in this country. The Financial CHOICE Act will be very helpful toward restarting our economy and bringing back, once again, consumer choice. Let’s move this bill through. f 
PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BANKS of Indiana). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here with my partner, Congresswoman JAYAPAL from the State of Washington, and we are running the Progressive Caucus Special Order hour. We are delighted to kick off this session, which is about the extraordinary revelations this week and some breathtaking developments in Washington, with a statement by our distinguished colleague from Texas, SHEILA JACKSON  LEE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Maryland and the distinguished gentlewoman from Washington. Just by coincidence, Mr. Speaker, all three of us are members of the Judiciary Committee and had a very vigorous constitutional discussion this morning in a hearing on the responsibilities of the Judiciary Committee and, as well, the responsibilities of this Congress to the American people. I think many of us offered our comments in the context that we did not speak as a Democrat or a Republican, though we are here on this floor as members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. We really spoke to our views and commitment as Americans. Having served in this House for a period of time where I have seen the Judiciary Committee engage vigorously in impeachment proceedings for judges and Presidents, I know that the role of the Judiciary Committee is to be assured that the government—the executive, the legislature, the judiciary— works within the context of the Constitution. So that is the spirit and the position in which I rise this evening: to share a few thoughts and to recount for our Members why this is a week that requires further oversight and insight and further assessment of whether the actions of the Oval Office, the executive—in this instance, the White House—have really complied with the Constitution of the United States. I would, first of all, indicate that much of what I will say I will qualify and say that the President, or a President, or any President, would have the authority to do. So although, for example, the FBI Director is given a 10year term, the individual serves at the will of the President of the United States of America. That means that President Trump, President Obama, President Bush, President Clinton, and others would have the authority to fire this particular individual as they would have the right to fire Cabinet officers and others. They have the right to fire the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, which may be one of the concerns we now have as we proceed to try to get to the facts of just a whole litany of issues. Let me recount for you, as I discuss the firing of Director Comey, that in the last couple of days we have discerned that the Trump campaign operatives spoke to Russian operatives, Russian Government officials, 18 times in the last 7 months of the campaign. We are well aware that the former NSA Director, something I think we, as Members of Congress—I will speak for myself—have never heard of in the tenure that I have been privileged to serve in the United States Congress, that an individual who was advising the President of the United States not in the form of a lobbyist, but in the form of an adviser in national security issues, was being paid by a foreign country. So the advice that was given, two different recommendations: one, to drag out and throw to an unknowing future a Turkish citizen who is here, who has been involved in a number of schools and good charitable work, who lives in Pennsylvania; one of his recommendations was to throw this individual who is statused, not undocumented, out into the hands of the present President of Turkey, who has been known over the years, recently, to deny political and religious rights and human rights. That was one recommendation. The second recommendation, whether you liked it or disliked it, was to not arm the Kurds to help with the fight in Syria. That advice was given, both of those proposals as advice were given while General Flynn was on the payroll of a foreign government. So you would have to wonder in the series of incidents how we have come to the point where the FBI Director, who was actively engaged in investigating—or the FBI, investigating General Flynn, as were congressional committees—General Flynn is now under a subpoena by, I believe, the Senate Intelligence Committee. All of that, all of those elements certainly respond that the Congress and the FBI were engaged in active investigations. I think the American people understand that. The American people understand that if their chief of police was engaged in an active investigation of murder, one that the whole community was just outraged about, as any murder, as all the homicides that take place in a community that you desire to be safe, and one local elected official indicated that you are investigating my neighbor or you are investigating me and had the authority to fire the chief of police with the reason of one thing and then it became very clear that you were firing the chief of police who was actively engaged in a murder investigation that was going to help the whole community find the truth and bring the perpetrator to justice, you fired that police 
chief because it was either you that was being investigated, local elected official, or it was your neighbor that was being investigated, you just took it upon yourself to cease and desist of that investigation, and that is a simple explanation of what has happened here in Washington. Because Washington is big, because this government is huge, because it is the leader of the free world, because all the nations look up to it gives it no greater authority to stop an active investigation that is based upon the duties of the FBI, but also the laws of this land, and that is just what happened. Director Comey was unceremoniously fired; a man who has had great tenure in law enforcement as an attorney and prosecutor and, now, over the FBI. Of course, the socalled explanation— which, by the way, has just been repeated in the last 45 minutes on international television, saying the same thing, that his firing was based upon Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein’s representation in a memorandum that many of us question that gave a whole explanation of the incidents regarding former Secretary Clinton, which, of course, she was not found to have warranted any further review or investigation or prosecution. But that was what was used by President Trump just in the last, as I said, 30 to 45 minutes, when we know that the Deputy Attorney General has already denied that he was the cause and center of the firing of FBI Director Comey, yet it is still being repeated over and over and over and over again. You would also know that not only did he deny—and we look forward to hearing him tomorrow, the House Members, as the Senate has already heard him. What he also indicated, or what was also said to vindicate him, is that the President came out on last Thursday with interviews with Lester Holt on NBC News that it wasn’t anybody but him, and it was connected to this fake Russian thing. I am paraphrasing. I may not have all of the words. So you have an executive that, one could analyze in a number of court decisions, may have been credited with an abuse of power. There was no legitimate failing in the work of Director Comey on this Russian investigation. Just 30 to 45 minutes ago, another comment that was made is that he was unpopular, and that he did very, very poorly in the hearings last week. None of those are elements of dismissal. Maybe reprimand, maybe study a little bit more before you go to Senatorial hearings or House hearings, but that has nothing to do with being fired. I don’t know whether any of us want, every single day, as we make very tough decisions in this House, that we are assessed on whether or not we are very popular. What we want to do is do what is right for the American people. And whatever you might say, I assume Director Comey felt that he was doing what is right for the American people. Many disagreed with his handling and assessment of the issues dealing with former Secretary Clinton, particularly in the October surprise. That is legitimate. But it is not legitimate to say, way past that incident and when this individual is actively engaged—and there is no question or no guarantee that, in spite of our displeasure as Democrats, if the Office of the Presidency had gone the other way that Director Comey would be fired. There was no suggestion of that, none whatsoever, even with disagreeing with actions. But here we have not only the misrepresentation of the reason, but the declaration that the reason was because of this Russian thing. Let me share with you the comments of Professor Tribe in a Washington Post article on May 13, 2017, as he recounts the whole issue of this action bearing upon the actions that are in the Constitution, such as impeachment, that relate to the questions of whether or not the Presidency or the President has acted appropriately: ‘‘The question of Russian interference in the Presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign go to the heart of our system and ability to conduct free and fair elections.’’ Therefore, it was free. It was what we do. ‘‘Consider, too, how Trump embroiled Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, despite Sessions’ recusal from involvement in the Russia investigation, in preparing admittedly phony justifications for the firing on which Trump had already decided. Consider how Trump used the Vice President and White House staff to propagate a set of blatant untruths—before giving an interview to NBC’s Lester Holt that exposed his true motivation. ‘‘Trump accompanied that confession with selfserving—and manifestly false—assertions about having been assured by Comey that Trump himself was not under investigation. By Trump’s own account, he asked Comey about his investigative status even as he was conducting the equivalent of a job interview in which Comey sought to retain his position as a Director.’’ So I believe that what we have here is a reasonable basis, those of us who have come to the floor tonight, to raise these questions and to be able to make sure that we do have a system of laws and that we do adhere to the rule of law. b1715 We know that, subsequently, the Deputy Attorney General has appointed a special counsel under the provisions of the Attorney General. Of course, that individual could be fired. The regulation could be dismantled. But we hope that former Director Mueller of the FBI, who has impeccable credentials, will go forward and ensure that the American people know the truth. That will be one part of it. I repeat, that will be one part of it. But, as I look at my closing remarks here, I want to ensure that we know that this is not something that is made up; that it continues to shock us, and it shocks the American people. It is not a made up entity. It just continues with a long list of incidents, starting from the firing and then going up. A comment Bill Moyers said: ‘‘The ensuing White House coverup tries to pin the blame on a newly confirmed Deputy Attorney General whose hastily prepared memo criticizes Comey’s 2016 statements. . . .’’ But the late summer of 2015, a member of Trump’s campaign staff called Lieutenant General Mike Flynn to ask if he is willing to meet with Trump. Trump agrees. Later Flynn says, four other Presidential candidates also reached out to him. There is a long list of items that may be true, may not be true, but clearly set a pattern, a pattern of the achilles heels of this Oval Office. And so I would say to my colleagues that we should not turn a blind eye on this. I believe it is important to follow the facts. I have no quarrel with that. But neither am I afraid to use the term appropriately, an impeachment inquiry, but at least to find the facts of whether or not any of the actions that swirled around Director Comey, that swirled around General Flynn’s and Director Comey’s or the FBI’s investigation of this particular series of incidents are in keeping with the responsibilities of the Congress, the Judiciary, in any elements there, or the Oval Office, the Presidency of the United States of America. I think that the special prosecutor, for Americans to understand, deals specifically with pursuing or possible criminal acts. On the other hand, it is well known that the Congress can address how we fix this; how we make sure it doesn’t happen again; how we work on behalf of the American people. And so I hope that, as we conclude this Special Order, no one will point to any of the Members on this floor as taking this up as a personal cause against the President of the United States, or any President, and that we will respect the office, as we have always done. But it is our duty to shed light on these issues and shed light on these potential failures. It is our responsibility to take up the cause of curing, responding, fixing, and serving the American people. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for those extremely thoughtful and lucid remarks. I also wish to associate myself with the idea that, here on this issue, we cannot act purely as partisans. I suppose I can make a partisan speech with the best of them, but we are called upon during these very trying days to speak not as partisans but as patriots and as constitutional patriots. I have been a professor of constitutional law for 27 years at American 
University’s Washington College of Law, and I am aware that the Founders of this country were determined to see that while we acted as partisans in the normal push and pull of legislative politics, when it comes to the basic character of our democracy, all of us try to need to act in a way that is consistent with the constitutional values that unify us. Thomas Jefferson said: ‘‘If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all.’’ And George Washington said that we should never forget that the word ‘‘party’’ comes from the French word ‘‘partie.’’ One part, each party is one part of the whole, and we have to try to keep our mind focused on the whole thing. Well, the whole country is in danger right now. The events of the last week have been breathtaking and extraordinary. So let’s take a moment to try to catch our breath to remember what is really at stake with the Russian connection, with the firing of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn after 24 days, with the firing of FBI Director James Comey this week after he refused to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn, and the Russian connection. All of this is about, in the big picture, an organized and systematic assault on the American form of government and our Democratic political institutions. During the 2016 Presidential election, 17 of our U.S. intelligence agencies, including the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and more than a dozen of others, got together and produced a report where they said, with a very high degree of certainty, that Vladimir Putin and Russian agents had an organized campaign orchestrated to engage in cyber espionage of the United States of America and our political institutions, and cyber sabotage of our political institutions with paid operatives working to disseminate fake news and propaganda, and to engineer leaks of mixtures of real emails mixed in with fake news, and so on. All of it meant to throw the Presidential election, to destroy the chances of Hillary Clinton, and to destabilize American political democracy. We know that this modus operandi was used before the 2016 election in America, and it was used again after, as recently as the election in the Netherlands with Mr. Wilders, who was the favorite of Vladimir Putin, and then again in France with Marine Le Pen and the National Front where Mr. Putin and his operatives did a data dump the weekend before the French Presidential election. Right before the blackout on campaigning, they again orchestrated hacks of the Macron campaign, and then tried to put out, again, a complete disinformation package on behalf of Le Pen. Well, the intelligence agencies warned us that this was just a dress rehearsal for 2020. This is what Vladimir Putin is doing. He is trying to organize every dictator, despot, and kleptocrat on Earth together to destroy the liberal democracies, from the outside and from the inside. Now, militarily, he is no match for the United States of America. Economically, he is no match for the United States of America. Intellectually, in terms of our political institutions and the democracy we have built, our Constitution, he is no match for America. But he perceives a weakness, and the weakness is all about the internet because the internet links the whole world together. And if he can use the internet in order to hack into our institutions, both our party institutions and our election systems, and the media, and political campaigns, and then use that to sew confusion and propaganda, then he may, indeed, be able to gain control over the direction of our country, the sovereign people of America. We were warned in that intelligence agency report, which is public, which everybody can find online, that this is their plan. It wasn’t as if 2016 was a oneshot deal. This is exactly what Putin will continue to do. So that is the background. Now, why is the firing of FBI Director James Comey so disturbing? He, of course, had a 10year term, which was abruptly and suddenly cut off by President Trump after Comey told him—according Comey’s account, at least—that he would refuse to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn. There are lots of people involved in this Russian connection story, including Page, and Stone, and Manafort, and Jared Kushner that go way beyond what we can talk about here tonight. But I just want to focus for the moment on Flynn. Why is this sequence of events so disturbing? Well, it came out this week also that the Trump transition team, headed by none other than Vice President PENCE , knew that Flynn was under criminal investigation at the time that they decided to hire him as America’s National Security Advisor. At a point when they decided to make him America’s number one national security operative, they knew he was under criminal investigation for being a paid operative of the Turkish Government, a paid agent of the Turkish Government. And nonetheless, they brought him on. And then when it was learned from the Acting Attorney General Sally Yates that Mr. Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail by Russians for having misled Vice President PENCE about his entanglement with the Russian Ambassador and his conversations with the Russian Ambassador, still they kept him on. So they brought him on, knowing he was under investigation, then they knew he lied about his connections to the Russians, and still they kept him on. When the media finally broke the story of Flynn’s collusive actions with foreign governments while he was the National Security Agency Director, Trump finally fired him, grudgingly, let him go, but said that Flynn was the victim somehow, and even tried to disassociate himself from the firing of Flynn. Then we learn that the President tried to get the FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation. Now, that is according to the FBI Director James Comey, who has never been accused of lying or perjury. So it is going to be his word against that of the President of the United States, who has said things like: Well, TEDCRUZ’ father participated in the assassination of JFK; and 5 million people voted illegally in the United States, with no evidence at all; and Barack Obama was born in Kenya, or Indonesia; and he had his phones tapped, and so on. And so that issue might come down to a swearing contest between the former Director of the FBI, Mr. Comey, and President Trump. But in any event, according to Comey, Trump said to him: Will you let it go? Will you let the investigation of Flynn go? And Comey said he would not. And then Comey was let go instead. So the question is: What does Michael Flynn know that everybody bends over backwards in the Trump administration to try to please him and placate him? This is an administration that doesn’t mind insulting our longest and most cherished allies in the world: NATO, which he has said is obsolete; Mexico, which he has had no problem insulting and affronting; Australia; and so on. Yet with Michael Flynn, everybody is tiptoeing. Everybody is doing a tap dance. What does Michael Flynn know about President Trump? It would seem as if he has got some kind of information about the President that the President doesn’t want to get out there. That is why a special counsel had to be appointed, and I am glad a special counsel was appointed. And I believe that Mr. Mueller is up to the task. And he has been known as a straight shooter, and a nonpartisan, someone who will follow the facts where they will go. Well, in the meantime, we have got to look at the much broader issue. Because, of course, that is about the criminal deeds or actions of particular people. And some people may end up facing prosecution for what they did. But there is a much larger issue here. Because as a country, we have got to stand up for strong democracy all over the world. But what is happening with all of these shenanigans, and sinister contacts and connections with the Turkish Government, and the Russian Government, and Orban in Hungary, and the killer dictator Duterte in the Philippines who orders that people he thinks are drug users should be shot on 
sight in his country, who has been invited to the White House by President Trump? Well, our country has got to stand up for what is great about our country: our Constitution and our Bill of Rights. President Trump said this is a witch hunt. But I want to close by telling you about a real witch hunt that is going on right now on the planet Earth. And if we were not so distracted by the spreading staph infection in the White House, we would be able to help in terms of this situation. And I refer to you an article that was in the newspaper a couple of days ago in The New York Times about the governor of Jakarta, one of the largest cities in Indonesia. b1730 He is Christian. He is the Governor of Jakarta. Someone was running against him and said that all the Muslims should vote against him because he is Christian. They should have to vote for a Muslim because the Koran tells them to. The governor objected. Mr. Basuki said: That is not right. The Koran doesn’t say that Muslims must vote for Muslims. Muslims can vote for me, even though I am a Christian. He was prosecuted, arrested for blasphemy against the Koran, against Islam, and sentenced to 2 years hard time in a maximum security prison in Indonesia. In America, where we have a First Amendment and freedom of conscience, free exercise of religion, separation of church and State, we got rid of blasphemy a long time ago. But now we have got a human being—a governor, no less—who is in prison for hard time in Indonesia, one of our allies. We should not let that stand. There are hundreds of people all over the Earth who are in prison for blasphemy or apostasy or heresy—religious offenses—and we are saying nothing about it. In Russia itself, there were just marches a month ago against political corruption and authoritarianism. Tens of thousands of people. Our government did nothing. Why? Some of them are on the payroll of Russian autocrats, and others just don’t care. We should be on the side of the people of Russia who are fighting for democracy, fighting for religious freedom, fighting for human rights. That is what America should be about. That is what is really at stake here. Our government should not be consumed with selfinterest and promoting people’s corporate agendas. It should not be consumed with the personal vanity of the President. It should not be about private agendas. It should be about the public good of the American people and standing with democracies all over the Earth. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS: DIRECTOR COMEY FIRING The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). She has been such a champion on progressive issues for so long. BARBARA LEEstill speaks for me across the country. Ms. LEE. Let me thank Congresswoman JAYAPAL for yielding and for holding this important issue on this existential threat to our democracy. Also, I just have to say that she has just hit the ground running here on behalf of the American people, on behalf of working men and women, on behalf of peace and security in the world, on behalf of our democracy. So I thank her for her leadership. The constant stream of allegations and scandals springing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is really quite shocking. I have to admit that, after watching President Trump fire the FBI Director who was investigating him, I thought things could not get any worse. But just days later, President Trump blundered into sharing classified intelligence with Russian officials. As the Nation and the world grappled with the aftermath of this revelation, yet more shocking news was breaking. The New York Times has alleged that, before he was fired, Director Comey was pressured by President Trump to shut down an ongoing investigation into General Michael Flynn’s possible collusion with the Russians. Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear with the American people. If The New York Times report is true, President Trump’s attempts to influence a Federal probe can only be described in one way, and that is obstruction of justice. And, yes, we all know obstruction of justice is an impeachable offense. Right now, one thing, though, is crystal clear: The President’s abuse of power has plunged this Nation into a fullblown constitutional crisis. This crisis goes far beyond party interests. Every American, Democrat or Republican, should be concerned by these allegations. President Trump’s actions have threatened national security, the rule of law, and the independence of our Nation’s justice system. His actions dishonor the Office of the Presidency and place this Nation and our allies in danger. The reports of last week underscore the need to establish a bipartisan, independent commission to get to the bottom of Russian interference in our elections once and for all. It is vitally important that Director Mueller—and I am very pleased that the Department of Justice appointed him; this is one step in the right direction—be given the resources and the autonomy to conduct an investigation. Unfortunately, President Trump said that this investigation is a witch hunt. Nothing could be further from the truth. The American people deserve to know the facts about possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Our democracy must be defended at all costs. I thank Congresswoman JAYAPAL for giving us a chance to speak tonight about this very dangerous moment that we are in, about Presidential abuse, and, really, about the preservation of our democracy. The Congressional Progressive Caucus continues to lead on so many issues that are important to this country and to the world. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ), who has also been a leader in the Progressive Caucus on so many issues, from the death penalty to immigration to healthcare. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman JAYAPAL and the Congressional Progressive Caucus for convening this 1 hour discussion about our democracy at risk. I don’t think it is really an exaggeration that what we are seeing right now is our democracy actually under attack. Unfortunately, it is from our own White House. I think Americans around the country, regardless of their political party or even political persuasion, are kind of shaking their head and saying: What the heck is going on? Every day, there is some sort of a new and disturbing revelation. We found out that the President of the United States just seems to have blurted out highly, highly classified information in a meeting with the Russian Ambassador and the Russian Foreign Minister—information that was passed on, it seems, from the Israelis, but actually could put some of the people who are doing the most delicate work on the ground in some danger. And then, of course, last week, the President fired the FBI Director, James Comey. As a Democrat, I certainly have had problems in the past with James Comey. I think that he helped influence the outcome of the election. But it turns out that on national television the President basically admitted, after giving various explanations of the firing, that it came down to the Russian investigation. Then we find out that James Comey actually took notes of a meeting with the President where the President asked him to drop the investigation of General Flynn and his connection to the Russians. It is a real question of what is going on. It was an important step when, yesterday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took the important first step of appointing a special counsel to investigate the Russia connection and the relationship between this administration of President Trump and the Russians. 
I am really happy. I was on the Intelligence Committee when Robert Mueller was the FBI Director. I have to tell you that I feel very confident in his independence and his integrity. I know that he, importantly, would not allow the FBI to work with the CIA when they wanted to torture people, essentially, by using enhanced interrogation techniques. So I feel good that he is a very good choice. But having done that, today I was happy to sign a discharge petition to create an independent commission that would also be looking into even the larger picture about what was going on with the Russian influence campaign involving itself in our elections, and then also, what was the connection between the Trump administration, Donald Trump himself, did they collude on influencing the election? It is important to do both. They are complementary. They don’t do the same thing. I am going to quote from ADAM SCHIFF , who is our ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. I think he put it really well: ‘‘The value an independent commission adds is you have a body that is truly independent of any political consideration and also has all the resources it needs and a single focus on the oversight of what Russia did, how we need to respond in the future, and it brings that political independence and staff and resources on task. So those are two different needs, and I think they’re complementary, not in competition with each other.’’ The other reason I am very much in support not only of the special prosecutor, but of the independent commission is because, then, Congress has a role here. Congress itself is saying— hopefully, Republicans and Democrats. We have two Republicans right now on our discharge petition that would force the bill to come to the floor that would say that we, together, think that this is worthy, our democracy is worthy of this kind of indepth investigation. Finally, let me say we would find out a lot about the relationship of the President and Russia, plus other conflicts of interest, if we could see his tax returns, like every other President has done. Release his tax returns. Again, I would hope that this has not devolved into strictly a partisan issue. All Americans should say: Let us look at those ties the President may have in countries around the world or with companies at home. Ms. JAYAPAL. Again, I am very pleased as the Congressional Progressive Caucus to be able host a Special Order every week. We pick a different topic every week, for those of you that are just beginning to listen. This week we want to focus attention on what we believe are some of the most serious and pressing issues facing our country today around the Trump administration’s ties to Russia, around the firing of James Comey, and the many, many issues that have come forward over the last several months, but certainly in the last week. Since last Tuesday, we have borne witness to a slew of alarming events within the White House and the Department of Justice. Last Tuesday afternoon, we received word that the President had fired FBI Director James Comey from his position. That position, by the way, is a 10 year term. Congress designated it as a 10year term specifically to ensure that we could protect any administration and the entire country against any conflict of interest that may come up. Obviously, that did not convince the President that he should keep Director Comey. So we heard that he fired him. It seems as if each morning we wake up to a barrage of firings, tweets, or untruths that continue to erode the public’s confidence in our democracy. So what do we know today? Certainly, we don’t know enough, but we do know that the President fired Director Comey under the guise of being unsatisfied with how he handled Secretary Hillary Clinton’s email investigation. b1745 But if that were the case, then why didn’t he fire him months ago? Why now? Why did he choose to meet with Russian officials the day after firing Mr. Comey? Mr. Trump’s attempts to use Clinton’s emails to divert attention from Comey’s investigation into the campaign’s ties to Russia are, unfortunately, very disingenuous, and I think that they are proving to be unsuccessful. Despite his claims that Mr. Comey was not investigating him, the President must have been concerned about what Director Comey would find because the firing, interestingly, came just days after Director Comey had requested additional resources for the investigation. White House officials attempted at first to say that the blame for the firing was Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s fault. They said it was at his recommendation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions weighed in on that decision as well. But, in fact, shortly after, the President went on television and said that, no, this was his decision regardless of what had been proposed, this is where he was going to be. On Wednesday, just 1 day after firing thenDirector Comey, the President welcomed the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov; and the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, into the Oval Office for a closed press meeting. Let’s not forget that Kislyak met with former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn during the campaign, a meeting that Flynn then lied about. I think this is very important because there were a number of Trump administration or Trump campaign officials that met with Russian officials over the course of many months before the election. Those meetings in and of themselves are not a problem. The problem, however, is that these individuals continued to lie about those meetings, and that makes you wonder: What fire is there where the smoke is? Why would they lie about these things? We certainly don’t know that. We have been unable to get the transcripts of that conversation because the President has not been willing to release them. Russian President Vladimir Putin is more willing to make that information public than our own President, but I find it outrageous that President Putin would actually propose to be sort of the backup of this information for the President. We are not looking to President Putin to provide corroboration of these meetings. We actually need an independent ability to look at the facts of this case. On Monday, the news exploded with reports that the President released highly classified information to Lavrov and Kislyak during their discussion at the White House. This is extremely alarming. It is true that the President has the right to declassify any information, but the information that was shared was so sensitive that the United States had not even shared it with our allies. The President’s decision to divulge that information to foreign officials—particularly Russian officials with whom our relationship is contentious at best—is dangerous and reckless. There is no doubt in my mind that this will hinder our ability to build international coalitions to actually be able to share information with allies who provide that classified information to us with the understanding that we are going to protect that and guard that. Should any classified information then be declassified for some reason, it is done in consultation with the country that provided that information and with national security advisors. None of that happened in this situation. President Trump also tweeted during the campaign that Hillary Clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive and highly classified information. So this seems like a particular irony. The President claimed that Hillary Clinton’s lack of ability to handle classified information actually made her unfit to be President. Speaker PAULRYAN said this: ‘‘It is simple: Individuals who are ‘extremely careless’ with classified information should be denied further access to it.’’ Reince Priebus, Trump’s Chief of Staff, took it one step further, saying: ‘‘Those who mishandled classified info have had their sec clearances revoked, lost their jobs, faced fines, and even been sent to prison.’’ So this is a situation that we have to take extremely seriously. Before we could even fully engage and vet that news, however, reports then came out that President Trump had actually asked FBI Director James 
Comey to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn. According to sources close to Comey, this request came just 1 day after Michael Flynn was fired. This is truly a new low. If this is true— and we are trying to get to the bottom of this—it would absolutely constitute an obstruction of justice. The President has put obstacle after obstacle in the way of any real investigation that gives us the information that we need to protect our national security and the American people. In the 118 days since the Trump Presidency began, it has been scandal after scandal. The latest events have escalated this crisis to an even higher level. As I mentioned, the FBI Director serves a 10year term specifically in order to be able to carry out these independent investigations free of partisanship or political pressure. The firing of James Comey and the fact that he was asked by the President for loyalty—again, this is apparently in Director Comey’s memo, which we hope to be able to see—and to abandon the investigation against Michael Flynn are extremely serious offenses. They hurt our democracy and they hurt our country. The President has tried to distract us time and time again, but we actually know that the American people deserve better. History smiles kindly on those who stand up and put country over party and on those who ensure that in the darkest of times and the most difficult of times, the times when we face a constitutional crisis, where our Nation wonders what direction we are going in, the times when we know that the need to preserve the institutions of democracy and justice are most necessary, those are the times when we need people to speak out on both sides of the aisle for the facts, for the truth, and for democracy. This should not be a partisan issue. We are seeing that starting to emerge from our colleagues across the aisle. I commend those Republicans who have begun to ask for information, documents, and hearings; and I hope that more of my colleagues will join us in the pursuit of truth and in the pursuit of justice. Last night we received news that Robert Mueller, who is the former FBI Director, has been appointed as special counsel for the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties with Russia. This is an extremely distinguished man. He has served the country with tremendous success and loyalty, and we are hopeful that Mr. Mueller will diligently investigate the allegations against Michael Flynn and other members of the Trump campaign with veracity and free from political influence. However, we still maintain that an independent commission is necessary because a special counsel answers to the Attorney General, who can then overrule decisions that they make or even fire them at any time. So the appointment of Robert Mueller is a good first step, but it cannot be the last. Director Mueller will still be in the chain of command under the Trumpappointed leadership of the Justice Department. He cannot take the place of a truly independent outside commission that is free from Trump’s meddling. I think that is why it is so important that we all join in signing the discharge petition that was introduced yesterday by my colleagues, Representative SWALWELL and Representative CUMMINGS , who is the ranking member on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. This discharge petition would essentially allow for a bill to move forward that would establish an independent commission that we could truly trust to seek justice. The commission would interview witnesses, would obtain documents, would issue subpoenas, and would receive public testimony in order to examine whether or not the Russian Government did, in fact, interfere with U.S. elections and how they carried that out. This is a really crucial step to take because it is not only about the short term and the immediacy of what is in front of us—extremely important, the commission would deal with that as well—but it is also about how do we ensure that these things don’t happen again? What did happen, first of all, and how do we make sure that we continue to protect our democracy in the face of what 17 independent intelligence agencies said, which is that the Russians hacked our election in the United States? There is a lot we need to understand. We need the special counsel, but we also need this independent citizen commission not made up of Members of Congress, but appointed by the House and the Senate leaders of both parties in equal numbers so that we could actually have people who look at this from the perspective of all of America and not tainted by even the vestiges or the appearance of party. Apparently when President Trump heard that special counsel had been named, he laughed out loud, saying that this is ‘‘the greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.’’ No, Mr. President, we are seeking the truth. As the American people have shown us, they are not backing down, and we will continue to fight for this truth. Now, in that vein, I also wanted to mention that my colleague, Representative RASKIN , and I actually introduced a package of bills that we are calling the Trump transparency package. It is because we really believe that the American people deserve better. We believe that the American people deserve from us transparency. So what this package will do is, first, it will clearly forbid government officials from accepting anything of value from foreign governments in exchange for an official act. It would prohibit government employees from using their positions to further the financial interests of the President. It would ensure that the President’s press pool continues to exist so that the American people receive honest answers, and it would require the President and his family to publicly report any foreign business deals that exceed $10,000. These are simple steps. They are not egregious and they are not outrageous. They would apply to anyone. They are not partisan. They are about transparency and accountability so that we know that the President of the United States and that others in government are actually accountable to the American people—not to their financial interests, not to their bank accounts, not to their stock portfolios, not to their hotels and golf courses, but to the American people. We have to hold every administration—and certainly this one—accountable. So now, more than ever, it is our moral duty to defend the Constitution, and this bill package goes a step in the right direction. So I hope that all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would actually cosponsor the Trump transparency package with us so that we can continue to fight for the American people, for democracy, and for the notion that America is willing to question itself and for the notion that America is willing to always put our hands on that moral arc of the universe to push it more quickly towards justice. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CHENEY). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President and are further reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. 
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for 30 minutes. 
Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, first, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues, to talk about restoring Congress’ constitutional oversight on matters of war and peace. I invite all of my colleagues to join me in demanding that this House immediately repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Nearly 16 years ago, Congress passed an openended, blank check for endless war. This authorization gives any President the authority to wage limitless war at any time, anywhere, for any reason in perpetuity. The vote to relinquish our constitutional authority occurred just 3 days after the horrific terrorist attacks on 9/11. The American 
people were angry and anxious to take action. Madam Speaker, I was just as outraged and devastated as every other American, but I voted against this 2001 AUMF because I believed then—as I believe now—that it was a blank check and set the stage for perpetual war. This House rushed to pass the 60 word authorization with little debate. Sixty words, Madam Speaker, drastically altered history. In the almost 16 years since its passage, the 2001 AUMF—which was designed, mind you, to punish the perpetrators of the brutal and deadly attacks on September 11— has been used now by three Presidents to wage endless war around the globe. A recent report from the Congressional Research Service shows that this authorization has been used more than 37 times in 14 countries to justify military action. b1800 These include operations at Guantanamo Bay, warrantless wiretapping, and recent military actions in Libya, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and many more. This report only looks at unclassified military actions. I would like to now yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ), who has been such a leader on so many issues, especially around issues of our constitutional responsibility, issues around war and peace. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Congresswoman for having this Special Order to address this issue and for continuing to be such a leader on behalf of this great democracy that we have. Although I was not in Congress when this AUMF was established, more than 15 years later, it is clear this authorization is not designed for this endless and perpetual war on terror. I commend the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for her bravery and her unwavering stance for what is right. Sadly, what the gentlewoman feared is now our reality. Just today, U.S. forces participated in an airstrike against the Assad regime under the umbrella of the same AUMF. This is just the latest example of this virtual endless war we are able to wage in the Middle East and beyond. As of January 2013, DOD reported 7,008 U.S. military deaths in the war on terror in addition to the over 50,000 that have been wounded. This does not include the huge numbers of civilians killed and families that have been impacted by the U.S. military machine. This is compounded by the harsh reality that, according to Pentagon statistics, suicide, not combat, is the leading killer of U.S. troops deployed to the Middle East to fight Islamic State militants. Between 2001 and 2010, the rate of suicide in the military has doubled. When we decide to commit our troops to our mission, it needs to be with clear goals and the explicit approval of Congress, approval that aligns with the goals of the administration and the Commander in Chief. Anything less puts personnel at risk, draining vital resources, finances, and our military. We are taking our military away from readiness everywhere. We are making tactical and deliberate actions less feasible by spreading our military capacity thin. We are not doing our job if we allow carte blanche to any President to wage a nebulous war. This is not just a bipartisan issue, this is an American issue. I have voted against funding bills that maintain operations under the 2001 AUMF under the previous administration and feel no differently today. Quite frankly, based on the actions of this President, I have even less confidence that he has a reasonable and targeted plan to deal with such a complex military issue. We need a deliberate process. We need a new AUMF that establishes strict parameters, attainable goals, and, most importantly, accountability. There is a real cost here, a human cost here; so whether it is an additional 1 or 1,000, our troops demand more, our allies demand more, and this country of ours deserves more. Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ) for that very powerful statement and also for reminding us that this should not be a partisan issue. With that, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), who has been very diligent in his effort to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for organizing this very important Special Order. This is something that she has been a champion on. This is my third term, and we have been talking about this for 4 years. Enough is enough. It is time to end this. I rise today in support of Congress reclaiming its authority under Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution. The United States must have a clear strategy with welldefined goals to counter nonstate actors like ISIS that threaten the United States. They threaten our national security interests. We must also develop clear legal authority for our military to take action against these groups. Ending the 2001 AUMF is a crucial part of that effort. According to scholars at Brown University’s Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs, our government, our taxpayers, have spent $4.8 trillion on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, paid for almost entirely by borrowing. As of today, 6,925 American soldiers have given their lives serving our country in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Inherent Resolve, and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, according to the Department of Defense. But what about the costs to take care of these young men and women for the next 60, 70, and 80 years in our country? While our brave men and women in uniform continue to fight in the sands of Iraq and Syria and the mountains of Afghanistan, we have gone through three Presidential administrations without a statement articulating what victory is, except that ‘‘terrorism must be defeated.’’ No one disagrees with that goal, but it is an uncertain way to order our Nation’s military posture and to commit our young men and women in the military serving this Nation without a clear, defined goal. We have been at war in Afghanistan for 16 years, yet the Taliban controls or contests 40 percent of Afghan districts, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. The U.S. intelligence community’s worldwide threat assessment states that ‘‘the overall situation in Afghanistan will very likely continue to deteriorate, even if international support is sustained,’’ and that ‘‘endemic state weaknesses, the government’s political fragility, deficiencies of the Afghan National Security Forces, Taliban persistence, and regional interference will remain key impediments to improvement.’’ In addition to Afghanistan, the United States has also been involved in Iraq, on and off, since 2003. Dr. James Zogby of the Arab American Institute conducted a poll of Iraqi public opinion in 2016, which found that 94 percent of Iraqis had an unfavorable attitude about the United States. Ninetyfour percent of Iraqis polled say they do not think the U.S. contributes to peace and stability in the Arab world. We need a much clearer strategy for our men and women in uniform than to tell them just to keep doing the same thing over and over again. We all know what the definition of insanity is, and we need to do better for them and for our partners around the world. Our Nation has arrived at a historic and constitutional moment. Prior to President Trump’s inauguration, President Obama released a framework outlining his administration’s formal legal view on the use of military force against Islamic terror groups around the globe. That report relied heavily on the 2001 AUMF, which has been used to justify numerous American military operations against an everexpanding number of terror groups, many of which have only slight links to the perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, attacks. In reality, our loose interpretation of the 2001 AUMF to have a perpetual war against terror might as well be using the authorization that Thomas Jefferson used to go after the Barbary pirates on the shores of Tripoli the way this has been stretched over and over again. It is unconscionable. I hope that President Trump’s administration will not continue to rely 
on that same legal framework but, rather, that he will formally ask Congress to pass a new authorization with a clear directive of what success is for the use of force that will not perpetually operate in constitutional gray areas. Strikes against groups like al Shabaab in Somalia take place in constitutional twilight zones where the Constitution’s distribution of authority to use force is uncertain, as Justice Jackson wrote in Youngstown v. Sawyer. To better preserve our Constitution’s separation of powers structure, Congress must make it a priority to develop clear legal authority for American military action against Islamist terror organizations. Further, such authorization should be structured so it will not turn into the expanding grant of power like the 2001 AUMF has done. If we fail to pass a new AUMF, it would do our servicemen and women, as well as the American public, a fundamental disservice. It would prolong authorization of an endless war. It is time to end the Middle East conflict. Let’s end the authorization of the 2001 AUMF. Right now, I fear that many of our military operations do not have congressional authorization and do not comply with the clear statement of Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution that gives Congress the power to declare war. To show our servicemen and women we support them, to uphold the Constitution, and for the good of our Nation, I hope we can work on the passage of a new AUMF with deliberate speed. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. Her commitment to this cause is commendable. Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman YOHO for his clear and concise statement laying out how explicit the Constitution is as it relates to matters of war and peace and how we must debate both if we are going to continue to use force. We look forward to a bipartisan effort this year to get us where we need to be, and that is to repeal this authorization. I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker, I yield now to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ), who is the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and whom I served with on the committee for many years, and who really has a very clear understanding of foreign and military policy and has been such a leader on so many issues and someone on whom we rely on so many fronts. Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman LEE. We are all grateful to you for being so clear and so principled. As I have often said, Congress must fulfill its constitutional obligation to consider an updated AUMF, and as my colleagues said, that stands for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. Right now, the administration is still using the authorization we passed after September 11, 2001, in the legal justification to fight ISIS. That is deeply problematic. The 2001 AUMF has none of the limits many of us are seeking. We are a Congress. We are not a rubber stamp to any President. We have a right to vote on issues such as war and peace. U.S. leadership to defeat ISIS is critical, but this doesn’t require a large scale deployment of U.S. forces. With American leadership, we were able to prevent the wholesale slaughter of the Yazidi people. Iraqi partners were able to maintain control of the Mosul Dam, which, if breached by ISIS, could have resulted in death and displacement of up to 2 million people and endangered American personnel in Iraq. With our support, local forces have taken back about 80 percent of the territory from ISIS in Iraq and Syria. So another largescale, openended commitment of American troops is certainly not the answer. The disastrous intervention in Iraq last decade set the stage for the rise of ISIS in the first place. The 2001 AUMF has no limits at all on U.S. ground troops. As troop levels continue to rise in the fight against ISIS, we just cannot put our heads in the sand. We need to sit together as a deliberative body and make these important decisions, not give any President or any administration a blank check. I am working on legislation to limit the authority Congress provided after September 11. We need to tailor this authority to the threat we face today. September 11 happened 16 years ago. We need new parameters to define our mission and our goals. I voted for that AUMF 16 years ago, but I never would have imagined that 16 years later it would still be there and give a blank check to any President who would use it anytime, anyplace, and to do anything. So we must fulfill our constitutional responsibility and consider what an appropriate authorization should include. Using a 2001 authorization for a 2017 conflict sets a terrible constitutional precedent. Congress has a vital constitutional responsibility over America’s war powers. This is one of the most important decisions we are charged with making. When we fail to live up to that responsibility, we weaken the balance of power that is the bedrock of our democracy. Considering an updated AUMF is not easy, but it is our job. We should do our job. President Obama came to Congress well over a year ago with a proposed AUMF. Not many people cared for it, but it was a proposed AUMF. We could have changed it—it was a starting point—but we didn’t do it. We threw it away because it just got too hard. That cannot happen again. Congress has a responsibility to do its part here, and, unfortunately, we are not meeting that responsibility. We owe it to the American people and we owe it our men and women in uniform to do our job. Congressional inaction on an AUMF is inexcusable. b1815 I want to say that it a separate issue from the recent strikes against Assad. Congress has made no authorization whatsoever for sustained military action against Assad. The 60day clock started ticking when the President notified Congress of his missile strike. The administration must come to Congress on that issue as well. There cannot be longterm military action against Assad without Congressional sayso. Assad is a bad guy, and I think that he should be deposed, quite frankly. I think that any future for Syria cannot include Assad, who has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people. But whether the United States must involve itself in every single war and ground troops using an outdated authorization for the use of force just strikes me as being something that should not happen and will lead us down a path in the future where we can’t get out of it. I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). She has always stood up for her beliefs, whether they seem popular or unpopular when it happened. That is just the kind of people we want to serve in Congress: someone who speaks out and has been a consistent fighter. I am proud to join with her tonight, and I hope that more colleagues on both sides of the aisle will understand that this is an important constitutional principle. It is not a matter of who is in power, who is the President, what party has the majority. As Americans and as legislators, we should all be very concerned about giving any President a blank check to go to war. Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) for that very powerful statement and for really laying out the fact that Congress is missing in action and that this resolution, this AUMF, must be repealed so that we can move forward and make some determinations as to what Congress’ role will be and what we think should happen in terms of our strategy as it relates to going to war. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) for being here tonight and I thank him for his leadership and his expertise. Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. JONES ), who has been a friend, a supporter, who constantly is talking about why we need to protect our troops, support our troops, keep them out of harm’s way, support our veterans. He is a great American, and I have the pleasure of working with him on so many issues. Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for the leadership and also this opportunity. I could not agree more with where we are and why we are on the floor tonight. 
If you believe in the Constitution, which the majority of us do because we raise our hands when we are sworn in, then we need to do our constitutional responsibility. What has been said tonight by my colleagues and will be ended by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) in just a few minutes is the fact that we do not do our constitutional duty or responsibility. The 2001 AUMF to talk about going after Osama bin Laden after 9/11, meaning Afghanistan, made sense. The AUMF in 2002 should have never passed this House. I regret that I voted for it because Iraq was an unnecessary war. But that is history now. What we are talking about is learning from history and dealing with the present and the future. Therefore, there is no reason that the leadership of the House, Mr. RYAN, will not permit the committees of jurisdiction to bring forward a new AUMF. It could be a blanket AUMF or it could mean Syria or maybe Afghanistan. I have joined with colleagues on the other side, including the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), to put in H.R. 1666 that says, after 16 years, there needs to be a debate on the future involvement of the American people and the military into Afghanistan. We have 300 Members of Congress sitting on the floor day in and day out who have never been part of a debate or a vote on the future of Afghanistan. After 16 years, $800 billion spent, 2,000 Americans killed and 20,000 wounded, if we do not have a debate on whether we stay in Afghanistan or we talk about coming home, then our leadership in the House are not doing their constitutional duty either. Madam Speaker, tonight I wanted to be very supportive, as I will be. The gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) and I have been on each other’s bills as it deals with Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq. It is time for us to demand from our leadership—I do not blame the Presidents, whether it be Trump or Obama, I do not blame them, because it is our responsibility. James Madison was very clear, and I am going to paraphrase very quickly. It is the legislative branch that will debate and declare war, not the executive branch. What we have done with these AUMFs from 2001 and 2002, we have abdicated our responsibilities. I know how the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) feels, and all those who spoke tonight and those who are not here tonight to speak, how we all feel. But it is up to us to demand from our leadership. Don’t wait for a President to give direction, because Madison was very clear. It is our responsibility. Madam Speaker, I have written five or six letters to Mr. RYAN, the Speaker of the House. I have written him additional letters with my colleagues on the other side asking him to permit us to meet our constitutional responsibility. At this point we have had no luck, and I am asking Mr. RYAN tonight, the Speaker of the House, to direct the committees of jurisdiction to come forward with one of these bills that have been introduced by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) and other Members of the Democratic Party and those of us in the Republican Party to come forward and let’s have a refresher course, so to speak, on the constitutional responsibility. I have Camp Lejeune Marine Base in my district. I talked to marines as recently as 2 weeks ago. One has been five times to Afghanistan. He said it is not worth a dime to be there. We are spending billions and billions of dollars, and kids still getting killed. I have signed over 10,000 letters to families and extended families who have lost loved ones because I knew I should never have voted to go into Iraq. That is my mistake, and I am living with my mistake. But what I am trying to do now is to join you and others to say we have a constitutional responsibility to debate war. If we are going to send our young men and women to die in war, we need to debate it. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for this opportunity. I look forward to working with her as we go forward. I think we really need to put pressure on the leadership to allow us to meet our responsibilities. I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for giving me this opportunity to be here with my colleagues. Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. JONES ) for his statement tonight and for his leadership. I think, listening to him, listening to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), and working with our colleagues in a bipartisan way, you know, we have to keep hope alive on this because our young men and women, our Constitution, our country, deserves it. You have been here from the beginning in terms of trying to help put Congress back into action because we have been missing in action. Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ), my colleague from the Silicon Valley, right next door to my district, who has come to Congress and has hit the ground running. He is a true advocate on so many issues as it relates to peace and justice and security. Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for her vision in making sure Congress votes on matters of war and peace. When we were attacked, after 9/11, I, like many Americans, supported strikes on the people who attacked us. But no one in this country would have thought that a resolution would be used for perpetual war. Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) had the courage back then and the foresight to stand up with courage and stand up against a resolution that has provided a blank check for the last 16 years. I do believe that that is the type of political courage that one day will be remembered in history, and I applaud the gentlewoman for that. We have seen that, since 2001, the terrorists, which were contained on the AfghanistanPakistan border, have spread. They have spread to the Middle East. They have spread to Africa. And it is about time that we ask: What have all these interventions gotten us? And this is not a partisan issue, as the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) has mentioned and as the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. JONES ) just articulated. It goes back to our founding principles of John Quincy Adams, an early President who said: ‘‘We ought not to go overseas to slay monsters.’’ And he said the reason we shouldn’t do that is we should give people who seek freedom our voice and our prayers; but if we go out to destroy monsters, we actually will be seen not as a liberating force, but as a dictatorial force because we often won’t know who the truly freedomseeking people are. I wish every Member of Congress, every Senator would read John Quincy Adams’ insight so that we had more restraint. Consider the issue of Afghanistan, where 40 percent of the country is not under our control. And here is the thing: I know this region. I was born here. But being of South Asian origin, on the PakistanIndia border, where there are 3,000 terrorists, there are 150,000 troops to take care of that. Does anyone think sending 10,000 troops again and again has accomplished anything? It has not. All it is doing is further antagonizing people and putting our troops at risk. Then when we called for regime change in 2011 with Syria and Assad, we made Syria a magnet for terrorist groups. Now in Yemen, where we are aiding the Saudi Arabian Government, which is aligned, ironically, with al Qaida, and alQaida, which has claimed responsibility for the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber in this country, we are aiding and intervening in a place where we are actually supporting groups that are harming us. All the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) is saying is we ought to debate these issues, that the American people ought to know what these interventions are getting us; why they are not making us more safe and why we are not having a thoughtful policy. Madam Speaker, I applaud the gentlewoman from California’s (Ms. LEE) vision and I applaud her leadership. I know that history will vindicate her. Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ) for those kind words, but also for his clarity and his vision and understanding that we must repeal this authorization to use force and put Congress back in the mix where we should have been from day one. I want to 
thank him again very much for being here. Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) has 1 minute remaining. Ms. LEE. I will close now. Once again, I ask our Speaker a very simple question, and that is why he has not scheduled a debate on this vital issue that affects our national security. We asked over and over again for a vote to repeal this authorization. We want a debate and we want to have a new vote based on the current realities of what is taking place as it relates to the use of force by our own government. In February of 2015, Congressman ELIOT ENGEL mentioned that President Obama sent to Congress an ISISspecific AUMF, and it was never taken up. There were no actions, no hearings, no formal debate. Not one vote. We have a new President that is continuing to use the outdated 2001 AUMF in expanded ways, including justifying sending more troops to fight ISIS in Syria and spending more taxpayer dollars on war and putting our young men and women in harm’s way. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank all of the Members who were here last night. Let’s hope that this discussion will help more Members come to the floor and talk about why we need the Speaker to bring up the bill to repeal the authorization to use force. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. SWALWELL of California (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today through May 25 on account of birth of child.
