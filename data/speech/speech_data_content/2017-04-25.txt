Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Mr. Ryan Ziem’s American Government students at Arnold High School the very best luck in their upcoming advanced placement exam. I visited these students last fall, and I was impressed by their articulate questions and commitment to understanding our system of government. Of course, understanding our system of government means understanding the U.S. Constitution. It is the greatest gift left to us by the Founders, and it has stood the test of time. The success of the Constitution is due to its carefully designed system of checks and balances. By separating the powers of government into separate but equal branches and guaranteeing individual rights, the Constitution has been, as James Madison suggested, ‘‘the guardian of true liberty.’’ Mr. Speaker, please join me in wishing these bright young students good luck on their AP exam and in their college applications. f 
CONFRONTING TRUMP ON ANTI SCIENCE AGENDA AND TAXES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday was Earth Day, and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people across this country had to march in favor of science because, not since Galileo was condemned by the Inquisition for asserting that the Earth orbits the Sun, not since Galileo was condemned by the Inquisition have science deniers had such powerful friends. Our species went 1,000 years without science. We call those years, in retrospect, the Dark Ages. My time in this Congress has convinced me that we should be guided by scientific consensus, by scientific facts, not alternative facts. Scientific fact: Climate change is real and predominantly manmade, and if we don’t reduce our emission of greenhouse gasses, then we are going to lose our ports, our beaches, our health, and entire countries like the Maldives. Another scientific fact: Donald Trump can’t stop global warming just by emitting an unprecedented volume of hot air. Now, a week earlier we had tax day, and millions of Americans across this country, including in Los Angeles, needed to demonstrate to try to get Donald Trump to reveal his tax returns. Every President since Richard Nixon has released their tax returns. Donald Trump told us in May of 2014: If I decide to run for office, I will produce my tax returns. And he said it again a year later. And then he said it during the Republican debate in 2016. He said: Oh, I will release my tax returns, but they are under audit. Well, according to Donald Trump, his 2011 and 2012 returns aren’t under audit. He ought to release those. But he ought to release all of his tax returns. And this idea that they are under audit is absolutely absurd. The IRS has made it clear: Any taxpayer can release their tax return, whether they are under audit or not, and everyone in the tax world—I headed the second largest tax agency in this country for several years, I am a CPA— knows that you can release your tax returns whether you are under audit or not. Now, I understand that you don’t want to release information to your adversary, and if you are being audited, the IRS is your adversary. But Donald Trump knows that the IRS already has his tax returns, so who is the adversary from which Donald Trump is withholding information? The American people are the adversary that cannot see his tax return that the IRS already has. But it is not enough to just see Donald Trump’s Form 1040, because he tells us that he has 532 private businesses, secret businesses in the sense that they do not report their financial information to the SEC, over 532 of those business entity investments. We need to see the tax returns of every business entity that Trump controls. Over 100 of 
those investments are in foreign countries. We need to see the tax returns of Trump Panama Hotel, LLC; Trump Korea, LLC; DT Dubai Golf Course, LLC; and all the business entities that he has that are doing business in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and China. Finally, Donald Trump ran as a populist, especially on corporate issues, but now he wants to allow corporate inversions that provide tax benefits to corporate Benedict Arnolds who betray our country and incorporate in some foreign country. He refuses to designate China as a currency manipulator, even though he pledged to the American people during his rallies that he would do just that, and he refuses to do anything about Chinese requirements for coproduction agreements. Donald Trump: His rallies sounded like BERNIE SANDERS , but he is governing like Goldman Sachs. 
DELIVERING FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNN). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, for generations our Nation has celebrated the American Dream. I call it the American promise, the simple idea that if you work hard, you will be rewarded. The American promise means that, if you show up for work every morning and play by the rules, you will be able to take care of your family and, over time, your life will improve. Unfortunately, for many Americans, that promise no longer rings true today. Before the election of Donald Trump, more than 50 percent of Americans saw our economic conditions worsening, and 50 percent of millennials think the American Dream is dead. When it comes to economic security for low and middleincome workers, we flatlined: paychecks have frozen, and American families are having a harder and harder time making ends meet. As an uncle of mine used to say: When it came to the end of the month, it seems like you got more month than money to pay your bills. We need a renewed focus on improving the lives of everyday working Americans. That is why the Republican Policy Committee, which I chair, launched a task force for the American worker, and our first hearing is today. It is time to start delivering for the American worker and restoring the American promise. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 10 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. POLIQUIN ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day. The House returns from a long recess meeting with constituents as concerns about budget, taxes, and immigration, among others, reveal the considerable divisions both in Congress and among the American populace as well. As opinions and emotions surge loudly and with little indication of easy solution, we take this quiet moment to ask Your blessing upon the Members of this people’s House. Give each Member peace and quiet discernment to work toward common solutions that might ease our divisions and open the way to new hope and confidence that we as a nation will continue to shine as an example for all the world to emulate. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. LANCE led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
NORTH KOREA (Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my deep concern regarding the dangerous and irresponsible actions of the Kim Jongun regime in North Korea on behalf of the people of Orange County and the Korean Americans I represent. This week marks the 85th anniversary of the founding of the North Korean Army. The North Korean military marked the occasion by conducting a large scale artillery drill in the coastal region of Wonsan on the Sea of Japan. Make no mistake, this was a direct message to our ally, South Korea, where millions, including nearly 30,000 U.S. troops, are within range of the North Korean artillery. This drill comes on the heels of North Korea’s threat to destroy U.S. aircraft carriers. Mr. Speaker, North Korea is the top threat facing the American people. North Korea’s efforts to extend the range of their ballistic missiles, while working to miniaturize a nuclear warhead, will eventually place the West Coast of the United States under direct nuclear threat. Intelligence experts estimate that the regime will be capable of striking the West Coast in less than 4 years. That is an unacceptable risk for U.S. national security and an intolerable threat facing the residents of Orange County. I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning the recent North Korean provocations, demanding comprehensive sanctions on the North Korean regime, and supporting all actions necessary to secure the safety of our Nation and allies. f 
REMEMBERING RUBY ARNOLD (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, while it is widely known that Horace Peterson of Kansas City was the visionary and sole founder of the Black Archives of MidAmerica, it is little known who saved the institution from vanishing years later. During the spring of 1998, Ruby Arnold, a diehard board member, began a personal crusade to secure a new home for the organization she held dear. One Monday morning, during a heavy rainstorm, Ruby Arnold appeared at the front desk of the 29th floor of city hall. The security guard asked her if she had an appointment with anyone in particular. ‘‘I don’t have an appointment,’’ she said, ‘‘but I have come to see Mayor Emanuel Cleaver.’’ The assistant to the mayor replied: I’m sorry, but the mayor is not in. A week later, Ruby came by again to see the mayor and waited two hours for an appointment that she did not have to discuss a home for the Black Archives. And then, at a public event the next week, she asked again: Mayor, have you found a place for the Black Archives? Ruby Arnold died before the opening of the new archives in the summer of 2010, but former mayor, EMANUEL  CLEAVER , now the U.S. Representative from the Fifth District, said this location for the Black Archives was not secured by wishing or hoping but by the merciful harassment I received from one determined Ruby Arnold. May God bless her remarkable spirit. 
CELEBRATING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF CAROLANN GARAFOLA (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the public service of Carolann Garafola, mayor of Warren Township, New Jersey, as she is honored by the Somerset County Federation of Republican Women as the recipient of the Millicent Fenwick Award for Outstanding Public Service. Carolann’s service as a public official began on the Warren Township planning board 30 years ago. She then became the township committeewoman for that township, a post she has held for 20 consecutive years, 6 as mayor. Carolann began her professional career working with special needs children in Glen Rock, New Jersey public schools, and is currently in her fifth year as executive director of Mt. Bethel Village in Warren, an apartment community for adults with autism, developmental disabilities, and traumatic brain injuries. The Millicent Fenwick Award for Outstanding Public Service is awarded to a woman who serves in the tradition of the late Congresswoman Fenwick, one with a strong work ethic, high integrity, and a willingness to assist those in need. I congratulate Mayor Garafola on this welldeserved recognition. 
RECOGNIZING ROTARY INTERNATIONAL’S SUCCESS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, through my service to South Carolina’s Second Congressional District and as past CayceWest Columbia Rotary Club president, I appreciate Rotary International’s work in promoting worldwide Service Above Self. In coordination with national governments, Rotary International created the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, producing Polio Plus as one of the most successful publicprivate health initiatives in history. The initiative has provided immunizations for more than 2.5 billion children, spared 15 million from disability, prevented over 1.5 million deaths, and has reduced polio illnesses by 99 percent. Earlier this year, I introduced H. Res. 165, recognizing Rotary International’s work on the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and supporting their ongoing services. While we have made remarkable strides, more work remains. I am grateful to support the current president of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative with Rotary International President John Germ and past Vice President Anne Matthews of Columbia, South Carolina. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy to the family of National Review conservative stalwart Kate O’Beirne. DO EVERYTHING TO SECURE THE BORDER (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for years, cries for help coming from those on the front lines of the Rio Grande have fallen on deaf ears in Washington. I have traveled to the southern border many times in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Law enforcement and citizens do the best they can with what they have got, but they are outmanned, outgunned, and outfinanced by the drug cartels and other devious actors trying to enter the United States. The Federal Government has been negligent for too long, but there is a new sheriff in town, and President Trump has promised that help is on the way. He wants to build a wall. Mr. Speaker, I believe that effective border security requires a comprehensive strategy that includes not only physical barriers in places but also increased use of technology, more boots on the ground, and more boats in the Rio Grande. The United States has amazing capabilities like aerial drones, aerostats, and seismic technology to detect crossers. Let’s use and do everything to secure the Nation. The Commander in Chief is right when he indicates border security is a matter of national security. And that is just the way it is. 
COMBATING OPIOID ABUSE (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I recently visited The Next 24, an addiction recovery residential home in New Port Richey, Florida. They do fantastic work to give those impacted by addiction a second chance. After all, the opioid crisis is not only a national epidemic; it is happening here in our local communities. Addiction knows no bounds and does not discriminate based on race, age, income, or ZIP Code. It seems like so many people have a story about how they have been affected. Thanks to the 21st Century Cures Act, Florida will soon receive $27 million in new grant funding to help fight the opioid crisis. The $27 million will go towards increasing access to treatment and recovery services, strengthening public education efforts, and improving pain management practices. This critical grant is the first of two rounds of funding to support an all handsondeck approach in Florida to combat opioid abuse and save lives. 
SOLVING OPIOID CRISIS (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, as communities across my district and across the Nation continue to deal with the crisis of opioid abuse and addiction, it is hard to imagine that a synthetic drug exists that is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is a manufactured opioid, which, especially in its illicit versions, has contributed to tens of thousands of deaths. Especially concerning is the fact that this synthetic poison can be ordered online and delivered via medical or express consignment couriers from places like China, and because of its high potency in small amounts, Fentanyl is extremely difficult for law enforcement officials and authorities to detect. That is why I have joined Congresswoman NIKITSONGAS in introducing the INTERDICT Act which will provide U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents access to the latest chemical screening devices and scientific support to both detect and intercept synthetic opioids before they can cause our communities more harm and more devastation. So I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. As both parties, we must come together, and this is one piece of a larger response to the opioid epidemic. Both parties can and must come together to solve this crisis to take on this challenge head on. 
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE ANNIVERSARY (Mr. VALADAO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the anniversary of the Armenian genocide, a horrific event impacting many of my own constituents in California. From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Empire engaged in a systematic and organized deportation and extermination of over 2 million Armenians from their homeland. It is estimated that nearly 1.5 million Armenian men, women, and children were killed and many more permanently displaced or forced to flee. I recall one Armenian genocide remembrance ceremony outside city hall in Fresno, California. During the ceremony, I was given a copy of the event invitation, which had inscribed the words of Avetis Aharonian, an influential Armenian writer and poet. It read: ‘‘If evil of this magnitude can be ignored, if our own children forget, then we deserve oblivion and earn the world’s scorn.’’ The passionate and enduring advocacy of the Armenian Americans, especially those in California’s Central Valley, is evidence that the descendants of those who escaped the genocide have not forgotten this evil or their obligation to share its lessons with the world. 
Like Armenians from around the world, our central California community has heeded Aharonian’s words, accepting his call to remember. I am proud to have recently coauthored a bipartisan letter encouraging President Trump to properly recognize the Armenian genocide. As in years past, this year I took part in the Capitol Hill remembrance ceremony and supported the Armenian Caucus’ screening of ‘‘The Promise,’’ a film made possible by Fresnonative Kirk Kerkorian that depicts the Armenian people’s will to survive. To the Armenian community throughout the United States, please know that I stand with you today and always in honoring Aharonian’s words and never forgetting all those impacted by the Armenian genocide. 
b1415 MEDIA BIAS SETS RECORD (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the biased liberal media have forgotten their responsibility to our democracy: give the American people the facts, don’t tell them what to think. A new report by the Media Research Center shows that coverage of President Trump by the broadcast networks has been 89 percent negative, higher than any other President. Is it any wonder that half of Americans disapprove of the job President Trump is doing? The real wonder is that it is not greater, given what the public hears and reads every day. According to a recent Gallup Poll, 55 percent of U.S. adults say that news organizations’ stories are ‘‘often inaccurate.’’ Only 36 percent say the media get the facts straight. Commonsense, reasonable Americans would do well to discount the liberal media since they don’t provide fair and objective information. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:

b1630 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky) at 4 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 35) authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the National Peace Officers Memorial Service and the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
H. C ONRES. 35 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
SECTION 1. USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL SERVICE. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the 36th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service (in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘Memorial Service’’), on the Capitol Grounds, in order to honor the law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty during 2016. (b) DATE OF MEMORIAL SERVICE .—The Me morial Service shall be held on May 15, 2017, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate, with preparation for the event to begin on May 11, 2017, and take down completed on May 16, 2017. 
SEC. 2. USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL HONOR GUARD AND PIPE BAND EXHIBITION. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition (in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘Exhibition’’), on the Capitol Grounds, in order to allow law enforcement representatives to exhibit their ability to demonstrate Honor Guard programs and provide for a bagpipe exhibition. (b) DATE OF EXHIBITION .—The exhibition shall be held on May 14, 2017, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Under conditions to be prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the event shall be— (1) free of admission charge and open to the public; and (2) arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress. (b) EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES .—The sponsors of the Memorial Service and Exhibition shall assume full responsibility for all expenses and liabilities incident to all activities associated with the events. 
Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol, the sponsors referred to in section 3(b) are authorized to erect upon the Capitol Grounds such stage, sound amplification devices, and other related structures and equipment, as may be required for the Memorial Service and Exhibition. 
The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40, United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements, displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, in connection with the events. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ). 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 35. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 35 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual National Police Officers’ Memorial Service and the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. These events are held each year as part of Police Week to honor the men and women who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. This use of the Capitol Grounds is a worthy recognition of the honorable sacrifice of our Nation’s brave first responders and their families. This year, 234 fallen officers will be honored, which is 100 more than last year. Ten of these officers are from my home State of Georgia, and 70 died from 9/11related cancer. This year, we will also remember five officers of the Dallas Police Department for their courage in the line of fire while responding to the shootings in Dallas at last July’s protest. 
This is a clear reminder of the sacrifices that our men and women in law enforcement make every day as they put their lives on the line to maintain safe communities for us and our loved ones. We must do all we can to support these brave men and women and their families. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 35 authorizes use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service on May 15 and a National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. Both events will be coordinated with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police. The National Peace Officers’ Memorial will honor the 144 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2016. In addition, the memorial event will honor 70 police officers who died from cancer related to 9/11 and 30 officers who died within the past 5 years who were not previously honored. Eight of those officers this year hail from my home State of Georgia. I offer the deepest condolences to the families of those officers who have had to endure the tragedy of losing a loved one who volunteered to protect my fellow Georgians. I have deep appreciation for the fallen officers and the ultimate sacrifice that they have made on behalf of their local communities. I support this resolution and urge Members to join me in supporting this tribute to law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty in the year 2016. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 35. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX DERBY Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 36) authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
H. C ON. RES. 36 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), SECTION 1. USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR SOAP BOX DERBY RACES. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association (in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘sponsor’’) shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, soap box derby races (in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘event’’), on the Capitol Grounds. (b) DATE OF EVENT .—The event shall be held on June 17, 2017, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Under conditions to be prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the event shall be— (1) free of admission charge and open to the public; and (2) arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress. (b) EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES .—The sponsor shall assume full responsibility for all expenses and liabilities incident to all activities associated with the event.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ). 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 36. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. H. Con. Res. 36 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby in June. Since the first official AllAmerican Soap Box Derby in 1934, the mission of the soapbox derby has been to build knowledge and character and to teach fair and honest competition. This tradition also allows children to demonstrate their dedication and creativity. Winners from this local competition will join those from other races, including from my home State of Georgia, in competing at the world championship in Akron, Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to, first of all, thank my good friend from Maryland, Representative STENY HOYER , for introducing this resolution on behalf of the entire Washington regional delegation. The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby is an annual competitive event that encourages boys and girls, ages 9 through 16, to construct and race their own soapbox vehicles. This Capitol Hill event has become a great tradition in Washington, D.C., in our metropolitan area over the last 20 years. It provides a terrific opportunity for children to appreciate the workmanship necessary to build the vehicles and enjoy the thrill of competition. The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby organizers will work with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police to ensure the appropriate rules and regulations are in place and that the event remains free to the public. I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation. You know, the Washington Soap Box Derby was an event that was being held during the times that I was here in Washington, D.C., growing up. I was born and raised here in Washington, D.C. I left at the age of 17 to come to Georgia. When I got to Georgia, I fell in love with Georgia; and I have been there for the last 47 years or so, and it has been a good run for me. But I tell you, remembering those occasions when the soapbox derby came to Washington, D.C., in my youth and going to watch the races, and, you know, it was really a joyful occasion, mass crowds gathered, people are rooting for their neighbors and their relatives and their friends, and pretty soon everybody is rooting for everybody. And to see the cars, the craftsmanship that went into building those cars, it is really a joy. I haven’t been to a soapbox derby since those times, so I imagine the craftsmanship that is going into these vehicles now is probably astounding what these young people and their supporters do in preparation for this soapbox derby. But still, although the vehicles have probably gotten more sophisticated and the preparation has gotten more detailed, the aspiration of the soapbox derby remains the same, and that is for young people to challenge themselves to do something, get out of their comfort zone, construct something, build something, then watch it actually move, and then even win the competition. So it is a great thrill, I am sure. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding, and I thank the chairman for bringing this resolution to the floor. Mr. Speaker, as I was sitting here listening to Congressman JOHNSON , I got so inspired that I just want to go out and jump in a soapbox or jump on a soapbox to give my talk. I have been at this for a very long period of time. The soapbox derby has been going on for 76 years; 36 of those years, I had the great privilege of serving in this body. I rise each year to sponsor the resolution allowing the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold its annual race on the Capitol Grounds. It is appropriate, I think, that it is here at the Capitol. The inspiration of the Capitol, the inspiration of the dome, the inspiration and excitement of which Congressman JOHNSON just spoke, I think, captures the sense of what ‘‘soapbox derby’’ means. This year marks, as I said, the 76th year of the derby, Mr. Speaker, at which young people from around the region, from age 8 all the way to age 17, compete in three divisions. Those divisions are stock, super stock, and masters. So you are talking about these sophisticated soapboxes. They are not your father’s soapbox, that is for sure. It is not only a fun and exciting event, it is also educational and brings children together, young people together, young adults together with their parents, grandparents, siblings, and neighbors to plan and build their soapbox racers. You know, one of the things we need in America is more engineers. I am a lawyer. I don’t know that we need more lawyers. And we need doctors, of course, but people tell me, if we are going to make things in America, we need more engineers, people who work with their hands, people who create, people who design, and that is what this soapbox derby is about. Doing so, participating in this contest helps connect these young people with handson engineering and manufacturing lessons which promote greater interest in the STEM fields which we all talk about: science, technology, engineering, and math. This has been the case, Mr. Speaker, since the first soapbox derby in 1938, and this long tradition now continues in the 21st century. The winner in each division will then qualify to race against the regional champions from across the Nation later this year, at Derby Downs, at the AllAmerican Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio. This year, the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby will be held on June 17, Mr. Speaker. The derby has been called ‘‘the greatest amateur racing event in the world.’’ I don’t know whether it is the greatest, but it is certainly one of the great contests in the world and teaches participating youth about fortitude, about leadership, about engineering, sportsmanship, and pride of achievement. b1645 In addition to bringing families together, the Soap Box Derby brings communities closer together, Mr. Speaker. Many of the races are sponsored and cheered by their local civic groups, police, fire departments, and service organizations. I have been proud, as I said, Mr. Speaker, to sponsor this resolution for 26 years, and I believe strongly in the importance of this tradition and am convinced of the very positive impact the Derby has on young people from my district who participate, around this region, and around the country. Maryland’s Fifth District, my district, has been home to a number of Greater Washington Soap Box Derby winners, including the winners from 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014. The Washington region is millions of people. My young people and their advisers, otherwise may be called parents, are doing pretty well in this, and we are proud of that. Our racers even won the national championship in 2007 and 2008. I hope my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, will join me in supporting this resolution and thanking the organizers of the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. I hope they will also join me in congratulating, in advance, all of the young people from the region who will be participating on June 17. I also want to thank my cosponsors: GERRY CONNOLLY , D ONBEYER , JOHN DELANEY , J AMIE RASKIN , A NTHONY  BROWN , ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON , and BARBARA COMSTOCK . This is a bipartisan resolution. I am sure everybody will support it, and I am sure that the excitement of which Congressman JOHNSON spoke will be experienced by those young people as they race towards victory. Whether they win the number one spot, they will be winners for having participated in this creative contest that makes them better people. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 36. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
R. JESS BROWN UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 455) to designate the United States courthouse located at 501 East Court Street in Jackson, Mississippi, as the ‘‘R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 455 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The United States courthouse located at 501 East Court Street in Jackson, Mississippi, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse’’. 
Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the United States courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ). 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 455. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 455 would designate the United States courthouse located at 501 East Court Street in Jackson, Mississippi, as the R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse. Mr. Brown, a native of Oklahoma, attended Illinois State University, Indiana University, and the Texas Southern University law school. In the 1960s, R. Jess Brown was one of only four AfricanAmerican lawyers licensed to practice in Mississippi. In 1962, Mr. Brown took on his most famous case, where he worked on behalf of James Meredith, an AfricanAmerican student who sought enrollment at the University of Mississippi. Mr. Brown’s successful lawsuit broke the color barrier at the University of Mississippi and helped set the tone for future litigation in the civil rights movement. Although the Meredith case may be his most famous trial, Mr. Brown already had established a history of litigating for civil rights stretching back to 1948, when he sued on behalf of Black teachers in Jackson, Mississippi, who sought salaries on par with their White colleagues. R. Jess Brown helped to break down barriers and set historical precedent that has shaped our Nation for the better. It is only appropriate that we honor the work of Mr. Brown by naming this courthouse after him. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 455. I want to commend my friend on the other side of the aisle for his eloquence and for his support of H.R. 455. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 455, a bill to designate the United States courthouse in Jackson, Mississippi, as the R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse. Mr. Speaker, Richard Jess Brown was born on September 12, 1912, in Coffeyville, Kansas. His parents, Ernestine and Joe Brown, were jazz musicians and performed in and managed a local theater. Jess received a bachelor of science in industrial arts from Illinois State Normal University and a master of science in industrial education from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. After teaching at Alcorn State University, Jess moved to Jackson, Mississippi, where he taught industrial arts at Lanier High School, the only Black high school in the city at that time. While teaching at Lanier, Jess became an intervening plaintiff in a lawsuit that sought equal pay for Black teachers in Jackson. After teaching in Jackson, Jess attended Texas Southern University Law School. Jess left the law school before receiving his juris doctorate, but was able to return to Mississippi and pass the Mississippi bar in 1953. Beginning his law career in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Jess confined his practice to cases involving divorces, deeds, land titles, and other practices that did not agitate White members of the bar. However, after the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka ruling in 1954, Jess felt compelled to defend the civil rights of African Americans. In the fall of 1955, the conditions and hardships endured by Black lawyers in the courts led Mr. Brown and seven other Black attorneys to establish the Magnolia Bar Association. Mr. Speaker, R. Jess Brown is credited with filing the first civil suit on behalf of an African American in Mississippi, that lawsuit on behalf of a Jefferson County minister who challenged laws that prevented Blacks from voting. Mr. Speaker, Jess Brown has an extensive record as a civil rights lawyer. His list of clients include: Clyde Kennard, who was charged with and convicted of a fictitious crime while attempting to desegregate the University of Southern Mississippi; James H. Meredith, whose litigation ultimately led to the integration of the University of Mississippi; Dr. Gilbert Mason, who led the effort to end racial segregation on the beaches of Biloxi, Mississippi; and Civil rights icons Medgar Wiley Evers and Dr. Aaron Henry. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Brown was admitted to practice law before all Mississippi court systems; the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi; the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi; the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit; and the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Brown also served on the Executive Board of the National Bar Association for approximately 15 years. Mr. Speaker, on December 31, 1989, R. Jess Brown died in Jackson, Mississippi, at the age of 77. Mr. Speaker, R. Jess Brown is well deserving of this honor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 455. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, R. Jess Brown is the type of individual who is an American success story. Just listening to the comments of my colleague, Congressman THOMPSON , about R. Jess Brown made me very proud of his accomplishments. He seemed to have been a Renaissance man with a southern twist. He seemed to be a gentleman and a scholar, yet someone who worked with his hands, also, and showed others how to do so. That is why I rise in support of H.R. 455, a bill to designate the Federal courthouse in Jackson, Mississippi, as the R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse. I can’t think of any better name for a courthouse in that locale other than the R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse. Attorney R. Jess Brown was a towering champion during critical moments in the civil rights movement in the South, and especially in Mississippi. Jess Brown received his law degree from the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University, which is my law school alma mater, and he practiced law in Mississippi throughout the sixties and seventies as one of the few attorneys willing to practice civil rights law. He made the metamorphosis from being a divorce lawyer into being a civil rights lawyer. He was associate counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and he filed the first civil rights suit in Mississippi in the 1950s in Jefferson Davis County, seeking the enforcement of the right of Black citizens to become registered voters. In 1961, R. Jess Brown represented James H. Meredith in his suit to be allowed to enter the University of Mississippi. His victory in this case opened the doors of that university to all Mississippi citizens. While with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, he played a major role in fighting racial discrimination in the areas of transportation and other public accommodations. During his lifetime, R. Jess Brown received numerous awards and honors, including the NAACP’s Lawyer of the Year Award, the National Bar Association’s C. Francis Stradford Award, and the Mississippi Teachers Association Award for extraordinary service to education in Mississippi. Other accomplishments are too numerous to mention but, unfortunately, are not as well known as they should be, and this is the least that we can do to honor the legacy of this important American. I support this legislation honoring the life’s work of R. Jess Brown, and I urge my colleagues to join me and pass H.R. 455. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 455. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION COORDINATION AND PLANNING AREA REFORM REPEAL ACT Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 496) to repeal the rule issued by the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration entitled ‘‘Metropolitan Planning Organization Coordination and Planning Area Reform’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 496 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The rule issued by the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration entitled ‘‘Metropolitan Planning Organization Coordination and Planning Area Reform’’ (81 Fed. Reg. 93448 (December 20, 2016)) shall have no force or effect, and any regulation revised by that rule shall be applied as if that rule had not been issued. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. LEWIS) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota. 
Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 496. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Minnesota? There was no objection. b1700 Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking my colleague across the aisle, Representative LIPINSKI , for his work on the original House version of this legislation and to Senator DUCKWORTH for introducing the corresponding language in the Senate. We all understood the unintended ramifications that this lastminute rule created, and we worked together to address this issue. This bill rescinds the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration’s Metropolitan Planning Organization Coordination and Planning Reform rule that was promulgated in December, 2016. After being sworn in to the House of Representatives, one of the first pieces of legislation I offered was to repeal this rule. Through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we were able to work in a bipartisan manner to achieve that goal, and I was proud to serve as the lead Republican in advancing a commonsense policy unanimously through our committee. This flawed rule mandates the expansion of boundaries for federally required Metropolitan Planning Organizations, or MPOs. There are 409 MPOs in the United States, and the Department of Transportation identified that more than onethird of these MPOs would immediately be subject to the new requirements of this rule. By requiring that MPO boundaries encompass the entire urbanized area and any surrounding areas that may be urbanized within 20 years, the Department of Transportation has taken away the ability for States and localities to determine how to plan their transportation networks. In many cases, this rule pushes an MPO into the boundary of another MPO, forcing consolidation of areas that are represented by different governing bodies. These areas are not capped and could become extremely expansive. There are even instances where MPOs would be mandated to include cities and counties in neighboring States. The question is: Why did the DOT feel the need to institute this rule? States already have the ability to reassess their MPO boundaries. MPOs have the ability to expand beyond their boundaries by using memorandums of understanding. Minnesota uses several for transportation planning. Additionally, every 4 years, MPOs are required to participate in a review process that identifies areas of concern like the planning of projects with neighboring areas. Meanwhile, in the instances of unelected MPOs, like Minnesota’s Metropolitan Council, this rule encourages them to expand without any participation or control from local citizens. The MPO council representing the Twin Cities area is entirely appointed by the Governor. Through State statute, they have the ability to levy taxes, and, like all MPOs, they determine what transportation projects to pursue. An expansion of MPO boundaries could mean a new tax for surrounding counties to fund transportation projects that do not address their local needs. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure and return current law to what Congress intended when it passed the FAST Act. This bill ensures that States, cities, and counties retain decisionmaking ability when it comes to planning their development and transportation growth. Our language restores certainty to local officials already in planning phases for local projects and could save MPOs more than $340 million over the next several years conforming to the regulation. The essence of this bill is local control. The more government is removed from the people, the less responsive it becomes. Selfgovernance works best when closest to home. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER  for his leadership on this matter, as well as my colleagues, Representative LIPINSKI and Senator D UCKWORTH , for their work on this bill, and I encourage all my colleagues to support our bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from the National Association of Regional Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and a letter from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL  COUNCILS AND ASSOCIATION OF  METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANI ZATIONS , April 25, 2017. DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS : On behalf of the members of the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (AMPO) and National Association of Regional Councils (NARC), we wish to express our strong support for a bill expected on the floor later today: S. 496—‘‘To repeal the rule issued by the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration entitled ‘‘Metropolitan Planning Organization Coordination and Planning Area Reform’’. This legislation passed the Senate unanimously on March 8. Identical legislation from Representatives Daniel Lipinski and Jason Lewis, H.R. 1346, has the support of 26 bipartisan cosponsors and passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee by voice vote on March 29. AMPO and NARC support increased planning coordination at all levels, but this Final Rule has significant drawbacks that make its implementation impractical, and would hinder the regional planning process and delay project implementation. Our extensive joint comments to the federal docket explain in significant detail the problems with this rule and the negative consequences we believe would result. Ours was one of more than 600 comments to the docket that asked this rule be withdrawn or substantially modified. Neither occurred, so legislative action is required. Repeal of this Final Rule is a key priority for our organizations and for many of our members. The legislation you will consider today would immediately restore certainty to the planning process for hundreds of planning organizations. Its bipartisan support is an indication that members from both parties recognize the damage this Final Rule could inflict on the transportation planning process and project implementation. We thank you for your consideration of this matter, and reaffirm our request that you support passage of S. 496. Sincerely, LESLIE WOLLACK , Executive Director, National Association of Regional Councils. DELANIA HARDY , Executive Director, Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF STATE  HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION  OFFICIALS , Washington, DC, March 10, 2017. Re H.R. 1346 to repeal the rule issued by the FHWA and the FTA entitled ‘‘Metropolitan Planning Organization and Coordination and Planning Area Reform’’ DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS : The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) expresses our full support of H.R. 1346 which will repeal the recently issued rule by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) entitled ‘‘Metropolitan Planning Organization Coordination and Planning Area Reform’’ (81 Fed. Reg. 93448) finalized on December 20, 2016. Representing all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, AASHTO serves as a liaison between state departments of transportation (state DOTs) and the federal government. AASHTO and its members are supportive of voluntary opportunities to strengthen regional transportation planning by states and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). As expressed in our comments on the NPRM regarding this rule, we do not see a basis for making substantial changes to the planning process as required in the rule. AASHTO has significant concerns with the specific mandates that the rule imposes upon states and MPOs. The regulation will add significant additional legal and administrative requirements that would serve as barriers to constructive and flexible approaches to planning and programming being implemented by states and MPOs today. Imposing these new requirements goes against the Congressional intent of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act to streamline project delivery. The rule also epitomizes the onesizefitsall approach that does not allow flexibility to tailor processes and solutions to the diverse needs, opportunities, and constraints faced by states and MPOs across the nation. We appreciate your tremendous leadership in repealing this specific rule. If you would like to discuss these issues further, please contact AASHTO’s Program Director for Planning and Performance Management. Sincerely, DAVID BERNHARDT , P.E., President, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; Commissioner, Maine Department of Transportation. 
Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 496, a straightforward bill to repeal changes made to the transportation planning process in the waning days of the Obama administration. On June 27, 2016, the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration jointly published a proposed rule to make significant changes to surface transportation planning regulations in an attempt to promote more effective regional planning by States and Metropolitan Planning Organizations, MPOs. The proposed rule was wellintentioned, aiming to strengthen coordination among planning partners and neighboring communities. However, the rule was haphazardly put together on an expedited timeline, with very little input from States and local planning organizations. It is not surprising, therefore, that the result was overwhelming opposition to the specific requirements of the rule. This rule was not mandated by Congress. In fact, Congress made very few changes to the planning process in the most recent surface transportation reauthorization, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, also known as the FAST Act. Among other changes, the administration sought to require that, in any urbanized area represented by more than one MPO, the MPOs would be required to either merge or realign their boundaries or develop unified planning documents. This requirement for joint planning documents would apply in urbanized areas that cross State lines. This provision, in particular, caused substantial concern in the planning community. The FHWA and the FTA received 299 comments in opposition to the proposed rule, of which 249 requested that the rulemaking be withdrawn. Only 16 commenters expressed support for the proposed rule. The agencies received 156 comments in support of the intent of the rule, but not the specific requirements and procedures proposed. The final rule, published in December of 2016, made a few modifications, including the addition of a waiver process, subject to approval by the Secretary, from some of the joint planning requirements if an area can demonstrate suitable coordination. Despite the changes made by the agencies in the final rule, strong opposition to the rule continues. Earlier this month, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed testified before the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit on implementation of the FAST Act. His written testimony, submitted on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, states: ‘‘The outgoing administration proposed a new rule on MPO designations that created unreasonable burdens for a number of regions, and we thank you, Mr. Chairman, and this committee for acting on legislation to remedy this.’’ Repeal of this rule is supported also by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and the National Association of Regional Councils. Last month, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed H.R. 1346, an identical bill to S. 496, by voice vote. H.R. 1346, introduced by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ), is a bipartisan bill with 29 cosponsors. S. 496 stops the controversial changes I have described from going into effect. The bill does not preclude the administration from pursuing changes in the future, through a new notice and comment rulemaking, to improve the planning process by strengthening the coordination of MPOs and States. Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 496, which is the first and likely only legislation striking an Obama Administration era rule or regulation outright that I will be supporting this Congress. From when I first learned of the rule last year, I have had strong concerns about the United States Department of Transportation’s (DOT) proposal on Metropolitan Planning Organization Coordination and Planning Area Reform. Planning was a top priority of one of my predecessors in the United States House of Representatives, former Public Works Committee Chairman Bob Roe. In the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991, the Congress overhauled the planning process and gave tremendous authority to local Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO). The process works well in Northern New Jersey, where the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority (NJTPA) plays an important role advancing regional projects that provides an important opportunity for local communities to offer meaningful input. I joined my colleague, Mr. SIRES, in a letter last summer expressing concerns with the draft rule and requesting that the comment period be extended. I appreciate the DOTs end goal: to make planning more efficient, more comprehensible to stakeholders and the public, and more focused on projects that address critical regional needs. However, in a rush to judgment and ignoring the concerns of many comments from across the county, the DOT finalized a wellintended, but misguided rule. Specifically, I object to the severity of its reconstruction of the planning processes, practices, and understandings that have been in effect for MPOs for decades, and the ability for the public to comment. Most concerning to me is that the rule could require the redrawing of Metropolitan Planning Areas (MPAs) and require Urbanized Areas (UZAs) to have a common MPO or common Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP). For densely populated regions like Northern New Jersey, the proposed rule would reduce local decisionmaking by either forcing MPO consolidation or requiring a burdensome multiregion single longterm TIP that could weaken local input. The NJTPA region covering my district already includes 6.7 million people and its TIP is over $2 Billion—adding any more to their plate would be unwieldy. We just need to witness the dysfunction at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to know that mandating New Jersey to undertake transportation planning with New York City and New York State in this way would be a recipe for disaster. I thank my colleagues for advancing this bill, look forward to this rule being put back on the shelf, and hope DOT can come up with something less burdensome in their quest to reform transportation planning processes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. LEWIS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 496. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 876, the Aviation Employee Screening and Security Enhancement Act of 2017, which seeks to implement findings from a multiyear investigation into the insider threat facing our Nation’s airports. This bipartisan legislation will help mitigate an increasingly disturbing threat to safety of the traveling public. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security’s Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, it is my duty to understand and respond to the ever changing threat landscape facing our Nation’s aviation sector, which is a critical component to both America’s economic and national security. In February of this year, we released a telling report on airport insider threats, which painted a disturbing picture of security vulnerabilities and gaps in screening and access controls at airports across the country. Just 3 days after the release of our report, news broke of a massive drug smuggling ring between Puerto Rico and the continental United States involving both TSA and airport employees. This network of criminals exploited their access to secure areas of airports to smuggle an astounding 20 tons—or $100 million worth—of cocaine into the United States and into our own communities. Another concerning example uncovered in our investigation throughout last Congress was when an airport employee offered to smuggle explosives on a passenger aircraft. Luckily, this individual was caught in a drug trafficking ring by the FBI and was arrested. However, we have seen multiple examples of aviation workers with access to secure areas of airports being involved in serious criminal activities, including terror plotting, after being radicalized. We cannot allow these lapses in security to continue placing the traveling public at risk, and we must continue to work together like my brother across the aisle, Mr. PAYNE , with our partners in security in the aviation sector and at the Transportation Security Administration. After a number of insider threatrelated attacks at airports overseas, along with plots here in the United States, it is essential that we act on this legislation. This bill, if enacted, will enhance employee vetting requirements, improve procedures governing the way airports issue security credentials, and reform TSA’s employee screening operations to be more targeted and effective. It will also provide policymakers with critical, previously unavailable data relating to the cost and feasibility of providing full employee screening at all domestic airports. The insider threat is real, and it is our duty to ensure the Federal Government is taking every step possible to keep the traveling public safe. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the ranking member of the subcommittee, my friend and colleague, Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN , for her shared leadership on this issue. I would also like to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. MCCAUL, for shepherding this legislation through the committee. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS , Washington, DC, April 25, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN MCCAUL: I am writing with respect to H.R. 876, the ‘‘Aviation Employee Screening and Security Enhancement Act of 2017.’’ This bill contains provisions within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. The Committee on Ways and Means will not seek a sequential referral on H.R. 876 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. This is done with the understanding that the jurisdictional interests of the Committee on Ways and Means over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 876 and requests your support when such a request is made. I would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 876 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. Sincerely, KEVIN BRADY , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, April 25, 2017. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN BRADY : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 876, the ‘‘Aviation Employee Screening and Security Enhancement Act of 2017.’’ I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Ways and Means will not seek a sequential referral of the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at this time, the Committee on Ways and Means does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Ways and Means for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 876, the Aviation Employee Screening and Security Enhancement Act for 2017. Mr. Speaker, last month, the Transportation Security Administration issued a directive prohibiting travelers flying out of 10 airports in eight countries from carrying laptops and other large electronic devices aboard airplanes. That decision was informed by intelligence that ISIS and other terrorist organizations may have developed innovative ways to plant explosives in electronic devices that TSA may not be able to detect. This swift action highlights the importance of TSA’s being able to adapt quickly in response to the everevolving terrorist threat landscape. Here, in the United States, we have been fortunate that there has never been a case where an airport worker has exploited their position to carry out a deadly attack on an airport, but we have seen such incidents abroad. Accordingly, Congress has given particular attention to the airport insider threat risk, and, in the 114th Congress, we enacted measures to enhance access controls at airports and improve security vetting for airport workers. b1715 Today, we consider H.R. 876, a bill that seeks to address this risk by requiring TSA to carry out a cost and feasibility study of incorporating new approaches to bolster access controls to a diverse range of airports. In an effort to help airports better understand the effectiveness of their current airport worker screening systems, the measure also directs TSA to increase covert testing of such systems. One feature of the bill that I want to highlight is a provision targeted at fostering greater vigilance and awareness among airport workers regarding the insider threat risk. Specifically, it directs TSA to work with airport operators, air carriers, and unions to develop insider threat security awareness training for airport workers within 180 days of enactment of the bill. H.R. 876, which was introduced in February and approved by the full committee in March, has bipartisan support, including the support of Representative BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN , the topranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee’s Transportation Security Subcommittee. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 876, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I echo the sentiment of my colleague, Mr. PAYNE . He is spot on in his discussion about the vulnerabilities that have been highlighted overseas that can easily come our way if we don’t act on this bill. I applaud his comments and thank him for those. This issue is critical to the safety of traveling Americans. We must act today to close every known security gap. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 876, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
HOMELAND SECURITY FOR CHILDREN ACT Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1372) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to ensure that the needs of children are considered in homeland security planning, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1372 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Homeland Security for Children Act’’. 
SEC. 2. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR STRATEGY, POLICY, AND PLANS. 
Paragraph (6) of section 709(c) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 349(c)) is amended by inserting ‘‘, including feedback from organizations representing the needs of children,’’ after ‘‘stakeholder feedback’’. 
Paragraph (2) of section 503(b) of the Homeland Security Act (6 U.S.C. 313(b)) is amended— (1) in subparagraph (G), by striking ‘‘and’’ at the end; (2) in subparagraph (H), by striking the period at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ‘‘(I) identify and integrate the needs of children into activities to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against the risk of natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other manmade disasters, including catastrophic incidents, including by appointing a technical expert, who may consult with relevant outside organizations and experts, as necessary, to coordinate such integration, as necessary.’’. 
Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter for five years, the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans of the Department of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report describing the efforts the Department has undertaken to review and incorporate feedback from organizations representing the needs of children into Department policy in accordance with paragraph (6) of section 709(c) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (as added by section 2 of this Act), including information on the following: (1) The designation of any individual responsible for carrying out such paragraph (6). (2) Any review, formal or informal, of Department policies, programs, or activities to assess the suitability of such policies, programs, or activities for children and where feedback from organizations representing the needs of children should be reviewed and incorporated. (3) Any review, change, modification, or promulgation of Department policies, programs, or activities to ensure that such policies, programs, or activities are appropriate for children. (4) Coordination with organizations or experts outside the Department pursuant to such paragraph (6) conducted to inform any such review, change, modification, or promulgation of such policies, programs, or activities. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1372, the Homeland Security for Children Act. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are about 74 million children in the United States, and while we are constantly making progress to achieve national resilience in the face of the next emergency, we must continue to ensure special consideration is made to integrate emergency planning at the Department of Homeland Security that addresses the unique needs of children when emergencies arise. I want to thank Mr. PAYNE for introducing H.R. 1372, which will ensure such consideration is made. Recently, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held a series of hearings focused on the progress and the future of achieving national preparedness in the face of events like Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. Among the child safety efforts made in the last 10 years, FEMA created the National Emergency Child Locator Center within the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to ensure the swift reunification of children should a major emergency displace communities. Mr. Speaker, I know this personally, having been an elected official on Staten Island during the tragedy in lower Manhattan in September of 2001. All three bridges from Staten Island to New Jersey were closed, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge was closed, and ferry service was stopped from Staten Island to Manhattan. We had many of our residents stuck at work in Manhattan. Their children were on Staten Island and could not be reached when being released from school. I know Mr. PAYNE can comment on this as well, but I just want to publicly thank him, because I experienced that myself. The subcommittee heard from weathertested first responders who, among other important issues, stressed the importance of integrating the needs of children into emergency planning, reminding us that, after all, children are not just miniadults. While DHS and FEMA have taken steps to elevate the safety of our most important populations, DHS can still do more to ensure Department policies, programs, and activities to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against disasters, and also consider the needs of children throughout our impacted communities. By authorizing a children’s needs technical expert at FEMA, as H.R. 1372 seeks to do, we can make certain that the needs of children are integrated into emergency preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation activities. Further, H.R. 1372 will require DHS’s Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans to appropriately consider the needs of children throughout Departmental activities and report such efforts to Congress. H.R. 1372 provides peace of mind that the future of our most treasured assets, our children, are safe in the face of emergencies. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation would not have a significant impact on the Federal budget. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER  of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and Chairman BARLETTA of the Transportation and Infrastructure’s Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management for working with the Committee on Homeland Security to see that this legislation receives timely consideration on the House floor. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I am committed to ensuring FEMA has resources at its disposal to meet its mission of safeguarding a more resilient nation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my fellow Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, March 10, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: I write concerning H.R. 1372, the ‘‘Homeland Security for Children Act.’’ This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite Floor consideration of H.R. 1372, the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, March 16, 2017. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHUSTER : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1372, the ‘‘Homeland Security for Children Act’’. I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will waive further consideration of the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a action on this bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor, I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1372, the Homeland Security for Children Act. Mr. Speaker, children are not tiny adults, as was stated, but too often that is how the Federal policy treats them when there is not a deliberate effort to do otherwise. The Department of Homeland Security, through its components, interacts with children regularly, and its policies have a direct impact on them. That is why I introduced H.R. 1372, the Homeland Security for Children Act. H.R. 1372 would make integrating the unique needs of children a priority at the Department of Homeland Security. The bill directs the DHS Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans to solicit and incorporate feedback from children’s organizations into Departmentwide policies and activities. Additionally, H.R. 1372 would formally authorize the existing children’s technical expert position at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The position was established by former Administrator Fugate in response to a March 2015 recommendation by the FEMA National Advisory Council. At the time, the National Advisory Council had concluded that FEMA had made progress integrating the unique needs of children into disaster plans since Hurricane Katrina, despite the fact that it did not have a technical lead to emphasize and address children’s issues. As a result, State and local governments and emergency managers were unaware of guidance related to children’s needs at the State and local level, leaving children vulnerable. According to Save the Children, 80 percent of the National Commission on Children and Disasters’ recommendations from 2010 still remain open. Whatever progress has been made in integrating the needs of children in disasters, it is clear there is still work left to be done. H.R. 1372 will ensure FEMA and DHS has the expertise necessary to do its part to ensure the unique needs of children are integrated into relevant activities, plans, and policies. The legislation has been endorsed by Save the Children, and former Administrator Fugate has said he supports efforts to authorize the children’s needs technical expert at FEMA. Mr. Speaker, the Homeland Security for Children Act is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable among us are adequately integrated into homeland security and disaster policies planning. I would like to just state, Mr. Speaker, that this bill has been a long time coming. I was just reminded of its importance by a program that I watched on television the other day about the tornadoes in Oklahoma, where we lost 7 children in a school building that fell. It showed the disarray in the rest of the parents being able to be reunited with their children. This is a timely bill. Before I yield back, I would like to thank Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman SHUSTER  and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for agreeing to exchange letters to expedite consideration of H.R. 1372 on the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1372, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1372, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
b1730 U.S. WANTS TO COMPETE FOR A WORLD EXPO ACT Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 534) to require the Secretary of State to take such actions as may be necessary for the United States to rejoin the Bureau of International Expositions, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 534 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) The Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) is the organization responsible for governing World Fairs and International Expositions. (2) Section 1(a) of Public Law 91–269 (22 U.S.C. 2801(a)) found that ‘‘international expositions . . . have a significant impact on the economic growth of the region surrounding the exposition and . . . are important instruments of national policy’’. (3) The United States has not been an active member of the BIE since 2001. (4) State and local governments and private entities in the United States have continued to participate in international expositions held in foreign countries as a means of promoting United States exports and creating jobs, but face significantly higher costs for such participation because the United States is not an active member. (5) State and local governments and private entities in the United States have expressed interest in an international exposition being hosted in the United States, but the bid of a United States city, region, or State to host an international exposition is unlikely to be successful if the United States is not a member of the BIE. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the United States should rejoin the BIE immediately to promote domestic job creation, global branding, and tourism to the United States; (2) the Secretary of State, in partnership with the Secretary of Commerce, State and local governments, and private and nonprofit entities, should take all necessary steps to facilitate the timely submission of a request to rejoin the BIE; and (3) funding for the participation of the United States in international expositions or other events facilitated by the BIE should continue to be privately solicited and sourced, in accordance with existing law. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Secretary of State is authorized to take such actions as the Secretary determines necessary for the United States to rejoin and maintain membership in the BIE. (b) AUTHORIZATION TO ACCEPT PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS .—In addition to funds otherwise available to the Secretary to carry out this section, the Secretary is authorized to accept contributions for such purpose. 
(c) N OTIFICATION .—The Secretary of State shall notify the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations of the Senate upon taking any action under subsection (a). 
SEC. 5. CONTINUATION OF PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR WORLD’S FAIR PAVILIONS AND EXHIBITS. 
Nothing in this Act may be construed to authorize any obligation or expenditure prohibited by section 204 of the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 (22 U.S.C. 2452b) (relating to limitations on the obligation or expenditure of funds by the Department of State for a United States pavilion or exhibit at an international exposition or world’s fair registered by the BIE). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 534, the U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act. As always, I appreciate the assistance of the ranking member, Mr. ENGEL , in expediting this legislation. I would like to commend two of our body here, Mr. TOMEMMER and Ms. B ETTY  MCCOLLUM . We thank them and their Minnesota colleagues for their leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, this bill will enable American citizens and our businesses and State and local governments to once again compete on an even footing against foreign countries to host a World Expo here in the United States. It does so by authorizing the Secretary of State to take those steps necessary to rejoin the Bureau of International Expositions. This BIE, as it is called, is the organization that governs World Expos, and it determines which cities get to host such an event. The United States originally joined the BIE back in 1928, but it withdrew from active membership in 2001. Unfortunately, the rules of the BIE make it virtually impossible for bids from nonmember nations to compete against bids from member nations. This bill will revise this. It will reverse the longstanding position, and we can lend our support to a recent surge of American interest in once again hosting a World Expo in the United States. Citizens from Minnesota have developed a comprehensive bid and are actively competing against cities in Argentina and Poland to host the 2023 World Expo, but since these countries are BIE members, the U.S. must rejoin the BIE in order for Minnesota to compete on an even playing field when the BIE makes its recommendations to the selection committee in May. It is not just Minnesota that is interested in this. At least five other U.S. States and cities are actively exploring hosting a World Expo in the future, including Los Angeles and San Francisco from my home State of California. These cities know that World Expos create American jobs. They promote American exports. They enhance the image of America around the world. Indeed, in November, the Departments of Commerce and State submitted reports to the President certifying that the Minnesota proposal was in the national interest of the United States and had guaranteed financial support from State, from local, from private, and other sources. Members should know that U.S. law requires that the cost of hosting or participating in a World Expo be funded entirely by private donors. This bill does not change that. In fact, it reaffirms that requirement. This bill also specifically authorizes the Department of State to accept private contributions in order to cover any costs associated with rejoining the organization. Indeed, the organizers of Minnesota’s 2023 Expo bid have committed to do just that. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 534 in order to once again give the American people the opportunity to host a World Expo here in the United States. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of the U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act. Let me thank our chairman, ED ROYCE , for his leadership of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I also want to thank my colleagues from Minnesota, Ms. MCCOLLUM and Mr. E MMER , for their hard work on this measure. World Fairs and World Expos explore and bring millions of people together from around the globe. They drive billions of dollars of investment to host cities, and they provide a forum for working toward new and creative solutions to serious problems. Across more than a century, these Expos have given us some of the world’s most iconic architecture: the Golden Gate Bridge, the Space Needle, and the Eiffel Tower. They have brought together world leaders and experts to discuss topics ranging from nutrition to the future of energy. The last Expo held in the United States was in 1984, and Minnesota is a potential candidate to host the 2023 World Expo. This Expo could bring in about 12 million visitors and $4 billion of revenue to Minnesota and connect the public and private sector to discuss Wellness and WellBeing for All. Mr. Speaker, we are at a grave disadvantage in competing for this event. In 2001, at the direction of Congress, the State Department withdrew from numerous international associations, including the Bureau of International Expositions, or BIE. ThenSecretary of State Colin Powell warned that this action could force the U.S. to pay a higher fee for participation and decrease the chance of an American city being selected as a host city. We are currently facing these consequences. As a nonmember of the BIE, the United States faces significantly higher costs to participate in expositions and will also face substantial barriers in hosting since preference is given to member nations. Mr. Speaker, the remedy is simple. We must rejoin the BIE. Private sector companies have shown interest in paying membership dues, so rejoining the BIE would not be an additional burden to taxpayers. Hosting the World Expo would increase revenue and tourism to Minnesota and the U.S. generally, put us at the forefront of international discussion on health, and increase our chances to hold specialized and World Expos in the future. I am proud of the hard work that has gone into this by my colleagues. I am glad once again that we are working in a bipartisan manner to pass legislation that advances our interests. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD two letters of support for this bill. One is from the administration, and the other is from ExpoUSA, the United States World’s Fairs Council. 
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE , Washington, DC, April 24, 2017. Hon. EDWARD R. R OYCE , Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Department of State appreciates Congress’ interest in facilitating the bids of states to host international expositions. Not only do such events potentially generate considerable economic benefits but they also create ideal opportunities for showcasing American commercial capabilities to interested international audiences. This is consistent with the President’s policy to promote domestic job growth and American innovation. As the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) is the international organization responsible for selecting venues offered by bidders, the chances of U.S. bidders being selected would be greatly enhanced if the U.S. were to renew and maintain its membership in the BIE. H.R. 534, the ‘‘U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act’’, as amended, would provide the needed permissive authority for the Secretary of State to do so. Further, the Department greatly appreciates the efforts of Congress to ensure the bill is consistent with similar authorizations. Insofar as BIE has advised of the need for United States membership to be renewed by May 12, 2017, to ensure timely consideration of the Minnesota Expo 2023 bid, the Department urges that, if possible, the bill be passed quickly. This will enable the Department to take the necessary steps to renew membership, enhancing prospects that state bids to host upcoming expositions will prevail. With the U.S. membership within BIE, 
costs for states to bid and host will be decreased by half and provide longterm savings for U.S. businesses interested in participating in future expos, both domestically and internationally. Finally, expeditious renewal of United States membership in the BIE will return the United States to the decisionmaking body for future World’s Fairs and Expos, offsetting the growing influence of other countries, such as China. The Office of Management and Budget has no objection to the views expressed in this letter. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. Sincerely, JOSEPH E.

EXPOUSA, T HEUNITED STATES  WORLD ’SFAIRS COUNCIL , April 19, 2017. Hon. EDROYCE , Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. ELIOT ENGEL , Ranking Member, House Foreign Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN ROYCE AND RANKING MEMBERENGEL : On behalf of ExpoUSA and Minnesota’s World’s Fair Bid Committee, we write in support of The U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act (H.R. 534). This bill authorizes the United States to rejoin Bureau of International Exhibitions (BIE), the organization that coordinates World’s Fairs, also known as Expos. Renewing membership in the BIE will promote public diplomacy, U.S. exports and travel and tourism. It will also ensure that U.S. cities wanting to host Expos will have that opportunity to compete against cities around the world. H.R. 534 has gained bipartisan and national support. While the U.S. has not hosted a World’s Fair in more than 30 years, there’s been a surge of local interest over the past few years. Houston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Philadelphia have actively considered bidding for future Expos, and the U.S. Government gave official support for Minnesota’s bid to host a World’s Fair in 2023 focused on health and wellness. After passing a rigorous review by the United States Commerce Department, State Department, and the White House, the State Department formally recommended Minnesota’s bid to the BIE. Minnesota will now compete against Buenos Aires, Argentina and Lodz, Poland. Voting will take place at the BIE General Council meeting in November 2017. Under current rules, the BIE is required to discriminate against bids from nonmember countries if there are competing proposals from member countries. Since Argentina and Poland are BIE members, the U.S. must rejoin the BIE in order for Minnesota to compete against these foreign bidders when the BIE makes its recommendations to the selection committee in May. Therefore, Congress must pass legislation authorizing the Secretary of State to rejoin the BIE by May 13, 2017 in order for Minnesota’s bid to be viable. Expos held in the U.S. are local initiatives that are funded entirely by the private sector; therefore no taxpayer money will be used to pay for Expo 2023. Additionally, if Congress acts to rejoin the BIE, ExpoUSA stands ready to pay the costs of BIE membership with private sector funds, including membership dues both past and current, in order to save money by reducing fees and to give Minnesota and the U.S. a renewed voice in the BIE. World’s Fairs are the largest gatherings held on the planet, generating billions of dollars in economic activity for the region and country in which they are held. Expo 2023 will attract 12 million visitors, generating 22,000 jobs in the upper Midwest region, paying an annual wage of $47,000, and another 18,000 jobs nationwide in the tourism, travel, and hospitality sectors. Total economic impact in the Twin Cities metropolitan area will be $1.4 billion. International visitor spending will total $581 million, and on average will stay 6 days in Minnesota and another 5 days in other locations around the United States. We ask for your support in expeditiously moving legislation authorizing the United States to rejoin the BIE. Thank you for consideration of our request and for your interest in helping cities like Minneapolis/St. Paul bid on future World’s Fairs. Sincerely, MARKRITCHIE , President and CEO, Minnesota World’s Fair Bid Committee, Board Member, ExpoUSA. MANUEL DELGADO , Chairman, ExpoUSA. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ). He is the author of this bill. He has worked very hard preparing this legislation for passage. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I thank Chairman EDROYCE , Ranking Member ENGEL as well, and the entire staff on the Committee on Foreign Affairs for working to get this important legislation to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, when many Americans look back in our Nation’s history, they remember the iconic nature of the 1962 World’s Fair in Seattle or the 1939 and 1964 World’s Fairs in New York. Those events highlighted the best the United States had to offer in science, technology, and innovation, all while bringing visitors and revenue to this great country. While the United States remains a global leader in these fields, our country has been noticeably absent over the past three decades when it comes to hosting a World’s Fair. In fact, New Orleans was the last city in the United States to host a World’s Fair in 1984. But it is time for that to change and to bring this incredible event back to our great country. Thankfully, in recent years there has been an upsurge of local interest in hosting a World’s Fair. Exploratory committees in Houston, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Francisco are actively considering bidding to host a future World’s Fair. Currently, my home State of Minnesota is competing against Argentina and Poland to do just that, with the goal of hosting the 2023 World Expo. However, under the current rules, the Bureau of International Expositions will not give bids submitted by a nonmember country the same consideration as those from a country who is a member of the organization. For those of you who may not know, the Bureau of International Expositions is the intergovernmental organization in charge of overseeing and regulating World Expos. Despite being one of the founding members in 1928, the United States has not been a member since 2001. The U.S. must renew its membership so Minneapolis and every city across the country can have an opportunity to host a World’s Fair. That is why I have introduced and I am happy to see H.R. 534 under consideration before the House today. The U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act provides the Secretary of State with the authority to rejoin the Bureau of International Expositions so that U.S. cities can compete against foreign cities to host a World Expo. The 6month World Expo, held every 5 years, can draw millions of visitors and generate billions of dollars in tourism, construction, and other jobcreating economic activity, all while promoting exports of U.S. products around the world. In Minnesota’s case, a 2016 economic analysis conducted by Rockport Analytics found that hosting the 2023 World Expo will attract 12 million visitors, create almost 22,000 jobs, yield $185.3 million in State and local tax revenue, and generate $1.5 billion in total economic benefits. This legislation also has safeguards for protecting taxpayers and ensuring proper use of funds. Recognizing the difficult fiscal climate our country currently faces, H.R. 534 authorizes the use of private funds to pay outstanding as well as future membership dues. It also maintains taxpayer safeguards which prohibit tax dollars from being used to fund a United States pavilion or exhibit at an international exposition or World’s Fair. By approving this legislation today, we will give American cities the ability to compete with other cities around the world to host future Expos and World’s Fairs where we can showcase American innovation and success while continuing to be wise stewards of the taxpayers’ hardearned dollars. Again, I thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL in helping bring this legislation to the floor today. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation, and I look forward to bringing the next World’s Fair back to the United States. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. World Expos are designed to showcase a nation’s products, the technology, the innovative spirit. And what nation on Earth produces more innovative products and technology than the United States or has a better or more skilled workforce? Simply put, when Americans compete in the world on an even footing, America wins. It is therefore in our interest to once again compete to host a World Expo. 
This bill does that by empowering our fellow citizens to mount competitive private bids to bring a World Expo to the U.S., and it does so while maintaining a sound legal requirement that participation in Expos continue to be privately funded. It goes further to permit private funding for the relatively modest cost to rejoin the BIE. That is why this measure has the support of Members from both parties and the administration, which has written that H.R. 534 is consistent with the President’s policy to promote domestic job growth and American innovation. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this measure and give our fellow Americans the chance to compete and win a World Expo for America. I again thank the bill’s committed sponsors, Representatives TOMEMMER and B ETTY  MCCOLLUM . I want to give a special thanks to Sean O’Neill, a detailee on my staff, whose skill and dedication have made today’s consideration of this measure possible. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 534, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1745 RELATING TO EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO THE FAMINE IN SOUTH SUDAN Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 187) relating to efforts to respond to the famine in South Sudan, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 187 Whereas on February 20, 2017, famine was formally declared in parts of South Sudan; Whereas South Sudan is the world’s newest nation and for the past three years has experienced an ongoing armed conflict and the deliberate hindrance by the Government of South Sudan of humanitarian access to opposition communities in need; Whereas due to this deliberate action on the part of the Government of South Sudan and the armed opposition to prolong the conflict South Sudan is experiencing a ‘‘man made’’ famine currently affecting 100,000 people; Whereas according to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) food insecurity is already prevalent in South Sudan and the ongoing conflict is exacerbating the situation; Whereas the United Nations has reported that 4,900,000 people, over 40 percent of the population, are in urgent need of food, agriculture, and nutritional assistance; Whereas there are 1,900,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) residing in South Sudan and according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) an average of approximately 2,400 South Sudanese refugees arrive in Uganda every day; Whereas 1,000,000 children in South Sudan are suffering from malnutrition in part due to the deliberate actions of the Government of South Sudan, at the same time according to United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) there are more than 17,000 child soldiers forced into combat; Whereas an anticipated 5,500,000 people are at risk for starvation by midyear and without urgent humanitarian intervention civilians will continue to die from acute malnutrition and millions more will remain at risk; Whereas failure to act prior to the upcoming rainy season May to August, will further impede humanitarian efforts; Whereas the areas where famine has been declared have seen some of the most intense fighting; Whereas USAID has been a leading provider of humanitarian support to South Sudan, including more than 620,000 tons of lifesaving food assistance since the conflict broke out in 2013; and Whereas support provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), UNICEF, and the World Food Program have been critical in reducing the number of civilians at risk of severe malnutrition: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives— (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that— (A) the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development should continue to provide immediate and robust assistance to respond to the famine in South Sudan by providing food and other essential resources and to collaborate with international relief organizations, such as World Food Program and others in an effort to reach vulnerable populations; and (B) the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development should be encouraged to continue to provide desperately needed and locally appropriate food aid through the Food for Peace and Emergency Food Security Programs; and (2) the House of Representatives— (A) calls upon the Government of South Sudan to declare and observe a cessation of hostilities to allow food and essential supplies to reach affected civilians; (B) urges specifically that the Government of South Sudan allow immediate and unrestricted humanitarian access to southern Unity, where the famine is currently underway; (C) condemns all threats and violence against civilian populations and aid workers, including the over 70 humanitarian aid workers killed since the conflict began and the brutal attack by the South Sudanese military on humanitarian aid workers, including Americans, at the Terrain Camp in July 2016; (D) condemns the multiple instances in which security forces have looted humanitarian assistance destined for civilians in need; and (E) supports effort of the United States Government, working with partners in the international community, including the United Nations, the African Union, and the European Union, to facilitate humanitarian access to affected areas, and encourages greater diplomatic pressure on the parties to return to the negotiation table to stop the violence, and to allow full humanitarian access. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in July of 2011, all of us here celebrated the establishment of the world’s newest nation. Finally, South Sudan had emerged after more than 20 years of brutal suppression by the government in Khartoum and a war that saw some of the worst human rights atrocities of our time. They emerged out of that. Tragically, though, the celebration was shortlived. By December of 2013, a longsimmering rivalry between two leaders—South Sudan’s ethnic Dinka President and ethnic Nuer Vice President—exploded in violence, and South Sudan became embroiled in yet another deadly civil conflict. Today, over 100,000 people are starving to death; 5.5 million people—half of the population—are at risk of starving by July; and 3.6 million people have been displaced by conflict and famine with 7,000 newly displaced South Sudanese crossing the Ugandan border each and every week. In February, famine was declared in two of the areas that have experienced the heaviest fighting. Let’s be clear: the famine unfolding across South Sudan is completely manmade. The leaders who have unleashed this horror upon the citizens that they are meant to represent—Salva Kiir and Riek Machar—have plundered billions of dollars in oil revenues and donor investment, manipulated ethnic tensions, and armed proxy militias. They have, as we can share with you, recruited child soldiers, killed U.N. peacekeeping forces, and forcibly displaced millions of their citizens—civilians who have been run from their homes. Lifesaving humanitarian supplies have been looted by the government and by the opposition. The government has blocked humanitarian access through bureaucratic manipulation and through sheer brute force. Humanitarian workers have been deliberately targeted. They have been abused, raped, and murdered with impunity. Yes, humanitarian workers. South Sudan is now the most dangerous place in the world for humanitarians. It is also the most dangerous place for their own citizens because they are treated the same way by these two so called leaders. And those South Sudan leaders have, in effect, become exactly 
like the government in Khartoum that their people fought against for decades. This is appalling. This is unconscionable. It cannot stand. Congress, working with our Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, and many other concerned countries, must make sure those who bear responsibility for this calamity are held to account through sanctions and other tools. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS), the ranking member of the Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations Subcommittee, for introducing this timely and important resolution, which seeks to bring attention to the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in South Sudan, because in South Sudan it gets worse by the day. It has not mattered what arguments we have brought to bear against the President and the Vice President. Many world leaders and many of us have had these arguments facetoface. This resolution makes clear that the U.S. Agency for International Development should have the flexibility to tailor their response by using market based food aid where appropriate, and U.S. commodities where needed. We need to ensure that food is not being used as a weapon in this civil war, and flexible food aid can help. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this resolution and, more importantly, in continuing to demonstrate the compassion of the American people through lifesaving humanitarian assistance. Deep, arbitrary cuts to U.S. humanitarian assistance programs at a time when we are facing famine in four countries beset by violence—including countries where we are fighting designated terrorist groups—would be reckless and irresponsible. Millions of lives are hanging in the balance. It is in the U.S. interest to respond in South Sudan, just as it is in these other countries. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for H. Res. 187, Relating to Efforts to Respond to the Famine in South Sudan, as amended, which passed out of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and has received bipartisan support. As always, Mr. Speaker, I thank and appreciate the leadership of Chairman ROYCE , Chairman S MITH, and Ranking Member ENGEL . The United Nations has declared what is going on now in four countries as potentially the worse humanitarian crisis since the U.N. was formed in 1945. Famine has been declared in one country, and three others are at risk of famine. Famine might be averted in Somalia if the rains come. In Nigeria and Yemen, famine might be averted if the world acts in time. But South Sudan, which is the world’s newest nation, is currently experiencing famine. The United Nations defines famine as meaning over 20 percent of the population has access to only 2,100 calories per day. Thirty percent of children are malnourished. And 2 to 4 people die per day because of lack of food. Tragically, South Sudan meets all three conditions. Over the years, the U.S. has played a leadership role in the region. The U.S. has helped South Sudan throughout their struggle for independence, and has tried to help the world’s newest nation over the last several years before and during the conflict. The tragedy is the people of South Sudan are in the midst of a famine, not because of a drought or other natural disaster, but because of ongoing conflict. There is heavy responsibility on all sides of the fighting. There is no innocent party here. In South Sudan, the U.N. has reported roughly 5 million people who are in urgent need of food and nutritional assistance. There are almost 2 million internally displaced persons in camps in South Sudan, and 2,400 South Sudanese refugees arrive in Uganda every single day. If the world does not act, 5 million people will be at risk for starvation by mid2017. Without urging humanitarian intervention, more civilians will continue to die from acute malnutrition, and millions more will remain at risk. If we fail to act prior to the upcoming rainy season, which is May to August, this will create additional problems that will further impede humanitarian efforts. Unfortunately, the areas where famine has been declared have also seen some of the most intense fighting. The amendment to H. Res. 187 calls for USAID to continue providing desperately needed and locally appropriate food aid through the Food for Peace and Emergency Food Security Programs, and calls on the Government of South Sudan to declare and observe a cessation of hostilities to allow food and essential supplies to reach affected civilians. The resolution urges the Government of South Sudan to allow immediate and unrestricted humanitarian access to the southern unity region, where the famine is currently underway. The amendment also condemns all threats and violence against civilian populations and aid workers, including over 70 humanitarian aid workers that have been killed since the conflict began. The resolution condemns the brutal attack by the South Sudanese military on humanitarian aid workers, including Americans at the Terrain Camp in July of last year. The resolution condemns the multiple instances in which security forces have looted humanitarian assistance destined for civilians in need, and supports the effort of the U.S. Government working with partners in the international community, including the U.N., the African Union, and the European Union, to facilitate humanitarian access to affected areas, and encourages greater diplomatic pressure on the parties to return to the negotiation table to stop the violence and to allow full humanitarian access. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding and for his leadership. I especially thank my good friend and colleague, Ms. BASS, for this resolution. Mr. Speaker, last August, my staff director Greg Simpkins and I visited Juba, South Sudan, to press President Salva Kiir, his Vice President, the minister of defense, and five of his top generals to end the civil war, protect innocent lives, and reverse the conditions causing rampant disease and severe malnutrition that could soon lead to a famine. Mr. Speaker, just 2 months ago, famine was formally declared in South Sudan. I especially asked President Kiir to personally intervene and issue and enforce an executive order of zero tolerance on rape and sexual abuse by his soldiers and security personnel against mostly humanitarian aid workers and civilians. I told the President that it was unconscionable in the extreme that South Sudanese soldiers had raped, beaten, and murdered humanitarian aid workers in July at the Terrain compound. One of those workers that was sexually assaulted, as it turned out, was from my own district. I didn’t know until 3 days before leaving on that trip that she was in the compound and came close to being raped and it was the intervention of other forces that precluded her from suffering that horrible trauma, but she was, indeed, severely traumatized. I asked him for a review to hold people to account and put them in prison— yes, there have been arrests, but there have been no prosecutions yet—and, again, to issue a zero tolerance policy. On March 28, I chaired a hearing on the famine and the growing crisis in South Sudan, which is also being chaired by some of the other neighboring countries in the region. Matt Nims, the acting director of the Office of Food for Peace testified that for 3 years the international community has employed massive efforts to stave off famine in South Sudan. Yet, as conflict intensified, the food security situation continued to deteriorate. And he said: 
This is a manmade crisis and the direct consequence of prolonged conflict. 
Ken Isaacs, the vice president of Samaritan’s Purse—and Samaritan’s Purse has an extensive footprint in South Sudan doing unbelievably great humanitarian work—testified: 
The most significant driver of the current crisis in the worst hit areas of South Sudan, however, is the political insecurity and brutal conflict that continues to engulf the region. In South Sudan alone, 1.85 million people have been internally displaced because. Because of this, many people are calling this a manmade famine, and it is hard to argue with that assessment. 
Today, the United Nations reports that twothirds of South Sudan’s population requires humanitarian assistance, and almost 5 million people— more than 40 percent of the population—are in urgent need of food, agriculture, and nutritional assistance. Clearly, the Government of South Sudan and the rebels they face are more interested in winning and holding territory than in finding ways to feed and nurture their people and allow humanitarian access. Two months ago, there were 70 humanitarianaccess incidents reported, causing suspension of operations in multiple locations. Aid workers are being targeted in South Sudan, where eight Samaritan’s Purse workers were kidnapped and later released in February, and six African aid workers in South Sudan were killed in March. Stephen O’Brien, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, accused South Sudan’s Government of blocking foods and medicines and restricting U.N. peacekeepers from protecting civilians. He described active hostility, access denials, and bureaucratic impediments to humanitarian organizations serving that beleaguered nation. This is a manmade crisis. This resolution puts us on record and, again, encourages our administration and the world to do more to end it. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), my good friend and Democratic Caucus chairman. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. I want to recognize the bipartisan support for this resolution. It heartens me. I know of the great work of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS) for quite some time, as well as others on the other side of the aisle, on this issue. She, along with the Sudan Caucus, the Africa Subcommittee, and the CBC Africa Task Force have been working every day in a very tenacious way to draw attention to this issue and demand a strong international response. b1800 Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that this is a crisis. I agree with my colleague and friend from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH): it is a manmade crisis. The United Nations is reporting that the current situation in a number of countries in Africa and the Middle East constitutes the most serious humanitarian crisis since its founding over 70 years ago. In South Sudan alone, 100,000 people are in a state of famine as we speak, and up to 5 million more are in serious danger of being in famine. These are men, women, and children who are in danger of not having enough food and water. The simple fact is, without international aid and assistance, people will die—many people will die. But it doesn’t have to be this way. The world is smart enough and resourceful enough to ensure that the worst of this tragedy can be prevented before the situation gets further out of hand, but it is going to take a fullcourt press by this administration, by the State Department, and by the international community. I grew up in Queens, New York, in an IrishAmerican family. At an early age, I learned of the Great Hunger in Ireland that killed more than 1 million people and forced more than 2 million more to flee. Those Irish didn’t have to die just because a potato crop went bad. In Ireland at the time, food was actually being exported out of Ireland while people starved. So it was starvation not only because of food loss, but also because of politics and repression— very much the same situation that exists in parts of Africa and in Yemen— and only politics could ultimately change the underlying conditions in Ireland. Now, we need both aid and political pressure to help stop this famine and all of the ongoing famines now. So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. I urge that the State Department: Seize the bull by the horns and take action. Don’t let history look back on America and say: Why did you not do enough while millions starved? Let history reflect the goodness of the heart of the American people, which I know exists. To this day, the people of Ireland remember the sultans from the then Ottoman Empire that helped. They remember the Choctaw Nation, who gave $700 during the 1840s to help the starving Irish. Let America be that shining country in the future when Africa looks back and says: Who was there to help? Let it be America. That is the American way. Working with our allies, America will succeed in preventing this famine if we move expeditiously. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ). Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, 100,000 people in South Sudan are at risk of starvation. Turmoil in the country could push another 5.5 million people into lifethreatening hunger by summer. This hunger crisis in Sudan is manmade, the result of a civil war that has decimated the agriculture and destroyed the economy, and it will take humanitarian action to fix it. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H. Res. 187, introduced by Congresswoman KAREN BASS. This resolution aids the people of South Sudan by increasing emergency assistance to address the famine, and it calls on the Government of South Sudan to allow unrestricted humanitarian access to displaced and starving populations. I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution. It is essential that the South Sudanese Government and opposition forces cease their inhumane blocking of humanitarian workers and permit the delivery of assistance to the South Sudanese. Millions of lives are at stake. As my late father, Donald Payne, the Member in this seat prior to me, fought for this Nation to exist over a decade of work here in the Congress, to now see what is going on, he was able to get the situation in Darfur labeled a genocide. I hope the next generation of Paynes does not have to do the same thing in South Sudan. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), my good friend and colleague and the chair of the Nigeria Caucus. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished lady for her commitment and this very important resolution, and the opportunities to meet with her and advocate as she convenes the South Sudan and Sudan Caucus and works as the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on Africa, with our chairman, Mr. SMITH; and, of course, I thank Mr. ROYCE and Mr. E NGEL , leading the full committee; and those who came to the floor, Mr. CROWLEY , and certainly Mr. PAYNE , who has a legacy that he is holding in such high esteem by his own leadership. I was in South Sudan with the late Congressman Donald Payne as the right to return was implemented, and the individuals who were fleeing Sudan came with joy and tears. As they exited the buses that were bringing them in, they clearly were joyful. This was a homecoming. We look forward to a great recognition of the assets and minerals and various wealth that Sudan, South Sudan could have to help all of its people and even to try and help those still in Darfur even though in Sudan. We met with the thenPresident and Vice President, who have now turned it into an enormous conflict and rising up against each other and killing and causing people to flee. And so I want to congratulate Congresswoman BASSfor this resolution, for us to be on record relating to efforts to respond to the famine in South Sudan. And I take this moment just to read this story about a woman who is an example of what the fear and fright is: ‘‘By day, Mary Nyarac scours swamps for fish and edible water lilies. When darkness falls and South Sudan’s militias retreat to their bases, she and hundreds of others fleeing a 3year civil war slip onto dry land and tend crops to stave off famine. 
‘‘Prowling hyenas pose a threat during Nyarac’s nighttime harvests, but they worry her less than the armed men who can appear in daytime, the 20 yearold said as she sat beneath neem trees in the northern county of Leer, one of two areas in South Sudan where the United Nations in February made the world’s first declaration of famine since 2011. She and other residents are facing a catastrophe that’s being echoed by looming mass food shortages in Somalia, Yemen, and northern Nigeria.’’ This is devastating—an article in Bloomberg News—100,000 in those counties, 5 million all throughout Sudan and South Sudan, but it is in all of SubSaharan Africa. So I believe that this resolution brings all of us together—Republicans and Democrats—and makes the statement of the United States House of Representatives, then on to the Senate, and then for the President to make the statement, as Congresswoman BASSso aptly states in this resolution, to let humanitarian aid come in. Let there be food that will reach those starving, and particularly the children, that are apt to die in this region. It is wellknown, as well, that women are not treated in the way that they should be, and I look forward to working with Congresswoman BASSon H.R. 48 that deals specifically with the rights of women and providing them with human rights and women’s participation in leadership. That is certainly missing. But now people are starving, and so I would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 187, relating to efforts to respond to the famine in South Sudan and be reminded of Mary, who scours swamps for fish and edible water lilies, if at all possible, and fears the onslaught of violence during the day. They cannot live this way. They can only die this way. Mr. Speaker, support H. Res. 187 so that we can save lives. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the South Sudan Caucus, and the sponsor of H.R. 48, the ‘‘Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act,’’ I rise in strong support of H. Res. 187, a resolution directing the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to increase emergency assistance to respond to the famine in South Sudan. On February 20, 2017 famine was declared formally in two counties of Unity State, which is located in the northern region of South Sudan. The United Nations currently estimates that more than 100,000 people in two Unity State counties are directly affected by the famine. In addition, food security experts are concerned that famine will spread. According to expert analyses, in the absence of urgent humanitarian action, as many as 4.9 million South Sudanese, about 40 percent of the country’s population, face the grim and certain prospect of starvation. In 1998 the region suffered from a famine spurred by civil war and approximately 70,000 to several hundred thousand people died during that famine. Although South Sudan has previously experienced widespread food insecurity, the present famine crisis is different because it is almost entirely manmade. South Sudan is the world’s newest nation, located in the center of Africa and bordered by six countries. It is rich in oil, but following decades of civil war it is also one of the least developed regions on earth—only 15% of its citizens own a mobile phone and there are very few tarmac roads in an area larger in land mass than Spain and Portugal combined. This makes the Nile River, which flows through regional centers, an important transport and trade route. Since South Sudan overwhelmingly voted to break away from Sudan in 2011, the government’s main concern has been to get oil flowing following disagreements with the regime in Khartoum. There have been a few small armed rebellions, border clashes and deadly cattle feuds but these have all taken place far from the capital city of Juba. Signs of friction within the governing party, Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM), came when President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, the country’s largest group, fired his deputy Riek Machar, who is from the second largest tribe, the Nuer. President Kiir believes Mr. Machar was behind a coup plot to oust him and seize power. Mr. Machar denies the accusations, but has publicly criticized Mr. Kiir for failing to tackle corruption and vowed to challenge President Kiir for leadership of the SPLM. It is not clear what led to the breach in their relationship but what started out as a political squabble has escalated into ethnic violence. The loyalties of the South Sudan army are divided with each of the principals commanding significant military support and forces loyal to each man have clashed around the country. And some of the most intense fighting has taken place in areas where famine is most severe. Compounding matters, Mr. Speaker, South Sudan is awash with guns after decades of conflict and there is a history of ethnic tension for politicians to exploit if they believe that could help them gain, or remain in, power. It is against this backdrop that USAID is coordinating proactively and closely with the United Nations, the African Union, the European Union, and others to address South Sudan’s food insecurity. Complicating this situation is the fact that while the Government of South Sudan has reportedly promised access to the most atrisk areas, humanitarian organizations remain unable to provide vital food, water and shelter in many locations. Mr. Speaker, the actions of South Sudan Government in prohibiting humanitarian assistance from getting to starving communities has undermined the most proactive attempts by the United States and others to address what has now become a famine. H. Res. 187 calls on South Sudan’s leaders to put their petty disputes aside and to put the wellbeing of their people first. The resolution condemns all threats and violence against civilian populations and aid workers, including the over 70 humanitarian aid workers killed since the conflict began and the brutal attack by the South Sudanese military on humanitarian aid workers, including Americans, at the Terrain Camp in July 2016. In addition, H. Res. 187 expresses support for the efforts of the United States Government, working with partners in the international community, including the United Nations, the African Union, and the European Union, to facilitate humanitarian access to affected areas, and encourages greater diplomatic pressure on the parties to return to the negotiation table to stop the violence, and to allow full humanitarian access to displaced and starving populations, and to cease violations of humanitarian principles. Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by observing that while bringing an end to the civil war and humanitarian relief the faminestricken in South Sudan must be our first order of business, it is also very important to note that all of us who worked to secure its independence want the country to succeed and become a productive and constructive member of the community of nations. That is why I have reintroduced the ‘‘Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act’’ (H.R. 48), which promotes the human rights of women in South Sudan as the country transitions to a longterm government and to ensure women enjoy the right to participate fully in the political and economic life of the country. Despite its newly won independence women in South Sudan continue to face brutal violations of their human rights. A lack of infrastructure as well as gender inequality has the potential to regress much of the progress that has been made in South Sudan. Such a lack of human development factors only furthers the marginalization of women in South Sudan: 1. Inadequate health care has resulted in high maternal and infant mortality rates in South Sudan; the maternal mortality rate is one of the highest in the world with 1,054 deaths per 100,000 live births. 2. Additionally, literacy rates for women are staggeringly low; over 80% of women and girls in South Sudan are illiterate. 3. The violence stemming from the conflict has led some traders to suspend their market presence resulting in food commodity price increases as much as 30 percent in highconflict regions. The ‘‘Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act’’ puts equal rights and access for the women of South Sudan at the forefront by: 1. Encouraging the appointment of women to high level positions within Republic of South Sudan Government; 2. Ensuring that a significant portion of United States development, humanitarian, and relief assistance is channeled to local and United Statesbased South Sudanese organizations, particularly South Sudanese women’s organizations; 3. Providing longterm financial assistance for primary, secondary, higher, nontraditional, and vocational education for South Sudanese girls, women, boys, and men; 4. Providing financial assistance to build health infrastructure and deliver highquality comprehensive health care programs, including primary, maternal, child, reproductive, and mental health care; 5. Requiring military training regarding the protection, rights, and particular needs of 
women and emphasizing that violations of women’s rights are intolerable and should be prosecuted; and 6. Taking all necessary steps to ensure that internally displaced South Sudanese women are directly receiving food aid, shelter, relief supplies, and other services from United Statessponsored programs. Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we should support the Republic of South Sudan in its efforts to become a freer, more equitable society that respects, supports, and endorses the rights of women. I look forward to working with Congresswoman BASS, the Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, members of the South Sudan Caucus, and all Members of the House to pass the ‘‘Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act’’ and send it to the President’s desk for signature. But before we can do that, we must end the manmade famine and alleviate the humanitarian suffering now ongoing in South Sudan. That is why I strongly support H. Res. 187 and urge all Members to join me in voting for this important resolution. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ), my fellow colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 187, sponsored by my colleagues, Ranking Member BASSand Chairman SMITH, and I applaud their and Chairman ROYCE ’s and Ranking Member ENGEL ’s continued bipartisan attention to this oftneglected part of the world. South Sudan faces a famine of Biblical proportions which compels us to act. As the world’s newest country, South Sudan’s entry on the world stage has been fraught with disaster. A drought caused by climate change, which has become all too familiar in this part of the world, has, since December 2013, been coupled with politically and ethnically fueled violence which has destroyed the infrastructure as well as the economy. This has escalated drought into famine. Across the African Continent and the globe, climate change and extreme weather result in drought and the loss of farmland. Families are forced to leave their homes in the countryside to seek work in the cities. The work is not there. Incompetent and/or corrupt governments fail to address the needs, and civil unrest devolves into violence. Countries are destabilized. Here in South Sudan, the newness of the nation, the government’s efforts to stamp out civil unrest—especially from nonruling tribes—and military forces let loose upon their fellow countrymen has resulted in death, destruction, and destabilization. With nearly 3.5 million people displaced and at least 50,000 dead, the international community, including the United States, has responded with humanitarian aid to try and address the potential for 5.5 million humans at risk for starvation by midyear. However, last month the U.N. reported 79 incidents of aid being either stolen or otherwise blocked. Eighty two aid workers have been killed since the start of the conflict, and around half of those deaths have occurred in the last 2 years alone. Additionally, the upcoming rainy season will further impede delivery of humanitarian aid. For too many reasons, the hunger exists. USAID is a leading provider of humanitarian aid, including more than 620,000 tons of food assistance since 2013. b1815 This resolution calls on the government of South Sudan to cease hostilities and allow aid to flow unrestricted. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus teaches: ‘‘I was hungry, and you fed me. Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Truly I tell you, whatever you did for the least of my brothers, you did for me.’’ In an effort to both stabilize the region and to feed those dying of hunger, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 187. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. I propose to close. Mr. Speaker, this crisis can be stopped in its tracks. There is no need for millions to die. The world needs to step up as it did in the Ebola crisis. The U.S. needs to continue to lead. Our contribution is vital and is based on the size of our economy and the fact that other countries who are not as fortunate contribute in different ways. But the entire world should and does participate. In 2011, 200,000 people had to die in Somalia before the world took notice and acted. This should never happen again. Mr. Speaker, I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, many of us knew President John Garang who tragically died after many years of trying to secure freedom for the people of South Sudan, tragically died in a helicopter crash. He was the father of his country. He was also one who always championed peaceful coexistence among the tribes in South Sudan. He was very different than obviously the current competing warlords for that position. I had worked with DONPAYNE ’Sfather. DONPAYNE , JR., spoke of this issue of the genocide resolution. We passed that resolution through this House together. As a matter of fact, we brought it before the Human Rights Council. DONPAYNE and I traveled up to New York to raise this issue. What is shocking to us about the current circumstances in South Sudan is the effort being undertaken by the world community in order to try to step in and provide some measure of peace. Of course, we have talked today about what has happened to the people of South Sudan, what has happened to our own aid workers there. But if we reflect for a minute that Rwandans have lost their lives there, when we were dealing with this genocide issue in Sudan, we took Don Cheadle, the actor who portrayed Paul Rusesabagina, who was also with us on that trip. We went into Sudan in order to document the genocide that was going on, to speak to some of the survivors. We brought in a Nightline camera crew. Yes, we have, in this case, brought the world community along to a certain extent. But here is part of the tragedy: those Rwandan peacekeepers were slaughtered in South Sudan. So were Chinese peacekeepers. So were Indian and Kenyan and Fiji and Danish peacekeepers. So were Egyptian and Ethiopian and Bangladeshi peacekeepers. So were Benin and Burkina Faso, and Chad and Mongolia. So were peacekeepers from Nepal and Nigeria and Norway, and the Philippines and Pakistan. And this is the kind of attitude that we see from these warlords against their own people and against others who try to come in to keep the peace. And this is why, frankly, in addition to this resolution, it is time—and I know the support is there in the Security Council, I know now there is the support—to cut off the arms and the ammunition going in to South Sudan that helps fuel these warlords. We have heard the passion and dedication of Congresswoman BASSof California. Of course, she has worked with Mr. SMITH of New Jersey, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa, to shine a light on this crisis. As always, I appreciate the assistance of Mr. ENGEL , the ranking member. I share the anguish of my colleagues in seeing the aspirations of South Sudan citizens dashed by kleptocrats and warlords, certainly not in the tradition of John Garang, warlords bent on maintaining power at any cost. The blood of countless civilians is on their hands, and the people of South Sudan deserve better. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to recognize the bravery and selflessness of the humanitarians who are working to save lives and bring an end to the suffering that has been imposed upon the people of South Sudan. I have personally met with humanitarian workers who have been held at gunpoint, who have been threatened, who have been abused in the worst ways. I have met with people who have carried food and medicine on their backs through swamps because there were no roads. Without their commitment, without their sacrifice, countless lives would have now been lost. And while they don’t do this work for the accolades, 
they deserve our recognition and thanks here tonight. I urge Members to join me in honoring them today by supporting this timely resolution. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 187 and to express my growing alarm that we have millions around the globe on the verge of starvation despite the fact that we live in a world that produces more than enough food to feed all its inhabitants. H. Res. 187 rightfully calls for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to continue to provide emergency relief (food and other essential resources) to those affected in South Sudan. It also calls on USAID to collaborate with international relief organizations and others to ensure that aid gets where it is most needed. The resolution also condemns violence and threats against aid workers assisting those in need and calls on the leaders of South Sudan to cease the fighting so that these resources may reach those who need them. This resolution focuses on the situation in South Sudan where 7.5 million are at imminent risk. But unfortunately, at least 20 million people around the world are facing severe food shortages as a result of belowaverage rainfall and conflict. That is equivalent to the populations of the States of Connecticut, Iowa, Utah, Mississippi, Arkansas, Nevada, Kansas, and New Mexico combined. And conflicts in South Sudan, Yemen Nigeria, and Somalia are making bad situations even worse. People are starving and we cannot stand by and watch. I implore my colleagues to support U.S. leadership and funding to address this dire situation. That’s what this resolution is about. The United States has the ability to save the lives of tens of millions of people and this resolution is crystal clear that we should do so. The U.S. cannot end these crises by itself. However, my conscious—and I hope that all of my colleagues would not be clear knowing that I could have done more as a Member of Congress to respond to the suffering and deaths of millions of innocent adults and children across the world facing starvation. This resolution and the recognition of the problem is a good start. I urge my colleagues to also support the inclusion of additional funding in the FY 2017 funding bill that we may consider this week to prevent widespread famine and cut off suffering from hunger as an obvious next step. It is also vital that we provide adequate resources in FY 2018 as well to save the lives of men, women and children. I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman KAREN BASS, for her leadership and focus on this issue as well as Congressman DONALD PAYNE , Jr. and Rep. C HRIS SMITH. I also want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. ROYCE and Mr. E NGEL for their leadership and efforts as well. Now is the time for the U.S. to illustrate its global leadership and act to save lives. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 187, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess for a period of less than 15 minutes. Accordingly (at 6 o’clock and 21 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1831 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee) at 6 o’clock and 31 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 222. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, April 25, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of the Certificate of Election received from the Honorable Kris W. Kobach, Secretary of State of Kansas, indicating that, at the Special Election held on April 11, 2017, the Honorable Ron Estes was duly elected Representative in Congress for the Fourth Congressional District, State of Kansas. With best wishes, I am, Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS, Clerk. SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE RON ESTES, OF KANSAS, AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER. Will Representative elect Estes and the members of the Kansas delegation present themselves in the well. All Members will rise and the Representativeelect will please raise his right hand. Mr. ESTES appeared at the bar of the House and took the oath of office, as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you are now a Member of the 115th Congress. 
WELCOMING THE HONORABLE RON ESTES TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. JENKINS ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to congratulate my good friend and our new House colleague, RONESTES. I have known RONand his wife, Susan, for many years. I can tell you, he is truly one of the nicest guys you will ever want to know. RONand I share a common bond, having served as State treasurers in Kansas, and I have watched him serve in that role well. With a nation $20 trillion in debt, it is always nice to add a fellow conservative to Congress to help fix the debt and get our economy on the right fiscal track, which I know RONis committed to doing. He has dedicated his entire life to bold innovations and efficiency, reform, and problem solving in both the public and the private sector. Kansans in the Fourth District can be proud of their new Congressman, and I look forward to working with Congressman RONESTES on behalf of Kansans. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES), our newest colleague. Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman JENKINS and our entire Kansas delegation, and thank you to all the Members for serving. I also want to thank my wife, Susan Estes, who is up in the gallery tonight. My mother, Lou Estes, is also up there, my son, Brent Estes, and my daughters, Laura Estes and Grace Estes. As you all know, you can’t run an election and you can’t serve without the support of family and friends, so I appreciate the effort that they put in on my behalf. I look forward to serving with you. This is an honor to be a public servant and to work with you in the Chamber. I want to mention that my background, both in the private sector before I was elected county treasurer and then State treasurer, was to focus on how to make things more efficient and how do we get things done. The message that came through in the election was that the voters in my district, like the voters in your district, want to see us accomplish things and want to get them done. I appreciate the time, I appreciate the opportunity, and I look forward to serving with you to accomplish things for our country. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk lately about President Trump’s first 100 days in office. The first 100 days of an administration offer a chance to watch a new President turn proposed policy changes into reality. In southwestern Pennsylvania, we are seeing President Trump fulfill his pledge to end the war on coal, and we are seeing real change. For example, the very day that President Trump signed legislation overturning one of former President Obama’s anticoal rules, a coal company in Somerset County announced it would open a brandnew coal mine that will create at least 70 new middle class jobs. It would be great if President Trump can make it out to the mine’s grand opening ceremony scheduled for June 8. I have met with miners as their mines were closed during the previous administration, and I listened to their stories as they worried about their kids and paying their mortgages. It is a new day, Mr. Speaker, and I look forward to more employment opportunities being created as we begin to roll back the jobkilling regulations in Washington, D.C. 
REJECT DANGEROUS CUTS (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, last week in Michigan, I toured the Bay Area Women’s Center, which provides emergency shelter and counseling to survivors of domestic violence or sexual violence and their children. I toured the Women’s Center to get a better understanding of their important work and see what they do and how they would be impacted by President Trump’s proposed budget cuts. Twothirds of the Women’s Center’s budget comes from Federal grants through the Violence Against Women Act, one of the first bills I cosponsored. I saw it signed into law by President Obama. I am concerned that the cuts that President Trump has proposed would effectively eliminate the important lifesaving care and rescue this organization provides to women, children, and others facing domestic violence. There are 15,000 citizens in midMichigan who could lose access to these lifesaving, important services. What kind of country are we if we don’t provide this sort of support to our most vulnerable citizens at the moment of their need? We need to reject these dangerous cuts. f 
GE’S ECONOMIC IMPACT IN NORTH CAROLINA (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, GE will hold its 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareowners in Asheville, North Carolina. The company will also be celebrating its 125th anniversary. GE likes to hold its shareowners meeting in a different city each year to highlight the company’s strong presence in communities across the United States. It certainly has significant business operations in North Carolina. GE supports nearly 18,000 jobs in the State between its direct employees and its suppliers. For every one GE job, three North Carolina jobs are supported. The company also generates $7.2 billion in total production output per year in North Carolina, and compensates its employees more than twice the State average. GE makes this investment in our great State because it knows that the workers in North Carolina, especially those at the GE facility in West Jefferson, in the Fifth District, work hard and have a commitment to excellence. 
AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Autism Awareness Month. It is shocking to know that at least 1 in 68 children have been identified with autism spectrum disorder in the United States. My own family has been affected by this situation with my nephew Joshua, who is now 20 years old, a bright and energetic young man who is autistic. Mr. Speaker, early detection and treatment plans are crucial to the development of a child’s social, behavioral, and communications skills. As such, we must invest in the research of new interventions, provide support to families and caregivers, and fund programs that assist those living with autism well into adulthood. Right now, 
especially when they age into adulthood, those resources are not there. Mr. Speaker, Sesame Street recently introduced a character with autism named Julia to teach audiences about inclusion. This month is part of a larger conversation about autism derived from a place of positivity. I am hopeful that Julia can help convey such a message to our youth, and I will continue supporting programs that help people with autism and their families by providing the tools they need to succeed. 
CONGRATULATING WESLEY SO ON HIS CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wesley So of Minnetonka, Minnesota, who earlier this month became the United States chess champion. At 23 years of age, Wesley is already one of the world’s top chess grandmasters. In St. Louis, for the U.S. Chess Championship, Wesley So and his opponent went into a playoff after a two way tie for first place. In the twogame playoff, So won the first game handily and was able to force a draw in the second game with a perpetual check with his knight. He extended his noloss streak to 67 games, one of the longest runs in the game’s history. Mr. Speaker, Wesley So has quickly made a name for himself in the world of chess since coming to America from the Philippines 5 years ago. He is now the world’s number two ranked player and is in prime position to play the world’s top player, Norway’s Magnus Carlsen. Congratulations to Wesley So on an impressive run of dominance. We will be cheering for him as he continues to work on becoming the first American chess grandmaster in more than 40 years. 
AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge this Congress to work together to avoid a shutdown of the Federal Government this week. We must pass a clean funding bill that Members from both parties can support, without any ideological riders. We cannot allow the American public and central coast families in my district to foot the bill resulting from partisan gridlock. A shutdown would mean disrupting economic growth and potentially triggering job losses across the country, as we experienced in the partisan 2013 shutdown. A shutdown damages both our economy and national security. It is vital that this Congress put forward a clean funding resolution. It would be irresponsible for us to engage in partisan political games with the funding of our Federal Government. f 
HONORING NANCY LOMBARDO ON HER RETIREMENT (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Nancy Lombardo on her welldeserved retirement. Nancy is the executive officer for the Clearfield County League on Social Services in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District. For the past nearly 20 years, she has been instrumental in leading several programs that the league provides for the betterment of local communities. Nancy manages several programs, including Child Care Information Services of Clarion, Clearfield, and Jefferson Counties; Children First, which is a seminar for divorced parents to help cope with divorce and how it affects their children; Safe Haven, which provides a safe meeting place for custodial parents to have their children visit with the noncustodial parent; as well as the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Nancy has given her time to numerous boards to advocate for children’s needs, day care services, child advocacy centers, children youth services, and more. She has been a valuable and dedicated leader to the league for many years, and she will be missed. On behalf of the Congress of the United States, I wish Nancy Lombardo all the best in her retirement. 
EDUCATION FUNDING IN THE PRESIDENT’S BUDGET (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, our children are this Nation’s greatest asset. Our future is in their hands. We have to make sure that they have the tools they need to lead our country and tackle whatever challenges the future holds. This is why I was shocked the President’s budget makes drastic cuts to education—cuts that will have the biggest impact on kids who need our help the most. In my district, a quarter of our kids live in poverty, with parents working long hours and multiple jobs just to make ends meet. Yet President Trump wants to cut before and afterschool programs, as well as over $4 million in programs to hire and train teachers and reduce class size. As this Congress crafts our budget, I ask my Republican colleagues to reject these cuts and to truly invest in our future. We will never make America great if we leave our kids behind. NATIONAL DONATE LIFE MONTH (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness to April being National Donate Life Month. There are currently 117,992 people who need lifesaving organ transplants. Of those, there are nearly 1,000 Kentuckians on that list. To put it in perspective, every 10 minutes, someone is added to that list. Despite advances in medicine, there continues to be a gap between supply and demand. On average, 22 people die each day while waiting for a transplant. Kentucky legislation passed in 2006 enabling its residents to have their wishes documented through the Kentucky Organ Donor Registry. By joining the registry, an individual’s wishes are documented electronically in a safe and secure database. Several States have also created their own registry. Ninetyfive of Americans are in favor of being a donor, but only 54 percent are registered. This is why registering to be an organ donor is so important. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize my field representative, Amelia Wilson, who received a liver transplant in 2005, and is currently awaiting a second transplant. Amelia, my longtime friend and a fellow Monroe County native, resides in Livingston County with her husband, Allen Wilson. After courageously undergoing her first transplant, Amelia has dedicated herself to advocating for organ donation. We are lucky to have her serving the First District as our field representative. Beyond her service to Kentucky, her activism for this noble cause is what truly elevates her as an advocate, friend, and servant of the First District. During National Donate Life Month, I encourage everyone to remember the bravery and diligence of people like Amelia. This April, please consider the importance of donating life. 
b1930 WE MUST AVOID A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to do everything in our power to avoid a government shutdown. Federal workers protect our public health and environment, they deliver our mail, they help our businesses and home buyers, and they keep us safe. Shutting down the government would suspend their paychecks, damage their morale, and shut off the essential services they provide. My friend, Mr. WITTMAN , and I have drafted legislation to protect the pay of Federal employees in case Congress and the White House fail to reach an agreement. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor the 
Federal Employee Retroactive Pay Fairness Act. This bill is unusual. Usually you do everything you can when you introduce a bill to get it passed. You work hard to get it written into law. But this bill, I will do everything I can to prevent it from being considered because, if it becomes law, it means that Congress has failed and we have shut down our government. Republicans hold the White House and both Chambers of the Congress, so what happens next is up to them. I hope my friends here will have nothing to do with the White House plan to hold hostage the budget agreement and payments to stabilize health insurance rates. I urge my colleagues to act swiftly and responsibly to work out a bipartisan funding bill and avoid a government shutdown. 
ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE FUNDING CUTS (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of communities across Michigan’s First District that depend on Essential Air Service funding for industry, mobility, and economic success. I believe that, when it comes to protecting taxpayer dollars, we as Congress have a fiduciary responsibility to the American people. We owe it to them to evaluate what is working and what isn’t and make the appropriate adjustments. The Essential Air Service program is a great example of a program that is working, and I am proud to support it. EAS grants make it possible for 8 of the 10 airports in Michigan’s First District to provide reliable air services, promote economic stability and job growth, and support a healthy tourism industry in the Upper Peninsula and throughout northern Michigan. The benefits that this program provides to small towns and cities in Michigan and across the United States are well worth the investment, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to ensure full Essential Air Service funding. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF SHARON GIESE (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Sharon Giese. Sharon passed away unexpectedly in Arizona last week, a few short days after the death of her husband, Burt. Sharon was a respected, admired, and cherished member of our community. She had a long history of promoting conservative principles, and everyone she touched will miss her steady voice. Sharon Giese was a steadfast icon of the conservative movement in Arizona and a former Republican National Committeewoman. Mr. Speaker, I pray that the family of Burt and Sharon will receive peace in remembering their lives of purpose and distinction. These two individuals made a difference for Arizona and for the causes they dedicated themselves to. Burt and Sharon left behind a wonderful legacy for their family, community, church, and State. Like Sharon, we do not have knowledge of the moment of our life’s final breath, but we are exhorted to run with endurance the race that is set before us. Sharon Giese ran her race with an abundance of endurance and inspired countless individuals around her. Her example will be celebrated and her loss mourned. f 
AUTISM SPEAKS OUT (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize the beginning of World Autism Month. I am wearing this blue pin to raise awareness for those impacted by autism around the country. There are over 70 million people with autism worldwide, with more children diagnosed each year than with AIDS, diabetes, and cancer combined. This disease impairs the ability for folks to communicate and socialize. This April, it is my goal to join forces with my House colleagues to recognize what has become the fastest growing serious developmental disorder in the United States, one that early intervention can greatly help. On average, having a child with autism costs a family $60,000 per year, an expense that many families cannot afford but are left with no choice. Schoolbased services provide vital education and developmental tools for children with autism, but what happens when the schooldays are over? Once a child with autism reaches the age of 18, many families face a services cliff. They are no longer able to access the care they need. As we work to reform health care in this 115th Congress, we must ensure that individuals have access to the affordable treatment they need and improve the outcomes for youth who are transitioning out of the school system as well. Go to autismspeaks.org, and let’s deal with and work for quality of life improvements for these folks. I urge my House and Senate colleagues to do the same. 
MAKE IT IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, the good news is this will probably be about 15—maybe 20—minutes, but it is a subject that is very, very important to all of us. Actually, I am going to start on a slightly different subject, and that is what is wrong with this picture. A master sergeant at one of the air bases in the United States who has served for some almost 30 years, married the last 18 years to a young woman with three children. She attempted to return from deployment in the United Kingdom, had her passport removed, and she was deported to Mexico. Her children are in the United States. She served for 18 years alongside her husband as he built and maintained America’s fleet of spy planes. What is wrong with this picture, America, that a wife of a servicemember who served for 18 years alongside her husband, a master sergeant, cannot come back into the United States because of an error that was made years and years ago? We are going to follow this up. When our generals talk about taking care of their troops, may I suggest they also take care of their spouses. We have got work to do here. But the subject matter for tonight is a little different, although that issue is much on my mind. Some of you may have seen this on the news a month and a half ago. That is the Oroville Dam spillway. A maintenance problem not paid attention to over the years resulted in a massive failure of the spillway and put 188,000 of my constituents and Mr. LAMALFA ’s constituents at risk. This is the Interstate 5 bridge in Washington State connecting the United States to Canada. It collapsed. We could put up pictures of other bridges in Minnesota, et cetera. What we are talking about tonight is infrastructure, not just about infrastructure. The President wants a trillion dollar infrastructure program, and we await his proposal. It would be good. We would put millions of Americans to work if we were to have that infrastructure program. But there is more to it than just infrastructure. In the last 5year transportation bill, I was successful in working with other Members here to insert into that bill that at least 70 percent of the value in our transit systems be American made. So tonight’s subject matter is really about the failing infrastructure, but it is also about making it in America. This is a subject matter that, for 7 years, I have talked about on the floor here: Make It In America. Our President wants to talk about this and, in fact, recently issued an executive order that says we ought to make it in America. He instructed his administration, as few as they are, to make sure that, in every effort, the Buy American provisions be honored. That has not been the case in the past. What we need to do is make certain that we make it in 
America, that we spend the American taxpayer money on Americanmade products. Let me give you an example of what it means when you actually do that—or maybe an example of what it means when you don’t do that. Now, Californians take great pride in their State. We have the Golden Gate Bridge. We have Yosemite. We have the great industries of southern California—the entertainment, the movie industries and the rest—and we have San Francisco. We also have major policy problems. Make It In America: I want to give you two different examples. The San FranciscoOakland Bay Bridge, now completed. It is a beautiful bridge, and it replaces an old bridge that was built in the 1930s that was seriously deficient. However, it was made with a large, large input of Chinese steel. It actually came in $3.9 billion over budget, but we did provide some 3,000 jobs in China, and we allowed the Chinese steel industry to build a new steel mill to be able to produce the very highquality steel that was supposed to be in the bridge. However, the steel that they shipped wasn’t exactly high quality, the welds weren’t exactly good, and we wound up seriously over budget for that as well as other reasons. So maybe Californians don’t always have the position of taking pride in all that is done. This I take no pride in. This was a serious mistake by the State government, a serious mistake by the agency that ran and put this bridge into process. What would it mean if, for example, instead of trying to save 10 percent on the cost of steel, our Californian colleagues would have actually said, well, maybe those jobs should be in America and that new steel mill should be in America? Could have, should have, but it didn’t happen. Now, on the other side of the continent we have New York. Now, we Californians don’t much like to talk about New York but, hey, here is something to talk about. Here is something that really worked out well. It seems as though New York wanted a new bridge over the Hudson River, the new Tappan Zee Bridge in New York, and they made a decision: it was going to be built with American steel. Wow, what a noble thought. And all of that from New York, as opposed to California that said: Oh, let’s go with China. So what happened? The steel arrived. The steel was quality. The bridge was built, $3.9 billion, on budget, on time, and there was some 7,700plus American jobs. It makes a difference when you make it in America and when your tax dollars—State, local, and Federal— are spent on Americanmade equipment and supplies: American steel, American jobs, an American bridge. The Oakland Bay Bridge, San FranciscoOakland Bay Bridge: Chinese steel, Chinese jobs, over budget, bad quality, and the story is not a good one. So the issue of the day is: Buy American. Yes, indeed, we should and we could. Let me give you an example of what happens. My Republican colleagues like to take on the bailout. They like to talk about how bad the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was. It wasn’t bad. It was actually very good. It could have been better if there had been more infrastructure and more Buy American, but there is one provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that really made a difference. b1945 It was for the Amtrak systems. Basically, the systems here on the East Coast, the electrification. New locomotives for the East Coast corridor. Wow. Some $700 million. I think it was 80, maybe 90 new locomotives to be built. American companies looked at this and said: We don’t build locomotives anymore. We certainly don’t build diesel electric or all electric locomotives, so we will let this one go. Well, there is that German company called Siemens. They said: $700 million, 80 or so locomotives. We have a manufacturing plant out in Sacramento, California. We make light rail cars out there and transit cars. You say: 100 percent American made? Everything from the electric motors to the brakes, to the wheels, to the paint, 100 percent American made? The German company said: We can do that. We could make it in America. And they did. The last train has been produced. This is the first train. Don’t tell me we can’t make it in America. Don’t tell me that our American taxpayer dollars should be spent in China, Japan, or someplace else. No. Build it in America. Buy American. And we will put thousands—in fact, tens of thousands of people to work. I want to give you another example. The American maritime industry has been in a very steep decline for the last 4 decades. Following World War II, we had over 1,500 American ships. A decade ago we had over 200 ships on the ocean. Our shipyards were making LNG tankers 20 years ago, and they were American flagged. There were American mariners on those ships. Today, we have less than 80 American flagships, and we don’t make large commercial ships in the United States, except on rare occasions. The maritime industry is absolutely critical for national defense. How do you think our men, women, and equipment get to the troubled spots of the world? You don’t fly the M1 tank on an airplane. You put it on a ship. You put the trucks on a ship. You put the artillery on a ship. But where are the American ships? Oh, I know. We will call China and they will deliver our goods to the South China Sea. I doubt it. I don’t think so. If you are concerned about national security, you had better be thinking about the American maritime industry. Are you thinking about it? Are you thinking what is really possible if we were to write 16 lines of law this year? It has to do with the export of two strategic national resources: oil and natural gas. Now operating in Texas is an LNG— liquefied natural gas—facility exporting American natural gas. They liquefy it, put it on a ship, and off it goes to somewhere in the world like China. That is okay. It will take 100 or more LNG tank ships to meet the full export potential of that one facility when it comes fully on line. There are five other LNG export facilities licensed in the United States, one which is being built near the Washington Capital, in Maryland. Perhaps 250—225 new liquefied natural gas tank ships are going to be needed in the next decade or so. Are any of them to be built in America? No, nada, none, unless we pass a piece of legislation that we call energizing American shipbuilding. There are 16 lines of law that say it is a strategic national security issue to be able to build commercial ships in the United States. The export of an equally strategic national asset—LNG and crude oil—should be on those ships. This is not new policy. When the North Slope of Alaska opened nearly 50 years ago, it was American steel in the pipeline, it was American ships that were taking that crude oil out of Valdez, Alaska. Over the years, we kind of forgot about that and the law disappeared. Now it is not American ships and not American sailors. We can do this. The energizing American shipbuilding piece of legislation will be introduced this week. We have some 20 or more coauthors. We want to follow what our President says about: Buy American, build it in America. How many jobs are we talking about? Well over a couple hundred thousand in the shipyards. And if that bill passes as we have written it, that would require that the engines, the compressors, the pumps, the anchors, and the electronic equipment be American made also. We are talking about a whole supply train throughout most every State and businesses that are as reflective as the American manufacturing sector used to be. There is enormous potential in public policy that actually puts in place laws that build upon the strength of America, strengthening our national security, and at the same time strengthening a critical industry in America: the shipbuilding industry. And, of course, American ships will be American flagged with American mariners. This is a good thing for America. This is a very good thing for our national security. It is a very good thing for jobs. 
For our taxpayers, what does it mean? Well, these are commercial ships, so no direct. However, if the American shipyards are able to reconstitute their ability to build large commercial vessels, they will also be able to compete for the naval vessels and begin to give America naval construction competition in the shipyards. It is not a bad thing to have competition. That is one. Number two. For more than 3 decades we have had the School Lunch Program, which is also the School Breakfast Program, which is a critical program that provides nutritious meals to students in our schools who would not otherwise be fed. Now, there is one genius here that said: Well, hungry kids can learn. Really? I know a lot of my colleagues that can’t think if they are hungry. At least that is a good reason to assume what they are actually talking about in policy. But a hungry kid will not be able to learn. They are thinking about their stomach. They are thinking about that ache. We have had the school nutrition program for some time—lunches and breakfasts. The law says that the food should be produced in America, but the practice is different. The practice is: We will buy wherever we can. Now, I will give you an example. A school district in Sacramento, California, whose name actually happens to be similar to the city, decided that they should purchase Chinese peaches in big cans. Yet, within 10 miles of that school there were three packing plants that produced Californiagrown peaches. It turns out that the Chinese peaches have some label on it that says organic. Right. Now, there is a label you can believe. It turns out that they are really not too organic at all. So in terms of quality, in terms of food that is produced domestically and locally, the Buy American provisions that have been in the law for the School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program need to be observed by school districts across this Nation. So we have introduced another bill called American Food for American Schools. It doesn’t change the basic requirement that the food be American produced food by our farmers and by our packing houses and by the facilities that take that food and bring that nutritious meal to the schools. No. It simply says that school districts can no longer ignore the law. That they are going to be required to follow the law, to report and to seek a waiver if the cost of domesticallygrown peaches, peaches grown within 10 miles of the Sacramento school district, are too expensive compared to peaches that are imported from California or some other part of the world. They could seek a waiver. They could prove that those peaches are nutritious and that they are not somehow contaminated. We have done the studies, and there is some question about whether there is or is not contamination. But I know that in California, we have the strictest laws concerning the quality of the food, both on the tree and in the can. I want our students to have the best. If the cost is way out of line, a waiver can be sought and granted. But no more willynilly not paying attention to the law, which says: American food for American schools. And now there will be somebody watching to make sure that that law is followed. I would also add that a similar bill is now being pushed through the California legislature. So, once again, it comes back to this issue: Do you want to grow the American economy? Do you want to use our taxpayer money to support American jobs and American manufacturing? Or are you willing to just not worry about it and let the jobs go wherever they may? I am still trying to find who it was; maybe one of my colleagues here in the House of Representatives or a Senator, but quite probably some staff person that when they wrote the American Recovery Act, they said: Great, we need new electric locomotives on the Eastern corridor. And they said: 100 percent American made. Hundreds of jobs in Sacramento building these. And the electric engines, the brakes, the steel, all the rest of it, all gathered from America, 100 percent American made. So don’t let anybody tell you it can’t be done. If we write the law, it will be done. Those LNG ships, those oil tankers that will take our crude oil and ship it around the world, those can be built in America, in the American shipyards with American welders and plumbers and boilermakers and naval architects and American businesses providing the jobs here in the United States. It is possible. But, colleagues, it takes a law. That is our business: to pass laws that support the American jobs, that support American businesses, just like the American Recovery Act. Sixteen lines of law. The export of crude oil, the export of LNG, starting with 5 percent in the first year, and then building up to 25 percent over the next 7 years. American ships will be built, American sailors will be on it, and American jobs will be here in the United States. We can do it if we want to. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. MARINO (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for today and the balance of the week on account of a family medical issue.

The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was called to order by the Honorable BEN SASSE, a Senator from the State of Nebraska. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer: Let us pray. O God most high, we know not what a day will bring forth—sorrow or joy— but our eyes are on You. Sustain our Senators in their work. Give them the wisdom to repay Your Grace with the currency of their gratitude. Lead them to bear the burdens of the marginalized and so fulfill the law of love. Lord, teach them anew the meaning of faith, hope, and love. Give them even tempers that can meet upsetting things with calm serenity. Lord, keep them from being ashamed of that which they should be proud and proud of that which they should be ashamed. We pray in Your powerful Name. Amen.
