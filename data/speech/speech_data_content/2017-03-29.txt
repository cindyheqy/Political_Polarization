Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, last week was an historic week in many respects. My Republican colleagues have indicated, for 6 years, they wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They introduced a bill which really did not accomplish that objective, but it did undermine, very severely, the protections and the opportunities that the Affordable Care Act provided our citizens. That bill did not come to a vote. Had it come to a vote, it would have lost very substantially. Mr. Speaker, the proclamations last week by Republican leaders are that the Affordable Care Act will now remain in place. As PAUL RYAN, our Speaker, said on Friday: ‘‘ObamaCare is the law of the land.’’ b1015 The Affordable Care Act is, indeed, the law of the land. Mr. Speaker, I rise, however, in a deep concern that the Trump administration and its allies in Congress will take steps to undermine the law and weaken it, to the detriment of millions who will see their health care put at risk. In other words, in my view, they may well try to do indirectly what they could not do directly. Let it be absolutely clear: Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. As a result, they are the governing party and will be responsible for anything that happens to our healthcare system on their watch. Even without the passage of a repeal bill, the Trump administration’s actions could fundamentally undermine the law and the stability of our healthcare system. First and foremost, the Trump administration must commit to continuing payments for costsharing subsidies. We met with insurance companies yesterday to see whether or not the environment that was being created by the administration was undermining confidence so that it would undermine the ability to price the product that Americans need: healthcare insurance. Costsharing payments, paid for and in the bill, are being put at risk by a suit that the Republicans in the House of Representatives have filed. They ought to withdraw that suit to give confidence to the system. We all know that confidence in markets is critically important. This is essential to preserving the affordability and accessibility of health care for millions of Americans and to ensuring stability in health insurance markets. The uncertainty around costsharing subsidies that has been perpetrated by the administration’s silence on this issue, must come to an end. The administration has said the system will implode. It will only implode if they are forced to do so by the administration through executive action. Insurers are preparing to file rates as soon as next month in some States. Without a clear and public commitment from the administration, we could very well see premiums spike and insurers flee. Americans have made their opinion pretty clear. They said: Do not do that. Do not undermine the system. Second, already, President Trump has undermined that requirement through lax enforcement that the individual responsibility requirement—a Republican suggestion, a Heritage Foundation suggestion, a Romney adopted policy in the State of Massachusetts—a premise of personal responsibility that is being undermined right now by the Trump administration. The individual responsibility requirement is vital to ensuring that those with preexisting conditions can be guaranteed coverage. To my friends across the aisle who talk often about defending our Constitution, I would remind them that the President has sworn an oath to faithfully execute the laws of this Nation; not picking and choosing which ones he likes. Third, the administration can—and I would suggest it should—encourage States that have not yet accepted expanded Medicaid to do so. It works. According to a 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human Services, in the expandedMedicaid States, premiums were 7 percent lower on average. Mr. Speaker, just yesterday, the Republicancontrolled Kansas State legislature—Republican Governor, Republican House, Republican Senate—sent a bill to the Governor that would expand the State’s Medicaid program. Presumably, they made a judgment that was in the best interest of their State and the best interest of their people. The Republican sponsor of the bill, State Senator Vicki Schmidt said: ‘‘I don’t believe we can wait for D.C. They had an opportunity, and they didn’t take it.’’ So her response was, and the legislature’s response has been: adopt Medicaid expansion. We have heard a lot from Governors of both parties from States with expanded Medicaid, almost universally extolling the benefits that they provided, and urging Congress not to roll it back. The Trump administration must recognize the importance of Medicaid expansion and support ongoing efforts in States like Kansas, Virginia, and Maine to do what is right for their people and their State. Fourth, the Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Price, has a responsibility, a duty, an obligation to focus at least as much on outreach and enrollment, as did his predecessor, Secretary Burwell, to let people know what options they have, what opportunities they have, what protections they have, what securities they can achieve. Earlier this year, the Trump administration, instead, intentionally sabotaged enrollment efforts in the final week, pulling media ads to let people know what they could sign up for, and ending other outreach programs. This move resulted in half a million fewer people obtaining affordable coverage through the marketplaces—the first decline in the history of the law. Those people will be hurt because some of them are going to get sick. Some of them may have a catastrophic accident, and they will need insurance, and they will not have it because they did not get the information that they needed. Now that the Affordable Care Act will continue to be the ‘‘law of the land,’’ to use words first spoken by former Speaker Boehner in 2012, the issue in 2012 was the Affordable Care Act—President Obama’s probably crowning achievement. Republicans called it ObamaCare, derisively. We call it the Affordable Care Act, supported by President Obama. After the 2012 election, Speaker Boehner said, well, we resolved that issue. The American people have voted to confirm a President whose principal law that was. But the Republicans kept trying to undermine it. They kept trying to say they wanted to repeal it. And now they have all of the power. They haven’t done that. Don’t break it. If you couldn’t do directly something, don’t do it indirectly. Don’t undermine the security of the American people indirectly; not through law. So when open enrollment comes later this year, Mr. Speaker, it would be a dereliction of duty—let me repeat that: it would be a dereliction of duty—not to inform Americans to know how they can benefit under the law, what options they have for finding coverage at more affordable rates or through expanded Medicaid. Let there not be a dereliction of duty. The larger point here, Mr. Speaker, is, as I have said, that Republicans cannot now simply throw up their hands and say: We failed to offer a viable alternative, and we will now, by action and inaction, by negligence and malfeasance, conspire to undermine the options that are available to the American people. More than twothirds of Americans have said that is not a responsible policy. The Affordable Care Act has brought protections and benefits to millions. Twenty million more people are insured in America. But now my Republican friends, who have no workable alternative, are in power; and it is 
now their duty to ensure that they faithfully execute existing laws to benefit the American people. If they fail to do so, or intentionally sabotage the current healthcare system, they will surely be held accountable by the American people. Democrats don’t want to see that happen. We reject the premise of some kind of death spiral. By the way, the Congressional Budget Office—an independent bipartisan group, but its director appointed by Republicans—said it was not only not on a death spiral, but it was stable. The yardstick by which we all ought to be judged is not whether the law succeeds just enough, but whether we can work together—work together, work together—to make the law work as best it can, to benefit as many Americans as it can. President Trump, speaking at that rostrum, looked directly into the TV camera of 100 millionplus Americans and said: I want every American to have health insurance that will be cheaper and higher quality than we have today. Mr. President, if you send such a bill to this House, I will vote for it. I haven’t seen a bill like that, but if I see it, and if you send it down here, and that is your commitment, I will vote for it. Mr. Speaker, I hope my friends across the aisle will take a lesson from last week that, to paraphrase the President, health insurance is indeed complicated, and that it will truly take both parties working together towards consensus to meet the healthcare challenges we face. Our constituents and our country is counting on us not to fight, not to throw bricks at one another, but to act in their best interest. And what I urge the Trump administration to do, Mr. Speaker: Do no harm until you have a bill that accomplishes what you said to the American people you want to accomplish. Mr. President, do no harm. Ensure that the American people continue to have access to affordable, quality health care. 
HONORING SERVICE OF DR. THOM MASON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Dr. Thom Mason, who has served as the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 10 years. Thom joined ORNL in 1998 as a condensed matter physicist, and quickly demonstrated his talents as a visionary scientific leader. He led the completion of the oneof akind Spallation Neutron Source, which has provided a decade of exceptional research. When promoted to lab director, Thom led ORNL to many other successes: the development of two supercomputers which at different times ranked as the most powerful in the world; and ORNL’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, which is revitalizing American manufacturing. Thom served our community as chairman of the Oak Ridge Public Schools Education Foundation, leading the multimilliondollar expansion of Oak Ridge High School; and as chairman of Innovation Valley, a regional economic development partnership. Thank you, Dr. Thom Mason, for many years of dedicated service to the great State of Tennessee and our Nation. f 
b1030 HEALTH CARE, NOT WEALTH CARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I will say today what I said when we were working to pass the Affordable Care Act, what we said when we were having some 181 witnesses to appear over a 2year period having 79 hearings: I said then that I would fight to make sure that health care would not become wealth care in the richest country in the world. I still stand on that basic premise. We cannot allow health care to become wealth care in the richest country in the world. Wealth care is where the wealthy will receive the very best care that is available; and the poor will get care, but it won’t be health care. It will be sickness care. It will be sickness care because, when they are sick, they will be able to go to an emergency room and get care. When they are sick, they will be able to get emergency care, which will cost all of us more, but they won’t get preventive care. They will get stabilized if they have diabetes, but they won’t get the continued care that they need to treat that disease. We don’t want, in the richest country in the world, health care to become wealth care. Recently, we had a piece of legislation that was going to accord the 400 richest families in this country $7 million a year. That was what the bill would have done that failed. The 400 richest families making $3 million a year would get $7 million additional every year in the final analysis ad infinitum. That is $7 million additionally. We are the richest country in the world. We can afford to take care of those who find themselves living in the streets of life who cannot take care of themselves. We cannot allow health care to become wealth care in the richest country in the world. How rich are we? Well, one year a man made $3 billion. By the way, he is not the only person to make this kind of money. I just use this kind of example. A minimum wage worker making $7.25 an hour, it will take that worker 198,000 years to make $3 billion. That man making $3 billion will get the best wealth care this country can afford. But we have got to make sure that those who are working at minimum wage, working fulltime, living below the poverty line, make sure that they get the best health care. I am a proud Texan. I love my State, but I don’t like what we have done when it comes to health care. Texas has refused to help those living in the streets of life. We look out for those living in the sweets of life. We take care of them. But Texas has the opportunity to receive $100 billion—with a B—to expand Medicaid. Medicaid expansion, this is for those persons who are not as fortunate as we are here in Congress who will have the best health care in the world, by the way, as we cut health care for those who cannot afford it, as we cut the expansion of the Affordable Care Act for those persons who would get Medicaid, as we cut Medicaid. We are going to have good health care. Texans who happen to be oil barons and rich, are going to have good health care. We are going to have good health care. But those who need Medicaid, who could benefit from the $100 billion that the State of Texas has refused to accept and has never said that it wasn’t needed, are not. There has never been a case made for a lack of need for the $100 billion to help Medicaid expansion for people who are in need of help and need of health care. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this in the richest country in the world—and we are. Don’t let people try to convince you that we are broke. We are not broke. We can afford to take care of people who need health care. I will close with this: we ought to have a sense of responsibility for every person in this country who may get sick. There is this notion of, but for the grace of God, there go I. If we had been fortunate enough to have good health, remember, you may not always. But for the grace of God, there go I. 
ANTISEMITISM AT THE UNITED NATIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, last Congress, I joined several of our colleagues in forming the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating AntiSemitism. As a cochair, a distinction that I am proud to share alongside my pals, ELIOT ENGEL , C HRIS SMITH, T ED DEUTCH , KAYGRANGER , NITALOWEY , PETER ROSKAM , and M ARCVEASEY , it is important to call attention to anti Semitism in all of its forms and to work to root it out whenever we can. I am also extremely honored to have been named by Speaker RYAN to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council earlier this year. As we know, it was the antiSemitic attitudes across Europe, in the 1920s 
and 1930s, that gave rise to Hitler and the Nazis who exploited the deepseated hatred of Jews to take power, culminating in the systematic and deliberate murder of over 6 million Jews during humanity’s darkest period, the Holocaust. In these capacities, I intend to continue to raise awareness on the rising level and this trend of antiSemitism worldwide and to take actions against it, as I have done for many years now. The fight against global antiSemitism must start with strong U.S. leadership. We have the means, we have the leverage, but we must be resolute in our efforts to stem the tide of anti Semitism and to reverse it. Today, Mr. Speaker, we hear about the dangers of antiSemitism across the world and how, in many places, Jews are being targeted in an alarmingly increasing trend. But I want to highlight an area that needs to be brought into greater focus when we discuss combating global antiSemitism. It is something that an old friend of mine, Natan Sharansky, so succinctly and astutely described. Natan and I have had the opportunities to discuss everything from anti Semitism to oppression in Cuba, my native homeland, and in Russia; and his insight is extremely valuable. What Natan Sharansky has helped define is the new antiSemitism and what he calls the three Ds: double standards, demonization, and delegitimatization. And I think the clearest example today of Natan’s three Ds can be seen unfortunately at the United Nations with its antiIsrael, antiSemitic agenda, most notably at bodies like UNESCO, UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council, and other U.N. bodies. All of these clearly exhibit the double standards: condemning Israel based on faulty or illegitimate claims, while ignoring the very real problems of other member states. Israel is repeatedly and singularly isolated, targeted, and demonized. And, of course, there is no other nation that is subjected to efforts to delegitimize it or its existence like Israel. So what do we need to do? Well, we have to look around at what agencies are doing. The efforts at UNESCO to erase Jewish historical and cultural ties to their ancient homeland, Jerusalem, have been appalling. The move by the Human Rights Council to establish a blacklist to target individuals and entities that do business with Israel, legitimatizing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, BDS, and the efforts to take Israel to the International Criminal Court or to force Israel to agree to a onesided peace plan, these all reach the height of delegitimatization. All of this is taking place at the United Nations, the body that was forged in the aftermath of the Holocaust and World War II. We need to fight the scourge of antiSemitism on all fronts, Mr. Speaker, and not just at the U.N. But if we fail to reverse the systematic and endemic antiSemitism at the U.N., we are going to have a hard time achieving much success in any of our other endeavors. That is why I will introduce a bill soon that addresses these problems at the U.N., and I urge my colleagues to join me in an effort to defeat the intolerance wherever and whenever it appears. AntiSemitism is one of the world’s oldest forms of hatred and, for too long, has gone unaddressed. We have a responsibility to the Jewish communities worldwide, and we have a responsibility to ourselves to root out this hatred in all of its forms, once and for all. 
THE POLITICAL CLASS AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 minutes. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, you can divide this country into two classes of people, not Republican and Democrat but the political class and the rest of the country. The political class is doing better than ever. Eleven out of 20 of the richest counties in America are in the D.C. metro area. For every dollar the average family in D.C. earns, the average family in Davie County, where I live, earns 55 cents. The political class is alive and doing well for themselves. On the other hand, those who are not oriented to government—doctors, auto mechanics, waitresses, bartenders, factory workers— are still earning exactly what they did 10 years ago. I am not the first person to point this out, but I want to speak about a textbook example of how this dynamic plays out in reality. I am referring to a recently announced $418 million arms deal between the U.S. and Kenya. It is for 12 airplanes that are essentially armed crop dusters. There is only one slight problem with the deal, the defense contractor that was chosen to fulfill the sale doesn’t even make these type of airplanes. They have never done it before. In fact, there is an extra $130 million built into this deal to design a whole new airplane. IOMAX USA, a servicedisabled, veteranowned small business in my district, makes these airplanes. They have been doing it for 7 years. They have got 50 of these airplanes in the Middle East. These planes have dropped more than 4,000 bombs on ISIS. They are the only U.S. manufacturer of this type of aircraft. They were not even considered for the deal, which was awarded without competition. Nobody got a chance to bid. Nobody knew about it, except for the company that got it and the bureaucrats who were involved. That is how the D.C. area got so wealthy. If you know the right people and you have the right lobbyists, you get awards like this from the Federal Government without competition. It doesn’t matter if you don’t even make the product, they will give you some extra money to design it from scratch if you know the right people. IOMAX, a small business just like the millions of others in our country, doesn’t have those connections. The giant defense contractor involved in this deal does, and so they get the money. Something is wrong with that picture. The problem lies with a secretive acquisition unit within the Air Force called Big Safari. Now, I don’t say ‘‘secretive’’ lightly. At one point in 2013, Big Safari’s commanding officer told a reporter: Don’t be angry or upset when your Freedom of Information Act gets turned down; that is just they way we do business here at Big Safari. And the commander’s words were true. I asked for information on this, and they turned me down saying that the information was sensitive, but unclassified, and for official use only. I asked them 19 questions, and they answered only four of them having to do with the very basic elements for the deal that were already public. Under that secrecy, Big Safari doles out billions in government contracts. I imagine it makes things convenient for when Big Safari employees go to work for the same companies to which they direct these large defense contracts, which we have found that they do with some regularity. You don’t even have to go to a different building, in some instances. We have got a confirmed case of a Big Safari employee awarding a contract, quitting, and then going to work on the same program with the same company he has just given the contract to. The forgotten men in this equation are the employees of IOMAX, mostly veterans, mostly blue collar, who have to compete against a $13 billion defense contractor and a $4 trillion Federal Government that appears to have forgotten impartiality. We need to shine the light on this deal with congressional oversight, and we need to ask ourselves who exactly the Federal Government is supposed to be working for, the country or for the political class. Mr. Speaker, we need to fix this. It is a symptom of a very serious disease that our democracy cannot long survive. 
b1045 REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JOE ROGERS, SR. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Joe Rogers, Sr., the cofounder of Waffle House, who passed away on March 3, 2017, at the age of 97. 
In 1919, Mr. Rogers was born in Jackson, Tennessee. Before he became a waffle cook, Mr. Rogers served as a captain in the Army Air Corps during World War II. After the war, he took a job as a shortorder cook, eventually moving to Atlanta in 1949. It was there that he met his future partner in the Waffle House business, Tom Forkner. In famous words, Mr. Rogers told his friend: ‘‘You build a restaurant and I’ll show you how to run it.’’ Their decision was the start of something special. The first Waffle House opened on Labor Day weekend, 1955, in Avondale Estates, Georgia. It was Mr. Rogers’ suggestion to keep their restaurant doors open all day long so people would always have a warm place to eat. Soon enough, more and more towns needed their own 24hour diner, and today, more than 2,100 locations are scattered across 25 States. Georgia leads the way with more than 400 locations covering the State. What Mr. Rogers valued the most was the people, whether they were dedicated regulars, hungry dropins, or the employees who made his dream possible. His passion for people was a defining characteristic in his life and is an endearing trait of the Waffle House legacy. Thank you, Mr. Rogers, for welcoming any who entered the Waffle House doors, regardless of who they were, what time they came, or how they ordered their hash browns. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Southern Soul Barbeque for winning the Southern Living magazine’s first ever Best of the South Award. In fall of 2016, Southern Living polled its nationwide audience to discover America’s favorite cities, hotels, shops, museums, and restaurants in the South. At the end of the poll, America crowned St. Simons Island’s own Southern Soul Barbeque as the best barbecue restaurant in the South. The restaurant opened in 2007 when Harrison Sapp and Griffin Bufkin joined forces to create an authentic barbecue restaurant that embraces its Southern roots. Southern Soul Barbeque was born in a converted gas station with Southern charm, making it the perfect atmosphere to feast on Mr. Sapp’s and Mr. Bufkin’s barbecue dishes. They cook their delicious pork ribs and brisket on oakfired pits outside their restaurant, so patrons know they are enjoying authentic barbecue. Over the years, the restaurant has enjoyed a loyal local following and was even featured on the Food Network in 2010. These days, business is booming, and should only grow from here. In their efforts to feed the folks of St. Simons Island, Mr. Sapp and Mr. Bufkin created more than a barbecue restaurant, they created a barbecue experience. Congratulations to Mr. Sapp and Mr. Bufkin on winning this award, and for the national recognition their hard work earned. REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF BURKE DAY  
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of former Georgia State Representative Burke Day. Mr. Day passed away in his Tybee Island home on March 5, 2017, at the age of 62. Mr. Day was born in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to parents, Cecil and Marian, but he grew up in Dunwoody, Georgia. It was there that Mr. Day met his high school sweetheart and future wife, Sally, at Peachtree High School. During this time, he helped lay the foundation of his father’s new business, Days Inn Hotels. Mr. Day worked with his father to build the very first location on Tybee Island. After studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City and Mercer University in Atlanta, Mr. Day joined the family business of real estate like his father. In 1991, he made his start in politics by running for the Tybee Island City Council on a dare, and won. During this time, he grew to love public service. Three years later he ran again, this time for the Georgia General Assembly House of Representatives, where he served for the next 16 years until his retirement in 2010. Perhaps his greatest achievement was his work on the StephensDay legislation in 2000, which freezes the value of residential property at the time it was purchased. This means homeowners are not taxed out of their homes when property values increase. StephensDay saved local residents hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year. I am proud to recognize today Mr. Day’s time in public service and his contributions to the people of Georgia. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call your attention to the upcoming Gold Star Spouses Day occurring on April 5, 2017, and to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing those who have given so much for our country. Gold Star Spouses are widows and widowers who have lost loved ones during their service to our Nation’s Armed Forces. Through this group, members find comfort, understanding, and an unparalleled support system. On April 5, we all have the opportunity to honor both fallen American heroes and surviving military spouses. 
RECOGNIZING JUDGE MICHAEL J. NEWMAN’S ACCOMPLISHMENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Honorable Michael J. Newman, Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, and who is president of the Federal Bar Association, for his achievements in piloting a special veterans court in Dayton, Ohio. With WrightPatterson Air Force Base and the Dayton VA Medical Center both located in the Dayton community, and with the large number of veterans residing in my 10th Congressional District, southwest Ohio is a prime region for establishing a court that concentrates on veterans’ issues. Judge Newman’s veterans court appears to be the first of its kind in the State of Ohio, and it aims to address an area of need in the Miami Valley, assisting military veterans who have been charged with relatively minor offenses get their lives back on track. In many cases, treatment and strong guidance is a better course of action to remedy misdemeanor Federal offenses than jail time, which can lead to a cascade of negative unintended consequences, such as difficulty in obtaining employment. Thanks to Judge Newman’s efforts to cooperate with the United States Attorney’s Office and the Federal Public Defender’s Office, veterans in the Dayton, Ohio, area can receive treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues, which so often underpin these minor offenses, rather than sitting in jail. Veterans who decide to participate in Judge Newman’s 6monthlong pilot program are required to work closely with a Veterans Justice Outreach coordinator, who acts as a mentor and caseworker, providing guidance, facilitating treatment, and helping secure housing and employment. Besides meeting with their veterans officer, veterans must also attend medical appointments, receive recommended treatment, and not reoffend in order to graduate. Upon successful completion, the misdemeanor charges are frequently dismissed, allowing former servicemembers to truly earn themselves a second chance at life. Of the more than 33 veteran participants thus far, 20 have successfully completed the program, and several others are continuing to make progress as we speak. I commend Judge Newman for instituting an innovative Federal veterans court program that addresses critical needs within our community and resolves programs by rehabilitating rather than simply punishing the brave men and women who have served our country. I also would like to congratulate Judge Newman for his work in implementing a civics program for students to learn about the Federal courts. Developing a partnership between the Federal judiciary and the Federal Bar Association, these interactive court camps invite elementary, middle, and high school students into the Federal courts to learn about the third branch of government. During court camp, Federal judges meet with the groups of students in school classrooms, as well as Federal courtrooms, to teach them about the 
selection process for Federal judges, explain how decisions are made in both criminal and civil cases, and offer an insider’s view on how the Federal court system works. Under Judge Newman’s leadership, the Federal Bar Association’s partnership with the United States Courts will give thousands of young people across the country the opportunity to meet with Federal judges and explore the judicial branch of government. In Dayton, Ohio, alone, where Judge Newman sits, over 1,000 students will participate in the civics program, learning more about the Constitution and Bill of Rights, the separation of powers, the role of the Federal judge, the structure of the Federal court system, and how to become a judge or lawyer themselves. The Federal Bar Association has also added a civics page to its website to make educational materials available for lawyers and judges who choose to serve as mentors in the program. In an effort to encourage direct involvement by American government teachers and students alike, the Federal Bar Association, again under Judge Newman’s leadership, is holding a national essay contest for middle and high school students on the subject ‘‘What Does an Impartial Judicial System Mean to Me?’’ In addition to honoring the student essay winners, the Federal Bar Association and United States Courts will also recognize a select group of top notch civics teachers from across the United States. As president of the Federal Bar Association and a United States magistrate, Judge Newman has spearheaded this effort, publicly urging the association’s 19,000 members to join him in engaging the next generation of attorneys, judges, and legislators. I commend Judge Newman on his tireless work to connect our young people to the best and brightest in the field of law, and for reemphasizing the critical importance of civics in American society. 
DISTRUST IN GOVERNMENT IS AT AN ALLTIME HIGH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, distrust in government is at an alltime high, and it is easy to see why. Our Federal debt is approaching $20 trillion. A child born today in this country will inherit a crushing burden of debt, part of an intergenerational crime without consequence. Meanwhile, the middle class is being hollowed out, if not disappearing entirely. We have a 7millionman strong army that simply opted out of the labor force entirely. Finally, our foreign policy is in crisis. Threats continue to rise abroad as, here at home, we continue to wreak havoc on our own military through mindless defense sequester. By the way, our veterans still aren’t getting the care that they deserve. This is unacceptable. Despite the fact that Congress, by any metric we might devise, is not doing its basic job, in 10 days the Members of this body will adjourn on a 2 week vacation. And in 10 legislative days, if we don’t make some hard choices, the government may shut down, cutting off our constituents from access to programs they depend upon for their livelihood. So my message is simple. My plea to this body is simple. Let’s end the vacation. In what other job would you grant yourself a 2week vacation if you failed to do that fundamental job? I know we need to go back home. I know people want to hear from their constituents. But more than anything else, our constituents sent us here to do our job, to work together to fix problems rather than punting them down the road to the next generation. So, please, let’s stay here, let’s do our job. That is the very least we owe the American people. f 
THANKING TEXAS WORLD WAR I VETERANS FOR PROTECTING OUR COUNTY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, soldiers from south Texas were instrumental in the United States victory during World War I. With the 100th anniversary of World War I quickly approaching, I would like to take a minute to thank our veterans, especially Texas veterans, for protecting our country. In 1916, thousands of National Guardsmen were stationed along the Mexican border. When tensions began to calm, 3,500 soldiers were moved to Corpus Christi, where the city prepared a 200acre site that later became Camp Scurry. By 1917, the camp was closed after the border remained quiet for nearly a year. Once the United States entered World War I, the camp was reactivated and became a training base for the 4th Field Artillery Regiment and the 5th Engineer Battalion. Through the draft, nearly 200,000 Texans served in the military during the war, and 450 Texas women worked as nurses. Today, now, we must remember the 5,000 Texans who died during the war, including seven Gold Star women nurses. Also, a special thank you to the Nueces County Historical Society for hosting the World War I Centennial Commemoration on April 6. Their work helps preserve our south Texas history. 
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight how important our relationship with Israel is, and how our ally in the Middle East is a huge asset to our Nation and the world. Israel is a beacon of democracy in a sea of turbulence. It is a success story of enterprising spirit and indomitable will. I was fortunate enough to visit Israel in 2011 and saw firsthand the high level of strategic cooperation between the United States and Israel militarily, businesswise, technologywise, and socially. Almost 32 years ago, the U.S. signed its firstever free trade agreement with Israel, leading to almost $40 billion in trade annually. Israel makes up more than 40 percent of all investment in the United States from the Middle East and north Africa, and has companies listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, more than any other country other than the United States and Canada. The ‘‘Startup Nation’’ has given the world the USB flash drive, the first PC CPU, voice over IP phone system, and just recently, Intel acquired Israeli driverassistance company, Mobileye, to help develop better autonomous vehicles. Israel’s drip irrigation technology has helped millions around the world grow crops on land that otherwise would be barren, and Israeli doctors have made medical discoveries improving the lives of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of folks worldwide. The U.S. and Israeli militaries also maintain a high level of cooperation and support. Our two nations regularly hold joint exercises and work side by side in developing new technologies, including missile defense systems, weapons technologies, and more. Situated in an extremely hostile neighborhood, Israelis share a unique understanding of the threats posed by Islamic terror groups. Through cooperation, we are constantly monitoring and defeating new threats to both nations. I have been heartened to see the renewal in U.S.Israeli relations since President Trump took office and hope to see them continue to flourish. I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring H.R. 1697, the Israel Anti Boycott Act; H.R. 1698, the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act; and H. Res. 218, Recognizing the importance of the United StatesIsrael economic relationship and encouraging new areas of cooperation. While many around the world are eager to point fingers and attempt to delegitimize or destroy the State of Israel, it is important—now more than ever—that we stand strong with our allies and the only democracy in the Middle East. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend Robert Dillingham, Farina United Methodist Church, Farina, Illinois, offered the following prayer: Creator of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, we come to You as broken vessels, called to Your holy task of governance. Be with the families of these gathered, build up, equip, protect, and empower all to the task before them this day. Bring together through Your spirit those who are divided, and those who divide. Bring healing, bring unity, as You continually offer healing and hope to all of creation. Omnipresent Creator, You have guided creation through the most difficult times. You have called us to this time and to this place, to this activity, to this body. We have followed that calling. Now guide us, empower us, embolden us to this holy work of service and representation of Your creation. Guide us, O great Jehovah. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. STEFANIK led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING REVEREND ROBERT DILLINGHAM The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Reverend Robert Dillingham who led us in the opening prayer. He is a pastor in the Illinois Great Rivers Conference of the United Methodist Church where he serves Farina, Illinois. Reverend Dillingham is both a chaplain and a volunteer firefighter with the Farina Fire Department and is also a chaplain with the Mutual Aid Box Alarm System, division 54. He serves as a hospice chaplain with the Hospital Sisters Health Systems through St. Anthony’s Memorial Hospital in Effingham, Illinois, where he serves patients from over 20 counties in the central part of my congressional district. In addition to his service as chaplain, Reverend Dillingham is also on the board of the Farina food pantry and is a clergy care guide, where he is a pastoral presence in the lives of over 70 pastors. It is my honor to welcome Reverend Dillingham and his wife, Ashley, who is in the gallery today, and personally thank him for offering this morning’s prayer. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our resilient military families. These families endure countless relocations and deployments every couple of years, transitioning to new schools, new jobs, and fitting into new communities. Military spouses wear their own patches of service and share a true sense of duty to our country. They sacrifice a great deal of themselves amid strain and the unknown, while providing unyielding support to their spouse in uniform. Military spouses are often employed in professions which require new licensing that vary from State to State, with fees and wait times. To alleviate this burden and provide predictability in the lives of military spouses and their families, I have reintroduced the Lift the Relocation Burden from Military Spouses Act. Military spouses serve, too, and my bill will help alleviate unnecessary stress and expenses, help make job changes easier, and will give these spouses and their families some deserved predictability as they serve their Nation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. 
LET’S WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my constituents and the millions of Americans who contacted their Representatives last week and voiced their opposition to the Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Although TrumpCare failed, the debate on health care is far from over. I hope that Speaker RYAN will reach across the aisle so we can improve a law that works and is more popular than ever. Thanks to the ACA, over 20 million more Americans are insured. People with preexisting conditions can no longer be denied. Consumers are protected from the worst abuses of the insurance industry. There are parts of the law that can be improved, and that is what we should be working on. The Republican bill never tried; not one public hearing was held on that bill. Their complete lack of transparency in the Republican leadership tried to ram it through without public comment. We worked on the ACA for more than a year before there was a final vote. TrumpCare was voted on in only 18 days after it was introduced—18 days— a bill that would cut 24 million Americans from health care. As ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, I hope to work with my colleagues on a bipartisan solution to improve the ACA. 
CONGRATULATING HERMITAGE FFA FORESTRY TEAM (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the outstanding achievements of four young men in my district. The Hermitage, Arkansas, FFA Forestry team not only placed first in Arkansas but also won the 37th annual National 4–H Forestry Invitational and the National FFA Forestry Career Development Event. The Hermitage FFA Forestry team was comprised of: Ethan Boykin, Hunter Saunders, Cade Wilkerson, and Connor Wilkerson, all of Hermitage, Arkansas. During the Forestry Invitational, teams competed for overall team and individual awards in events such as tree identification, insect and disease identification, forest evaluation, and a written forestry exam. The National FFA Forestry CDE tests students’ skills and knowledge in forest management. As a forester serving in the House of Representatives, I recognize the many hours that these young men dedicated to competing on a national level, and I admire them for their hard work. Additionally, special recognition is due to Mr. Taylor Gwin, who coached the Arkansas Forestry team, the parents of the team members, and the Bradley County Extension Services. They all played a crucial role in making this victory possible. Mr. Speaker, agriculture and forestry are the main economic engines in Arkansas, and there is little doubt, in my mind, that one day soon, talented and passionate young people, such as these, will be called upon to lead our State into the future. Once again, I offer them my most sincere congratulations and wish them the best as they continue to pursue their passion for forestry. f 
DON’T SHELVE FUEL EFFICIENCY RULES (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, in 2009, when gas prices were very high and our dependence on foreign oil was at its peak, the Environmental Protection Agency set standards to increase fuel efficiency of trucks and cars. This helped achieve three main goals: It lessened the burden on consumers faced with high gas prices, addressed the urgent national security priority relating to our addiction to Middle East oil, and sought to limit the admittance of harmful fumes into our atmosphere. At the same time, we made unprecedented commitment to our auto industry, and in their most uncertain and darkest moment, facing collapse and bankruptcy, America bailed them out. We did this, and it came with political consequences, but we believe in their centrality to the future of the American economy, and we still do. That is why it is so disappointing to see the eagerness the auto industry has with this administration’s choice to cave—and cowardly—on fuel efficiency standards. Gas prices may be low now, but they won’t be forever. It would be a misguided decision to shelve these fuelefficiency rules now. 
WHAT MY CONSTITUENTS WANT (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I made a promise to my constituents when they sent me back to office this year. They entrusted me to represent them on the issues that affect them the most. They sent me here to repeal ObamaCare, our health system. Our health insurance system is crushing those that it is supposed to help. They sent me here to remove Washington bureaucrats from the healthcare business and to restore the doctorpatient relationship that has broken down. If ObamaCare has shown us anything, it is that coverage and affordable care are two very different things. They sent me here for sweeping tax reform that benefits every American, to create a tax structure that rewards American workers and American businesses. Lastly, they sent me here to make sure that we secure our borders and enforce our border laws because border security is national security. Mr. Speaker, these are the issues this House should be tackling. f 
NOTHING TO HIDE? (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned that the Trump administration tried to limit former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates’ testimony on Russian interference in the 2016 election. As reported in The Washington Post, Sally Yates and former CIA Director John Brennan had made clear that their testimony would contradict statements that have been made by officials at the White House. The hearing at which they were to testify has now been canceled, and all of us have a responsibility to ask why. If there is nothing to hide about his ties to Putin’s Russia, then why doesn’t President Trump want Sally Yates to testify? If there is nothing to hide, then why does President Trump continue to withhold his tax returns? If there is nothing to hide, then why won’t President Trump make public the visitor logs at MaraLago? We are now in day 68 of the Trump administration. Each day, more and more information emerges about ties between Vladimir Putin’s regime and Trump’s inner circle, and the Trump campaign officials. Each day, the White House scrambles to contain the damage. It is time for the President to come clean with the American people. Mr. President, let Sally Yates testify. Mr. President, release your taxes. Mr. President, let’s see the guest logs at MaraLago. And Mr. President, support an independent, bipartisan commission to get to the bottom of this. The American people deserve answers. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members to address their remarks to the Chair. 
b1215 TAX REFORM (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on tax reform. Many of my colleagues know this is a matter that I am the most passionate about. Mr. Speaker, I am a secondgeneration smallbusiness owner, and my daughters are thirdgeneration. I understand firsthand the impact that unfair, jobkilling taxes and regulations have on Main Street. I know what it is like to nearly lose a family business that was built from the ground up just because the Federal Government believes in a death tax. 
This, my friends, is a tax that strips families of the American Dream they worked so hard to achieve. The inheritance tax takes money from folks who know how to use it to create jobs and donate to charities and puts it in the hands of those responsible for a $20 trillion national debt. Mr. Speaker, I came up here to speak on behalf of the job creators that employ more than half of America’s workforce. These are the men and women who suffer directly from politicians’ kneejerk reactions, politicians who have never met a payroll and have never worked in the private sector. Congress has talked about tax reform for decades, but we haven’t seen major reforms in 30 years. Again, I am asking this Congress and this President to act now. In God we trust. 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH AND THE WOMEN OF DETROIT (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women’s History Month and to show some RESPEC T to a real Detroiter and Michigan legend, my dear friend and Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. Aretha has taught us to be a proud ‘‘Natural Woman.’’ She has forced us, not just to ‘‘Think’’ about it, but also to act. Once called the voice of Black America, Ms. Franklin has been a champion in the AfricanAmerican community for decades and in her hometown of Detroit. With a Hollywood star, 20 R&B number one hits, 18 Grammys, and a Medal of Freedom from President George Bush, she represents the best of Detroit and of our country. This month and every month, we must stand up to lift women up across this country, ensuring that our laws and policies empower and protect all women. I am proud to call Aretha Franklin my friend and to wish her a happy birthday, which was March 25, and to stand alongside this great champion for women everywhere this month, Women’s History Month, and every day. 
IN MEMORY OF CAPTAIN JOHN JOSEPH KEARNEY, USN (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Captain John Joseph Kearney, who passed away on Pearl Harbor Day last year at the too young age of 62. After graduating just 2 years before me at Catholic High School for Boys in Little Rock, John received a Presidential appointment to the United States Naval Academy. Upon graduation and commission, he followed in his father’s footsteps and pursued a lifetime career in the Navy, ultimately retiring at the rank of captain. Captain Kearney dedicated his life to his distinguished military career and received numerous honors and medals for his service, which included work here in Washington and on the 7th Fleet staff in Japan. John leaves behind a legacy of warmth and passion, and his example is one all Americans and Arkansans can admire. I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his fine family and loved ones. f 
RECOGNIZING THERESA LOPEZ (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Theresa Lopez from Madera, California. Theresa was chosen by my office to be March’s Heroine of the Month for the 17th Congressional District. For nearly 10 years, Theresa has served as a veterans service representative at the Madera Veterans Service Office. Theresa understands that our valley veterans and their families deserve the best care and service that they can have because the men and women who have served our Nation’s military, members of your family and members of my family, have made sacrifices that we should never, ever forget. Theresa knows. She’s been working with my office since 2008, and I know that she works hard every day to ensure that local veterans are receiving the VA benefits they have earned. Theresa also does outreach to the Chowchilla State men’s prison and the VA communitybased clinic in Oakhurst, and she is a member of the county veterans court. She has also served as secretary of the California Association of County Veterans Service Officers since 2012. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the service of Theresa Lopez and her strong commitment to serving valley veterans, for we can never, ever say thank you enough not only for our veterans, but for the good work that Theresa has done. God bless her, and God bless the United States of America. 
HONORING CAPITOL POLICE SPECIAL AGENT ANGEL MORALES (Mr. SCALISE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an incredible man, Capitol Police Special Agent Angel Morales, who is retiring after 21 years on the force. Angel has dedicated his entire life to serving our country. From 1986 to 1991, he put on the uniform of our country serving in the U.S. Army, working his way up to sergeant. From there, Angel traded his Army uniform for a police uniform and served with the D.C. Metro Police. Starting in 1996, Angel joined the Capitol Police force, where he has protected thousands of visitors, staff, and Members of Congress who come through our Nation’s Capitol every single day. Since 1998, Angel has been assigned to the United States Capitol Police Dignitary Protection Division, working with many House leaders, including Dick Armey, ROYBLUNT , Eric Cantor, and, for the last 3 years, as the leader of my detail team. I would like to thank Angel’s wife, Susan, and his two kids, Tatiana and Mike, for selflessly allowing Angel to serve our Nation in these roles. Angel, on behalf of my family and the entire Capitol family, thanks for your service. We will miss you, young man. 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TIES TO RUSSIA (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding a real investigation into President Trump’s ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin. I was a journalist for nearly two decades, and for part of that time, I was an investigative reporter. I could tell you that, where there is smoke, there is usually fire. Right now, smoke is billowing out of the White House. No matter how many times President Trump tries to distract us with a tweet, no matter how many times President Trump advisers have held secret meetings with the Russians, no matter how many times the Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence changes his story to protect President Trump, sooner or later, the truth will come out. Vladimir Putin has a driving mission and that is to weaken America from within. So to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I ask one simple question: What would President Ronald Reagan do? Well, I can tell you. He would put our national security ahead of partisan politics. He would follow the facts, and he would leave no stone unturned. Our democracy demands a complete, thorough, and independent investigation into President Trump’s ties with the Putin regime. 
RUSSIA’S THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY (Mr. MCEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, before my time in Congress, I was a trial lawyer. As a trial lawyer, I learned that, 
where there is smoke, there is fire. Mr. Speaker, I am here to tell you that there is a fire threatening our Republic. Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it: Russia attacked our country when it tried to meddle in our elections. But we have a Commander in Chief who will barely acknowledge this act, much less condemn it. Mr. Speaker, we hear tough talk from the President when it comes to Iran, North Korea, and China; but when Russia moves missiles in violation of treaty obligations, when a Russian spy ship patrols just outside our coastal waters, we hear crickets. As evidence mounts that Russia is interfering with the democracies of Europe, we hear crickets. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, this President sees no moral difference between our democracy and the Putin regime. Mr. Speaker, there is smoke; there is fire. Our Republic is being threatened. We are the first responders, and we can only put this fire out with the truth. We need to establish an independent commission to investigate the Trump Russian ties and find our way to the truth. 
COMMEMORATING 20 YEARS OF THE GLUCK FELLOWS PROGRAMS OF THE ARTS (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 20 years of the Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts at the University of California, Riverside. Since 1996, the Max H. Gluck Foundation has supported undergraduate and graduate students as they bring innovative arts programming to schools, libraries, and community centers in my district. The Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts has provided students, families, and other community members with the opportunity to experience art, music, dance, theater, and art history through workshops and performances. Over the past 20 years, more than 300,000 Inland Empire residents have benefited from this program. I congratulate UCR’s Chancellor Kim Wilcox; Dean of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences Milagros Pena; Gluck Fellows Director Erika Suderburg; and especially the Max H. Gluck Foundation and its chair, Dr. Jon Kaswick. I wish continued success to the Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts at the University of California, Riverside. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, March 29, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on March 29, 2017, at 9:28 a.m.: Appointments: Advisory Committee on the Records of Congress. With best wishes, I am, Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS. f 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1431, EPA SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD REFORM ACT OF 2017 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 233 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 233 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1431) to amend the Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 to provide for Scientific Advisory Board member qualifications, public participation, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology; and (2) one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the House Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 233, providing for consideration of H.R. 1431, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017. This legislation will reform the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, Science Advisory Board to ensure that it is unbiased and transparent in performing its duties. The SAB, the Science Advisory Board, was first established by Congress in 1978 and plays a vital role in reviewing the scientific foundation of EPA’s regulatory decisions, while also providing critical advice to us here in Congress as well as the Agency. The information it reviews is used to justify important policy decisions at the EPA and should be held to the highest standards because it is imperative that the regulated community and the public can have confidence that EPA decisions are grounded, that science should be both reproducible and transparent. However, shortcomings with the current process have arisen in recent years, including limited public participation, EPA interference with expert advice, potential conflicts of interest, and serious deficiencies with the process to select the board members. Far too often, the SAB’s authority has been used by the EPA to silence dissenting scientific views and opinions, rather than promoting the impartiality and fairness that is the cornerstone of unbiased scientific advice. b1230 At its inception, the SAB was intended to function independently in order to provide candid advice and guidance to the EPA. Yet, if the Agency undermines this autonomy, then the SAB’s value to both the EPA and Congress, I believe, is severely diminished. Mr. Speaker, to address these issues, H.R. 1431 would reform the SAB and reaffirm its independence so the public and regulated entities can have that confidence that sound science is driving policy decisions at the EPA. The bill makes several important reforms to the SAB, such as requiring board members to be qualified experts; disclosing conflicts of interest and sources of bias; and ensuring that the views of members, including the dissenting members, are available to the public. It provides the public with the opportunity to participate in the advisory activities of the board and gives people the ability to view the agency’s responses to issues raised by the SAB. Additionally, the bill requires that at least 10 percent of the board is comprised of State, local, and tribal experts; that board members do not participate in advisory activities that involve reviews or evaluations of their own work; and that EPA publicly disclose all board member recusals; and that comments are published in the Federal Register. So these reforms will improve the existing regulatory process, while also reinvigorating the scientific judgements that are often directly linked to regulatory decisions. The EPA relies on SAB reviews and studies to support new regulations, new standards, assessments, and other Agency actions. A transparent and accountable Science Advisory Board is critically important and can assure the public that the data that Federal agencies rely on is scientifically sound and unbiased. 
This legislation would reinforce that the SAB process is a tool to help policymakers with complex issues, while also preventing the EPA from taking actions that impede the free flow of impartial scientific advice. Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of an important measure that will improve the peer review process and ensure sound science is used in the Federal rulemaking process. It is a simple, relatively straightforward bill that will make the SAB more consistent, transparent, and accountable to our bosses, the American people. Transparency in regulations based on the highest quality science should not be a partisan issue. In the 114th Congress, a nearly identical version of this bill was passed by the House, I am glad to say, with bipartisan support. I hope we can join together again to pass this important bill with support from Members of both sides of the aisle, from both parties. I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation. This is the 23rd closed rule of this short, new Congress. Both Democrats and Republicans have been denied the opportunity to amend nearly 60 percent of the legislation that has been brought to the floor through the House Rules Committee. This effort by Speaker RYANand the Republican leadership to halt a fair and open debate in the people’s House is outrageous. We are supposed to be a deliberative body where both parties get to deliberate. These Putinesque rules that shut down all debate need to stop. This isn’t the Kremlin. You know, I think Representative ROONEY , a Republican, said it best last week: ‘‘I’ve been in this job for 8 years, and I’m wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that’s been something positive, that’s been something other than stopping something else from happening.’’ Well, Mr. Speaker, today we are considering a piece of legislation that seeks to prevent the EPA from protecting public health and the environment—not exactly positive. This bill was brought to the Rules Committee in an emergency meeting last night. And let me emphasize that, an emergency meeting. Mr. Speaker, I think the American people have a pretty good idea of what is and what isn’t an emergency. A tree falls on your house, that is an emergency. Your rose bush needs pruning, not an emergency. Timmy fell down a well, that is an emergency. Timmy might stub his toe, not an emergency. On April 28, the government will run out of money. That is an emergency, even if it is selfinflicted by the Republicans. And we have no shortage of other actual emergencies that we should be dealing with: a devastating opioid epidemic, crumbling roads and bridges, mounting evidence of Russian meddling in our election, and people being killed every day due to gun violence, not to mention Flint, Michigan, is still dealing with the residual health effects of toxically polluted water. These are just a few examples of actual emergencies that Congress is doing nothing to address. Instead, the underlying bill, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act, is brought to the Rules Committee and to the House floor as an emergency piece of legislation. As we learned last week, the American people are paying attention to what we do here. They are smart enough to know what an emergency is. And this bill isn’t addressing an emergency, Mr. Speaker; it is creating one. The Science Advisory Board at the EPA provides a way for the Agency to use sound, independent, and objective scientific data to help make their decisions. Science, Mr. Speaker—you may have heard of it—is kind of a big deal. But this bill won’t help the EPA to include more scientists in the decisions. It will force them to include people with potential financial conflicts of interest on the Science Advisory Board so long as they disclose them. I mean, do we really want people on our advisory boards if they could profit from a decision that they are about to make? There is nothing scientific about corruption, and this is exactly what this bill will open the door to. This bill also limits the participation of scientific experts at the EPA, leading to a disproportionate representation of big business and corporate special interests. Are these really the people we want making decisions about the health of our kids and the policies that should be protecting our environment? Is that what we want? So what is this bill really about? Well, it is about allowing the Republicans’ big corporate cronies a direct route to the decisionmakers at the EPA. It is about disrupting the EPA’s ability to fairly enforce the rules, hold corporate polluters accountable, and protect our health. It is about undermining scientific fact with political cronyism. Now, maybe things have changed lately. It has been a while since my last science class. But I am pretty sure there is no step in the scientific method that says consult corporate cronies. The truth is that this Republican majority wants the EPA to base their decisions on fiction, not fact. Americans can’t afford to have the EPA run by people who live in a fantasyland where facts and science don’t matter. Our environment and the health of our families are too important. This law is going to have reallife consequences. It undermines science, hurts the environment, and it helps polluters. We need to allow the EPA to make decisions based on fact. We need to ensure that EPA is always free from financial conflicts, not making decisions based on panels filled with industry insiders like the ones that this bill would create. Mr. Speaker, this bill defies logic. It defies reason. It defies sanity. It will hurt the people who sent us here, and it will help polluters. Republicans are putting corporate greed ahead of public health, and the American people will be the ones who will suffer. Americans deserve better. We should be fighting on behalf of the American people. Mr. Speaker, let me tell my Republican friends what I tell first graders that I talk to back in my district in Massachusetts when I go to visit their schools. I usually begin by telling them that science is important. It is a big deal, and it is such a big deal that all our schools teach it. And if you do your homework and if you study hard and you pay attention, you might grow up someday to become a scientist, and scientists are people who dedicate their lives to protecting the health and well being of people all over the world, and they dedicate their lives to protecting our planet. Scientists tell us things that are really important. They tell us things like climate change is caused by greenhouse gasses, something my Republican friends continually deny. They tell us that polluted air can give children asthma. They tell us that lead in children’s drinking water causes learning problems. They tell us pesticide exposure can cause cancer. These are important things. We all learned in school, thanks to science, that the Earth orbits around the Sun, that gravity causes this pen to fall when I drop it, that plants turn sunshine into energy, that dinosaurs roamed the Earth millions of years ago. Mr. Speaker, the first graders I talk to, they get it. They understand the importance of science. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues in this Chamber do not. And I would bet that those first graders understand the importance of making sure that it is scientists who sit on scientific advisory boards and not corporate cronies. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the gentleman’s comments. In fact, some of those comments he was making I thought he was quoting me, or at least quoting parts of my own speech. Certainly, I agree that the decisions made by the Environmental Protection Agency should be based on fact, not by industry insiders, and that is exactly 
what this legislation would do. I can’t think of any instance where asking for more full public participation as well as transparency is not a positive step, and that is exactly what we are trying to do here. In reference to the number of closed rules that we have had this year, let me just remind the good gentleman that 15 out of the 23 closed rules were actually the Congressional Review Act, the CRAs that we have been working on. They are prescribed to be a closed rule. That is the nature of a CRA. So I would think that, in the good gentleman’s estimation of this bill and all the negative things that could potentially come of it, that we should be able to come to some bipartisan agreement on this, especially considering the political climate that we are in today, the occupant of the White House today, certainly in Republican hands, and I would think our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle would be very interested in ensuring an unbiased source of information that comes from the SAB to give to the EPA in making their important decisions. This, I would think, would be a good idea for both sides of the aisle, no matter who is in the White House, and I would agree that it is. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ), my good friend. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of H.R. 1430, and I appreciate the primer that we were just given from the other side on what an emergency is. I would remind my good friend on the other side that, on November 8, 2016, the Americans stood up and said: We have an emergency. We need to change directions. And they elected Donald Trump to be President to do just that. So that is a good reminder. Mr. Speaker, our constituents have a right to know whether or not EPA regulations are based on sound science and if they benefit the American people. Keeping in the vein with what I just said, we have a better way. Speaker PAULRYANhas put out his plan for A Better Way. Donald Trump has been elected for that better way. The American people deserve a better way. This is called the HONEST Act, which I am proud to be a cosponsor of. It is a better way. It is simple and straightforward. It is a message to government bureaucrats they cannot propose costly new regulations without providing sufficient transparency. As my good friend from Washington said: Why would anybody be opposed to transparency and a right for the American public to know? Opponents of this bill apparently think Americans do not deserve to know the truth, not to mention the ‘‘science’’ behind EPA burdensome regulations. b1245 Trust me when I say Americans deserve the truth from the very start. Mr. Speaker, EPA’s regulatory agenda should not require secret science, much less 30yearold data, in order to sell it to the American people. The other side likes to claim that there are a lot of scientists behind this climate change theory, but they won’t release that data. So what are they hiding behind? By the way, I remember Mark Twain said that sometimes the majority simply means that all the fools are on one side. Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for Congress to increase the transparency of the EPA. This HONEST Act will do exactly that by prohibiting the EPA from proposing or finalizing regulations based upon data that is either outdated, it is not transparent, nor is it publicly available for review. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SMITH for bringing this important legislation to the floor today, and I thank the fine gentleman from Washington State (Mr. NEWHOUSE ). Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his speech, but it was on a different bill than the one we are talking about right now. That was a rule we debated yesterday. The rule passed, but we are going to be talking about it today. So I was a little confused trying to follow the gentleman. I also want to remind the gentleman that he mentioned Donald Trump’s election. I will remind him that less than half of the people of the United States actually voted for him. Hillary won the popular vote by close to 3 million. The gentleman keeps on talking about a better way, a better way, a better way. Was that what was on display last week when we spent 15 hours in the Rules Committee debating a repeal andreplace bill on health care that only 16 percent of the American people thought was worth it and that had to be pulled because it was such a lousy process? If that is the better way, I don’t think people want anything to do with it. I would say to the gentleman, my colleague, Mr. NEWHOUSE , who is talking about trying to justify the closed process and saying that some of these bills were CRAs, just repealing regulations, well, my friends chose to bring up these repeal regulation bills under a very closed process. Interestingly enough, these rules were made under a very open process where agencies solicited input from stakeholders and from the public, and it was all out in the open. But the Republicans chose to bring measures to the floor to repeal regulations in such a way that that agency can’t even go back and revisit the same subject of that particular regulation. I think people need to understand this. I don’t think I can ever recall a more closed, authoritarian process than the one that we have experienced under this leadership. This is not only something that I know Democrats have a problem with; I know a lot of Republicans do, too, because what this closed process means is that anybody with a good idea can’t bring it to the floor and can’t have an opportunity to debate the issue. It was funny last night in the Rules Committee, my colleague from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) was kind of crowing about the fact that no amendments were brought before the Rules Committee. I reminded him the reason why no amendments were brought before the Rules Committee is because this bill was noticed as an emergency and there was no call for amendments. Members weren’t asked to bring their ideas or their amendments to the Rules Committee. This would be laughable if it weren’t so tragic. I would say to my colleagues that it is this same closed process that brought us this disastrous health repeal bill that my friends had to pull last week that is on display today. When you have a lousy process, you end up with lousy legislation. This is the people’s House. We are supposed to deliberate, and here is a radical idea: let us deliberate a little bit. Open it up. Open it up a little bit. Let there be some amendments on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. If we defeat the previous question, I will bring to the floor an amendment, which I am going to talk about right now because, Mr. Speaker, we are deeply concerned by reports from our intelligence community regarding Russian interference in last year’s election and even more troubled by FBI Director Comey’s sworn testimony that the FBI is now investigating the possibility of collusion between members of President Trump’s campaign team and Russia. Mr. Speaker, the legitimacy of our electoral system is at stake, and it is time that this Republicancontrolled Congress does its job and gets to the bottom of this. Unfortunately, recent actions by the House Intelligence Committee chairman have left many Members from both sides of the aisle convinced that the committee will not be able to conduct an impartial investigation of this crucial matter of national security. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative SWALWELL ’s and Representative CUMMINGS ’ bill, which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in our 2016 election. For the life of me I don’t know why this is controversial. My colleagues on the Republican side should be just as interested in getting to the truth and getting to the truth in a way that has credibility with the American people as we on the Democratic side do. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FARENTHOLD ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) to discuss our proposal. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend from Massachusetts, and I also thank his able staff for the incredible work they are doing. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the bill before us, the EPA Science Advisory Board, but also I want to talk about Mr. MCGOVERN ’s amendment on Russia. They actually are linked because the last time a great power decided to deny sciencebased policy and to actually dictate politically what was science and what wasn’t was Stalin’s Soviet Russia. A famous scientist named Lysenko turned out to be a fraud and a con artist. But for 30 years, his thinking dominated Soviet science to the detriment of the Soviet people. It actually led to a famine in Ukraine, killing millions of people because he insisted on his political brand of agricultural science, which wasn’t science at all. My friend from Massachusetts I think is wrong when he asks: What is the emergency? I don’t think he understands that, from the Republican point of view, science mixed with public policy is an emergency. We have to do something about it. The world was created 4,273 years ago and carbon dating is a fraud. As your coastal areas are under water, think about the comfort of Republican philosophy: it is just a theory, and disputable at that. By the way, let’s defund any research on it. Let’s back out of our commitments. Let’s be the only major nation in the world that denies that climate change is real and is going to affect us in almost every aspect of our lives moving forward, including our children and their children. We owe them better. That is the emergency. God forbid the Environmental Protection Agency have policies and regulations that are science based. God forbid we look at empirical research to guide us in making thoughtful policies to protect the public. God forbid we look at the science of lead and other toxins in water supplies, let’s save $7 million in Flint, Michigan. Just today they announced a $100 million settlement. That antiscientific decision, that political decision, put the people of Flint, Michigan, at risk, and it is now going to cost $100 million to fix. That is the consequences of an anti empirical philosophy, and that will be the consequence of polluting this board with corporations and corporate representatives who are guilty of polluting in the first place. Of course, they won’t welcome regulation of their own respective industries, and the Republicans are their enablers. That is what is going to happen if this bill passes. With respect to Russia, each day there are more troubling revelations that make clear that seniorlevel Trump officials had undisclosed contact with Russian officials about the campaign, perhaps, the transition, and about sanctions. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was fired after only 3 weeks on the job for lying about this very thing to the Vice President of the United States. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from any Russian probe because of compromised testimony at his nomination hearing. FBI Director James Comey confirmed an investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russian officials. What has been the most visible reaction from my friends on the other side of the aisle in this Congress? The frenetic behavior of the Intelligence Committee chairman that has seemingly compromised the committee’s ability to investigate. This ought not to be about partisan politics. It ought to be about restoring congressional independence and integrity, one of our most cherished democratic institutions; in fact, the most cherished, a free election without foreign interference. So I support Mr. MCGOVERN ’s potential amendment. I will also oppose the previous question. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As we get back to the bill at hand, I think it is important that there are a lot of important topics out there that people want to touch on, and that is all well and good. Just like my friend from Texas, a fine member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, brought up other bills that are important and that relate to what we are talking about here today, and I think that is important as well. But I think I see an underlying theme here. We all agree on one thing: we want the EPA to use science. We want public participation. We want and we need transparency. This is certainly a positive step in a bill, Mr. Speaker, that went through regular order, that was introduced with bipartisan support, that went through the markup process, and that was reported out without amendments, something that this body in the last Congress passed, I believe, in a bipartisan fashion. Just to underscore the importance of taking this important step—and let me underscore again—no matter which side of the aisle you are on, it is important that we do this because of who you may think is the right person or the wrong person occupying the White House, it is important that the EPA has an unbiased source of information in order for it to make its decisions. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a news release from the American Chemistry Council. 
[From the American Chemistry Council, March 9, 2017] ACC SUPPORTS LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE EPA S CIENCE  WASHINGTON .—The American Chemistry Council (ACC) issued the following statement in support of the H.R. 1430, the ‘‘Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017’’ (or The HONEST Act) introduced by Chairman Lamar Smith (R–TX) and H.R. 1431 ‘‘EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017,’’ introduced by Congressman Frank Lucus (R–OK). ‘‘Consistency and transparency are key to the regulatory certainty our industry needs to grow and create jobs. In some instances, EPA has fallen short of employing the highestquality, bestavailable science in their regulatory decision making. ‘‘It is critical that the regulated community and the public have confidence that decisions reached by EPA are grounded in transparent and reproducible science. By ensuring that the EPA utilizes high quality science and shares underlying data used to reach decisions, the HONEST Act can help foster a regulatory environment that will allow the U.S. business of chemistry to continue to develop safe, innovative products that Americans depend on in their everyday lives. ‘‘The Science Advisory Board Reform Act would improve the peer review process—a critical component of the scientific process used by EPA in their regulatory decisions about potential risks to human health or the environment. The Act would make peer reviewers accountable for responding to public comment, strengthen policies to address conflicts of interest, ensure engagement of a wide range of perspectives of qualified scientific experts in EPA’s scientific peer review panels and increase transparency in peer review reports. ‘‘We commend Chairman Smith and Congressman Lucas for their leadership and commitment to advance these important issues.’’ 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to read an excerpt from the American Chemistry Council letter: ‘‘The Science Advisory Board Reform Act would improve the peer review process—a critical component of the scientific process used by EPA in their regulatory decisions about potential risks to human health or the environment. The Act would make peer reviewers accountable for responding to public comment, strengthen policies to address conflicts of interest, ensure engagement of a wide range of perspectives of qualified scientific experts in EPA’s scientific peer review panels and increase transparency in peer review reports.’’ That is a strong statement. I also include in the RECORD a letter from the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION , Washington, DC, March 8, 2017. Hon. LAMAR SMITH, Chair, House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, Washington, DC. Hon. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , Ranking Member, House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN SMITH AND RANKING MEMBER JOHNSON : Later this week, the House 
Science, Space and Technology Committee will consider legislation to provide for Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) member qualifications and public participation. The American Farm Bureau strongly supports this legislation and pledges our commitment to work with the committee in pressing for its swift consideration. This legislation is a priority because it reforms the SAB process by strengthening public participation, improving the process of selecting expert advisors, and expanding the overall transparency of the SAB. While the SAB should be a critical part of the scientific foundation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) regulatory process, EPA has systematically used its authority to silence dissenting scientific experts. Rather than promote fairness, transparency and independence to ensure unbiased scientific advice, EPA routinely has ignored its own Peer Review Handbook and silenced dissenting voices on expert panels. This legislation seeks to reinforce the SAB process as a tool that can help policymakers with complex issues while preventing EPA from muzzling impartial scientific advice. This legislation deserves strong, bipartisan support. We applaud your leadership in this effort and will work with you to ensure passage. Sincerely, ZIPPY DUVALL , President. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, the American Farm Bureau Federation states: ‘‘This legislation seeks to reinforce the SAB process as a tool that can help policymakers with complex issues while preventing EPA from muzzling impartial scientific advice. This legislation deserves strong, bipartisan support. We applaud your leadership in this effort and will work with you to ensure passage.’’ These are two bipartisan groups looking out for the best interests of the citizens of our great country, so I think they make strong statements in support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire from the gentleman how many more speakers he has? Mr. NEWHOUSE. I think we have run to the end of our speakers. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, let me first remind Members that we are asking for a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, we will bring up an amendment that will allow the bill that Representative SWALWELL  and Representative CUMMINGS have introduced, which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in our 2016 election. This is the appropriate place to do it because we are blocked in every other way in terms of trying to bring this to the floor, and the Rules Committee is a committee that prioritizes legislation that helps set the agenda, so this ought to be part of it. This antiscience bill can still be debated and voted on. It won’t derail that, but it will allow the House to be able to deliberate on this bill that would create a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election. b1300 This is a big deal. The American people deserve the truth. My Republican colleagues ought to get out of the way and allow this commission to be created so that the American people can actually have some trust in a process that determines the extent to which the Russians interfered in our election. Again, I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question. With regard to the rule that we are debating today, I would again remind everybody that this is a closed rule. There are some Members of this House who have never seen an open rule, ever. I hope that changes because I do think that, again, there ought to be more deliberation here, there ought to be more back and forth. Even ideas that I strongly disagree with on the Republican side, they ought to have the opportunity to come here and be able to present them and we can vote up or down on them. I think we need to break this pattern of shutting the process down. It is what resulted in the debacle last week with your horrible healthcare bill, the one that only 16 percent of the American people supported. It is pretty hard to get that low, but my friends managed to be able to set a new record on unpopular legislation—so bad that it had to be withdrawn from the floor for consideration. I would argue it is the closed, authoritarianlike process that produced a lousy bill. If my friends continue to adhere to this closed process, they are going to get more lousy pieces of legislation that are going to do great harm to the American people brought to this floor. This bill that is before us today, again, has been brought to the floor under this expedited procedure called an emergency provision. It is just being rushed to the floor as an emergency. This is not an emergency. The opioid crisis is an emergency; the crisis in Flint, Michigan, is an emergency; our crumbling infrastructure is an emergency. There are deficient bridges and roads in every one of our congressional districts. That is an emergency. We need to address that. Keeping the government open is an emergency. But to say this is an emergency is kind of ridiculous. It is not an emergency. It is kind of like our house is on fire and you are saying: I will get out the hose later, but I need to wash the dishes first. That is how this kind of fits into what we are doing here today. This doesn’t qualify for that. On the substance of the bill, we have this radical idea that scientists ought to sit on scientific advisory committees, not corporate cronies, not people who are interested in covering up for polluters or doing their bidding. We think experts and scientists ought to sit on scientific advisory boards. That is the radical idea that we have. This bill, unfortunately, undermines that. What this bill does is threaten public health by stacking advisory boards with industry representatives, and it weakens scientific review. It is that simple. I don’t care what your political ideology is, I don’t think you want that. Let me just mention some of the groups that are opposed to this: The Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Geophysical Union, and the American Lung Association strongly oppose this bill. The American Public Health Association, the American Thoracic Society, and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America oppose this bill. Clean Water Action opposes this bill. Earthjustice, the Environmental Defense Action Fund, Health Care Without Harm, League of Conservation Voters, and the National Medical Association oppose this bill. The Natural Resources Defense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Union of Concerned Scientists all oppose this bill. The Food Policy Action opposes this bill. I can go on and on. Every organization that is an advocate for the health and wellbeing of the American people oppose this bill. We are bringing it up for an upordown vote, no amendments, a closed rule, and here we are. I would just say, Mr. Speaker, again, this is a bad idea. I guess if you are an ally of big corporations or of corporations that engage in pollution, this is a good idea. But if you are interested in protecting the health and wellbeing of the American people, and the globe, for that matter, this is a bad idea. As I began, I mentioned that when I speak to firstgraders, they understand the importance of science. They get it. They want us to be good stewards of the environment. They want us to protect this planet. They understand the importance of science. But I am always amazed how many people in this Chamber just don’t get it. I find that really sad. I want to give my kids, and someday my grandkids and great grandkids, a future where we respect the environment. When we pass bills like this, it makes that less certain. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues again to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and, please, in a bipartisan way, reject this lousy piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. This bill is a good idea, and I think the debate that we have had here today underscores the importance of this as we consider this under the rule. H.R. 1431 addresses problems that have arisen over the years with the Science Advisory Board, and actually would return the Board to its intended purpose—something maybe the gentleman does not agree with—to provide independent expert advice on scientific and technical information. By modernizing the policies and the procedures of the governing of the SAB, Congress, with this bill, can take 
critical steps to make sure that the SAB is best equipped to provide that independent, transparent, balanced review and the analyses of the science used that guides the EPA’s regulatory decisions. One key issue that this measure would address is the importance of having regulations that are supported by science and that are reproducible and accessible for peer review, not antiscience, like some people have said. Quite the opposite. We want science. We want good science. The scientific method demands that the result of scientific studies be capable of replication. This is all the more critical when the information is used to develop and set public policy, which is why the methods and the data used by the EPA and the SAB must be publicly available for purposes of replication and verification. If you don’t want public transparency, I guess you should vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Mr. Speaker, opponents of the legislation have argued that it makes unnecessary and unproductive changes to the SAB, that it would restrict the ability of scientists to engage on the issues they specialize in, creates new burdens through the public comment and transparency provisions, and weakens the ability of the EPA to use the best available science and data to support its rules and regulations. I believe that these arguments fail to recognize what this bill actually does accomplish. They seem to ignore the importance of reforming the Federal rulemaking process in a way that ensures sound science is the bedrock on which Federal rules and regulations are built—sound science; is that a radical idea—and that these are not predetermined political agendas. Unfortunately, the EPA has diluted the Board’s credibility by systematically silencing dissenting opinions, ignoring calls for balanced participation, and preventing the Board from responding to congressional reports. Fully 10 percent of the seats on the Board will be filled by State, local, and tribal representatives, improving the balance of that participation. H.R. 1431 simply encourages greater transparency, debate, and public participation in the Board, which will result in better decisionmaking at the EPA. I think that is something everyone should be able to agree on. I don’t think public participation is a burden, but, rather, a benefit that improves the relationship and the interaction between Federal regulators and the public. By strengthening public participation, improving the process for selecting expert advisers, and expanding transparency requirements, this legislation takes critical steps that will improve our regulatory system, while also ensuring that the most qualified and the most capable scientists are free to undertake a balanced and open review of regulatory science. Mr. Speaker, it is time to update the law. It is time to restore independence to the Science Advisory Board. It is time to strengthen scientific integrity. Science is an invaluable tool that helps policymakers navigate complex issues, yet this resource has been severely diminished if the EPA interferes with expert advice, limits public participation, and fails to disclose potential conflicts of interest. As President Reagan said in guidance to the EPA: ‘‘The purpose of the Science Advisory Board is to apply the universally accepted principles of scientific peer review to the research conclusions that will form the basis for EPA regulations, a function that must remain above interest group politics.’’ Mr. Speaker, I believe H.R. 1431 gets to the heart of President Reagan’s point. Greater debate, unbiased scientific advice and independent peerreviews, and public participation will only result in better decisionmaking at the Federal level. I believe that this is the goal we all share, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, as well as the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 233 O FFERED BY  MR. MCGOVERN  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 356. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of adoption of the resolution. 
The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 232, nays 191, not voting 6, as follows:

HONEST AND OPEN NEW EPA SCIENCE TREATMENT ACT OF 2017 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 229, I call up the bill (H.R. 1430) to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from proposing, finalizing, or disseminating regulations or assessments based upon science that is not transparent or reproducible, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 229, the bill is considered read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1430 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017’’ or the ‘‘HONEST Act’’. 
Section 6(b) of the Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 4363 note) is amended to read as follows: ‘‘(b)(1) The Administrator shall not propose, finalize, or disseminate a covered action unless all scientific and technical information relied on to support such covered action is— ‘‘(A) the best available science; ‘‘(B) specifically identified; and ‘‘(C) publicly available online in a manner that is sufficient for independent analysis and substantial reproduction of research results, except that any personally identifiable information, trade secrets, or commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential, shall be redacted prior to public availability. ‘‘(2) The redacted information described in paragraph (1)(C) shall be disclosed to a person only after such person signs a written confidentiality agreement with the Administrator, subject to guidance to be developed by the Administrator. ‘‘(3) Nothing in the subsection shall be construed as— ‘‘(A) requiring the Administrator to disseminate scientific and technical information; ‘‘(B) superseding any nondiscretionary statutory requirement; or ‘‘(C) requiring the Administrator to repeal, reissue, or modify a regulation in effect on the date of enactment of the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017. ‘‘(4) In this subsection— ‘‘(A) the term ‘covered action’ means a risk, exposure, or hazard assessment, criteria document, standard, limitation, regulation, regulatory impact analysis, or guidance; and ‘‘(B) the term ‘scientific and technical information’ includes— ‘‘(i) materials, data, and associated protocols necessary to understand, assess, and extend conclusions; ‘‘(ii) computer codes and models involved in the creation and analysis of such information; ‘‘(iii) recorded factual materials; and ‘‘(iv) detailed descriptions of how to access and use such information. ‘‘(5) The Administrator shall carry out this subsection in a manner that does not exceed $1,000,000 per fiscal year, to be derived from amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated.’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 229, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1430. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1430, the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017, or HONEST Act, requires the Environmental Protection Agency to base its regulations on science that is publicly available. Why would anyone want to hide this information from the American people? I thank former Science Committee member and former Environment Subcommittee Chairman DAVID SCHWEIKERT for his longtime commitment to this issue, and for sponsoring the Secret Science Reform Act in the 113th Congress. In the last Congress, a similar bill passed the House with bipartisan support. Our goal is to help advance not just any science, but the best science. The HONEST Act is a nonpartisan bill: a change in administration does not affect the public’s right to know and see the science behind the EPA’s regulations. This legislation ensures that sound science is the basis for EPA decisions and regulatory actions. The days of ‘‘trustme science’’ are over. In our modern Information Age, Federal regulations should be based only upon data that is available for every American to see, and that can be subjected to independent review. That is called the scientific method. We can all agree that the government should rely on the best available science. Unfortunately, the government does not always hold to this standard. Looking at the EPA’s past record, it is clear that the Agency has not followed an open and honest process. For example, many major airquality regulations from the previous administration were justified by data that the EPA said they had not seen, even though they proposed the regulation. This means that the EPA’s claims about the cost and benefits of its regulations and the real risk they are meant to address cannot be independently verified by unbiased experts. If the EPA’s mandates really are based on sound science, then the American people should be allowed to see the data. The EPA’s past refusal to cooperate, leads to the question: What have they been hiding? Americans have a right to be suspicious. Mr. Speaker, we all care about the environment, but if policies are not based on legitimate science, regulations will result in economic hardship with little or no environmental benefits. In other words, the regulations would be all pain and no gain. This bill strengthens the previous Housepassed legislation of the last Congress, the Secret Science Reform Act. That bill also required the EPA to base its decisions on information fully available to scientists and the American people. You may hear from opponents of this legislation that it costs too much money. That is based on a CBO estimate from 2 years ago that misinterprets the implementation requirements of the bill. CBO has not reissued that misinterpretation this year after consulting with the EPA. All the HONEST Act requires is that the EPA use science that is publicly available, not make all science public itself. So the cost is negligible. Some critics may claim that it puts personal data at risk. This is false. The HONEST Act specifically requires 
redactions of personally identifiable information and confidential business information. It is also misleading to assert that the bill tells scientists how to conduct science. The opposite is true. The bill reinforces the scientific method and its tenets of observing, hypothesizing, testing, gathering and sharing data, and analyzing and challenging the resulting theories. It allows independent researchers to evaluate the studies that the EPA uses to justify its regulations. The HONEST Act promotes sound science and restores confidence in the EPA decisionmaking process. Finally, the HONEST Act ensures that the EPA is not promoting a one sided ideological agenda. The legislation provides for the type of open and accountable government that the American people want and deserve. You are either for an open and honest government, or you are not. If you are, then support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1430, the socalled HONEST Act. This is the third time the majority has tried to move this misguided legislation, which was formerly known as the Secret Science Reform Act. Unfortunately, in this case, the third time is not the charm. The Secret Science bills that the Republicans tried to enact over the previous two Congresses were insidious bills designed, from the outset, to prevent the EPA from using the best available science to meet its obligations under the law. Those bills were constructed to hamstring the ability of the EPA to do just about anything to protect the American public. As the American Lung Association said at the time: ‘‘The legislation will not improve EPA’s actions; rather, it will stifle public health protections.’’ The HONEST Act, if anything, is even worse than those two previous bills. There are several reasons for this. Like the prior Secret Science bills, the HONEST Act requires the EPA to release the underlying data from any science that is relied upon when taking action. This would cause a host of cascading problems for the Agency, which is, of course, the real reason they are pushing this bill. First, the EPA relies upon science drawn from many sources. Since EPA does not own or control the data for most of these scientific sources, the EPA would have no authority to order the public release of such data. This would preclude the EPA from using the vast majority of peerreviewed science in existence today. Second, under the HONEST Act, scientific studies relied upon by the EPA must be reproducible from the data that is publicly released. However, the EPA frequently investigates and relies upon scientific studies that are inherently not reproducible. For instance, the EPA might study natural or manmade environmental disasters, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, to better understand the effects on the environment and to improve disaster response. Under this bill, the EPA couldn’t use this type of information at all. These problems with the legislation were apparently not enough for my Republican colleagues. They have worked hard to make the bill even worse this Congress. The newest addition to the bill would permit the EPA to redact from public disclosure confidential information, such as trade secrets and public health information. However, the bill then sets up an unrestricted process whereby anyone who signs a confidentiality agreement can access any restricted information in the EPA’s possession. This provision is a Pandora’s box, which could have untold consequences for the EPA, industry, and the general public. First, the EPA will find it much more difficult to collect scientific data in the first instance if people think it will be disclosed at will. This will cripple the EPA’s ability to conduct their own science, which is important since the rest of the HONEST Act essentially places all nonEPA science off limits. This provision is also in direct conflict with any number of other Federal laws, like the Freedom of Information Act, and HIPAA. The bill provides no guidance to the Agency on how to navigate the minefield it creates, which will surely lead to a morass of lawsuits and legal bills for the EPA. Finally, this provision places no restrictions on who can access restricted information. For instance, could a chemical manufacturer obtain access to the trade secrets of a competitor simply by signing a confidentiality agreement? Could insurance companies seek the health information of potential customers? The potential for abuses with this provision are endless. In a day and age when the most valuable commodity on the black market is personal information and trade secrets, it is unconscionable that we are providing an easily accessible source for criminals around the world. Finally, the HONEST Act also foists upon the EPA a massive unfunded mandate. While we have no CBO cost estimate for this bill, prior versions were estimated to cost the EPA $250 million per year. However, the bill restricts the EPA to spending only $1 million to implement its provisions. In essence, this hits the EPA with a $249 million unfunded mandate every year. If that were not bad enough, this bill comes in the face of massive proposed budget cuts to the EPA’s science program by the Trump administration. Mr. Speaker, Republicans claim that this bill is just implementing scientific’s best practices. It is odd, then, that a host of scientific societies and science stakeholder groups have expressed their opposition to this legislation. This includes the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Association of Public and Landgrant Universities, the Association of American Universities; and the American Chemical Society. If Republicans don’t want to be labeled as flatEarth science haters, I think they would want to listen to what scientists say instead of lecturing them about things they don’t understand. In reality, this bill isn’t about science. It is about undermining public health and the environment. That is why a host of public health and environmental groups are actively opposing the bill. This includes, among others, the American Lung Association, the American Thoracic Society, the American Public Health Association, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the Environmental Defense Fund. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  some of the letters I received in opposition. 
MARCH 27, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : The undersigned health and medical organizations are writing to express our opposition to the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 and the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017. Our organizations are dedicated to saving lives and improving public health. Science is the bedrock of sound medical and public health decisionmaking. The best science undergirds everything our organizations do to improve health. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA has long implemented a transparent and open process for seeking advice from the medical and scientific community on standards and measures to meet those standards. Both of these bills would restrict the input of scientific experts in the review of complex issues and add undue industry influence into EPA’s decisionmaking process. As written, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would make unneeded and unproductive changes that would: Restrict the ability of scientists to speak on issues that include their own expertise; Block scientists who receive any EPA grants from serving on the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, despite their having the expertise and conducted relevant research that earned them these highly competitive grants; Prevent the EPA Scientific Advisory Board from making policy recommendations, even though EPA administrators have regularly sought their advice in the past; Add a notice and comment component to all parts of the EPA Scientific Advisory Board actions, a burdensome and unnecessary requirement since their reviews of major issues already include public notice and comment; and Reallocate membership requirements to increase the influence of industry representatives on the scientific advisory panels. In short, EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would limit the voice of scientists, restrict the ability of the Board to respond to important questions, and increase the influence of industry in shaping EPA policy. This is not in the best interest of the American public. We also have concerns with the HONEST Act. This legislation would limit the kinds of scientific data EPA can use as it develops policy to protect the American public from 
environmental exposures and permit violation of patient confidentiality. If enacted, the legislation would: Allow the EPA administrator to release confidential patient information to third parties, including industry; Bolster industry’s flawed arguments to discredit research that documents the adverse health effects of environmental pollution; and Impose new standards for the publication and distribution of scientific research that go beyond the robust, existing requirements of many scientific journals. Science, developed by the respected men and women scientists at colleges and universities across the United States, has always been the foundation of the nation’s environmental policy. EPA’s sciencebased decision making process has saved lives and led to dramatic improvements in the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the earth we share. All Americans have benefited from the researchbased scientific advice that scientists have provided to EPA. Congress should adopt policy that fortifies our scientists, not bills that undermine the scientific integrity of EPA’s decisionmaking or give polluters a disproportionate voice in EPA’s policysetting process. We strongly urge you to oppose these bills. Sincerely, KATIE HUFFLING , RN, CNM, Director, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments. HAROLD P.

AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE  ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE , Washington, DC, March 28, 2017. Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY , House Majority Whip, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE MCCARTHY : As lead ing U.S. science, engineering, and academic institutions, we are writing to express our concerns regarding H.R. 1430, the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017. We encourage you and your colleagues to take additional time to evaluate the unintended consequences of this bill before considering it on the House floor. This bill is virtually identical to the Secret Science Reform Act of the 113th and 114th Congress, on which we expressed similar concerns that have remained unchanged. Of course, regulations and agency actions should be informed by the best available science and a rigorous scientific process. Undermining the integrity of the scientific process, or the ability of federal agencies to utilize rigorous science in establishing policies, could have longterm negative consequences. It is with this in mind that we urge caution in setting laws that submerge science beneath politics. The research community is concerned that some key terms in the bill could be interpreted or misinterpreted, especially terms such as ‘‘materials,’’ ‘‘data,’’ and ‘‘reproducible.’’ Legislation removing concepts like reproducibility and independent analysis from the hands of scientists and into the hands of legislators could undermine the scientific process and reduce the benefits that science could bring to society. With respect to reproducibility of research, it is often impossible to repeat an experiment down to the last detail. Some scientific research, especially in areas of public health, involve longitudinal studies that are so large and of great duration that they could not realistically be repeated. Rather, these studies are verified utilizing statistical modeling or independent data analysis. The same may be true for scientific data from a onetime event (e.g., Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill) where the data are gathered in real time. It is unclear if data from studies like these would be permitted under this bill. As a result, we could foresee a situation where the EPA would be prevented from using the best available science and disseminating public information in a timely fashion. In addition, H.R. 1430 would give the EPA administrator sole authority to disclose private information gathered in research studies, which might include confidential health and proprietary business information, to anyone who signs a confidentiality agreement with the EPA. It is unclear whether the EPA has this authority, and very clear this would deter individuals and businesses from participating in studies used by the EPA. This would again constrain the EPA from making a proposal based on the best available science. We thank you for your consideration and stand ready to work with you to evaluate the unintended consequences of this bill before consideration on the House floor.

Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for the many reasons I have spoken about today, I strongly oppose this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I would like to alleviate the ranking member’s unfounded concerns and remind her that the National Academy of Sciences itself has explained that transparency in science is possible without any risk to confidentiality or privacy. This is what the National Academy of Sciences said: ‘‘Nothing in the past suggests that increasing access to research data without damage to privacy and confidentiality rights is beyond scientific reach.’’ So I hope that will alleviate her concerns. Really, it comes down to whether you are for an open and honest government or not. That is what this bill is all about. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN), who is the chairman of the Space Subcommittee of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. b1400 Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the HONEST Act. As a cosponsor of this legislation and a member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I am very pleased to see this bill come to the House floor. I represent the congressional district with the highest concentration of petrochemical, manufacturing, and refining facilities than any other district in the entire Nation. This means that thousands of my constituents have been or are currently employed by these industries. In fact, years ago, I spent some time as a worker in one of these very factories. With this in mind, you can understand why pushing for reform, transparency, and accountability within the EPA would be very important to me because so many of my constituents’ livelihoods are affected by costly and burdensome regulations from the EPA. My constituents want to make sure that the EPA’s actions, particularly those based on secret science, do not cost them their jobs or their livelihood. Time and again, the EPA has issued extensive regulations without ever showing the science to back up their claims to justify these regulations. It is like they have a little black box over there. They don’t let anyone else look into it, and they just say: Trust us, we have got good science backing up our claims. I say, if your science is so good, then don’t hide it in your little black box. Show us your data. The HONEST Act simply requires the EPA to open their little black box to public scrutiny. After we pass the HONEST Act, any regulations coming from the EPA must be based on data that is publicly available. What is so offensive about a little transparency? Most companies and businesses would be happy to comply with the EPA when data shows that their regulations are backed up by clear evidence. But many times, if not most of the time, this is not the case. Instead the regulations are based on secret science that no one but the regulators themselves have access to. When the Federal Government issues regulations based on secret science, this is yet another example of a Federal agency getting away with something the rest of America cannot do. 
American workers are fed up with overzealous regulators pushing our jobs overseas. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about protecting American jobs and the American economy. In math class, we were taught to show our work; and when we didn’t, we got the problem counted wrong. This bill is about transparency, accountability, and holding the government to the same standard that everyone else is. According to a poll by the Institute for Energy Research, 90 percent of Americans believe that scientific data used to make government decisions should be available to the public, to the rest of us. That is nearly 100 percent. Not many issues in our current political environment enjoy that level of support. But when it does, Congress should very well listen. The HONEST Act is a commonsense legislation that I am proud to support. I include in the RECORD this letter of support from the American Chemistry Council. 
AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL , Washington, DC, March 28, 2017. Hon. LAMAR SMITH, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SMITH: On behalf of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), we want to thank you for introducing H.R. 1430, the ‘‘Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017’’ (or the HONEST Act) to help improve the science employed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Agency’s regulatory decision making processes. The proposed legislation would increase the transparency and public confidence in the EPA’s scientific analyses. Consistency and transparency are key to the regulatory certainty our industry needs to grow and create jobs. In some instances, EPA has fallen short of employing the highestquality, bestavailable science in their regulatory decision making. It is critical that the regulated community and the public have confidence that decisions reached by EPA are grounded in transparent and reproducible science, while ensuring the protection of confidential business information and competitive intelligence. By ensuring that the EPA utilizes high quality science and shares underlying data used to reach decisions, the HONEST Act can help foster a regulatory environment that will allow the U.S. business of chemistry to continue to develop safe, innovative products that Americans depend on in their everyday lives. We commend you for your leadership and commitment to advance and improve EPA science. We look forward to working with you and other bill sponsors to pass this important piece of legislation. Sincerely, CALDOOLEY . 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the tireless work that Chairman LAMAR SMITH has done to bring this legislation forward so that we can bring accountability and transparency to the EPA. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ). Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1430, which makes it harder for the Environmental Protection Agency to do its job. This bill would bring the EPA’s work to a halt, undermining protection of America’s health and safety. This legislation interferes with the use of sound science and creates obstacles that stop the EPA from enforcing the law. This bill is just one part of President Trump and congressional Republicans’ attacks on science and our environment. Shortly after the inauguration, the Trump administration removed taxpayerfunded scientific data from public websites. Now, that is not open, that is not honest, and that is not fair to the taxpayers. This month, President Trump proposed dramatic budget cuts that would make it impossible for the EPA to enforce clean air and clean water laws. Yesterday, President Trump rescinded the Clean Power Plan, paving the way for more air pollution. We cannot go backwards. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and other Republican efforts to weaken the environmental protections. We must put public health and scientific integrity before polluters’ profits. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS ), who is the vice chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology’s Subcommittee on Environment. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SMITH for sponsoring this legislation, the HONEST Act. I believe that this bill will take a very important step toward improving the quality of science at the EPA. This is incredibly important because this agency ensures that our air and water are clean, which is something that all Americans want and deserve. However, in recent years, the EPA has not been as transparent and forthcoming with the scientific data that the agency has used as the basis for costly regulations. That is exactly where the HONEST Act comes in. By requiring the agency to base its regulations on publicly available science, scientists and the American people will be able to examine the data and pursue their own scientific inquiry if they wish, improving the scientific integrity of the EPA. Transparency throughout all levels of the Federal Government is an important tenet of American democracy. I strongly support all efforts to provide the American people with more information on how our government works. This is most important when regulations that impact American jobs and the economy are involved. Critics of the HONEST Act claim that requiring scientific data to be public would compromise personal information. This is a false narrative. This legislation specifically protects that information by way of redactions. It is not the interest of Congress or the EPA to compromise anyone’s personal data. Passage of the HONEST Act comes at a critical time for the EPA. Executive orders issued by President Trump require that the agency review and potentially revise a number of regulations from the past administration that were only partly based on science and that were never made public to the American people. We want to avoid similar situations moving forward, regardless of the administration. I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation to promote a more honest and open EPA. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ), the vice ranking member of the full committee and ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology’s Subcommittee on Oversight. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I have several objections to the legislation being considered today. As with the Secret Science Reform Act, the bill would seriously undercut the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to use science to inform their work. The bill would prohibit the EPA from using any scientific findings when the EPA did not have total access to the underlying data. This would eliminate some of the best available science from being considered by the EPA. Let me be very clear, there is nothing secret nor dishonest about relying on voluminous, peerreviewed studies published in the most credible scientific journals in the world to make public health decisions. Equally problematic, the bill would force the EPA to grant full access to any scientific data it does possess, including highly sensitive materials like trade secrets and personal health histories. Much has been made about the ability of the EPA to redact this information, but there is a piece of legislation that says: By simply signing a nondisclosure agreement at the discretion of the EPA administrator, you can have access to all of the nonredacted information. We talk about the accountability of the EPA. What is the accountability of violating a simple nondisclosure agreement? It becomes so easy for these private health information trade secrets to be sold for a small fortune on the black market. It certainly doesn’t make sense to provide such an easy avenue to potential bad actors. I would also like to object to the title of the legislation and the implication that EPA employees and scientists are somehow not honest. Many of those folks live in Virginia, and, frankly, I am tired of Members of Congress bad mouthing my constituents. These are 
hardworking public servants who have dedicated their lives to clean air, clean water, and to our good health. And I want to reassure the many wonderful employees of the EPA that, in Congress, we do, in fact, appreciate your good work on behalf of the American people. Lastly, much like the TrumpCare bill we almost considered last week, there is no CBO cost estimate. The chairman mentions that he has asked the CBO to use a different methodology. The last one they said was going to cost us hundreds of millions of dollars to implement. It is hard to imagine anything where the EPA has been required to fund or acquire data that is not going to be unreasonably expensive relative to anything before. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I don’t see how we can make it more clear to anybody who brings up the privacy arguments. If they go to lines 17 through 21 of page 2 of the bill, it states: ‘‘ . . . any personally identifiable information, trade secrets, or commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential, shall be redacted prior to public availability.’’ Any misconstruing of that is unfortunate, and it is not an accurate description of that provision. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD), who is also the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology’s Subcommittee on Oversight. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman LAMAR SMITH for yielding time and for his leadership on this important issue. Mr. Speaker, my district in central and west central Illinois is home to some of the most fertile farmland in the entire world. My district is the ninth largest congressional district in terms of corn and soybean production. With that said, farming families across the 19 counties I represent are faced every day with burdensome rules and regulations created by the EPA with little or no transparency into the data that influenced those regulations in the first place. These rules and regulations have and continue to cause realworld consequences to the agriculture community. Moreover, these EPA directives have far greater reach outside the realm of just farmers. Manufacturing and trade industries in my district have also seen a direct negative impact from these agency actions. They have continued to hurt the ability of these industries to create jobs and economic opportunities in central and west central Illinois. As such, I am here today in support of the HONEST Act, which encourages a more open and transparent Federal Government. It requires data and studies used by Federal agencies in the rulemaking process to be made publicly available to the American people and independent scientists. The goal is to promote more accountability for Washington, D.C., bureaucracies, such as the EPA. The bottom line is costly Federal regulations should only be based upon data that is comprised of sound science and that can withstand scrutiny and review. Simply put, the HONEST Act is a step in the right direction to restore trust in the EPA and in Federal bureaucracies. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY). Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the socalled HONEST Act. Whether in its incarnation last Congress as the Secret Science Act or in this year’s incarnation as the HONEST Act, let us be clear, this Orwelliannamed bill is clearly designed to suppress certain scientific research that has been the foundation for essential health and environmental regulations. In addition to hindering scientific advancement, this bill risks violating people’s privacy by exposing sensitive patient data, and it is harmful to public health. The clear aim of the HONEST Act is to undermine EPA’s efforts to take action in a variety of areas, such as climate and air pollution. Let me also be clear, in my State of Connecticut, we rely on those regulations to deal with the asthma crisis we have based on power plants in other parts of the country blowing polluted air into my State. The socalled HONEST Act accomplishes this objective by excluding legitimate, peerreviewed research from the policy process. If this bill were to become law, EPA would have no choice but to lean increasingly on industry funded studies instead. At my recent townhall meeting in Waterbury, Connecticut, one American after another stood up and expressed their fear and outrage at the attempts made in this House and by the new administration to take science out of public policy. My constituents want genuine scientific research guiding our efforts to protect our environment and safeguard public health. They don’t want agenda driven studies funded by fossil fuel companies determining the EPA’s actions on climate policy. b1415 While the majority attempted to alleviate some of our privacy concerns with this bill, the reality is that any person whom EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt deems worthy will have access to sensitive patient information. Why is this a problem? Because fewer people will be willing to participate in the studies that are necessary to understand air and water quality issues. Who can blame them? No one wants their medical records shared with strangers, or worse, made public. The result is that the EPA will have to rely on incomplete science to issue lifesaving regulations. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, this bill is yet another example of the political crusade against science that we are seeing coming from both Congress and the new administration. We should be confronting the economic and environmental realities of our changing climate. But just yesterday, President Trump issued an executive order that would have us pretend that climate change does not exist. Only weeks earlier, the EPA Administrator himself said, without evidence, that he disagreed with the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary contributor to global climate change. In my home State of Connecticut, we are downwind from these power plants that are burning dirty coal. We see elevated rates of asthma, higher rates of cardiopulmonary issues. If this bill is passed, many longitudinal, scientific studies like the ones that establish the link between air pollution and asthma, would be excluded from playing a role in the EPA’s actions. Mr. Speaker, let’s allow the EPA to do its job. I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  two letters in opposition from the Union of Concerned Scientists and from the Environmental Defense Fund. 
UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS , March 9, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : The Union of Concerned Scientists, with 500,000 members and supporters throughout the country, strongly opposes H.R. 1430, the misleadingly named Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act (HONEST Act) of 2017. The proposal shows that supporters of this legislation have a fundamental misunderstanding of the process by which science operates and is ultimately a solution in search of a problem. This legislation would require that all raw data, models, code, and other materials from scientific studies be made available to the public before a federal agency could use it. But, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) already is exhaustingly transparent and the science it relies on to make decisions is made available to the public. The true intention of this bill is not to increase transparency in agency use of science in policymaking, but rather to handcuff the EPA from ever using critical information necessary to follow through on statutorily required rulemaking for popular legislation like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. The additional restrictions imposed by this proposed bill would make it almost impossible to base public protections on the best available scientific information. In particular, if enacted, the language appears to indicate that the EPA would be inhibited by the following challenges: The EPA wouldn’t be able to use most health studies. It should be expected that any agency tasked with protecting public health should be able to use public health data. The confidentiality of such data is usually protected by institutional review boards 
(IRB) to insure the privacy of the participants; thus, the data could not be made publicly available as demanded. Since many EPA rules are healthbased standards, this rule would severely restrict the ability of the agency to base rules on science. The EPA wouldn’t be able to draw from industry data sources. The agency would be prevented from using data provided by industry to the agency. Since information from industry sources is often not publicly available, to protect proprietary data from their competitors, a law requiring as such would prevent the agency from utilizing industry data, a source of information that often provides otherwise unknown data to inform EPA rulemaking. The EPA wouldn’t be able to use new and innovative science. New scientific methods and data may be restricted by intellectual property protections or industry trade secret exemptions. This bill doesn’t include protections for intellectual property, and it makes industry trade secrets available upon request to anyone who signs an agreement. If researchers and industry knew that sharing their science with the EPA meant that their intellectual property would be exposed to the world, they might opt out. This would limit EPA’s ability to rely on the best available science including novel approaches that may not yet be publicly available. Longterm and metaanalyses would be unavailable. Many of the public health and safety issues facing the nation cannot be measured within a small timeframe. The EPA needs longterm exposure studies that assess the link between chronic diseases/ mortality and pollutants; or on metaanalyses that include many different studies and locations to provide a more robust look at the science. In H.R. 1430, the provision that studies be conducted ‘‘in a manner that is sufficient for independent analysis and substantial reproduction of research’’ may prevent use of these vital studies by the EPA, as it is unclear whether such spatially and temporally comprehensive studies would be considered ‘‘sufficient for substantial reproduction.’’ The CBO estimates exorbitant costs. The attempt to implement this law would also make the EPA process much more costly. For past iterations of this legislation, the CBO has estimated it may take up to $250 million annually for the EPA simply to comply, and that doesn’t even account for the lost benefits from delaying the protections themselves. Compounded with the cuts to EPA’s budget that are being proposed, this would just further prevent the agency from being able to do its job. H.R. 1430 makes a token attempt to address some of the criticisms about privacy concerns for personal medical information and trade secrets. But in practice, the challenge of identifying and redacting all protected and privileged information sets up a series of hurdles and complications that will deter agencies from using the best scientific analysis to inform their work. Small, cosmetic tweaks do not change the fact that this bill is based on a flawed premise and that the authors of the legislation do not understand the scientific process. Furthermore, the burden imposed on the EPA to redact documents would ultimately place limits on the amount of actual scientific work the EPA can do. The EPA does not exist in a world of infinite resources. When this bill was introduced in the 114th Congress as the ‘‘Secret Science Reform Act,’’ it received a veto threat from the Obama administration, which noted that it would ‘‘interfere’’ with the EPA’s ability to protect public health, safety, and the environment. The worry is that now, with an administration that has shown zero interest in using science to enact safeguards, this legislation could cripple the agency. I strongly urge you to oppose H R. 1430, the socalled HONEST Act. The only honest thing about this legislation is that it truly opens the window into the real intentions of the supporters of the bill, and that is to stop the EPA from fulfilling its sciencebased mission to protect public health and the environment. H.R. 1430 is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, purporting to increase public accessibility to data used in rulemaking, while actually crippling the EPA’s ability to use the best available scientific and technical information to protect public health and the environment. Agencies protecting our public health should be able to use public health data and attempts to undermine agencies shouldn’t be cloaked in false transparency. This Trojan horse transparency bill would inhibit the EPA’s ability to carry out its sciencebased mission to protect human health and the environment. It does not deserve your support. Sincerely, ANDREW A. R OSENBERG , PH.D., Director, Center for Science and Democracy, Union of Concerned Scientists. 
EDF A CTION , March 8, 2017. Hon. LAMAR SMITH, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. Hon. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , Ranking Member, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN SMITH AND RANKING MEMBER JOHNSON : The Environmental Defense Action Fund strongly opposes the ‘‘Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017’’ and the ‘‘EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017’’. Despite their benignsounding titles, these bills would have devastating effects on public health and the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ability to consider and use sound science. The HONEST Act, a rebranded version of the ‘‘Secret Science Reform Act’’ from prior sessions of Congress, is framed as a measure to increase transparency by requiring that EPA only use studies that are publicly available online and replicable. Yet, as testimony before your Committee has made clear, these requirements would in many cases prevent the EPA from using the best available science for public health decisionmaking. Many epidemiological studies—for example a study on the causes of breast cancer—rely on health data that are legally confidential. This legislation suggests that EPA will be given the authority to disclose confidential medical information on breast cancer patients to anyone willing to sign a confidentiality agreement. EPA would also be responsible for identifying and redacting any information that should not be made broadly publicly available in the first place. Not only is this not an appropriate role for EPA, it could severely restrict both the number of studies EPA can use and the willingness of participants to be part of vital health studies. In addition, the Act’s requirements for replicability mean that critical longitudinal studies that follow health outcomes of individuals or groups over years, even decades, could not be used because— (1) they are inherently not replicable (e.g., a study that follows health outcomes of first responders following a single event such as the tragic 9/11 attack); or (2) where they are replicable, it would take years to show that the results could be reproduced (e.g., a study that examines the impacts on intelligence at childhood from environmental exposures that occurred in utero). Furthermore, even if, say, a longitudinal study that follows a cohort of individuals over 20 years could in principle be reproduced, there are practical and ethical reasons why it couldn’t or shouldn’t be. The same goes for a longterm environmental monitoring study, or data collected from a onetime event like the Deepwater Horizon Spill. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has found that previous iterations of this legislation would impede the number of studies the EPA can rely on—by their estimate, reducing the number of studies by half. Restricting EPA to just some of the existing scientific literature will prevent the agency from using the latest and most accurate science when developing regulations. Moreover, the tremendous resource burden of making data publicly available (CBO’s central estimate was $250 million a year) would create a strong incentive to reduce the amount of scientific data and analysis considered as part of decisionmaking. The net effect would be to undermine EPA’s ability to rely on the best available science and unnecessarily put the public at greater environmental and health risk. Similarly, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 undermines scientific integrity of the EPA. Contrary to longstanding practice, the bill allows individuals with financial conflicts of interest to serve on the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) so long as those conflicts are disclosed. This would permit an infusion of special corporate interest into what should remain an objective scientific review of EPA work products. Incredibly, at the same time, the bill makes it more difficult for academic experts to participate on the SAB. The bill considers an expert’s research on a topic covered by the Board to be a conflict of interest, when in fact the academic’s expertise would make them more, not less, valuable. In addition, receipt of EPA research grants and contracts, standard for universities, would be construed to constitute a conflict of interest for a scientist or expert. And a SAB member would be precluded from accepting any such grant or contract for three years after serving on the board which may deter qualified experts from serving on the SAB. The ‘‘Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017’’ and the ‘‘EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017’’ would block the use of sound science by EPA in developing public safeguards. For these reasons, EDF Action strongly opposes these bills. Sincerely, ELIZABETH B. T HOMPSON , President, Environmental Defense Action Fund. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to keep up with all the misstatements about this bill, but I am going to try. The immediate past speaker on the other side talked about the cost of the bill; and I am sure he didn’t do it intentionally, but he was using a 2yearoutofdate cost. We have an email from the CBO as of this past Monday that says the CBO estimates this legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues, so there is no cost, despite what Members might hear otherwise. Also, it is just hard for me to understand how any Member of Congress 
could oppose open and honest government. All this bill does is to say that the data has to be transparent, the data has to be publicly available. If they want more government control, more environmental regulations that can’t be justified, that is one thing; but don’t oppose the bill for the wrong reasons. The bill does nothing more than require open, transparent, and honest government. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ), who is a member of the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1430, the HONEST Act, sponsored by the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Chairman LAMAR SMITH. Let’s all go back to the fifth grade, where we learned about the steps of the scientific method and do a quick review. After we formulated our question and came up with our hypothesis, what did we do? We tested that hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting the data in a reproducible manner. Data isn’t reproducible if it isn’t even made available. Now, Mr. Speaker, transparency and reproducibility are basic tenets of science that every elementary school student learns and values. Yet our very own Environmental Protection Agency has issued regulation after regulation using studies and data that are not available for public review, despite the very serious ramifications of that very data. In 2012, President Obama’s own chair of the Science Advisory Board testified ‘‘that literature and data used by the EPA be peerreviewed and made available to the public.’’ This is common sense, Mr. Speaker: let’s make public policy using public data and use public data for public policy. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for leading this initiative. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ). Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1430, the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act. I have serious concerns with this bill that the majority has offered. This bill pretends to improve scientific integrity and transparency while, in reality, they would stop the EPA from doing its critical job, its critical mission of protecting the American people. Many credible organizations have opposed the HONEST Act, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Union of Concerned Scientists, American Institute of Biological Sciences, American Lung Association, American Public Health Association, the League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Environmental Defense Action Fund. Two others that I include in the RECORD , the copies that I hold in my hand, in opposition, have been received from the Consortium for Ocean Leadership, and the other from the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. 
CONSORTIUM FOR  OCEAN LEADERSHIP , Washington, DC, March 27, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: On behalf of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership, which represents our nation’s leading ocean research and technology institutions (from academia, industry, and aquaria), I am writing to express concern regarding the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017 (H.R. 1430). Sound science must underpin the rulemaking process at all our nation’s federal agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency included. I am concerned about the practical implications of this bill and what it means, not only for the rulemaking process, but for the health, security, and prosperity of our nation and its citizens. While I ardently support efforts to ensure the continued use of sound science, I urge you and your colleagues to consider unintended consequences of this bill before bringing it to the House floor. While reproducibility is a fundamental assumption of science, that should not be conflated with the idea that all nonreproducible science is incorrect. There are many cases where reproducibility is simply not possible, but that does not negate the importance of the conclusions that have been reached. In 1994, the comet ShoemakerLevy collided with our celestial neighbor Jupiter, providing a firsthand look at cosmic collisions and insight on both the comet and the planet. The devastating Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has provided untold insights into everything ranging from ecosystem responses to oil to impacts on communities’ physical and mental health. Because studies stemming from these one time incidents are not reproducible, it does not mean that their methodology and results are flawed. Additionally, longitudinal studies, especially in the public health arena, are often too large and take so much time (e.g., a study following a cohort for multiple decades) that they could not realistically be reproduced but are instead replicated through statistical modeling. Under the current language of the HONEST Act, similar studies within EPA’s purview would be excluded from the agency’s use, potentially keeping the agency from making a proposal or disseminating information and limiting the amount of good science from which the EPA can makes decisions. The bill also requires scientific and technical information used to make federal regulations be posted online. While the language specifies that personally identifiable information used in these studies be redacted (unlike in the bill’s predecessor, the Secret Science Reform Act), the HONEST Act goes on to state that personal information could be disclosed to anyone who signs a confidentiality agreement with the administrator. If federal regulations are made that impact a specific industry, the same industry could access the personal records of those who participated in the study. Knowing that their personal information could be made accessible to anyone would likely reduce the number of willing participants in such a study, again limiting the best science available to the agency. Additionally, redacting information from documents is a costly and timeconsuming process that often requires the work of an entire office. The EPA’s limited resources, rather than being spent fulfilling its mission ‘‘to protect human health and the environment’’ would instead be spent redacting, potentially hundreds of thousands of documents. Conversely, the bill does not define who would make this information publicly available online (and make appropriate redactions) if the EPA were relying on a published, peerreviewed study performed by another entity, such as an academic research institution. This would potentially impose unexpected costs on the institution. Rather than improving the quality of science used by the agency, this bill would instead limit the amount of ‘‘best available science’’ available for decisionmaking and would require significant time and manpower. Such an impact would threaten the health, not only of our nation, but of our country’s citizens who rely on the EPA to protect their wellbeing. The unintended consequences from this bill are myriad, and the ocean science and technology community stands ready to help you evaluate them before considering this legislation on the House floor. Respectfully, JONATHAN W. W HITE, RADM (Ret.), USN, President and CEO, Consortium for Ocean Leadership. 
ENVIRONMENTAL DATA & GOVERNANCE INITIATIVE , March 27, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : The Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) has analyzed the potential effects of the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 (H.R. 1430) and determined that the bill would obstruct the EPA’s use of scientific studies in essential agency work. EDGI is an organization comprised of non profit employees and academics that promotes open and accessible government data and information along with evidencebased policy making. As researchers invested in robust environmental data governance, EDGI members are concerned that this legislation would force the EPA to make determinations without certain categories of crucial evidencebased research it needs to make the best decisions for the health and welfare of the public and the environment. H.R. 1430 is just the latest iteration of the proposed Secret Science Reform Acts of 2014 and 2015. These bills would have prevented the EPA from relying on a large number of validated and pivotal scientific studies in its decisionmaking processes. Similarly, in its words, H.R. 1430 would ‘‘prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from proposing, finalizing, or disseminating regulations or assessments based upon science that is not transparent or reproducible.’’ Proponents claim that H.R. 1430 would improve transparency in scientific decisionmaking and public data accessibility, efforts that EDGI supports. However, as EDGI’s analysis shows, H.R. 1430 instead places important validated science off limits to the EPA. The data access requirements in H.R. 1430 would obstruct public protections critical to human safety and health. Any studies that utilize confidential medical records—including many human health studies—would be nearly impossible for the EPA to use because personally identifiable medical data cannot be released to the general public. For instance, the EPA would not be able to use epidemiological studies that are critical for linking exposure to toxics with certain types of diseases in the creation of standards that ensure our safe drinking water and healthy air. 
Additionally, the proposed legislation would bar studies that cannot be reproduced from use by the EPA. Blocking the EPA from using studies that are hard to reproduce impedes the EPA’s ability to protect the public from future health hazards. Some of the nation’s best evidence of public health risks comes from longterm analyses, assessments of chronic effects of exposure to toxic substances, studies based on natural and humancaused catastrophes, and other studies that we cannot reproduce. Specific examples of current protections and programs that would have been difficult, if not impossible, for the EPA to issue had H.R. 1430 been in place include: Standards that protect children from lead based paint hazards in their homes and schools. The EPA creates standards that protect children from the adverse neurological effects of exposure to lead in paint, dust, and soil. The agency bases these lead protections on longterm studies of children who have suffered lead exposure in the past. Because EPA regulations have effectively reduced lead exposure in children, reproducing these longterm epidemiological studies would be nearly impossible, as the cohort of study subjects no longer exists. Prohibiting the EPA from using historical reports like these would make continuing regulation of lead much harder. Safeguards that protect people from exposure to radioactive contaminants in drinking water. The EPA’s standards for the permissible quantity of certain radionuclides, such as uranium, found in drinking water are based on data from radiation exposure studies that use confidential patient information from a cohort of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors, which could not be used under this bill. Longterm epidemiological studies conducted on this cohort are also unreproducible, rendering these studies, and others like them, nearly impossible for the EPA to use under H.R. 1430’s provisions. Measures that improve safety at industrial facilities and protect and assist first responders and emergency authorities during accidents. The EPA improved its risk management regulations following several catastrophic events involving chemical plants, including an explosion at the West Fertilizer Company facility in Texas that killed 14 people, ten of them first responders. The studies that result from chemical explosions like these cannot be reproduced and would not be available for the EPA’s use under H.R. 1430, preventing the agency from properly protecting first responders and the public from future chemical disasters. Plans that ensure best practices in cleaning up major oil spills and other hazardous waste spills that affect wildlife health and habitats. After the Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran aground in Alaska’s Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, the EPA developed a restoration program to clean up the 11 million gallons of oil that had spilled into the Sound and affected over 1,000 miles of shoreline. This cleanup program would have been impossible without field studies of Prince William Sound and other historical oil spills. Given the large scale of these catastrophic spills, these studies cannot be reproduced and thus would be barred from use by the EPA by H.R. 1430. The EPA would be hampered from implementing these vital protections and programs under H.R. 1430. While the bill contains a provision that pretends to skirt some of these legal obstacles by only divulging protected materials to people who sign confidentiality agreements, this provision is illusory because medical data, trade secrets, and other privacyprotected data cannot be released to the general public, regardless of whether they sign a confidentiality agreement. The EPA cannot issue confidentiality agreements on behalf of third party researchers, so H.R. 1430 would inhibit the EPA’s ability to use many important scientific studies despite this confidentiality agreement provision. Further, H.R. 1430 limits the EPA to spending only $1 million a year to comply with these new requirements, yet the CBO estimated that past versions of this legislation would have cost the EPA up to $250 million annually to implement the data access provisions required in the bill. The added obligations specified in this legislation, coupled with a lack of adequate funding to implement the law, would prevent the EPA from fulfilling its hazard prevention and environmental safety protection responsibilities. Agencies tasked with protecting human health must be able to rely on all available scientific data. Currently, the EPA goes to great lengths to ensure that all of the data it relies on is thoroughly reviewed and accessible. The EPA uses several processes to ensure quality and relevance of data, such as internal and external peer review and review by scientific advisory boards. When the EPA is prohibited from utilizing the most optimal data, it puts the health and safety of citizens at risk. Protecting safe drinking water and healthy air depends on the EPA’s ability to incorporate the best available evidence from all scientific fields of study into its risk assessments and regulation drafting processes. EDGI’s analysis and research shows that the passage of H.R. 1430 would block the EPA from using the data it needs to fulfill its mission of protecting public health and the environment.

Mr. TONKO. The Union of Concerned Scientists has recently said that ‘‘the bill effectively prevents the EPA from using the weight of scientific evidence to protect public health and the environment.’’ They go on to say ‘‘this doesn’t make sense.’’ I agree. This doesn’t make any sense. Instead, I hope that, as a Congress, we can turn our attention to truly protecting scientific integrity. We must protect the scientific process from political interference, which is why I recently introduced the Scientific Integrity Act, which will require our United States Federal agencies to adopt or strengthen policies to insulate governmentdirected research from the influence of political pressure and special interests. Under the Scientific Integrity Act, Federal agencies that conduct or fund scientific research would be required to develop clear, written scientific integrity policies that can guarantee research is being done and published without undue influence, censorship, or distortion. Scientific and technological information would be able to flow more easily while protecting privacy, confidentiality, and our national security. Twentyfour separate Federal agencies have developed scientific integrity policies to date. This legislation would also codify and strengthen these policies within a common framework. Every Democrat on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has supported the Scientific Integrity Act, and I invite all of my colleagues across the aisle to join us in working to truly protect scientific integrity. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the socalled HONEST Act. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a couple of times today that the bill prevents the EPA from using the best available science. I hope that Members who are listening to this debate, and others, will take the time to actually look at the language of the bill. Here is the exact language, page 2, line 13. The first requirement of the bill is that the EPA ‘‘use the best available science.’’ I don’t know what more we can do and how better we can spell it out. The bill is only a little over three pages long. I really do recommend that the folks who oppose it read the bill itself and actually look at the language and the usual understanding and definition of the words, and I hope they will be satisfied. We have also heard that the scientific community opposes the bill, but let me quote from a couple of Obama administration officials. Dr. John Holdren, the President’s science adviser, said that: ‘‘Absolutely, the data on which regulatory decisions are based should be made available to the committee and should be made public.’’ The same was said by the chair of the EPA’s Science Advisory Board. This is the EPA’s Science Advisory Board. They testified before the committee that literature and data used by the EPA be made available to the public. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ), who is the vice chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, to 
voice my support of the HONEST Act. This legislation gives independent scientists a fair chance to validate the studies EPA uses to make regulations. As someone who has made a career in science, I know that determining anything less is unwise and unscientific. Whether you are studying a new oncology drug or EPA regulations, transparency and the ability to reproduce and share these findings are some of the basic tenets of science. Costly regulations that impact American citizens and Kansas farmers should be based upon data that is available to independent scientists and the public. Let’s continue to be a voice for the people with sound, transparent, scientific regulatory policy. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER ). Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and my friend, the chairman of the committee. We often agree on things in the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, but there are times when our disagreements are huge, and this is one of those times. So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 1430. We have seen this bill in the last Congress, when it was called the Secret Science Reform Act. It was a lousy bill then, and it is still a lousy bill today. Let’s start with the name of this bill, Mr. Speaker, the HONEST Act, but it really should be called the dishonest act. That is because this bill improperly describes what is going on at the EPA, which is looking to protect our environment from extreme weather events that we have in Colorado, throughout the country, and around the world. The EPA is working to protect our clean air and our clean water, and has demonstrably improved our communities and the health of America since 1970. I wish I could say these attacks today and tomorrow on the EPA and scientific research are isolated, but unfortunately they are not. Earlier today, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a hearing on climate science. I was astonished at what I heard from the majority Republican Party calling into question whether climate change is happening, and whether it is caused by humans. All this serves is to attack scientific research and jeopardize the progress we have made to combat climate change and protect our communities. Just yesterday, President Trump issued an executive order to further roll back progress that we have made over the last 8 years. The executive order tries to dismantle the Clean Power Plan and many other important protections from the Obama administration which were worked on based on the best available science and through an open and deliberate process, gathering millions of comments along the way. The fact is, investing in clean energy and reducing emissions is good for our national security, good for our environment, and good for jobs. I believe we can do both—improve our energy independence and create goodpaying jobs—at the same time. Colorado has been a leader in reducing harmful emissions, improving energy efficiency, and investing in clean energy, and we have realized substantial economic benefits for Colorado through innovation, research and development, and the creation of goodpaying jobs. Mr. Speaker, we need to do better. This House and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee need to take their heads out of the sand and stop ignoring what is going on across the country and across the world. I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the R ECORD  a letter dated March 8, 2017, from the American Geophysical Union. 
AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION, March 8, 2017. Hon. LAMAR SMITH, Washington, DC. Hon. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN SMITH AND RANKING MEMBER JOHNSON : On behalf of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and its more than 60,000 members, I am writing to express concerns about the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 (HONEST Act) and the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017. We encourage you and your colleagues to take additional time to evaluate the unintended consequences of these bills before the bills move forward. Although we appreciate the HONEST Act’s protections for confidential information, we remain concerned about several provisions in the bill. For example, requirements in the bill for the use of ‘‘best available science,’’ ‘‘data,’’ and ‘‘reproducible’’ do not have uniform applications across all disciplines. With respect to reproducibility of research, some scientific research involves longitudinal studies that are so large and of great duration that they could not realistically be reproduced. The same may be true for scientific data from a onetime event (e.g., Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill) where the data is gathered in real time. We’re concerned that in these situations the EPA could be constrained from using important or relevant research in making decisions. The legislation could also impose costs on recipients of federal research grants where the research results are expected to be ‘‘relied on to support a covered action.’’ The bill is not clear on whether it is the EPA’s or the research institution’s responsibility to cover the costs associated with sharing and archiving this information. We are also troubled by the implications of the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act. As an organization that represents scientists from broad backgrounds and expertise, we appreciate the attempt to ensure a diverse panel of scientific knowledge and perspectives, and support the bill’s goal of increasing accountability and transparency for scientific advisors. However, because the bill would exclude some scientists with substantial expertise in their fields from the Science Advisory Board (SAB), the SAB would suffer from the exclusion of valuable insight. The purpose of the SAB is to review the quality and robustness of scientific data that informs EPA’s regulatory process. It is imperative that the SAB comprise the most expert, independent scientists and technical advisors to best fulfill that mission. AGU looks forward to working with you on these critical issues in the future. With best wishes, LEXISHULTZ , Director of Public Affairs, American Geophysical Union. 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman from Colorado attended the hearing we had this morning on the scientific method and climate change, but I am not sure he was listening, because not a single witness on either side denied the facts around climate change. I also want to reassure him—he is worried about Colorado, and I understand that—that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that there was low confidence in any connection between climate change and extreme weather events. So I hope there will not be any unusual extreme weather events in Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ), a member of the Natural Resources Committee and the Agriculture Committee. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SMITH for yielding time here today, as these issues affect my constituents in northern California as well. So being here to support H.R. 1430, the HONEST Act, really pleases me because we haven’t had a lot of honesty the way the EPA has applied new interpretations of new rules to some of the folks in my district here, that farm and ranch and other activities that use their resources and their land in the way they see fit. We need to ensure that the EPA rules and regulations are made using verifiable, publicly available data and science. b1430 A fundamental tenet of our Nation is that citizens have the right to know how and why the government makes decisions and, just as importantly, have the ability to challenge those decisions. However, we have seen an increasing tendency of Federal agencies to refuse to disclose the data they have based decisions on, claiming it is too sensitive to share. Really, now. For example, the Obama administration’s waters of the U.S. rule, which would have inserted the Federal Government into local land use decisions across the Nation, directly conflicts with publicly available data prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers, yet the EPA refused to release data it claimed supported its conclusion. Farmers, in some cases, cannot even use their land under the threat of litigation, fines, or even arrest. Even the Army Corps of Engineers disputes the EPA’s refusal, noting, in 2015, that EPA provided no scientific basis for its jurisdictional power grab. Under waters of the United States, we have heard interpretations that 
people plowing their fields could be interpreted now as a regulatable land because that could be seen as a watershed because you now have furrows that are new watersheds. This is the kind of thing that needs to be heard publicly in review of Congress and the people, not made in a back room of the EPA somewhere. That is not an honest way of doing business. That is why H.R. 1430 is an honest way to bring them back to the accountability we need to have so people can have their day and have a right to dispute nonscienceled decisions made by the EPA. The Obama Administration did not even rely on peerreviewed science or on publicly available Scientific Advisory Board determinations despite EPA claims that its effort was backed by science. The tendency for Federal agencies to develop regulations based on secret data is even more insidious when we note that these are not even elected officials. They don’t have to stand for election. These are career bureaucrats who cannot be removed or even sometimes met up with by the voters, by their constituents. Mr. Speaker, when Americans face regulations imposed by unelected bureaucrats and based on secret science that cannot be verified or even viewed, how can they employ their First Amendment right to petition their government? The answer, colleagues, is simple. They can’t. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill to protect every American’s right to know how and why their government makes decisions, to protect their First Amendment rights, to protect their property, and their ability to thrive. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time, and I thank you for bringing this effort and for your battle. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), who is the chairman of the Environment Subcommittee. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and especially for sponsoring this legislation, the HONEST Act. As the chairman of the Environment Subcommittee on the Science Committee, I fully support this bill that will require EPA regulations be based on science that is publicly available. The HONEST Act pushes forward the basic principles of the scientific method, which is critically important in instances in which science and Federal Government policy intersect. Regulations put forward by the EPA impact all Americans, including my constituents in the East Valley of the Greater Phoenix area, the four cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek, and Mesa. So it is imperative that the citizens of this country be able to see the data that underpin these rules. What is even more important is that the scientific community be able to scrutinize EPA data to ensure that the Agency is using the best available science, regardless of the administration. Critics of the HONEST Act claim that scientific data underpinning EPA’s regulations are already subject to the standards of peer review. While this may be true, peer review of scientific studies is not adequate because this process seldom involves a close scrutiny of the data used in these studies. Peer review rarely doublechecks the analysis, and very rarely does it attempt to actually replicate the results of a study. Right now, we can only hope that the individuals conducting the science can be trusted with their results. The EPA should promote the use of rigorous science, not questionable science. Those who say that peer review is adequate are misguided. The American people deserve better than that, and the HONEST Act ensures that their expectations are met. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues who are interested in an open and honest EPA to pass this legislation. Again, I thank Chairman SMITH for bringing this legislation forward and giving me the opportunity to speak. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side? And I would like to know if the other side, the minority, has any more speakers. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LAMALFA ). The gentleman from Texas has 8
3⁄4minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from Texas has 10
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ). Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I have been standing here listening to this debate. Let’s go back and think about this for just a minute. Right now, in the United States, the cost of regulation in our Nation is approximately $2 trillion; $2 trillion is the cost that our Nation spends every year just complying with regulations. In fact, that distills down to the average household spending around $15,000 just to comply with regulations. Now, let me be clear. Regulations are important. We have got to have regulations to make sure we protect our environment, we protect the health and safety of our citizens. That is critical. What this bill does is it simply provides for transparency so we can understand the basis of regulations. That is all this does: make sure that we can understand the science that regulations were based upon. During a public comment process, we should have the ability to scrutinize that science to understand the basis. Because, Mr. Speaker, if you begin hiding the basis for decisions, then you have government, in many cases, acting without providing for transparency, without being able to be held accountable. That is dangerous to have people making decisions based upon secret information. That is dangerous for our economy, and it is going to further challenge the ability of Americans to keep their budgets balanced. It is already $15,000 per household. How many thousands does it have to be before we need to say: Stop. This is unreasonable? Mr. Speaker, you look right now at the trade deficit of this country; you look at the cost of goods and products in other nations. In many cases, we are losing the trade war because our regulatory environment here, our tax environment here, is simply not competitive. What happens in a scenario where you release the science you provide for transparency, you allow for better solutions. You allow for more efficient regulations, for better ways to achieve those objectives to improve our environment and protect our environment, to improve and protect the safety and health of workers and American citizens. This bill is in America’s interest. It is in the public interest. To listen to people stand here and talk about hiding and shielding science and making up red herrings about privacy and other things, that is absolutely contrary to this country’s interests. It is contrary to the public’s interest. This bill should be passed. I am shocked that there is opposition to it, and we should pass this with unanimous support. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT ), a former member of the Science Committee, who is still missed, a former chairman of the Environment Subcommittee, and the author of a very similar bill to this in a previous Congress. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, look, I miss the Science Committee, and I know I have been banned, and I have had a lot of coffee today. I was going to come up to the microphone and sort of do the blast away, but let me back away. A number of things I have heard in this debate from the left and even a couple of the things from my side, okay, you are conflating all sorts of things that this bill doesn’t do. This bill is three pages. So can I ask a question? If I came to you right now and said, ‘‘Tell me that the EPA actually has the right rule sets for hydrocarbons, if it has the right rule set for PM10, it has the right rule sets for ozone,’’ you would say, ‘‘Well, I have a peerreviewed study that says this.’’ I want to make the argument, in today’s technology, why 
shouldn’t your university, why shouldn’t the really smart person who has the computer system in their basement, why shouldn’t the new statistical packages that are on these things be allowed to take the data the taxpayers have paid for and work it and model it and bounce it off other types of datasets and ask is the way we model and regulate rational? This bill doesn’t reduce regulations. In many ways, it allows us all to participate in the citizen science to understand whether we are doing it the right way. Why is the left so scared of citizen scientists, of university scientists, of people who are just darned interested in the matching of different types of datasets? You and I might find out we are doing things the wrong way. You and I might find out we are not doing enough. You and I may find out we are doing far too much. But stop being afraid of people having access to the information. If society is going to live under a regulatory environment, then society deserves access to the information that creates those regulations. Public information for public policy, why is that so feared? Why is there so much trust in the bureaucracy instead of science and information? I want to argue with you that, in today’s world, when we are on the cusp, where sensors are going to be attached to this, taking thousands of readings in our communities, that that information is just as noble as something that is locked up in the cabinet where none of us can actually see the base datasets. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, since the time that President Nixon signed into law authorizing the EPA, it appears to me that there has been no evidence that they have done anything other than attempt to protect the lives of the American people. I don’t believe that this legislation is going to do anything to further that. It will give them a lot of unfunded mandates, far more than what they would ever be funded to carry out. I would ask everyone to respect the Agency and vote ‘‘no’’ on the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, costly environmental regulations should only be based upon data that is available to independent scientists and the public and that can be verified. H.R. 1430, the HONEST Act, gives independent scientists an opportunity to validate the studies the EPA uses to make new regulations. What this bill does not do is roll back the laws that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. It simply requires the EPA to base regulations on science that is publicly available. This is a nonpartisan bill. A change in administration does not change the need or justification for it. This is the same bill, virtually, introduced in the last administration, and that is evidenced by my introduction of this goodgovernment legislation with my Democratic colleague HENRY CUELLAR . That shows it is a good, bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and promote a more open and honest Federal Government. We should not be afraid of letting the American people see the data that the EPA or other agencies say justifies their regulations. So let’s vote for an open and honest government and support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 229, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. b1445 
Mr. M CEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. MCEACHIN. I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. McEachin moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1430 to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: At the end of the bill, add the following: 
Notwithstanding the amendment made by section 2, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall, in carrying out the activities described in that amendment, make use of the best available science, whether or not it is publicly available in any form, when responding to threats to public health, including black lung disease and asthma, caused by or exacerbated by exposure to pollution or toxic chemicals. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simple. It ensures that the EPA continues to use the best available science to respond to threats to public health, including black lung and asthma, caused by or exacerbated by exposure to pollution or toxic chemicals. This motion to recommit reverses harmful restrictions imposed by this bill that make it almost impossible to base public protections on the best available scientific information, much of which is private or proprietary and cannot always be published. In its current form, Mr. Speaker, this bill, the socalled Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act, seriously impedes the EPA’s ability to protect the American public from pollutants, toxins, and other dangerous threats to their wellbeing. The true intention of this bill is not to increase transparency in policymaking but, rather, to bar scientists and civil servants from enforcing the intent of bedrock protections in the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other important laws. If this ‘‘secret science’’ bill passes in its current form, the EPA’s work will grind to a halt and countless Americans will suffer or even die as a result. Hardworking miners, whose work and contributions have been overly politicized in the debate to keep access to science, are the greatest at risk. Generations of miners toil dutifully to support their families, all the while exposing themselves to toxicity and pollution that can leave them with lifelong debilitating diseases, such as black lung and asthma. Families who will struggle from the costs to treat these expensive diseases and from loss of income due to days missed from work do not need more obstruction or political football. They need access to the best care available, which relies upon evidencebased science. They deserve far better than what the majority is offering. Mr. Speaker, I came to Congress with a mission to uphold the values and principles of the great constituents living in Virginia’s Fourth Congressional District. I believe that includes advocating for the health of all Americans. That means advocating for sound science and reasonable policies. It means rejecting dangerous, shortsighted, and an astonishingly hard hearted piece of legislation that is currently before you. Mr. Speaker, science is the bedrock of sound medical and public health decisionmaking. EPA’s sciencebased decisionmaking process has saved lives and led to the dramatic improvements in the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the Earth we share. All Americans have benefited from the researchbased scientific advice that scientists have provided the EPA, and that is why I urge my colleagues to support my motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I don’t really know the gentleman from Virginia, but you can hear in the tone of his voice he is truly wellmeaning and cares about his State and his population. 
If you actually read this motion to recommit, things in here, such as best available science, are obvious. If you actually read the three pages of the legislation, that is the obvious part. For many of us—and being sort of the original previous generation author of the bill—that was our goal. But does anyone see sort of the intellectual duplicity when, on one hand, you say proprietary science, and then— the best available science, but other science can’t test, stress, analyze, bounce, conflate, model the proprietary science, because it is proprietary, with the best available and other datasets? You can’t have both. If you are going to try to make public policy in a world with functionally secret, proprietary science data that is sold—actually, let’s be brutally honest here for a moment. This stuff is sold to the EPA. One of the reasons some of the groups that have been listed off oppose this legislation is they make money selling the data, and then they make it so you can’t actually look at the datasets underneath and test it. How does that lead us to knowing that we are taking care of our brothers and sisters out there? How does that lead us to actually knowing we are doing it the best possible, most rational way and that our rules, our mechanics are correct? On your motion to recommit, I am a severe asthmatic. I have had it since I was an infant. I am one of those people who wakes up every day and takes a hit of my inhaler to make sure my lungs are okay. In the back room, I have an emergency inhaler. I know what it is like to live with asthma. I care tremendously about the science, but I also want there to be vigorous debate. I want there to be all sorts of research. I want there to be this sort of crowdsourced world where science and data are competing with each other and being modeled together; and living in a world where we trust the bureaucracy, where we trust proprietary, secret information to make our rule sets. I don’t know how anyone, intellectually, can get to the point of thinking that is making our society healthier and that we are actually doing it in the most efficient manner possible. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess subject to the call of the Chair. Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 52 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. f 
b1620 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee) at 4 o’clock and 20 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 205. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. This will be a 5minute vote. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 228, noes 194, not voting 7, as follows:

b1654 So the bill was passed. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mr. DUFFY. Madam Speaker, on March 29, 2017, on rollcall No. 203 on ordering the previous question, I am not recorded. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘aye.’’ On rollcall No. 204 on agreeing to the resolution, H. Res. 233, providing for consideration of H.R. 1431, I am not recorded. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘aye.’’ On rollcall No. 205 on motion to recommit with instructions, I am not recorded. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay.’’ On rollcall No. 206 on final passage of H.R. 1431, I am not recorded. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘aye’’ on final passage of H.R. 1431. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. TENNEY ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, during yesterday evening’s vote series, I was present on the House floor. However, my vote was not recorded on rollcall No. 202, due to a technical malfunction. Had I been recorded, I would have voted ‘‘no’’ on S.J. Res. 34. 
NATIONAL VIETNAM WAR VETERANS DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the first official National Vietnam War Veterans Day. Just yesterday, President Trump signed a bill into law permanently designating March 29 as the day we honor our Vietnam veterans. Madam Speaker, in many instances, our Vietnam veterans often did not receive a warm welcome home when they returned from war. This is a small step toward giving these brave men and women the recognition they deserve. It was on this day in 1973 that the last combat troops were ordered out of Vietnam. Fortyfour years later, the House and Senate unanimously approved this Federal statute recognizing and honoring our Vietnam veterans who answered the Nation’s call and served with honor and distinction. This effort began in Pennsylvania as the brainchild of Sergeant Harold Redding, a Vietnam veteran from York, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania’s own Senator PATTOOMEY led the charge to make this day a reality. Madam Speaker, we all know someone who served in Vietnam. Those veterans are our friends, our family, our neighbors. Thank you to all of our Vietnam veterans. May God bless you on this National Vietnam War Veterans Day. 
HONORING MAUREEN ‘‘MO’’ GILMAN (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor a dear friend, Maureen ‘‘Mo’’ Gilman, who retired on March 17 as the legislative director of the National Treasury Employees Union. Mo served NTEU with great ability for 31 years after working in this House for former Representatives Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut and Chris Dodd, also of Connecticut. NTEU represents approximately 150,000 Federal employees working in 31 Federal agencies. Mo has been tireless in the effort to ensure that Federal civilian employees receive the pay, benefits, and workplace protections they deserve. Mo spent a considerable part of her years at NTEU educating Congress and administrations about the important work Federal servants carry out. At a time when some in Congress and in the current administration are denigrating Federal civil servants, threatening to reduce their pay and benefits and deeply cut the budgets of agencies for which they work, I am more than a little sad to see Mo retire. But as she does, Madam Speaker, I am certain that Mo will keep inspiring us all to continue the fight with the same resolve that she showed every day of her career. I hope my colleagues will join me, Madam Speaker, in wishing Mo Gilman well and thanking her for her extraordinary work on behalf of our country. MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO SECURE OUR BORDER (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, foreign national Tommy AlvaradoVentura has a string of arrests to his name, including assault, impersonation, drunk driving, and contempt of court. Not to mention that he has been deported four times. And, oh, yes, Madam Speaker, he is an MS–13 gang member. Despite being deported four times, he made his way back to America. This time, he stabbed a woman in a parking lot. Then he went to a house only to sexually assault a 2yearold. When his girlfriend saw the bruises on the child, he stabbed her as well. Eventually, NYPD arrested him. Madam Speaker, our porous border is not secure. Foreign criminals who violently assault and rape women and children in the United States keep coming back to America. Border officials are doing the best they can do with what they have. But the message is clear: they need more to secure our border. Washington must send more resources, boots on the ground, aerostats, and military equipment, if necessary, to establish a virtual border wall against outlaws like AlvaradoVentura. And that is just the way it is. 
HEALTH CARE IS NOT EASY, BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, $880 billion cut from the insurance of hardworking, lowincome families; $600 billion going to the top 1 percent of the richest people in America. Those were the singular features of the TrumpCare bill: not caring for any one of you, but simply taking away and providing for the rich. Health care in my district and in America is very serious. I heard the testimony for many years of mothers who had autistic children or children with severe disorders, or visited nursing homes where elderly who had worked were there on Medicaid, or maybe heard the pleas of cancer survivors who would not have lived but for the Affordable Care Act and having insurance. This is nothing to play with. Any suggestion that health care is easy, Mr. Trump, or that we can get together with the moderates is not a direction to go. If you are serious, we are serious. But we are serious about people whose lives are in jeopardy, and we are serious about providing access and health care to all of America, including our rural hospitals and our children’s hospitals, who beg for us not to pass TrumpCare. We are prepared to work on behalf of the American people. Health care is not easy, but it is essential, it is lifesaving. I want to be on the side of saving lives of all Americans. It is not easy and it is not something to fool around with. f 
HONORING LIEUTENANT FREDERICK DELLECKER (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the loss of a Floridian, a patriot, and one of the Air Force’s finest. Two weeks ago, three servicemembers were lost in a crash of a reconnaissance and surveillance plane in New Mexico. These young men were not just servicemembers serving in our United States Air Force; they were sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers. In particular, Florida’s own Lieutenant Frederick Dellecker, a dedicated first lieutenant, had a long and promising career ahead of him. Lieutenant Dellecker was 26 and known amongst his friends for his legendary humor. As a veterinarian, I was particularly touched by Lieutenant Dellecker’s love of animals. His friends and family recently revealed that, while in pilot training, Lieutenant Dellecker once shared a hotdog with a fleabitten stray who had just delivered a litter of puppies and was starving. He ended up taking her in and giving her a second chance at a new life. I would like to take a moment on behalf of all Americans and all of the Members here today to thank him and his family for their service. Lieutenant Frederick Dellecker, your name will not be forgotten. 
CHAIRMAN OF HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND RECUSE HIMSELF (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I am someone who believes in this institution. So, Madam Speaker, this week, to me, has been an embarrassment. It is an embarrassment that we here in the House can’t have a real, genuine bipartisan investigation by our Intelligence Committee. Fortunately, this afternoon, the chairman and ranking member—one Democrat and one Republican—of the Senate Intelligence Committee have signaled in a joint press conference that they are interested in having a real investigation. Wouldn’t it be nice if the House of Representatives would do the same? Madam Speaker, it gives me no pleasure to say this, but the chairman of our House Intelligence Committee has acted in a way that makes a real 
investigation in our House impossible. He should do the right thing and recuse himself, and this House should join the Senate in having a real investigation. 
CONGRATULATING AND HONORING ANGELINA M. PENNISI STEINER (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I come from the State of Florida, where we have many of our citizens who live in nursing homes. Despite the views of some, those residents can live remarkable, productive, and fulfilling lives. One such resident is Angelina Steiner. Mrs. Steiner lives in the Plant City Senior Center. She shares her talents in weekly poetry readings. She became a member of the Florida Writers Association. In 2014, she published her first book: ‘‘Chasing Dreams.’’ Now, her second book: ‘‘Beautiful Words Coming My Way’’ is being published and archived in the Library of Congress. A loving wife and a mother of four children, Mrs. Steiner is inspired by everyday events. She has the talent to paint beautiful pictures through her poetry, and I am incredibly proud of her. 
RECOGNIZING SOCIAL SCIENTISTS FROM THE CONSORTIUM OF SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATIONS (Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the 80 social scientists from the Consortium of Social Science Associations, who are visiting Washington, D.C., today, and to thank them for their hard work keeping our STEM enterprise strong. They are here to highlight the value of social science research to the Nation, and to support funding for the social, behavioral, and economic sciences in the National Science Foundation budget. Social science research has provided us with numerous benefits. Some of these include: strengthening cybersecurity by showing us how changes in behavior can eliminate cyber vulnerabilities; making our soldiers safer by working with the Army to improve its crosscultural training; and saving lives by improving the system of matching kidney donors with patients. Madam Speaker, we must have strong Federal funding for social science research. Cuts would make America weaker, not greater. I urge my colleagues to oppose any cuts to social science funding in the NSF budget. 
PUTTING ACCOUNTABILITY BACK ON THE EPA (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, tonight I rise to commend the House for passing H.R. 1430, what is known as the HONEST Act. This would put more of the onus on to the Environmental Protection Agency, sometimes known as the employment prevention agency, to disclose where they get their science or where they get their reasoning when they are going to make a regulation upon the people that produce in this country. My own constituents have suffered from that in my district in northern California, where arbitrary rules are put in place without even the opportunity to face their accuser of what kind of science they are using or what kind of reasoning they are using to put a regulation in place that they have to fight, and fight sometimes for many years, in order to have the opportunity just to use their land, just to use their land for planting crops or for grazing or for other things that would help them with their livelihood, with their economy, like they have been using for so many years, even decades, in their families. The HONEST Act will put accountability back on the EPA to say you have to come forward with reasoning, with logic, and with science that is publicly available and not hidden from the public so that we can see what you are using to regulate the people. 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S TIES WITH RUSSIA (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to continue the call for an independent commission to investigate the President’s ties with Russia. Congress has the responsibility to ensure we investigate these matters appropriately. We must provide the American people with answers, transparency, and accountability. We know that there are issues with the House Intelligence Committee on the Republican side, so it is time that we ask for an independent commission to take the lead. Let’s be honest, at the end of the day, you are the company you keep. So far, President Trump’s team has included a national security adviser who was paid by Russian companies to appear at Russian events, a former campaign manager who had a multimilliondollar contract to advance Putin’s agenda, and now we have the issues again with the Republican side of the Intelligence Committee to cover up tracks left by the Trump administration. As we further untangle the web created by Trump and his team, it is clear that some Republicans are fearful of what potential investigations may reveal. The American people deserve answers. BUCKLEY V. VALEO REINTRODUCTION (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution: Expressing the sense of Congress that the Supreme Court misinterpreted the First Amendment to the Constitution in the case of Buckley v. Valeo. This resolution will restore equal footing to all Americans in our Nation’s politics. The landmark Supreme Court case Buckley v. Valeo was decided over 40 years ago. ThenJustice Byron White called the decision ‘‘a mortal danger against which effective preventive and curative steps must be taken.’’ In the wake of the recent Presidential election where spending approached $5 billion, we clearly see the influence of big money. That money exerts an inordinate amount of influence over our politics. True to form, it appears to have endowed donors with an unusually high number of Cabinet positions in the Trump administration. Over onethird of President Trump’s highlevel government posts were awarded to megacampaign donors. Congress must end the current practice of allowing elections to be bought by the highest bidder. If money equals free speech, then lack of money equals lack of free speech. We must ensure that our campaigns are reflective of the people’s voices. Buckley v. Valeo took away this inviolate First Amendment right from the people, and this resolution is the remedy to restore it. 
b1715 REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.J. RES. 17 Mr. SANFORD. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be removed as a cosponsor from H.J. Res. 17. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT A message in writing from the President of the United States was communicated to the House by Mr. Brian Pate, one of his secretaries. 
QUESTIONING THE RUSSIAN CONNECTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have five legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland? There was no objection. Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, with my colleague PRAMILA JAYAPAL , from the State of Washington, on behalf of the Progressive Caucus, we are taking this Special Order hour to focus on the question of the Russian connection. This is a matter of utmost seriousness and urgency to the American people because it goes to the question of our national security and the political sovereignty of the American people to engage in democracy on our own without foreign interference, subversion, and sabotage. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE  WATERS ), the distinguished Congresswoman. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman RASKIN for organizing this time, for helping to keep this Congress focused on this extraordinary chain of events that is taking place in our country, and for drawing attention to what should be a credible investigation about the ties between this President and Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. Why is this President so focused on complimenting Putin? Why has he wrapped his arms around him? Why has he said he is a great President? Why does he refuse to even talk about the fact that Putin has invaded Crimea? Why does he refuse to understand what is being said when Putin is charged to be a killer and all of the deaths that are taking place from opponents of his, from people who criticize him? Well, I think the more we learn about the connections that this President and his allies have, the more these questions are going to become very serious, and it is going to lead us to have to make some big decisions about whether or not this President is fit to lead the United States of America. I have been deeply concerned about these issues for months. President Trump, throughout his campaign and since his election, has chosen to surround himself with people who have close ties with Russia. When our intelligence agencies announced their conclusion that Russia interfered in our elections, I called for an investigation focusing on the possibility of collusion between Trump’s ‘‘Kremlin Klan,’’ that I have dubbed them, and the Russian Government. I introduced H. Con. Res. 15, urging Congress to investigate the possibility of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Investigations should focus on the Kremlin Klan. Let’s talk about some of those allies and folks who are aligned with Trump and with Russia: Michael Flynn, who was fired from the NSC after lying about discussing sanctions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak. Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, was a paid lobbyist for Viktor Yanukovych, the proRussian politician in Ukraine who fled to Russia in 2014. AP reports Manafort signed a $10 million contract in 2006, with Russian billionaire and Putin ally Oleg Deripaska, to advance Putin’s interest in the United States. The New York Times also reports Manafort tried to hide $750,000 in payments from a pro Russian party in Ukraine. Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, is a consultant to and investor in the Kremlin staterun gas company, Gazprom, and has a direct financial interest in ending American sanctions against the company. He recently revealed that he met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, during the 2016 RNC. And then there is Roger Stone, who has worked in Ukraine. Stone announced, in a speech last summer, that he had spoken to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Stone also disclosed to the press that he had been exchanging messages with Guccifer 2.0, the Russian hacker that hacked the DNC last summer. And thenSecretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross was a business partner of Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch and Putin ally, in a major financial project involving the Bank of Cyprus. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signed a multibilliondollar agreement with Russia in 2011, on behalf of Exxon, for an oil drilling project in the Arctic and is focused on lifting the sanctions. The New York Times reported that, prior to his resignation, Mike Flynn was delivered a proposal outlining a way for President Trump to lift the Russian sanctions and broker a deal between Russia and Ukraine that also included the public smearing of Ukraine’s current President Poroshenko. The deal is being pushed by his opposition in Ukraine. Although Mike Flynn is gone, the proposal remains, along with those pushing it. Then there is Michael Cohen, the President’s personal lawyer, who was involved in developing the document, and who delivered the document. Then there is Felix H. Sater, a business associate and a former criminal who served time, who reportedly had ties with the Mafia, who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia. And then there is Andriy Artemenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement, shaped in part by Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. And of course, there is our Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was forced to recuse himself from investigations related to the 2016 Presidential campaign, after it was revealed that he met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on two separate occasions during the campaign cycle, information which he failed to disclose during his confirmation hearings. Kislyak is the same Ambassador with whom Mike Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions, and, by the way, he lied about it. It has now been revealed that Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak met with the following Trump associates: Carter Page, Jeff Sessions, Mike Flynn, and Jared Kushner, in December 2016, in Trump Tower, during the transition. None of these meetings were made public and were only discovered after the press released reports. Before the press reporting on the meetings above, the Trump administration had repeatedly denied its campaign had contact and communication with Russian officials. The press has noted that the meetings are not unusual but that public concern is heightened because they have all lied about or failed to disclose the meetings. Deutsche Bank was ordered to pay more than $600 million in fines, including a $425 million fine to New York’s Department of Financial Services and a $204 million fine to the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority for failing to have adequate money laundering controls in place to prevent a group of corrupt traders from improperly and secretly transferring more than $10 billion out of Russia. Press reports indicate that the Department of Justice is investigating this matter. Deutsche Bank is Trump’s largest lender, lending his companies an estimated $360 million. As to oil and gas, President Trump signed last month a bill striking section 1504 of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform Act which required Big Oil companies to disclose the money they pay to foreign governments to drill on their lands. Striking section 1504 will allow Big Oil companies like ExxonMobil to conduct secretive dealings with corrupt parties, such as Vladimir Putin and Russia. The White House attempted to enlist the FBI, the CIA Director Pompeo, and top Republicans on the House and Senate intel committees to help push back against The New York Times reporting on Trump’s ties to Russia. There is DEVIN NUNES —I don’t need to talk about him. He issued a joint statement with ADAM SCHIFF , a joint statement in January announcing that the scope of their investigation would include links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns. FBI Director James Comey announced on March 20, during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, that the FBI is investigating whether members of President Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. DEVIN NUNES announced to the press that members of Trump’s transition team were under incidental surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies 
after the election and briefed President Trump on March 22. However, he did not brief ADAM SCHIFF or other House Intelligence Committee members, and he never revealed his source. DEVIN NUNES has clearly compromised the investigation and can no longer be trusted to lead it. In conclusion, Congress must create a comprehensive, independent, bipartisan commission to expose the full truth of Trump’s ties to Russia. I believe that, once we have fully investigated Trump’s Kremlin Klan, we will find that there was collusion between President Trump and Russia to violate the integrity of our elections. At that point, the Republicans in Congress will have no choice but to put country ahead of party. I say impeach Donald Trump. I thank you so much, as we witness what attempts to be a coverup now about all of this. Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ms. WATERS for her zealous work on behalf of her constituents and all Americans. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ), our distinguished colleague, who is a leading member of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, there is an obvious cancer at the heart of the credibility, perhaps even of the legitimacy, of the Trump administration. That cancer consists of questions pertaining to the relationship of this administration with Russia. We know that the Russians intervened in the last election with the goal of advantaging Trump’s campaign over Hillary Clinton. We know that there were numerous Trump campaign transition team and administration officials in contact with the Russians— prior to, during, and after the campaign. We know that there is a pattern of these individuals at first denying such contacts but later, after being forced to come clean, admitting them. Examples to date include: former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Roger Stone, who admitted that he was in contact with Guccifer 2.0, the hacker that the CIA says is a Russian front for military intelligence. We know that the Attorney General gave false testimony, deliberate or otherwise, to the Senate regarding meetings with Russian officials. We know that President Trump has financial ties with Russia. Although he denies it, we now know that there are large Russian investments in The Trump Organization. The President’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., said a few years ago that money was ‘‘flowing in’’ from Russia. That obviously can have a major influence on the President and on the decisions of his administration. We know that there was a change in the Republican platform dealing with Ukraine to favor Russia, a change that was engineered by the Trump campaign. We even know who in the Trump campaign gave the instruction to make this change. We know that there is an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI of possible collusion by the Trump campaign in the admitted Russian intervention in the attempt by Russia to subvert the 2016 Presidential campaign. Knowing all this, it is impossible to ignore or to dismiss questions concerning the credibility of the administration, and, certainly, we must ask questions regarding its legitimacy as well, if there is persuasive evidence that crimes were committed in colluding with Russia to subvert the election. b1730 We have a duty to resolve this question, to get answers, to pursue the truth, and to remove any cancer that we may find. A few weeks ago, the Judiciary Committee considered a resolution of inquiry that I introduced dealing with a number of issues, including the President’s conflicts of interests, his possible violations of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, and any information about possible criminal or counterintelligence investigations related to the President and/or his associates. Yet, to date, the Republicans have opposed our amendments and voted down our resolutions of inquiry, in effect, abdicating their constitutional obligation to provide oversight and enforce the law. Now we have the spectacle of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee conducting an obvious coverup, failing to share important information with members of the committee—information, I would add, that revealed President Trump’s allegations against former President Obama as completely false—while inappropriately briefing people at the White House on the committee’s investigation, the very same people who are the subjects of the investigation. This is so absurd, so inappropriate, and beyond belief that it is tough to accept the reality of the situation. Sadly, this isn’t a television drama we can turn off or walk away from. The integrity of our democratic system of government is at stake. What we need is honesty. The American people must have faith in the integrity of our government, and it is our job to ensure it. It is time for answers. If there is no evidence of misconduct, then we should move on. But if the truth reveals a conspiracy, if there is proof of criminal conduct, Donald Trump must be held accountable, and the people around him must be held accountable, and we must act. There is no superior way to get at the truth and to fulfill our duty to the people of this country than to have an independent investigatory commission established beyond any partisan control. So I urge that that be done so that the people of this country can have confidence once again in their government. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Washington State (Ms. JAYAPAL ), who is the coconvener of the Progressive Caucus Special Order along with me. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. RASKIN of Maryland, for his incredible leadership and for the opportunity to continue to lead the Special Order hour for the Progressive Caucus here every week. And every week we do try to pick a different topic. For those of you in the audience, we pick a different topic, and this evening that topic is the ties to Russia of this administration. Yesterday, Sean Spicer told veteran White House correspondent April Ryan that she was ‘‘going to have to take ‘no’ for an answer’’ when she asked him about the President’s collusion with Russia. Well, Mr. Spicer, we are here to tell you that we will not just take ‘‘no’’ for an answer. We are not going to sit back and believe everything that is coming out from the White House when there is mounting evidence that President Trump’s campaign may have colluded with Russia to tip the election in his favor. And for those of you who saw the Judiciary Committee today, we had a resolution of inquiry from Representative HAKEEM JEFFRIES and T EDLIEUabout this very issue in relation to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his ties to Russia. Let’s not forget that President Trump’s former national security adviser and campaign adviser only lasted a recordsetting 24 days in the role because he blatantly lied about meeting with Russia’s Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the campaign. So what other ties to Russia have been confirmed? There are so many of these ties that I thought it might be helpful to have a diagram and to really show exactly what the connections have been between top Trump officials during the campaign who are now the same officials that are serving in the White House and are the President’s close and personal confidants. The fact that a diagram is even necessary tells us something. Let’s start at the top with the President himself. President Trump has a long history with Russia. His first trip to Moscow was actually 30 years ago. He went to explore potential real estate opportunities. His relationship with the country has clearly grown. In the late 1990s, Trump started banking with Deutsche Bank, which has since been investigated for funneling Russian money offshore. Soon after that, he linked up with a Russian company called the Bayrock Group, which has ties to the Mafia and to criminal interests in Russia. Their partnership was integral to helping to 
expand The Trump Organization to new heights, with properties springing up across the country. His ties to Russia only grew deeper. In the late 2000s, several Russian businessmen bought properties from The Trump Organization, netting them hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. Now, let’s fastforward to 2016 when thencandidate Trump was building his team. He brought on Carter Page, who is now under investigation for communicating with Russian officials. And, in fact, it was the Trump campaign’s former manager, Corey Lewandowski, who gave Carter Page the green light to visit Moscow just last July. A couple of weeks later, Mr. Page met with Sergey Kislyak, but he said that he will not reveal the details of that conversation to the public. This is a very important, consistent fact that we see. Our resolution of inquiry today that we debated in the Judiciary Committee was about the release of information so that we understand what is going on. Without any accusations, what we are trying to say is let us investigate what these ties are, what the conversations were, and let us determine, in an independent, bipartisan way, let us determine that there has not been collusion, and let us make sure that there is no foreign government that is affecting our democracy. So various members of Trump’s team met with Russian officials during the campaign. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions didn’t just meet with officials, he lied about meeting with officials during his confirmation hearing. And again, the top prosecutor in the United States of America lied under oath during a confirmation hearing. This cannot be ignored. Once again, we are not saying don’t have conversations, but don’t lie about them. Don’t make us wonder what happened during those conversations. How do we trust the Attorney General of the United States of America to fairly and impartially preside if he has shown that he is willing to make false statements just to get the job? He is not the only highlevel Trump official who has been blatantly dishonest with the American people. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, was put in place by President Trump and resigned due to the shady backdoor dealings that put him in the pocket of Russian officials. He was paid $45,000 to attend a statesponsored gala dinner and sit at the table of Vladimir Putin. These connections are more than just mere coincidence. And in addition to Flynn, Page, and Sessions, there are several others who have been implicated: Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort; former campaign adviser, Roger Stone; his personal lawyer—all of these folks are up here—his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, are all under investigation for their connections to Russia. And now President Trump’s soninlaw, who has become one of his top advisers, is under investigation as well for his actions during the campaign. Not only did Jared Kushner meet with Ambassador Kislyak, he met with the Russian bankers as well. And the White House has claimed that the meetings were ‘‘diplomatic,’’ but it is deeply troubling that one of the bankers that he met with was Sergey Gorkov. I want to be clear about who this person is. He is a graduate of the Russian Academy of the Federal Security Service, which is an academy that is tasked with training individuals to become members of Russia’s security and intelligence forces. He is now the chairman of the Vnesheconombank, and he was appointed by Putin, himself. This is not a momandpop bank. This is a stateowned corporation that has been under sanctions by the United States for the past 3 years. And that is a big deal. Jared Kushner, whose family is worth nearly $2 billion, has real estate interests around the world, sat down, allegedly under the auspices of his role with the President, to chat with this owner of the bank. A spokesperson for the Kremlin has alleged that this meeting was ‘‘absolutely the bank’s prerogative’’ and that the Russian Government was unaware of the meeting. We need more information to know what happened in that meeting because, otherwise, where there is smoke, we think there is fire. So we need to have the information so that we can actually determine what is happening with these connections because, if somebody from the Trump campaign and the Trump administration is meeting with Russian officials and they don’t want to tell us why or what is discussed, then we have to start wondering whether the conversations are in the interest of the American people or in the interest of the Russian Government. We also have Rex Tillerson, President Trump’s Secretary of State, who has strong business ties to Russia and was awarded the Order of Friendship from Vladimir Putin in 2013. This is the highest honor that Russia can bestow on noncitizens. Just 2 years prior, Tillerson had struck a massive $500 billion oil deal with the Russian Government. Now, we could go on and on with this, but what is important for the American people to understand is that we have expectations that the President of the United States and that his Cabinet are working in the interests of the American people. We have expectations that, if a deal is struck, it is not for the benefit of some other country or for the personal benefit of any individual in office, but that it is for the public’s benefit. And if a deal is struck that takes benefit away from the public in order to give it to a foreign government or to an individual personal interest of our government, then that is an enormous disservice to our democracy, and, of course, there are constitutional ramifications for all of this. This administration has tried to tell us that the conversations between Trump’s advisers and highlevel Russian businessmen and officials were about diplomacy. Yet this shroud of secrecy that continues every time we try to get information, every time we try to make sure that there is an independent, bipartisan investigation, the shroud of secrecy continues, and it begs the question: If this is really about advocating for the interests of the American people and not the Russian Government or the pocketbooks of Cabinet members, then why the secrecy? What is there to hide? We don’t understand that. If there is nothing to hide, then let us have the information. There have been plenty of requests to do that in a classified way in case there is some information that is classified. But why are the President’s campaign advisers and officials denying under oath that they have communicated with Russia only then to be forced to walk back their statements or recuse themselves, as Jeff Sessions had to do, or to even resign? Foreign policy is key to American interests, but these backroom conversations and subsequent lies are doing nothing to make the American people feel confident in an administration that is supposed to represent them. It is clear that there is a strong tie here that was only strengthened during the campaign. But let’s be very clear about what is the connective tissue in all of this, in all of these lines that go back and forth. What is the connective tissue that connects all of this? It is money. How did we get to this point? Of course, we remember the hacking of the election that occurred last year. It is in the process of being investigated, even though the chairman of the Intelligence Committee feels that his first duty is to the President and not to the members of the committee. But last year, President Trump defended Vladimir Putin by placing the blame on the Democratic National Committee to distract the American people; and then, in July, he outright urged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails, saying: ‘‘Russia, if you are listening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.’’ In December, a CIA assessment concluded that Russia was trying to help thencandidate Trump win the election. Why? Because they know that they have an ally in President Trump. They have someone who is willing to do business with them, even if it may not be in the best interests of the American people. They know that they are well connected at every level of his administration. And let’s be clear about who we are talking about with Mr. Putin. This is a 
dictator, a human rights abuser, somebody whom Republicans and Democrats, alike, have said we cannot be associated with. b1745 You have heard of ‘‘The Manchurian Candidate.’’ In the most recent election, we may have ended up with the Kremlin candidate, and the script truly writes itself. We were hoping to have a chance to get to the bottom of this, as I said. We were hoping to have a chance to get to the bottom of this in a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee, but we never got the chance. Last Tuesday, Representative NUNES  went to the secret briefing in a National Security Council facility, and what he found apparently wasn’t good for the President because he ran over there to tell the President. Instead of doing his duty and reporting the information to the House Intelligence Committee, he went straight to the White House with his findings. And he is supposed to be chairing an investigation into what happened, not being the runner for information to the President. After briefing President Trump, Representative NUNES canceled the hearing, denying Americans the opportunity to hear from former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. And Ranking Member JIMHIMES was right when he said that ‘‘the Monday hearing last week was, I’m sure, not to the White House’s liking.’’ He went on to say: ‘‘Since Monday, I’m sorry to say, the chairman,’’ Chairman NUNES , ‘‘has ceased to be the chairman of an investigative committee and has been running interference for the Trump White House.’’ This is absolutely unacceptable. The fact that we are questioning whether or not several members of the President’s Cabinet—not just one, not even just two, but several members of the President’s Cabinet, including the President, himself—are guilty of collusion with a foreign government is a downright outrage. In my home district, the Seventh District of Washington State, I have been receiving numerous calls, hundreds of calls from constituents since day one, saying: How can this be happening in this democracy? How is this possible in America? How do we make sure that our government is representing us and not a foreign entity? Why is it that somebody would lie about whether or not they had a conversation with the Russian Government if there was nothing to hide? People are losing faith in the United States Government. It is a crisis of democracy when people can’t trust that their government is actually trying to get to the bottom of what is going on and actually representing the interests of the American people. The White House may have a friend in Representative NUNES , but I want the American people to know that they have a friend in us. We won’t back down on our demands. Representative NUNES should recuse himself from this investigation. There is no way we can expect a full and impartial investigation after what has just occurred. This should not be a partisan issue. Every Member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, should be demanding to know the facts. We are not making judgments. We want to know the facts. If there are facts that we don’t know that say, no, there were very legitimate conversations, there was no collusion, then we are done. Why tie up the airwaves with this? So tonight, as we think about where we are in this debate and we think about the fact that, for 3 months, this administration has been under the shadow of secrecy, under the shadow of mistrust from the American people, there is a very easy way to clear all of the names of the people who are on this list, including the President of the United States, and that is to ensure that we have an independent investigation; to ensure that Representative NUNES recuses himself and steps down as the chair of the Intelligence Committee, given what has happened; and to ensure that, at the end of the day, we remember that the Government of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the Congress of the United States of America, our one duty is to represent the people of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) for his leadership. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman JAYAPAL for her fantastic leadership for the people of Washington in the city of Washington and her zealous advocacy for all of the American people. Mr. Speaker, let me try to recap some of the themes that we have brought up this evening and talk about what is really at stake here. But I want to start with some good news, because there was really some great news out of Russia on Sunday, where more than 75,000 people across the country braved the tyranny and despotism of their government to go out into the streets to express their commitment to democracy, human rights, and against corruption. They were focused very specifically on some of the oligarchs who surround Vladimir Putin. One of them, Prime Minister Medvedev, it has just been learned, has amassed more than $1 billion, as a public servant, in mansions, in vineyards in Italy, in fancy cars, in jewelry—$1 billion. And the people of Russia are up in arms about the corruption, the kleptocracy, the stealing from the Russian people, which is increasingly impoverished by the imperial designs and the corrupt practices of Putin and his team. So tens of thousands of people went into the streets to protest. These are brave people, because you are talking about an authoritarian government there, a dictator, a despot, someone who orders out for the assassination of his political enemies. Many of them were arrested. Hundreds of them were arrested in Moscow, and some of them are still in jail right now. Mr. Speaker, we should be on the side of the protesters in Russia. That is who we are as America. We are a nation conceived in revolutionary insurgency against corruption, against monarchy, against dictators and autocrats and theocrats and kleptocrats who steal from the people. That is who we are. We should be meeting with them. We should be meeting with the human rights activists. We should be meeting with the anticorruption marchers who are putting themselves on the front lines of history. We should be meeting with the dissenters and the critics of Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs and big business kleptocrats who surround him. But, instead, our government has aligned with Putin himself, with the insiders in Russia. That is totally antithetical to the design of America, when you think about it. Mr. Speaker, we have the great good fortune to go to work every day surrounded by portraits of people who built this country, like George Washington, who is right over there. We have got portraits of Thomas Jefferson. We have got portraits of Frederick Douglass. We have got portraits of Abraham Lincoln, who actually served in this body and, when he was here, spent a lot of his time railing about a war that was concocted with lies by President James Polk, the Mexican War. But Lincoln knew how delicate and precious and precarious an enterprise democracy is. In the Gettysburg Address, he posed the question of how long government of the people, by the people, and for the people can last. Will it perish from the Earth? And he put the question to the people because, he said, it is up to us. Democracy is a rarity in human history. Democracy is not the norm. That is why America is a miraculous experiment on Earth. If you don’t do anything, you are going to end up with dictators and despots and kleptocrats who steal from their own people, like Vladimir Putin. But America started a different way. The first three words of our Constitution are ‘‘We, the people.’’ We, the people; we flipped the whole design. Before that, the whole theory was that the king had the power, and the king got power directly from God; and everybody was a subject of the king, and everybody served the king. Our Founders had the vision, in that outburst of enlightenment and enthusiasm, to say, no, we are going to try something different: We are going to start a government based on we, the people, and we are going to separate church and state; and we are not going to dictate to people their religious worship, and we are not 
going to dictate to people their political beliefs. There is going to be freedom of thought and freedom of speech. We don’t trust the collapse of all powers into one, which Madison said was the very definition of tyranny. We are going to separate powers. The legislature, Congress, will come first, Article I. It will represent the people. But then we are going to have someone else execute the laws of the people, faithfully execute the laws of the people. That will be the President. And when there are disputes, they will be adjudicated in a third branch of government, by the Supreme Court, to figure it out. But we are going to separate the powers, because when one guy has got all the power, it endangers the freedoms and the liberties of everybody else. We even said, even though our President is limited by the separation of powers, we are going to make sure that the President and also the Members of Congress will have an undivided, zealous loyalty only to the American people. Article I, section 9 says we cannot accept presents, emoluments, which are any kind of payments, offices, or titles from foreign princes, foreign kings, or foreign states, period. We can’t accept them without the approval of Congress. It doesn’t go. There were all kinds of powers that were sending spies and saboteurs to Washington, when the country first began, to try to pay off elected officials, but our Founders had the vision to say: No, we are not going to accept that. We are not going to allow payments and bribes and fancy presents being given to our elected officials. So one government, separated powers, based on public integrity, honesty, and devotion to the people. That is the model here. Now, we should be on the side of democratic movements all over the Earth, like the people who assembled in Moscow on Sunday, who assembled in Siberia on Sunday. There were marchers even there. It was like our Women’s March. It took place all over the country. Those are our people. We should be on the side of the people who are trying to overthrow the despotism in Russia. But look what is happening. Tyranny and authoritarianism are on the march all over the world. Russia is the headquarters of it, but you can find it everywhere you look: Philippines, a madman dictator who thinks he has the power to send his agents out to go and shoot people on the street because they look like they are a drug dealer and brags about it, Duterte; Hungary, another favorite of Vladimir Putin, Mr. Orban, who is cracking down on press freedom, on human rights in his country; Iran, authoritarian, theocratic state; people being thrown in jail for blasphemy, for heresy, for apostasy, for religious offenses; Saudi Arabia, fomenting racist, anti Semitic propaganda and sending it out, oppressing people based on religion, not even allowing women to drive in their society. Everywhere you turn, tyranny, despotism on the march. And Mr. Putin has a plan. How do we know it? Do we know it from the Democratic Caucus or the Republican Conference? No. We know it from our intelligence agencies, from the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency. Seventeen of America’s intelligence agencies came back with a report, and they said Vladimir Putin has a plan to continue to destabilize and undermine liberal democracy all over the world. Brexit was part of it. The intervention in our election was part of it. They are going after France, where they want the rightwing, ultra nationalist, antiimmigrant campaign of Marine Le Pen to triumph in France. They are trying to do it in Germany, which is now the strongest outpost of liberal democracy left on Earth, as of yet, uncontaminated by the penetration of Russian intelligence and Putin’s agents. But what did they do to us? What is this all about? Well, we had an election in 2016. The sovereign people of America had an election. Now, unfortunately, we are still using the electoral college, which is antiquated and obsolescent. There is a movement to change it afoot to the national popular vote. But be that as it may, that is our system. We haven’t reformed it yet. It is our system. It is our elections here in America. But the electoral college makes it more vulnerable because you just have to intervene in a handful of States in order to sway the vote. What did Putin do? Again, we know this. I am not making this up. We know this from our intelligence agencies. If you don’t believe me, you go to your computer and you just look up the intelligence agency report on Russian interference and espionage and sabotage in our 2016 election. And what did they do? They spied on different Democratic institutions, like the Democratic National Committee, and they spied on particular people. They engaged in not just cyber espionage, but cyber sabotage. They orchestrated a series of leaks which dominated election coverage in the United States for several weeks. They orchestrated a campaign of fake news and propaganda in order to undermine Hillary Clinton, who was reviled—and is reviled, presumably—by Vladimir Putin because she challenged him, and she challenged the human rights situation in Russia and the involvement of Russia with various dictators in other parts of the world. So they interfered in our election. When I first got to Congress, that was still being disputed. When we tried to talk about this, it was being said, well, there is no evidence that Russia did this. Well, guess what? The evidence is replete. It is decisive. It is determinative. b1800 Now we are not hearing from our friends on the other side: Well, Russia didn’t do this. Now they are saying something different: Well, Russia may have done that. It may have been this massive, orchestrated campaign to undermine and subvert our elections, but there is no proof that that was actual collusion by the Trump campaign. About that, I want to say two things. Number one, it shouldn’t make any difference. Let’s say nobody in the Trump campaign knew anybody in Russia and never heard of Vladimir Putin. It would make no difference because we should still view this as a radical threat to the political sovereignty of the American people. But the second answer is even more important. As all of my colleagues were pointing out before, every day we get more evidence not just of contacts and connections, but actual collaboration and cooperation between people in the Trump campaign, the Trump family, and the Trump universe with Vladimir Putin and his closest agents and assets throughout Russia and around the world. Let’s just recap a few of those: former national security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign, or I guess he was fired by President Trump after he failed to disclose the scope of his contacts with Russians, including Ambassador Kislyak. He was paid more than $33,000 in 2015 by Russianfunded propaganda media, and the full extent of his relationship to the Russians is still being investigated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from this whole matter because he met several times with Ambassador Kislyak, who has been described as Russia’s top spy in America during the 2016 election. Then—I will speak charitably here—he misled his own colleagues in the Senate about it at his Senate confirmation hearing raising the issue and then denying that he had had any contact with the Russians at all. Senior adviser and soninlaw Jared Kushner met with the Russian Ambassador at Trump Tower a few months ago in December of 2016. We have got former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, who has admitted that he met with the Russian Ambassador and other Russians in Cleveland at the Republican National Convention and met with managers from Rosneft, the Russianowned oil company. He himself owns shares of a Russian energy company called Gazprom. Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime buddy and political adviser, was working with WikiLeaks, which published documents during the election based on information divulged because of Russian interference and espionage that 
tilted the scales again in favor of Trump in the campaign, and he hosted a series on the Russian propaganda network. Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager for 6 months, was an adviser to Ukrainian oligarchs who got sweetheart business deals from Putin’s associates. He was also a business partner of Russian oligarchs close to Putin. He resigned in August of last year after reports surfaced that suggested that he had received $12.7 million from Ukraine’s proRussia former president Viktor Yanukovych. He was on the payroll for $10 million, it has just come out, in order to promote the Russian perspective and Putin’s propaganda in Washington, D.C., and throughout the United States in order to change the course of U.S. politics. Now, I am sorry to put these out there as a bunch of clues. I wish we had a coherent story to tell. We don’t, because what we need is a comprehensive 9/11style independent investigation to figure out what precisely happened. In America you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Nobody is putting any of these people in jail, but it has come out, despite their best efforts in some cases, that they are up to their necks in the Russian connection. What does that mean for American democracy? What we know is there was a massive independent expenditure in 2006. That is what we call it under our FEC law when you go out and spend money to try to destroy one candidate and help another. There was a massive foreign independent expenditure orchestrated by Vladimir Putin. The question is: Was it, in FEC terms, a coordinated expenditure? That is, did the Trump team actively work with them? As we are saying, there are lots of clues that suggest it is so. I am not willing to say that they were definitely in cahoots with them. I am not willing to say that they were necessarily collaborating the election. But the evidence accumulates every single day that points in that direction. Now every day in Washington, D.C., what we are doing is running around because there is a coverup that has been unfolding. Today, of course, we are dealing with a resolution in the House Judiciary Committee to try to get to the bottom of what Chairman NUNES of the House Intelligence Committee actually did when he ran over to the White House with some information that he had about Trump apparently being picked up incidentally in conversations that were being tapped by the American intelligence community with foreign operatives. Again, it is shadowy because we don’t know the whole thing. But what we do know is that Chairman NUNES went to the White House to tell President Trump or his deputies before he told anybody here in Congress. Now, we have been saying from the beginning we want an independent, objective 9/11style commission—no Democratic politicians, no Republican politicians, and no elected officials. Let’s agree on gifted statesmen and stateswomen who can really get to the bottom of this if we care about the truth. Their answer has been: No, we have got the Intelligence Committee to do it instead. But now what we have got is the Intelligence Committee chair traveling back and forth to the White House, spilling the beans, which undermines everybody’s confidence in the integrity of the investigation that is taking place into the Russian connection and what actually happened in the 2016 election. Mr. Speaker, in the American system of government, elected officials have to have undivided loyalty to the American people. That is why we have got the Emoluments Clause: no presents, no emoluments, no offices, and no titles from foreign governments. That is why we swear an oath to the Constitution of the United States of America. Each one of us who has the great honor and privilege of coming to Washington, D.C., to represent the people swear an oath to our Constitution and to our people. We are not a country, like so many, that are defined by one religion. We are not defined by one race. We are not defined by one ethnicity. We are not defined by one political party. We are not defined by one political ideology. We are defined by one Constitution. That is what unifies us as Americans. We must be constitutional patriots here and insist upon our constitutional values and the rule of law for democracy to be meaningful in the 21st century. There is a new model of tyrannical government traveling all over the world, and all the bullies and despots have found each other. They are in league together. They want government as a moneymaking operation. They want government as a moneymaking operation for private elites in their country, whether it is in Russia or the Philippines or Saudi Arabia. Sad to say, we are starting to see the development of that right here in the United States of America. So we have the opportunity and we have the responsibility to exercise our rights as citizens under the First Amendment and to exercise our privileges as Members of Congress under the speech or debate clause to speak up against the march of tyranny all over the Earth. We have got an obligation to resist the corruption—the same corruption that the people in Russia were marching against on Sunday. We must demand real answers about what took place in our Presidential election in 2016. The intelligence agencies warned us that what happened in 2016 was a dress rehearsal for what is going to happen the next time and the time after that. I want to say something about the geopolitics of this. Think about it for a second: Who has got the strongest economy on Earth? We do, the freest, the original democracy. We have got the strongest economy. Who has got the strongest military? We do. Russia can’t come close. But the way I understand what happened in 2016 was that Vladimir Putin—who is not an honest man, but he is a clever man— decided that this was a moment of opportunity for Russia. He is the former chief of the KGB. Let’s not forget that. He is the guy who said that the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet Union. He is an irredentist imperialist who wants to go back and reconstruct the Russian empire. But what he saw was an opportunity, which is that today the whole world is linked, and it is linked by the internet. He created something that I think of as a Manhattan Project for military conquest and defeat of the liberal democracies in the 21st century. He set about to figure out this question: How can we undermine and subvert the liberal democracies? These are open societies. America is an open society. We pride ourselves on the First Amendment, on freedom of speech, and on free dialogue and discussion. So he said to himself: How can I subvert and undermine that? The answer became very clear: to create—really on the cheap, because compared to military might, this is pennies on the dollar—he was going to create an internet army, in effect, to try to undermine and subvert our democracy with fake news, with propaganda, and with paid trolls to get information out to try to destroy the reputations of opposition politicians and to try to promote the parties that he viewed as ‘‘within his camp.’’ Guess what? It still is going on today. It is still happening. We are not talking about ancient history. We are talking about an ongoing project. That is why I am proud to be a member of the minority caucus here, the Democratic Party caucus, which is insisting that we create an independent, objective, neutral, 9/11style commission to investigate the Russian connection and what happened with the attack on American democracy in 2016. We have got to get to the bottom of it. Twothirds of the American people in public opinion polls say that they support such a commission. There is nobody who would oppose it except for somebody who has got something to hide. But for the rest of us, we have every reason to get to the bottom of this plot to destroy our election in 2016, and we have every reason to defend this great constitutional democracy with everything we have got. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Members are reminded to 
CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT MALICIOUS CYBER ENABLED ACTIVITIES—MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115– 26) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015, is to continue in effect beyond April 1, 2017. Significant malicious cyberenabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
