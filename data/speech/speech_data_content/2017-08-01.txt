Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today I honor His Divine Holiness Hariprasad Swamiji Maharaj, spiritual leader and founder of the Yogi Divine Society—a Hindu spiritual and humanitarian charitable organization—as he makes a historic visit to Yogi Divine Soci-ety members and devotees across North America. The Yogi Divine Society is a global not for profit organization founded in 1974 that en-courages all races, religions, and genders to lead enriched and harmonious lives. With over 500 educational and cultural centers world-wide, the Yogi Divine Society is devoted to working on issues like the environment, youth development, spiritual education, and health care. His Divine Holiness Hariprasad Swamiji Maharaj has dedicated his life to the principle of Atmiyata (Spiritual Affinity with one and all). He became a Sadhu (religious devotee) in 1965 and was made diksha (being appointed saint) by his spiritual educator Guruhari Yogiji Maharaj. His drive for global harmony led him to found the Yogi Divine Society. Through his work, his Holiness strives to promote human-ity, peace, and understanding amongst the people of the world. Every time I visit the volunteers and mem-bers of the Yogi Divine Society, I am reminded of the incredible virtues that the Society pro-motes not only to Americans but to people around the world. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support their work and their devotion to cre-ating a more welcoming and understanding world. I honor His Divine Holiness Hariprasad Swamiji Maharaj, the spiritual leader and founder of the Yogi Divine Society, as he visits the Jain Temple of Metropolitan Chicago on August 12th.

HONORING ROBERT ‘‘IAN’’ MALONEY 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 1, 2017 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight Robert ‘‘Ian’’ Malo-ney, a May 2017 graduate of Georgetown Pre-paratory School and a newly accepted mem-ber of the Brown University class of 2021. Last year, I had the great pleasure of speak-ing at Georgetown Preparatory School about the call to serve and to give back to the com-munity. I accepted the invitation to speak at that school because Ian reached out and asked me to do so. Ian is a remarkable young man whom I have known since his birth. Ian was President of the Black Student Association. He is also a member of the National Honor Soci-ety and a National Hispanic Scholar, and he is passionate about serving others and giving back. He is committed to social justice and drawing attention to the scourge of homeless-ness. Ian asked me to speak at Georgetown Pre-paratory School because he had made a promise to the school’s Headmaster, Mr. Jeff Jones. Mr. Jones was the school’s first Afri-can-American Headmaster and Interim Presi-dent, and a leader who fostered diversity. At the time that Ian requested that I speak, Mr. Jones was awaiting a heart transplant at Ce-dars-Sinai Hospital in my Congressional Dis-trict. Sadly, Mr. Jones would die two months after I spoke. However, several days before he had passed, he called to wish Ian con-tinuing success in his studies and called on him to carry the torch and to continue to serve others. Mr. Speaker, Ian wishes to honor the call and the memory of his Headmaster, Mr. Jeff Jones. Ian is a very special young man, and I wish him success in his academic endeav-ors. I truly believe that he has a very bright fu-ture ahead and that he will continue to give back to his community and make a positive difference in the world. f

IN HONOR OF JOHN CHRISTOPHER L
AMONICA 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 1, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to commemorate the life of Mr. John Christopher LaMonica. Mr. LaMonica’s career in broadcast jour-nalism is a catalogue of the major events of 20th century history. From Central Asia to the Middle East to Southern Africa; from the se-cret nuclear cities of Siberia to New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina; he used facts to tell stories with moral truths. Originally from Rye, New York, Mr. LaMonica attended Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. In 1979, he be-came an Adjunct Fellow at the Center for Stra-tegic and International Studies. He cut his teeth as a consultant for Henry Kissinger and became a newsman with Ted Koppel, working for decades as an investigative producer for ABC News Nightline. In 2006 he took the leg-acy of journalism from that program with him to Discovery, where he produced cutting-edge documentaries with Mr. Koppel on subjects ranging from the history of race relations in America to surviving cancer. Mr. LaMonica continued that work as an executive producer at Al Jazeera America. The sum total of years spent away from his family in Russia and Iran and some of the most dangerous places on earth rewarded Mr. LaMonica with numerous National Emmys, several Dupont-Columbia and Peabody awards, the Overseas Press Club Edward R. Murrow Award, and the Global Health Council Excellence in Media Award. In 1987, he earned the Benton Fellowship in broadcast journalism from the University of Chicago. But what meant the world to Mr. LaMonica was that it can be said of him that he was a great father, the best grandfather, and, quite simply, a good man. In addition to his journalistic endeavors, Mr. LaMonica continuously gave back to our com-munity. His philanthropic efforts included his involvement with the Knights of Columbus, HOPE in Northern Virginia and the Zambia Or-phans of AIDS, and the St. Peter Claver Soci-ety. Mr. LaMonica died peacefully in his bed at home in Virginia on March 13, 2016, after bat-tling cancer for nearly a year. He is survived by his wife, Teresa; her son; their three chil-dren; and four grandchildren, who still miss the man they called ‘‘Papa Jay.’’ Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the life of, and bidding fare-well to Jay LaMonica. May he rest in peace, and his family be comforted. f

HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 1, 2017 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Chris Redman, and to congratulate him for being inducted into the Honorary Rolls of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the ‘‘Blackhorse Regiment.’’ I believe that our na-tion’s men and women in uniform are Amer-ica’s greatest assets. They have made incred-ible sacrifices for our country and deserve our utmost support and respect for their service. Sergeant Redman has dedicated his life to protecting all Americans through his service as a sergeant in the United States Army and as a police officer. He received numerous rec-ognitions while in the Army and has continued to serve the Blackhorse Regiment since his retirement. In addition to his selfless service to our country, Sergeant Redman has also been a great leader and supporter of the Blackhorse Regiment in his community, coordinating re-unions and raising money for scholarship funds. Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude than the one we owe our veterans. They and their families should be commended. On be-half of the 4th Congressional District of Colo-rado, I extend my best wishes and deepest gratitude to Sergeant Redman. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Sergeant Chris Redman for his commitment to family, community, and the United States of America.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MA-RINE CORPORAL LUKE M
CDERMOTT 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 1, 2017 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the service and sacrifice of Marine Corporal Luke McDermott. Corporal McDermott was serving his second deployment in Afghanistan when on June 9, 2010, an improvised explosive device deto-nated underneath his vehicle during a routine security patrol. The damage caused by this explosion cost Corporal McDermott both of his legs, but it did not take away the fighting spirit which enabled him to persevere through the difficult recovery process. It is a true testament to Corporal McDermott’s character that these injuries have not prevented him from pursuing life to its full-est. In addition to actively training and trav-eling with the U.S. National Sled Hockey team, he has continued his service to the global community by participating in a volun-teer trip to study social development in Mo-rocco. Through the generous work of Homes for our Troops, Corporal McDermott will soon be-come a resident of New York’s 21st District, and we are proud to welcome him. Since 2004, the organization has built 236 adapted homes for veterans, and now Homes for our Troops is providing Corporal McDermott with an accessible residence in Clayton, New York. Here, he can live comfortably and pursue his dreams of working toward a law degree. I would like to thank Corporal McDermott for his service to our county and for the sacrifices he has made for our way of life. He is a de-serving recipient of the incredible opportunity that Homes for our Troops provides. f 
RECOGNIZING HOWARD L. CHAMBERS 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 1, 2017 Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize Howard L. Chambers, City Manager for Lakewood, California in my Southern Cali-fornia district who is retiring after over 41 years of public service. Howard is concluding his career as the longest serving city manager with any single city in California, exemplifying his love and dedication towards the City of Lakewood and its people. Howard was born and raised in Lakewood, having attended Lakewood schools and work-ing at the local YMCA and the City of Lake-wood’s recreation program. As his life pro-gressed Howard never strayed too far from his beloved city, attending college at nearby Cali-fornia State University, Long Beach where he received a Bachelor of Science degree. How-ard became Lakewood’s top executive in 1976, after receiving a Master of Arts degree in Planning and Administration from Pepperdine University and serving as Execu-tive Assistant to the Lakewood City Manager. During his tenure with the City of Lakewood, Howard always provided strong leadership and knowledgeable direction for major projects. While his accomplishments are far too numerous to name, I want to highlight the building of the Weingart Senior Center, The Centre at Sycamore Plaza, the S. Mark Taper Foundation Vista Lodge, the West San Gabriel River Parkway Nature Trail, and, most re-cently, the new Pumpkin Playground at San Martin Park. He also oversaw the renovation of the Veterans Memorial Plaza and Douglas jet plane at Del Valle Park. Over the past decades, Howard has worked tirelessly to ensure Lakewood operates on firm financial footing and never outside its fiscal means. During the recent economic downturn, Lakewood was able to maintain funding for all city services and avoid employee layoffs thanks to Howard’s budgetary foresight. Howard has also played an influential role amongst his peers in city management, through his leadership roles in League of Cali-fornia Cities, the California Contract Cities As-sociation, the California Joint Powers Insur-ance Authority, the Gateway Cities Council of Governments, and the International City/Coun-ty Management Association. Howard was re-cently honored by the League of California Cit-ies with the 2017 Wes McClure Award of Dis-tinction for outstanding career service, leader-ship, ethics, expertise and innovation as a city manager. I wish to commend Howard Chambers on his many years of outstanding public service and dedication to the City of Lakewood and its residents. I wish him the very best in retire-ment. f
