TRIBUTE TO MARLENE JOHNSON- ODOM 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 17, 2017 Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend Marlene Johnson- Odom. She served as alderwoman on the City of Milwaukee Common Council for the sixth al-dermanic district for more than 24 years. Ms. Johnson-Odom passed away on January 9, 2017. Marlene Johnson-Odom was a lifelong Mil-waukee resident. She was a product of the public school system and a fellow graduate of North Division High School. Marlene received a Bachelor of Science degree from the Univer-sity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Prior to becoming an elected official, Ms. Johnson-Odom worked for Milwaukee Public Schools and was TV Hostess at Channel 18, a local television station. Ms. Johnson-Odom succeeded her first husband Ben Johnson on the Common Council and was known as a quiet but effective leader. While serving on the Common Council, one of the achievements of which she was most proud was the renaming of 3rd Street to Martin Luther King Drive. Al-ways approachable, Marlene provided out-standing service to her constituents. Ms. Johnson-Odom was always extremely involved in the community and served on nu-merous boards and commissions including: Milwaukee Area Technical College Board, United Way Board of Directors, Black Wom-en’s Network and Pabst Theater Board. Ms. Johnson-Odom leaves behind 3 chil-dren: Jan Johnson Carlyle, Paula Darling and Jay Johnson, 2 grandchildren: Amber Brown and Ellis Johnson, 8 great-grandchildren and a host of other relatives and friends to mourn her passing. She leaves a strong legacy of leadership for her children and grandchildren to model. Mr. Speaker, Marlene was my friend and a Milwaukee and Wisconsin treasure and I val-ued her service to the 4th Congressional Dis-trict. I urge you and my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in a sa-lute to the late Marlene Johnson-Odom.
