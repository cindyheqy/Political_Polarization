Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we watched as Senator JOHN MCCAIN returned to the Capitol after having been diagnosed with cancer and undergoing a serious operation. All of us are praying for his swift and full recovery. In earlier days, as we all know, he faced danger with courage. He is doing the same again right now. When he spoke yesterday from the Senate floor, he talked about a time when legislators, Republicans and Democrats, despite their differences, worked together to make progress, albeit incremental, on major issues through discussion and compromise. He lamented, as do I, the recent tendency to seek total partisan victory or nothing at all, something we see as much in the House as in the Senate. Senator MCCAIN said this: ‘‘We’ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.’’ He concluded in that paragraph: ‘‘. . . we are getting nothing done.’’ Instead, Senator MCCAIN proposed legislators ought to return to regular order. Regular order, for those who aren’t familiar with the daytoday workings of Congress, simply means doing things in the proper way: drafting a bill in committee, holding open hearings, marking up with amendments, reporting it out, and then bringing it to the floor for amendment and debate before voting on it. This process, this regular order of business affords every member an opportunity, regardless of party or district, to have input and help shape the policy. That is the way it should be. The product of such a process, as Senator MCCAINdescribed it, would be ‘‘something that will be imperfect, full of compromises, and not very pleasing to implacable partisans on either side.’’ But he concluded it was one that ‘‘might provide workable solutions to problems Americans are struggling with today.’’ Mr. Speaker, that is how our system is supposed to work. b1015 I started my career in this body in 1981. Shortly thereafter, I joined the Appropriations Committee. I like to tell people that I served on the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, and there were 13 of us. The Democrats were in the majority, and there were eight Democrats and five Republicans. I used to tell people that you could take the 13 of us, throw us up in the air, have us come down in random seats, have a markup, and you would have been hardpressed to identify which party each member represented. Today, lamentably, Mr. Speaker, it would take you about a minute to determine those differences. 
Our Speaker said on October 29, 2015: ‘‘We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.’’ Mr. Speaker, we are about to consider a socalled minibus. The former chairman, my Republican friend, Mr. ROGERS , is seated here in this Chamber with us. He and I both recall a time when we considered one bill at a time. We brought it to the floor, we amended it, we debated it, and we voted on it one bill at a time. That is what Speaker RYAN was referring to when he said: ‘‘We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.’’ Apparently, Mr. Speaker, that has become inconvenient or impossible, but it is not the regular order that we are pursuing. Speaker RYAN went on to say: ‘‘We will not duck the tough issues. We will take them head on.’’ Mr. Speaker, we will adopt a rule that will duck the issue that will preclude full debate, and it deals with President Trump’s proposal to build a wall that many in his administration believe will be ineffective in accomplishing the objective that we all support, and that is keeping our country secure and making sure that those who come into this country are known to us and don’t sneak into the country. But the wall will not work and we will not be able to debate that fully because it will be included in the rule. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that is ducking the issue. It will be deemed passed. We won’t vote on it. We will vote for the rule or against the rule, and the wall and $1.6 billion will be deemed passed. Mr. Speaker, that is not how our system is supposed to work. Neither side ought to let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Neither side can claim credit for all of the best ideas. That is why working together is imperative. That was my experience when I served for 23 years on the Appropriations Committee. That is why regular order is so important. It protects the American people. It protects each Member who is here representing some 700,000 people, give or take. That is why regular order is so important. It facilitates dialogue and debate. It brings out every view and idea and provides the framework for compromise. Compromise is the essence of democracy, and I suggest it is the essence of successful families, whether they be countries or Mom and Dad and kids. They come together and they agree, not because they get everything they want or the other side gets nothing they want, but because both sides compromise. Mr. Speaker, I agree with Senator MCCAIN: we need to return to regular order. Speaker RYAN, as I have said, told us shortly after his elevation that he wants ‘‘the House to work its will.’’ Minibuses don’t allow that, omnibuses don’t allow that, and, frankly, CRs don’t allow that. The Speaker adopted, in principle, an open and transparent process. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, we haven’t always seen that. But there is still an opportunity for the 115th Congress to reflect that vision. That is what Senator MCCAINwas talking about yesterday. He was appealing to the best of us, the American in us, not the partisan in us, not the confrontationalist in us, but the seeker of productive compromise in a democracy. The Congress and our country will be better if we return to regular order. 
AFGHANISTAN IS THE GRAVEYARD OF EMPIRES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. JONES ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, on July 18, I wrote to President Trump about my concern about the fact that he and Secretary of Defense Mattis are discussing how many more American troops must be sent to Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, you being a marine, you know that I represent Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. We have been there 16 years. Nothing has changed. In fact, it has gotten worse. I would like to read just a few sentences from my letter. Again, this was delivered to the White House on July 18. I am going to read just sentences very quickly. ‘‘Disappointed because after 16 years in Afghanistan, Congress deserves another vote on this conflict. Disappointed because almost $1 trillion of taxpayers’ money has been spent with no direct goal or strategy. And most importantly, I am disappointed because we continue to lose American lives. ‘‘Sir, I am writing today because you seem to have had a change of heart on this issue.’’ I gave four examples of positions he has taken and tweets that he has sent out. I am just going to read two of them, Mr. Speaker. ‘‘In August of 2011, you agreed with Ron Paul and said the U.S. was ‘wasting lives and money in Iraq and Afghanistan.’’’ Another tweet: ‘‘The next year, you said on Twitter, ‘Do not allow our very stupid leaders to sign a deal that keeps us in Afghanistan through 2024—with all costs by USA . . . ’’’ And the last I would like to read: ‘‘You also tweeted that year, ‘Let’s get out of Afghanistan. Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA.’’’ I further stated: ‘‘Mr. President, I agree with those remarks, and so does the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, my friend and unofficial adviser, General Chuck Krulak. As he said in a recent email to me, ‘No one has ever conquered Afghanistan . . . and many have tried. We will join the list of nations that have tried and failed.’’’ I do not understand why this Congress and the leadership of this House will not let us have another debate. I put a bill in with JOHN GARAMENDI , H.R. 1666, for the only reason that, after 16 years, we have not debated the future of Afghanistan. A report was out last night that the Russians are sending sophisticated weapons to the Taliban in Afghanistan, who will be fighting and killing Americans. I continue to call on the House leadership to please let us meet our constitutional responsibility and debate. I have said, with H.R. 1666, that JOHN GARAMENDI and I have put in, join us in forcing a debate on the House and then vote against us, but give us a debate. I further said to the President: ‘‘Once you come to a consensus’’—and this is raising the troop levels—‘‘I suggest you publicly go before the American people and U.S. military to explain the benchmarks you choose for Afghanistan.’’ Why are we going to send more Americans to fight and die in Afghanistan? And also give the American people an idea of what we are trying to achieve. For 16 years, there are very few of the marines in my district who have been there three, four, and five times, and I will say to them, ‘‘What have we accomplished?’’ and they will say back to me, ‘‘Very little. Very little.’’ Yet we sit here in Congress and we fund billions of dollars. We will have a vote in 2 days to spend billions of dollars on Afghanistan, and there is very little accountability. This is not what this House needs to be doing, especially when we are sending our young men and women to give their life for this country. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  this letter to President Trump and ask President Trump to please stay strong in his beliefs and that it is a waste of money, life, and time to be in Afghanistan. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, July 18, 2017. President DONALD J. T RUMP , The White House, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT : Many of us in the U.S. House of Representatives believe we have been denied our sacred duty to debate and declare war. You could say that I am disappointed by this. Disappointed because after 16 years in Afghanistan, Congress deserves another vote on this conflict. Disappointed because almost $1 trillion of taxpayers’ money has been spent with no direct goal or strategy. And most importantly, I am disappointed because we continue to lose American lives. Sir, I am writing today because you seem to have had a change of heart on this issue: 1. In August of 2011, you agreed with Ron Paul and said the U.S. was ‘‘wasting lives and money in Iraq and Afghanistan.’’ 2. In 2012, you referred to Afghanistan as a ‘‘complete waste,’’ and declared it was ‘‘time to come home.’’ 3. The next year, you said on Twitter, ‘‘Do not allow our very stupid leaders to sign a deal that keeps us in Afghanistan through 2024—with all costs by U.S.A. . . .’’ 4. You also tweeted that year, ‘‘Let’s get out of Afghanistan. Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA.’’ 
Mr. President, I agree with those remarks, and so does the 31st Commandant of Marines Corps, my friend,. and unofficial advisor, General Chuck Krulak. As he said in a recent email to me, ‘‘NO ONE has ever conquered Afghanistan . . . and many have tried. We will join the list of Nations that have tried and failed.’’ Mr. President, that is why I am asking you to review this thinking before approving any troop level increases from General Mattis. I believe you would see great benefit and wisdom in asking Congress to debate and vote on troop level increases as well. You would then have the American people and their elected officials share a decision to send more of our sons and daughters into harm’s way. Once you come to a consensus, I suggest you publicly go before the American people and U.S. military to explain the benchmarks you choose for Afghanistan. Previous administrations have not been able to clarify those endpoints, which is unfair to taxpayers and our troops. In the end, we all share this responsibility, and it is time that not only Congress but also the American people have a say. Sixteen years is enough! Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires! We do not want a tombstone to read ‘‘United States of America.’’ Respectfully, WALTER B. J ONES , Member of Congress. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I close by showing the face of a little girl who is standing there with her mother and wondering why her daddy is in a flag draped coffin, and I could not explain to her. He died in Afghanistan. I don’t know why he is dead in a flagdraped coffin. God bless our men and women in uniform, and God bless America. 
RENEGOTIATION OF TRADE AGREEMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Trump administration released its NAFTA renegotiating objectives, which laid out its plan for how to fix that bad trade deal for America’s workers, but it lacks specifics. Yes, America needs a better deal, better jobs, better wages, for a better future for our people and the people of our continent. As renegotiations begin in August, let us remember the devil is in the details. The President’s rhetoric alone is not enough. Action is what creates jobs. Nearly 30 years ago, NAFTA was sold as the epitome of a modern trade agreement. Its supporters promised U.S. job growth. They guaranteed trade balances and even surpluses. They said there would be increased economic trade flexibility for North American industries and new buyers of American goods. But guess what. Those promises didn’t materialize. Instead, U.S. workers faced enormous job loss, declining wages, sublevel wage competition from desperate millions in Mexico, whose workers have no rights. The recent tragedy in San Antonio with all of those desperate workers in that truck is the tip of an iceberg of labor exploitation on this continent that was caused by NAFTA, enhanced by NAFTA. It is so ugly. The cold, critical measure of the job hemorrhaging truth this country has passed since NAFTA’s passage is our trade balance. That is how many more products and services our country exports rather than imports from offshore sweatshops. That translates into jobs. Since the inception of NAFTA, our trade deficit has ballooned to unprecedented levels. This chart basically goes through what has been happening recently. Each month and each year, we go deeper and deeper into trade deficit, not just with Mexico, but a number of other countries. But there has not been a single year of trade balance with Mexico since NAFTA’s passage, just more job dissolution and job loss. Just in May, the United States experienced an overall $46 billion trade deficit with the world, of which NAFTA is a part. But since NAFTA’s passage— get this—our country has accumulated nearly $2 trillion net negative balance with Mexico and Canada, and that translates into lost jobs here at home, and the American people know it. This import deficit supports millions of jobs abroad, not U.S. workers. It means less money left in the wallets of hardworking Americans as consumer dollars feed the greed of rapacious corporate interests that feed on desperate workers. Look at NAFTA’s job numbers. Between 1997 and 2010, our country bled over 696,000 manufacturing jobs to Mexico alone. You would recognize the names of the firms. It is an alphabet soup of companies: AlliedSignal, Lucent Technologies, Mr. Coffee, Rockwell Automation, UTC Aerospace Systems, Weyerhaeuser, and so many more. b1030 Unfortunately, the Midwest has suffered the most from this job hemorrhage. For Ohio, the trade deficit with Mexico alone resulted in tens of thousands of lost jobs. Ohio workers have had their net incomes go down by $7,000 per family since NAFTA’s passage. Neighboring Michigan lost over 300,000 jobs since 2000 alone to Mexico. There is little doubt the original NAFTA agreement failed to create a modern opportunity for America’s workers. It undercut them. Today, the Trump administration has a chance to change this. President Trump campaigned and promised to build highquality jobs and bring them back to the United States. How can a renegotiated NAFTA do this? It must include the most modern and enforceable continental labor agreements to yield rising standards of living so wages and job training across borders are equalized. If NAFTA were working, more good U.S. jobs could be created, outnumbering job losses. Mr. Trump promised a good deal for Americans as a candidate. Now he has to deliver on that promise. The old expression, ‘‘Don’t tell me what they say, show me what they do,’’ will be the true test of this administration’s renegotiation of NAFTA. The President must take bold action in renegotiating NAFTA, and it must resolve in reversing these negative balances and making them positive. He must stand up for America’s workers, for their jobs, not just for global corporate interests, whose shareholders have been making a fortune off the backs of desperate labor. Making America Great Again was more than a slogan to the people in Ohio and the greater Midwest, looking to shake up what was called the swamp. We need a better deal for America, better jobs, better wages for a better future, and we can start by renegotiating NAFTA. f 
HONORING HENRY O. LINEBERGER, JR. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the life of Dr. Henry O. Lineberger, Jr. Henry was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on January 5, 1927. He graduated from Broughton High School in 1944, as president of his senior class. From there, he went on to the U.S. Naval Academy, where he served as part of the Medical Corps during World War II. Mr. Speaker, after the war, Henry enrolled at Duke University, where he met his wife, Betty Rushing. After they were married in 1950, they moved to Chapel Hill, where Henry studied at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry as part of that dentistry school’s inaugural class. Following school, Henry and Betty moved to Raleigh in 1954, where he opened his first dental practice. Mr. Speaker, Henry Lineberger practiced dentistry in Raleigh for more than 50 years, and during that time, he served on numerous dental boards, including the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners, and he was known by his patients as being available day or night. Henry was an active member of the Edenton Street United Methodist Church, where he enjoyed teaching Sunday school and gathering for fellowship. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Henry’s Christian faith was the foundation of his life, and he spent a number of years immersed in Bible study. Henry shared his love for Duke football and basketball with his children and his grandchildren. His grandchildren, by the way, Mr. Speaker, like to call Dr. Lineberger ‘‘Pinky.’’ But despite his best efforts to turn them into Duke fans, they all attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, Henry Lineberger passed away on July 11. He 
is remembered by his family as a caring husband, father, and grandfather, and he will be deeply missed by his community that he helped build. 
WE CAN PIVOT TOWARDS BIPARTISAN ACTION CONSISTENT WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this is really an amazing time on Capitol Hill. The Republican internal battles and inability to deliver a coherent, effective alternative to fulfill all their contradictory campaign promises on healthcare has done more than just expose their political and policy dysfunction. They are obviously flirting with a serious political backlash. They have managed to make the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, with all of its shortcomings, popular with the majority of the American public for the first time ever, including so many small business people. They made the public more aware and concerned about Medicaid, that has expanded and made such a difference in Kentucky, in Oregon, in States all across the country, providing care for people otherwise who had not had it. They have managed to accelerate the move towards single payer by more than a decade: Medicare for all, Medicaid for more. I don’t know the exact form, but we are going to be moving in that direction, and the Republicans have helped raise the awareness and accelerate that progress, but I hope that we are going to be able to take steps to make progress sooner. In the meantime, I suspect that the Affordable Care Act, the core reforms and structure, are going to, in fact, stay in place. This is because there aren’t the votes in the Senate to do anything more; and frankly, it doesn’t look like there are votes to do much in the House, the socalled skinny bill notwithstanding. But I hope that we can pivot towards modest, bipartisan actions that are consistent with the Affordable Care Act, but don’t depend on it. We have a number of bipartisan initiatives that are teed up and ready to go. I have worked for years with Congresswoman DIANE BLACK from Tennessee, on valuebased insurance design. This bipartisan legislation would reward value over volume and make insurance much more effective in paying for what we need. I have an initiative with Congressman JASON SMITH and with Senator TODD YOUNG dealing with kidney health. This would enable providers to leverage those weekly sessions for dialysis for some of our most vulnerable Americans in terms of their health. Dialysis costs 1 percent of the entire Federal budget. We should be able to use that time and attention to deliver wraparound services, more care and less strain on people with multiple health needs. We ought to be able to act on empowering our citizens and their families to know what they are facing at end of life. I have bipartisan legislation with my friend and colleague, Congressman ROEfrom Tennessee, along those lines. Congress ought to accept the challenge from President Trump to deal meaningfully with prescription drug costs. There is support on both sides of the aisle. We can save billions of dollars for Americans and the taxpayers, and we can provide better care. There are mental health initiatives with our friend TIMMURPHY . Bipartisan progress was made in the last Congress, but there is much more that needs to be done. In fact, we can work together to overcome the opposition of Chairman SESSIONS and the Rules Committee denying the House the right to vote on extending our veterans access bill to allow consultation about medical marijuana. No one can listen to the heartbreaking stories of veterans and their families about what medical marijuana has done to sufferers of PTSD, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury. It is legal in 29 states, but the Rules Committee denied the right of the House to vote on extending that service to our veterans and their doctors, despite the horrible record that the VA has in preventing veteran suicide, and where the opioid addiction rate for the VA is twice the general population. These are things we can do tomorrow, not dealing with denying millions of people care through the Affordable Care Act and the various permutations that are spinning around now. Do our job, work together, follow regular order, deal with bipartisan initiatives that will benefit the American people, save the taxpayer money, and improve the health of all Americans. 
TRIBUTE TO SARAH MEECE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my longtime adviser and expert caseworker, Sarah Meece, upon her much deserved retirement after dedicating more than 40 years of service by my side. When I reflect upon Sarah’s career, I stand in awe of her loyalty, her unwavering patience, her persistent advocacy, and undying compassion for those in need. As Congressman, I have the duty and the privilege of assisting the people of southern and eastern Kentucky as they grapple with Federal agencies. At the heart of those cases has stood Sarah Meece providing expert advice and staunch support for individuals in our region who need help with Social Security, disability, and retirement claims, among many other issues. In fact, over the last 36 years, Sarah has worked on approximately 150,000 cases, representing an unmatched record of assistance for more than 4,000 individuals each year. Sarah has gained so much notoriety in her field that staff from other congressional offices, and officials even from the administration, contact her for guidance in case work. And in this line of work, there are very few, if any, medals or certificates of honor to honor those worthy of recognition like Sarah; nonetheless, her drive and consistency has never failed. Day in and day out, Sarah has answered countless phone calls, set up personal meetings, listened to some of the most heartbreaking stories from families who were denied benefits on multiple occasions, those in desperate need of recouping benefits, others who lost hope in a mountain of Federal paperwork. Sarah’s reward has been the simple words of appreciation from the thousands upon thousands of individuals who she has helped over the years. In my eyes, she deserves so much more. While I wish Sarah the best in her years of retirement, the absence of her daily presence in the office will be insurmountable. When I was elected Commonwealth’s Attorney for Pulaski and Rockcastle Counties in 1969, Sarah Meece was there. When I was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor in 1979, Sarah Meece was there. When I was elected to Congress in 1980, Sarah Meece was there. In fact, she has been with me every day since, even volunteering her personal time for campaign work along the way, ensuring we both could continue serving the public for another 2 years. During her tenure, Sarah welcomed U.S. Presidents and Vice Presidents to our region, befriended eight Kentucky Governors and their staffs, and assisted hundreds of local leaders across southern and eastern Kentucky as they navigated through Federal issues. However, it is the people living in the hills and hollers of Kentucky’s Fifth Congressional District who have driven her passionfilled public service. With every call and every personal visit, Sarah offered an encouraging word of hope to our constituents. Very few people can find the silver lining in every cloud like Sarah does, or bring a smile and a laugh to a broken heart. Her comical candor and illustrative storytelling have been a bright spot in everyone’s day. I am forever grateful to have such a great friend and loyal adviser over these last 4 decades. Sarah’s life’s work has given countless families hope in their darkest hour and comforted them through lengthy and complex Federal issues. Simply put, Sarah is irreplaceable, both her institutional knowledge of Federal casework and her kind, enduring spirit. Mr. Speaker, if every congressional office and Federal agency had a Sarah Meece, our Nation would operate much 
better. She has been the jewel of my congressional operations and the truest friend to the people of southern and eastern Kentucky. My wife, Cynthia, and I wish Sarah and her husband, Bud, many joyful and restful years of retirement with their children and grandchildren. 
b1045 OUR MILITARY DESERVES BETTER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, when our bravest men and women raise their hand and volunteered to defend our Nation, they defend all of her people, rich and poor, young and old, Democrat and Republican, gay and straight, Americans of all races, religions, ethnicities, beliefs, gender identities. Our soldiers do not discriminate. They do not offer to pay the ultimate sacrifice for some Americans and not for others. Their government owes them that same courtesy, that same decency in return. Instead, this morning, our President has told thousands of American soldiers that they will fight for us, but we will not fight for them; that their deeply personal medical decisions are somehow the public’s business; that although they are willing to sacrifice their lives to protect our freedom, we will not offer them the most basic freedom in return. Today, the President of the United States looked American soldiers in the eye and dared to question their patriotism, their courage. He doubted their commitment to their brothers and sisters in uniform. He said that our military couldn’t or wouldn’t stand for all of us. To the thousands of brave transgender men and women serving today in uniform, please know that a grateful Nation does not take your service, your patriotism for granted. You deserve better from your President. You deserve better from your government. You deserve better from your country. 
THE SECRET SERBIAN RESCUE MISSION OF WORLD WAR II The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, during the long, dark, lamentable days of World War II, Serbians and Americans forged a bond in a secret mission that remained classified for almost 60 years. What was known as Operation Halyard became the largest rescue operation of American airmen in history. It would not have been possible without the courage of the Serbian people. In 1944, as the Allies advanced into fortress Europe, American bombers based in southern Italy began to strike Germany’s vital oil supplies in Romania. The 15th Air Force launched nearly 20,000 sorties into Eastern Europe to degrade Hitler’s war machine. To do this, they had to fly over Nazioccupied Yugoslavia. As many as 1,500 pilots and airmen were shot down during these dangerous flights. Serbians who had been resisting German forces since 1941 risked their own lives to rescue American aircrews and hide them from patrolling Nazis. One of them was Serbian George Dudich, the father of Elaine Dudich, my chief of staff when I was a judge in Texas. For months, George Dudich and the other Serbians aided downed Americans, caring for and protecting the pilots, and then smuggling the aircrews back to Allied lines. By August 1944, hundreds of other downed aircrews were being sheltered by the Serbian guerillas. The OSS, the predecessor to the CIA, devised a plan to evacuate the Allied pilots in a daring mission coordinated with the Serbian resistance. On August 10, unarmed American C– 47s flew numerous sorties deep into enemy territory and landed at an improvised airfield built and protected by local Serbians near the village of Pranjani. By the 18th, more than 500 Allied airmen had been secretly rescued and flown back to Italy. Here on this poster you see the Serbian resistance, along with American aircrews that had been downed, moving them to hiding from the Nazis that were patrolling the areas. For over 60 years, this bold, unbelievable secret operation was kept classified. Our alliance with Serbia and the Serbian people goes back even further to the First World War. One hundred years ago, Serbia stood up to the aggression from the larger AustrianHungarian empire. We should admire such defiance against overwhelming odds. Serbia’s stand against tyranny also set events in motion that would lead the U.S. to take up the cause of freedom in Europe in World War I. That common devotion to liberty and the spirit of the Halyard mission still lives today with the close ties between the United States and Serbia. As was the case in both World Wars, Serbia and the United States still face shared threats. We work together now to preserve each others’ security. Serbian soldiers serve along with U.S. forces in fighting terrorism in Afghanistan, and Serbia is a partner in keeping terrorism from spreading in Serbia and in Europe. However, Russian propaganda efforts in the country are particularly strong and antiWestern. We must be vigilant to thwart the Kremlin’s efforts to poison our relationship with Serbia. Fortunately, Serbia’s integration into the West has continued to move in spite of Russian disinformation. In 2006, Serbia joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace and, in 2015, signed an Individual Partnership Action Plan with the alliance to strengthen cooperation. Serbia has no stronger supporter for increased integration with the EuroAtlantic community than the United States. So for more than 100 years, we have been friends with the Serbian people. And as cochair of the Serbian Caucus, along with the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER ), I want to welcome Serbian Ambassador Matkovic and his staff to the House Chamber today. With our shared events in Operation Halyard, our combined history, and our fight for freedom, the American people are forever grateful for those Serbs who came to America’s rescue during those bleak days of World War II. And that is just the way it is. 
HONORING THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1927, which is on the floor this afternoon, the African American Civil Rights Network Act. This is to honor the sad, yet heroic struggle for civil rights in America, a struggle for those who participated in the civil rights movement, a struggle for people that were, in fact, soldiers in a war for justice and democracy. We appropriately and regularly honor the soldiers who wore uniforms and went to Europe and Asia to defend our country, and we appropriately and properly give them benefits that they deserve for what they did to protect democracy and justice. But what we forget is those citizens in America who had to fight their own government and their own country for those same rights of justice and democracy. Enslaved for over 250 years, and then treated in a netherworld of segregation for 100 years, and then slowly creeping in after Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act of the sixties and to this day, those who fought for civil rights deserve to be recognized as soldiers for justice and democracy, and this bill will honor their work with the Civil Rights Network Act in our country. They used protests to gain public attention and, eventually, to spur judicial and legislative action. It goes all the way back to W.E.B. DuBois and others who fought when they weren’t so popular and on television. H.R. 1927 would establish a Civil Rights Network to commemorate and honor the history of the civil rights movement. And I want to encourage that the proposed sites include the Memphis Heritage Trail, which has applied for funding as part of that historical network. It was in Memphis, unfortunately, in April of 1968, where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was slain. Dr. King gave his last speech in Memphis the night before at the Mason Temple, the ‘‘I Have 
Been to the Mountaintop’’ speech. And it was in Memphis where he started his last march about a week earlier, marching from the historic Clayborn Temple with the AFSCME workers— the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees— who were garbage workers not recognized as a union and not recognized as men. ‘‘I am a man.’’ Dr. King came to Memphis as part of his fight for justice and freedom. The Clayborn Temple has risen from the ashes and is being renewed in Memphis as a place for events, worship, concerts, and protests. The National Civil Rights Museum has risen at the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. King was slain; the National Civil Rights Museum, which is outstanding and, next year, will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the assassination. Our own JOHNLEWIS will be there. H.R. 1927 would help to memorialize these events and these places across the United States and others, from North Carolina, where the sitins started, and Nashville, to the voting rights march in Selma, the atrocities in Birmingham, and Rosa Parks and the bus boycott in Montgomery. Julian Bond, our own JOHN LEWIS, Rosa Parks, Viola Liuzzo, Ida B. Wells, Michael Schwerner, James Cheney, Andrew Goodman, Joseph Lowery, Roy Wilkins, and others will be recognized. I look forward to voting for H.R. 1927 and saying that it more appropriately represents and remembers heroes, fighters for justice, democracy and freedom; not recognized as such, but, in fact, such. 
SUPPORT FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA, IRAN, AND NORTH KOREA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support of the Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act. These countries actively undermine U.S. national security and threaten the safety and freedoms we enjoy in the United States. Yesterday, Congress acted swiftly, voting 419–3 to defend the interests of the American people. I commend the leadership of House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman ROYCE and Majority Leader MCCARTHY for moving forward strong, meaningful legislation targeting the regimes carrying out brutal human rights violations against vulnerable peoples across the globe and threatening our national security. The Obama administration, time and again, failed to hold these regimes accountable, and the outcomes of that inaction have had lasting ramifications on global stability and security. U.S. officials are warning that North Korea will soon be able to launch a nuclearcapable intercontinental ballistic missile. And, to be clear, North Korea will soon have the capacity to kill American citizens on American soil. These are alarming developments and the United States must act aggressively to strengthen our own missile defense and immediately restrict North Korea’s access to cash. Murderous, tyrannical regimes have no place in the world, and I am confident that these bills will hold corrupt dictators accountable and advance justice for some of the world’s most repressed populations. f 
AN IMPRESSIVE MILESTONE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the Elk River Municipal Utilities Commission’s recent 70th anniversary. The Elk River Municipal Utilities Commission was created or established in 1915, when a private citizen started Elk River Power and Light. The business was eventually purchased by the village of Elk River and operated by the city council. Later on, when their responsibilities expanded to include water, the council created the Elk River Municipal Utilities Commission. Throughout the years, this organization has not only seen their responsibilities expand, but their jurisdiction expand as well. In fact, today, the commission covers Otsego, Dayton, and Big Lake, in addition to the Elk River area, providing services to more than 11,000 Minnesota customers. Thank you to everyone that makes the Elk River Municipal Utilities work, and congratulations on 70 years of great service to our communities. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 160th anniversary of the AnokaChamplin Fire Department. Since 1857, this fire department has been dedicated to protecting lives and property in our communities. To give a little perspective on the history of the organization, the Anoka Champlin Fire Department has been serving the great State of Minnesota since it was still a territory and before the Civil War. b1100 Due to their hard work and often lifesaving efforts, Anoka and Champlin have been allowed to grow into thriving communities. I want to thank the cities of Anoka and Champlin for continuing to support this important organization. Thank you for your service and commitment to our communities and their citizens. Congratulations on your anniversary and upcoming celebration. It is well deserved. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two men from my State whose quick thinking saved the life of another earlier this year. Dr. Bob Schwegler and Dr. Tom Cress were both golfing with Steve Blattner at the Albany Golf Course when Steve began to suffer a cardiac event. Instead of panicking, both doctors successfully performed lifesaving measures on Steve, and with the assistance of the Albany Fire Department, their efforts were successful in saving Steve’s life. As a result of their heroic actions, Dr. Schwegler and Dr. Cress were recently presented with lifesaving awards by Stearns County Sheriff Don Gudmundson and Lieutenant Vic Weiss at the Stearns County Board of Commissioners meeting. Thank you, Bob Schwegler, Tom Cress, and the Albany Fire Department, for your heroic actions. We appreciate your service. A PERFECT SCORE  
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a student in my district for an incredible academic achievement. Tyler Wilson of Andover, Minnesota, received a perfect score on his ACT this year, making him, no doubt, a valuable candidate for most colleges and universities across this country. To give an idea on how extraordinary that achievement is, only 0.1 percent of all individuals who take the ACT receive a perfect score. Tyler is going into his senior year at Andover High School. He hopes to attend either Drake University or the University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities, with the goal of pursuing a career as a pharmacist. We wish Tyler the best of luck on his senior year in high school, and we are excited to see what this scholar will accomplish in the future. Congratulations again, Tyler. We are all so proud of you. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL COUNCIL ON INDEPENDENT LIVING ON 35 YEARS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the National Council on Independent Living for celebrating its 35th anniversary this year. Their persistent advocacy has had a tremendous impact on the disability community and has not gone unnoticed. Mr. Speaker, as you may know, before I was elected to serve in Congress, I worked for many years as a therapist, a rehab services manager, and worked in the community with individuals living with intellectual disabilities and as a licensed nursing home administrator. Working with individuals facing life changing diseases and disabilities has been one of the greatest joys of my life, after my wife and children and two grandsons. There is something extraordinary about supporting an individual as they set out on challenging journeys toward rehabilitation and autonomy. 
My passion for improving the quality of care for my patients and helping them achieve independence is what brought me here to Congress. Last year, I was proud to turn my experience into advocacy by guiding the Special Needs Trust Fairness Act through the legislative process. This commonsense bill empowered those living with disabilities to set up their own special needs trusts, an action which was barred by previous law. After receiving overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, language from the bill was included in the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016. Mr. Speaker, safeguarding the rights of Americans living with disabilities is a cause I am honored to fight for, and I look forward to continuing my efforts. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize a member of the medical community whom we recently lost. Today, I honor the life and memory of Dr. Howard Kirtland, who passed away last week after years of selfless service to his community and employees through his practice, Venango Hematology and Oncology, as well as the Kirtland Cancer Foundation. Dr. Kirtland was wellknown for his kindness and generosity throughout the community. Those closest to him will be deeply impacted by the loss of a man who was loved for his mentorship, selflessness, and incredible work ethic. Dr. Kirtland founded the Kirtland Cancer Foundation with his personal resources to financially assist cancer patients and their families, as well as providing scholarship money to students affected by the disease. Dr. Kirtland was born in San Antonio, Texas, and raised in Poughkeepsie, New York. During his residency at the University of Virginia, he left school to enlist in the Army. He served in Vietnam before moving to Franklin, Pennsylvania, in the Pennsylvania Fifth Congressional District, to start his practice. On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, I recognize and honor Dr. Kirtland for his incredible life of service to those around him. He will be greatly missed. 
BORDER SECURITY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, as an FBI agent, my job was to keep the American people safe from all enemies, both foreign and domestic. On the national security front, those components include a sound counterterrorism strategy, a sound counterintelligence strategy, a sound cybersecurity strategy, a sound foreign policy, and a sound border security strategy. Before us today, Mr. Speaker, is the issue of border security, an issue that, quite frankly, has been largely ignored over the past several decades by both parties. As a result, our national security remains compromised at a point in time where we live in a more dangerous world now than we ever have. When you combine the fact that our enemies are now both more sophisticated and better funded, coupled with our border security apparatus which is underfunded, outdated, and compromised, this is a recipe for disaster for our Nation. The time is now to act on securing our border: north, south, east, and west—all of its components in all of our geographic regions. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I have spent time on the border with our brave women and men on the front lines, working with CPB officers and Border Patrol agents. I have spent time both on the ocean and in the sky with brave women and men in our Coast Guard. Mr. Speaker, they are pleading for our help, and shame on us if we do not deliver for them. Their requests are simple: increase their manpower to provide them with a sufficient number of agents to interdict not just drugs and guns from cartels, but also criminals and terrorists who seek to do us harm; invest in the technology that they need to do their jobs, to include drones and aerial surveillance, infrared technology, heat sensors, motion detectors both above and below the ground, and an array of 21st century, hightech options that serve as force multipliers along the border. They need physical barriers in various forms along various stretches of the border in order to slow down the cartels and allow for sufficient response time for the agents to interdict. Moreover, we must invest heavily in a robust human intelligence program, giving our agents the resources they need to recruit human sources on the other side of the border to provide our agents with the advance notice of both the sources and the methods of criminal conspiracies that are forming along the border. In addition, we must bolster the Office of Inspector General to crack down on border corruption through the use of drug testing, financial screening, and polygraph examinations. Mr. Speaker, the concept of border security is a multipronged challenge that requires action on all fronts, not just one or two, and I urge my friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Please do not politicize this issue. Securing operational control of our border is a national security emergency. My former law enforcement colleagues who are putting their life on the line every day while protecting our borders are asking for our help. Let us not let them down. 
THE TAYLOR FORCE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CURBELO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1164, the Taylor Force Act. This legislation conditions financial assistance from the United States on the Palestinian Authority’s termination of support for terror committed by individuals under its jurisdictional control. In order for the Palestinian Authority to receive aid, it would also be required to condemn acts of terror and cease providing payments to those who have committed such acts. The bill is named after Taylor Force, a former U.S. Army officer who was stabbed to death during a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv. This legislation is a commonsense solution that we must address. The Palestinian Authority, under the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, has continued to support efforts that undermine attempts at peace between the Palestinians and our great ally Israel. The blatant encouragement of terrorist activity by the Palestinian Authority must end. Why should we be rewarding this kind of behavior? The Palestinian Authority perpetuates terrorism by paying salaries to terrorists who are in prison. To make matters worse, those salaries increase the longer they are in jail, thus encouraging these terrorists to commit more violent acts. This is unacceptable. The United States must do something to end this conduct because the reality is it is costing innocent lives. I believe the goals of H.R. 1164, the Taylor Force Act, are a step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for its consideration and passage in the House. 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw muchneeded attention to our Nation’s rental affordability crisis, from rural America to the suburbs, to the big cities, this problem grows in severity each day, limiting Americans’ abilities to provide quality food, medical care, and safety for their families. My home State of Florida has been particularly hardhit, ranking third among States with the greatest number of severely costburdened renters. In my district, the Florida Keys continue to face an affordable housing crisis that has made it difficult for the workers and entrepreneurs of its ever growing economy. That is why, earlier this year, I attended the opening of the firstever affordable housing project for lowincome seniors outside of Key West. I have also been working to ensure Naval Air Station Key West, which currently has 166 units on base that have sat vacant for several years, is put to better use. While the process is slow, I am grateful for the Navy’s assistance as we work to explore the possibility of opening these units for more affordable housing in the Keys. 
Mr. Speaker, finding solutions to making housing more affordable for our constituents, especially the most vulnerable, is a priority of mine here in Congress. I am proud to stand with Mr. TIBERI of Ohio and over 70 bipartisan Members to support his efforts to reform and strengthen lowincome housing tax credits. It is time for Congress to work towards responsible solutions and make the rental affordability crisis a priority. 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the passage of sanctions against the Iranian, Russian, and North Korean regimes. This package of sanctions sends a strong message to these regimes that the United States will not tolerate their rogue actions. These sanctions will hold accountable those involved in the Iranian regime’s ballistic missile program, those who attempt to destabilize the region and threaten Israel, as well as those responsible for Iran’s ongoing human rights abuses. The legislation also sets us on a path to deter conventional Iranian activities in the region and imposes sanctions on any individual that contributes to Iran’s ballistic missiles or to terrorism. The sanctions against North Korea will respond to its increasingly hostile threats against the United States and our allies in Asia. By increasing the President’s authority to impose sanctions on persons in violation of United National Security Council resolutions regarding North Korea, we are ensuring action can be taken swiftly when necessary. Last, but certainly not least, we have strengthened sanctions against Russia in response to cyber attacks and interference in Ukraine. Specifically, we are increasing sanctions on human rights abusers, those who supply weapons to the Assad regime in Syria, and those conducting cyber activity on behalf of the Russian Government. Given the seriousness of Russia’s aggression, we are strengthening the existing sanctions contained in executive orders on Russia and mandating a congressional review if any sanctions are relaxed, suspended, or terminated. I strongly encourage the President to sign this bill into law and will continue to impress upon all of my colleagues the need to not treat Russia lightly. These threats posed to our national security by Iran, Russia, and North Korea cannot be understated. With passage of this sanctions package, Congress is doing its job to ensure they will be held accountable. 
SALUTING THE FIREFIGHTERS AND AGENCIES OF CAL FIRE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by saluting the more than 5,000 firefighters from 40 cooperating agencies that assembled under the coordination of CAL FIRE to battle the Detwiler fire that threatened Yosemite Valley and its gateway communities. I spent Saturday at the command centers in Mariposa and Merced Counties, and what I said is what I have seen time and again at so many fires we are having these days in the Sierras: cool, calm professionalism; selflessness; and devotion to duty. b1115 CAL FIRE is an agency that works. I want particularly to salute and thank Nancy Koerperich, CAL FIRE’s unit fire chief for Madera, Merced, and Mariposa. She and her operation literally saved several towns, including Mariposa and Coulterville, from annihilation last week. Sheriff Doug Binnewies of Mariposa County is rightly being hailed for his courage and leadership in directing the orderly evacuation of the town of Mariposa as the fire bore down upon it. You can literally see how the fire burned right up to the town’s edge. I can’t tell you how many homes I saw where firefighters stopped it literally within a few feet of their front doors. CAL FIRE Battalion Chief Jeremy Rahn told me that the difference between saving and losing so many homes was defensible space. CAL FIRE has produced a superb phone app to assist homeowners in preparing their homes so that if, God forbid, the need arises, firefighters will be able to defend them. It also provides fire alerts, and anyone in the mountain community should have it. It is free for downloading at your phone’s app store. I cannot say enough about the firefighters who have been working in tripledigit heat on 24hour shifts to battle the flames or the air crews that dropped a staggering 500,000 gallons of fire retardant in a single day at the height of the conflagration. Their effectiveness can be seen by red borders of fire retardant that separate the blackened ground of the fire on one side from the landscape they saved on the other. They not only saved these communities and hundreds of homes, they also stopped the fire within just a few miles of the Stanislaus National Forest, a forest that is dying because of Federal environmental restrictions on forest management. The firefighters warned that, if the fire had reached these vast stands of dead trees, the fire would have exploded with atomic force. And that is the fine point of the matter. I spoke with Mariposa County Supervisor Marshall Long and many of the other firefighters at the Mariposa command center, and the one thing that they stressed time and again is that they need relief from the regulations that are making it almost impossible to create firebreaks, thin the forests, or remove the excess fuels. These policies, imposed 45 years ago through legislation like the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, promised to improve the forest environment. After 45 years of experience with these laws, I think we are entitled to ask: Well, how is the forest environment doing? The answer is damning. These laws have made it virtually impossible to keep our forests properly managed, and the result has been severe tree overcrowding. The Sierra Nevada normally support between 20 and 100 trees per acre, depending upon the topography. The average tree density is now 266 trees per acre. This extreme overcrowding has stressed the trees to the point they can no longer resist drought and beetle infestation and disease. This has caused a massive tree dieoff, and we have entire national forests now just waiting to explode with over 100 million dead trees. The heroic firefighters of the Detwiler fire have kept it out of these hazard zones, but the hazard zones are still there. And consider this: we are only at the very beginning of the fire season that combines fresh brush from last year’s rains with millions of dead trees that were too stressed from overcrowding to survive the drought. The firefighters I spoke with on Saturday bitterly complained that they can’t even cut firebreaks to isolate these zones because of the same socalled environmental laws. The House has pending before it the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017 that would allow us to restore good forest management, but we may already have run afoul of what Churchill called history’s ‘‘terrible, chilling words: too late.’’ Mr. Speaker, I call for expeditious consideration of the Resilient Federal Forests Act and other legislation aimed at restoring management to our forests in the hope that firefighters can hold these fires at bay until we restore good management to our public lands. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CURBELO of Florida). Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 19 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend William D. Johnson, Jr., Harbour Lake Baptist Church, Goose Creek, South Carolina, offered the following prayer: Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for the day that You have bestowed upon us. May our actions glorify You 
in all that we do. We humbly request that You, Lord, place Your providential hand of protection upon every Member, their families, and those who guard and protect this Chamber. O gracious God, remind us daily that while we are here to represent the people, our authority comes from You, for there is no authority except from God, and those who exist are established by God. May there be renewal of prayer across the United States. God, place a burden upon us that we may seek You before we undertake any endeavor. God bless the House of Representatives, and God bless these United States of America. I ask this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. LOWENTHAL led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Edna Bernice Harvey Turman, who is celebrating her 100th birthday on August 15 of this year. Edna was born in 1917 and grew up just south of my own hometown, Jonesboro, in a community called Apt with her mother and father, Bill and Molly Harvey. She began working at Harvey’s grocery store, and afterwards she met a man named Raymond Turman. The pair married in 1936 and farmed and raised cattle together. During World War II, Edna and Raymond farmed for the government and sold soybeans, cotton, creamed milk, and formed butter. Edna and Raymond had five children: Mary, Barbara, Billy Ray, Garry, and Ronnie. Edna also has 9 grandchildren, 12 greatgrandchildren, and 8 great greatgrandchildren. An active member of her community and county, Edna is very passionate about her church, was a member of the International Order of the Rainbow for Girls, and even helped run the voting location in south Craighead County for several years. Today, besides being a happy grandmother, greatgrandmother, and great greatgrandmother, Edna still lives on the old homestead and works in her yard. Edna truly is a member of the greatest generation of Americans by which all the following generations are measured, and whether we realize it or not, it was people like Edna who built our communities and continue to shape the America we live in today. I hope you will join me in wishing her a happy 100th birthday. f 
JCPOA NEGOTIATIONS (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘irresponsible, reckless, duplicitous,’’ all words used to describe Iran during the JCPOA negotiations. Soon, if this administration abrogates the JCPOA, those words would apply to us: ‘‘irresponsible’’ for shredding an agreement that makes the world a safer place, ‘‘reckless’’ in giving Iran an excuse to immediately restart the nuclear program, and ‘‘duplicitous’’ in breaking an international agreement for no legitimate reason but to fulfill a campaign promise. Make no mistake, Iran is still a bad actor. It destabilizes the region. It funds terrorist activities. That is why we voted to increase nonnuclear sanctions on Iran yesterday. But the Iran nuclear agreement is being adhered to, and it is working. Under this administration, are we, as a nation, no longer as good as our word? 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CURRY TOMMY HAYNES (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Curry Tommy Haynes, a longtime Georgia resident and brave hero of the Vietnam war, who joined our Heavenly Father on July 16 after a long battle with cancer. Mr. Haynes was one of the most decorated soldiers in our Nation’s history, earning 10 Purple Heart awards for his bravery in combat in the jungles of Vietnam. Mr. Haynes remained an active member of the community after returning from duty by launching the Newton County EMT services, teaching locals to fly and skydive, and serving as a VA counselor to his fellow servicemembers. Mr. Speaker, while serving in Vietnam as part of the U.S. Army 173rd Airborne Brigade, Company C of the 503rd Infantry, Mr. Haynes was wounded 
multiple times. He was shot in the arm, the thighs, the hand; he lost two fingers in one enemy ambush alone. Yet despite the multiple injuries, he never quit fighting. In 2015, he was presented with a special letter of proclamation issued by Georgia Governor Nathan Deal during a special ceremony recognizing his sacrifice. When asked how he survived combat with his numerous injuries, Mr. Haynes simply replied: I don’t believe in luck. I owe it all to Jesus Christ. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please stand with me and join me in a moment of silence to honor the life and legacy of this American hero who deserves the respect of all Americans. 
BORDER WALL FUNDING (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, the inclusion of $1.6 billion to fund an ineffective divisive border wall is a direct attack on immigrant communities across our Nation. Funding this immoral wall does nothing to help our country. It only helps to promote President Trump’s campaign of fear. The wall itself mirrors President Trump’s approach to policy: divisive, ineffective, and motivated by hate. This is exemplified by the Trump administration’s reckless disregard of the humanitarian cost of building a border wall, which will force immigrants and asylum seekers to take greater risks and more dangerous routes that will likely result in more deaths. Furthermore, this wall will literally divide immigrant households and tear families apart. Instead of funding ineffective efforts to protect our homeland from dangerous threats, this administration would rather fulfill a campaign promise that does the exact opposite. It makes us less safe by targeting immigrant communities and closing off America from our neighbors. American taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for President Trump’s xenophobic antiimmigrant agenda. 
AUGUST 21 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, on August 21, a total solar eclipse will stretch from coast to coast in the United States for the first time in 99 years, and I am proud to say that my district in southern Illinois is the prime viewing spot. In fact, my home county of Jackson County near Carbondale, and also my front yard, is where the eclipse will be at its apex. For 2 minutes and 38 seconds, it will be like total darkness in the middle of the day. The city’s population of 26,000 is expected to multiply many times over from visitors around the world coming for tourism and to see this astronomical Super Bowl. So I would encourage my colleagues and the American people to visit for some world championship southern Illinois barbecue, the beautiful outdoors, the wonderful wineries, and welcome one and all people for the best viewing moments of this solar eclipse. f 
WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE ACA (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, while the Senate is moving forward this week on their deeply flawed and really unpopular healthcare bill, millions of Americans know that they will lose healthcare under TrumpCare. They will face skyrocketing costs, premiums will go up, prescription drug prices will go up. Republicans need to drop this obsession with repeal and work with Democrats to fix the problems that we know exist in the Affordable Care Act. No law is perfect. At least no law that has ever been written here is perfect. And the American people, at least the folks I talk to back home, they are exhausted. They are sick of this partisanship. We have some ideas that you might like. You have some ideas that maybe we could accept. We ought to get together and figure out a way to make healthcare work for every American and not obsess about the notion that anything signed by the previous President, by definition, is bad law. Let us do what the American people sent us here to do. 
RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT COMMANDER MIGUEL SANTIESTEBAN (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Lieutenant Commander Miguel Santiesteban, who is receiving the U.S. Navy’s nomination to be commander. Having fled Castro’s regime at a young age, Miguel moved with his family to south Florida. Driven by his desire to serve our great country, Miguel joined the Navy in 1989. While stationed in Japan as a deck seaman, Miguel was one of the few selected to attend the Hospital Corpsman ‘‘A’’ School. He earned a master’s degree in healthcare service administration at my alma mater, Florida International University. Miguel was commissioned in 2001 and completed his first duty assignment at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He is currently an administrative officer for research and development at the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Miguel has earned many accolades, including the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the NATO Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal several times. Miguel lives the Navy’s core values of honor, courage, commitment. I join Lieutenant Commander Miguel Santiesteban’s family and friends in congratulating him on this welldeserved nomination. We are so proud of you, Miguel. f 
b1215 A BETTER DEAL (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because it is long past time that the American people got a better deal. All Americans want the same thing: a fair chance to get ahead and a better deal than the raw deal that many have right now. Granite Staters in my district want to have the skills to get ahead in the 21st century economy. We want better pay and better jobs. Many women, and increasingly more men, are what we know as the ‘‘sandwich’’ generation, caring for young children and aging parents and relatives, often at the same time. That is why we need paid family leave and sick leave. We need to expand our educational system and skills training for all types of opportunities. Just this week, the Girl Scouts of America announced 23 new merit badges in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This is symbolic of what we need to do as a nation. Encourage young people, boys and girls, to pursue their interests in the fields that will be the cornerstone of the 21st century economy. America deserves a better deal, and that is what we are offering. 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING (Mr. CULBERSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, last year, over 7,000 cases of human trafficking were reported in the United States. Unfortunately, the city with the largest number of cases was our hometown of Houston, Texas. Human trafficking is an absolutely despicable and deplorable crime that demands swift action. As chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I have spearheaded efforts to make sure that our Federal law enforcement officers have all the resources they need to crack down on these human traffickers, who are exploiting our children and young women coming across our borders. 
We have to work together to provide justice and relief for these victims. That is why Congress has passed 16 bipartisan bills to combat this human trafficking epidemic. These bills ensure that all law enforcement officers at the State, Federal, and local level have the resources they need and the support they need to fight this overwhelming crisis. I am proud to support these measures, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that we crack down and drop the hammer on human traffickers. 
FUNDING TO BUILD A BORDER WALL (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the proposed border wall funding. Instead of wasting $1.6 billion in taxpayers’ dollars on an unnecessary border wall, the DHS should focus its limited resources on more important border security priorities. This includes upgrading and hiring more personnel for ports of entry, the main path for illegal drugs. This could include better and more technology so that border security agents will have a better idea what is happening along the borders. The border wall will be dangerous. Violence, poverty, and family ties ensure that migrants will continue attempting the risky journey through the border region’s hostile zones. The border wall will be divisive. We need to do our job, Mr. Speaker, and come together as a Congress for a comprehensive immigration plan; at the least, reform of our immigration policies. Building a wall sends a toxic message to one of our closest neighbors, a country on which we, the United States, depend on. 
RECOGNIZING HUCK PLYLER (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a young man whose thoughtfulness and generosity has stirred the hearts, souls, and patriotic spirits of people across my district in Arkansas. Earlier this year, 6yearold Huck Plyler from Hope, Arkansas, started what is now known as Huck’s Military Care Package Project. Huck’s project is comprised of putting together care packages for nearly 700 members of the Arkansas National Guard currently deployed to the Horn of Africa. Huck’s care packages include items such as nonperishable snacks, lip balm, sunscreen, personal hygiene products, socks, and more. When asked why he decided to start this project, Huck’s answer was: ‘‘We do this because they help us, so we help them.’’ Though simple, this reply is wise beyond his years. Huck’s dedication to this project has enabled him to collect enough donated items and monetary donations to send over 50 boxes to our troops thus far. Mr. Speaker, Huck’s kindness and thoughtfulness brings honor to himself; his parents, Caleb and Brianna Plyler; and to the benevolent people of Hempstead County and Arkansas. I commend and thank Huck for his hard work and commitment to our military members serving overseas. It is young men and women like Huck that give me hope for the future, hope that the giving and caring spirit is still alive and well in our young people and country today. f 
A BETTER DEAL (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, Democrats unveiled A Better Deal for the American people. This is an economic agenda that will create 10 million goodpaying, fulltime jobs; raise pay; lower costs; and give workers the tools that they need to get ahead. A job is much more than just a paycheck. It is about knowing that your hard work is valued and honored. It is about being treated with the dignity and respect that every human being deserves. We don’t have enough of that in this country today. People in my State and all across America feel like the system is completely stacked against them. And do you know what? They are right. Our Tax Code rewards companies that ship jobs overseas. Millionaires and billionaires don’t pay their fair share. Corporate special interests spend secretly in our elections. It doesn’t have to be this way; and with A Better Deal, it won’t be this way. We are going to invest in our infrastructure, we are going to build a new manufacturing economy, double investments in apprenticeships, and we are going to make sure that working families are valued again. The American people have had enough broken promises to last them a lifetime, but Democrats are going to deliver real results to them with A Better Deal, better jobs, better wages, for a better future. 
CONGRATULATING JACK AND MARIANNE COX (Mr. MCCLINTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Jack and Marianne Cox on the occasion of their upcoming golden wedding anniversary. Jack served for many years as chief of staff for Congressman Barry Goldwater, Jr. In fact, I first met him in that capacity when I was still in high school. I have done quite a bit of aging since then. Jack and Marianne have not, which I find annoying, but there it is. Jack was the quintessential congressional chief of staff. He was always one step behind Barry, whispering names in his ear as he went from handshake to handshake. Jack was also one of the moving forces behind the creation of the Republican Study Committee. Somehow he also found time to marry and raise a family in those years. And, even more surprisingly, Marianne put up with it. Jack and Marianne have sort of retired to the town of Copperopolis, and I extend to them heartiest congratulations on the celebration of this family milestone. f 
THE RIGHT TO HEALTHCARE (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, even as our colleagues in the Senate try, once again, today to strip lifesaving healthcare away from millions of Americans, I find that there is reason to hope and to have faith not in this Congress, where the work of cruel indifference to suffering precedes once again, but, rather, in the American people, because it has been the efforts of ordinary citizens whose calls and letters and protests have been making all the difference in this issue. It has been the collective voices of people telling their stories of struggle and survival who have slowed the system roller of repeal. I salute each and every one of them. Your voices count. Your stories are important. Keep them coming because you, your health, and your healthcare matter. 
RECOGNIZING LOUISE JOHNSON (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding service of Mrs. Louise Johnson, this year’s recipient of the Friends of the Fair Award from the Clinton County Fair. Mrs. Johnson has dedicated herself to the people and organizations of Clinton County for many years, particularly the Clinton County Fair. She served as chair of the Hershey Baking Contest for 22 years, as cochair for Open Show for 19 years, and created the Sizzling Senior Talent Show in 2010. Beyond her involvement at the fair, Mrs. Johnson has served at the Monument Church of Christ for more than six decades, teaching Sunday school, playing the piano, and serving as treasurer. 
She has further enriched the community by teaching crochet classes, serving residents at Haven Skilled Rehabilitation and Nursing, and assisting at Lock Haven Hospital. Mr. Speaker, the time and dedication Mrs. Johnson has given to her community is truly inspiring. I am so proud to congratulate her on this welldeserved award. I congratulate Mrs. Johnson, and I thank her for all that she has given in services to the communities of both Centre and Clinton Counties. 
BORDER SECURITY (Ms. SA´NCHEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, after more than 6 months of failing to pass any major legislative bills, House Republicans are becoming desperate for a win. So desperate, they decided to sneak in $1.6 billion into a funding bill to start construction on an unworkable wall along our border. While I support real border security, this stunt is a far cry from that. I believe in investing our Federal dollars wisely. Instead of building a medieval solution that will not work, why don’t we use those billions of dollars for a big, beautiful jobs package? Or big, beautiful bridges, roads, and infrastructure throughout this country? Or to ensure that our children can access higher education and job training, healthcare, and housing? Instead, my Republican colleagues are attempting to distract us from their failures by passing this bill. You would think that with their back against a wall, they wouldn’t be this eager to start building another one. 
CONGRATULATING THE SERGEANT ANDREW BRUCHER VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS POST 5499 (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the Sergeant Andrew Brucher Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5419, located in Kauneonga Lake, New York, which will soon be celebrating its 50th anniversary. At the anniversary dinner, the post will honor two very special people: Mrs. Mabel Brucher, a Gold Star mother whose son Post 5499 is named for; and Mr. Raymond Jankowski, a veteran of the Second World War and founding charter member of Post 5499. Honoring those who have served our Nation should be a top priority for all Americans, and the VFW is an essential organization that fosters camaraderie among American veterans and advocates on their behalf. Congratulations to Post 5499. I look forward to honoring this important milestone with members of the post this weekend. BORDER WALL (Mr. CA´RDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to oppose the inclusion of $1.6 billion that would be a waste of taxpayer money on this useless wall. The funds will go towards an unnecessary wall along the Southern border. This wall that the President promised voters that Mexico would pay for is now being put on the taxpayers’ backs. $1.6 billion can be used for better things. It can pay for thousands of jobs in the U.S. and workforce development programs and apprenticeships. And one other thing: agents protecting our border don’t even want it. They do not see themselves as defenders of a wall. Mr. President, please come back to reality. This is not ‘‘Game of Thrones.’’ This administration needs to stop demonizing people outside of our borders. We need to fix our immigration system, and we can do it in a humane and pragmatic and effective way, and in a way that will supercharge our economy and actually create American jobs. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair and not to the President. 
b1230 IN RECOGNITION OF BRIAN BERG (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, as the House cochair of the bipartisan Paper and Packaging Caucus, I rise today to recognize an individual from my district who has dedicated his entire professional life to an industry that is the lifeblood of a rural community in my State, Toledo, Oregon. I am talking about Brian Berg, who, after 41 years with GeorgiaPacific, will be retiring Friday. For 50 years, GP has been an integral part of Lincoln County and a community partner, providing paper and packaging products that are used around the world. For over 41 years, Brian has been a leader at GP in helping ensure that the mill continues to thrive and be successful and provide for this community now and into the future. I want to thank Brian for his dedication, his service, and his commitment to an industry that has been critical to my district and many of my constituents. I wish you all the best and hope you get to enjoy some time with your lovely wife, Janet, and kids, Savannah, Ashley, and Riley. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL DENY TRANSGENDER PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, Donald Trump announced via Twitter, how else, that he is going to reverse the Obamaera decision and deny transgender people the right to openly serve in our military. I think it is shameful to divide Americans, in the face of their service and sacrifice, for his political gain. This is not about national security, it is not about saving money, and it is not about fabricated claims of disruption. What is disruptive is discrimination against an entire class of Americans who are or who want to protect and defend America. That is the same argument that was used against women in the service, against gays and lesbians. We ought to welcome any American who is qualified and willing to serve to protect our great country, to protect America and our values, even as the President undermines both. f

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. The rule provides for 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us represents the end product of many months of work by the Appropriations Committee. In this package, we will be considering four appropriations bills: Defense, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. Together, the four parts of the bill make up the Make America Secure Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2018. The legislation ensures that our most important government services will be funded responsibly and appropriately and that we will fulfill our most important responsibilities as legislators: funding the government and keeping it open to serve our constituents. The bill provides a total of $658.1 billion for defense, an increase of $68.1 billion in discretionary funding above the fiscal year 2017 levels, and an increase of $28.3 billion over the President’s request. It also includes $73.9 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations and Global War on Terrorism funding. These funds will help us enhance our military readiness, and the substantial increase marks an end to the ongoing erosion of our national military strength that occurred during the Obama administration. Importantly, this bill also provides an increase in funding for veterans. Over the past several years, the House has worked to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs and to ensure that all veterans receive the care and benefits to which they are entitled. The Department of Veterans Affairs will receive a 5 percent increase in this bill, including $74 billion for the Veterans Health Administration. The increased funding represents an important step toward fulfilling our promise to improve care, reduce wait times at the VA, and enhance benefits for our Nation’s veterans. The Energy and Water portion of this appropriations bill provides $37.6 billion in funding for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $209 million from fiscal year 2017. The bill includes an increase in funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration that includes funds to restart the licensing process for Yucca Mountain, the national disposal repository for spent nuclear fuel. It also provides $6.16 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, a $10 million increase over fiscal year 2017. H.R. 3219 also provides $3.58 billion for the Legislative Branch. It does not recommend funding levels for the Senate, as per our longstanding tradition. The bill includes a significant increase in funding for U.S. Capitol Police and adds additional funds for securing offices in Washington and in congressional districts. Importantly, it continues the freeze on Member pay. The package before us represents the House fulfilling its primary responsibility: to fund the government. This package funds hundreds, if not thousands, of Member priorities, particularly on the defense side. I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their months of working and making this bill a reality. It shows what the House can do as we move forward toward completion of the fiscal year appropriations process. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to know where to begin, because this process is so lousy, but I want to rise today in opposition to this rule and the socalled underlying bill, H.R. 3219, the GOP fiscal year 2018 socalled security minibus appropriations bill. This rule makes in order 72 amendments for debate on the House floor, blocking 100 amendments. It continues the terrible closed process that this Republican majority has used since they took control of the House in 2011. When Speaker RYAN took the gavel, he promised a fair and open process with regular order where both the majority and the minority would have the opportunity to have their voices heard, and I am happy to provide the full text of that speech to my Republican friends. I guess we were misinformed, because our collective voices are repeatedly silenced in this Chamber, not just Democrats, but Republicans as well. Speaker RYAN’s broken promise was clearly on display last week when he waited until the dead of night to strip out of the Defense Appropriations bill a provision requiring Congress to debate the issue of the 2001 AUMF. That provision was adopted by the full House Appropriations Committee on a bipartisan basis as an amendment offered by our respected colleague, Representative BARBARA LEE. The bipartisan Lee amendment would sunset the outdated 2001 AUMF and give Congress 8 months to enact a new one, ensuring that Congress finally debate and vote on the many wars in which the United States is engaged. If the Republican leadership doesn’t like the lead provision, then the Rules Committee could have made in order an amendment to strike it from the bill. That would have given Members the chance to vote up or down either to keep or remove the provision. That would have been regular order, that would have been fair, that would have been open, but, instead, House Republican leadership took it upon themselves to replace Ms. LEE’s provision with alternative language calling upon the administration to produce a report. 
Republicans on the Rules Committee defended this action, saying that the Lee amendment legislated on an appropriations bill. The trouble with that logic, Mr. Speaker, is that the language that replaced Ms. LEE’s amendment also legislates on an appropriations bill. That is right. House Republicans put in an amendment that violates the same rule. If this leadership is going to silence Members on flimsy procedural grounds, they probably shouldn’t break those same rules on the same day. Even more shameful, the Republican leadership’s continued actions to block every effort and refuse to allow Congress to debate and vote on these wars, I believe, is an insult to the men and women in uniform, who put their lives on the line every day to protect our country, and to their families. Americans deserve better, and the bipartisan voices calling for action will not be silenced, but this is just one example of regular order being abandoned in order to advance an extreme agenda. Tomorrow, House Republicans will use another legislative trick, the self executing rule, to stick taxpayers with a $1.6 billion bill for President Trump’s reckless and ineffective border wall with Mexico. Now, instead of bringing that measure to the floor for an upordown vote in an open process where all voices could be heard, the Republican leadership is sticking this provision into the rule so that as soon as the rule is approved, the measure will automatically become part of the bill. President Trump, as you may recall, promised the American people that he would make Mexico pay for this wall. He repeated it over and over and over again during the campaign. But now, House Republicans want to take $1.6 billion of hardearned tax dollars from millions of Americans to fund it. b1245 Let me point out, Mr. Speaker, this $1.6 billion is only targeted at 74 miles of the border: two small tracts in Texas and one small tract in California. And how did this provision on the border wall make its way into this minibus of appropriations bills? It was literally lifted out of the Homeland Security appropriations bill and its few sentences airdropped into this package. Where is the rest of the Homeland Security bill, Mr. Speaker? Sitting in limbo, that is where it is. I guess there weren’t any other national security priorities in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill that merited the very special treatment that the 74 miles of this lousy wall seem to be getting. I see that the only priority that matters for my Republican friends when it comes to the security of our Nation is 74 miles of wall costing $1.6 billion. Mr. Speaker, this is a disgrace. This is just a disgrace. And then, because it will be part of a selfexecuting rule, Republicans won’t even have to vote on this Republican priority. They will just vote on the rule and, bingo, it is all taken care of. There will be no separate vote on this. You get the funding for the wall, but nothing on record that says you voted to waste $1.6 billion on 74 miles of border wall. Republicans can go home and say they delivered on the wall. I guess they better hope that their constituents don’t ask them to show them the vote. But as I said, Mr. Speaker, this is a disgrace on funding. It is a disgrace on funding priorities, and it is a real disgrace on process. I mean, we should be ashamed of the process in which this bill is being brought to the floor. I wish I could say that I am surprised by all of this, but the fact is that House Republicans have been doing this kind of thing for quite some time now. This week, you may have read about this: Kellyanne Conway claimed that even if President Trump says something that isn’t true, it is not a lie if he believes it. Well, you can’t make this stuff up. Well, I take that back. I guess you can make everything up. It seems clear that this warped logic has infected this Chamber, with the House Republican leadership employing this same kind of thinking and underhanded methods on a regular basis. They defend a process that is indefensible, plain and simple. This is a rigged process. Let’s be honest. This is a rigged process. Is this really how we want Congress and this House to conduct the business of the American people? Is this how we will conduct the appropriations process not only now, but in the future: no debate for individual appropriations bills and severely limiting amendments overall? no regular order and a subversion the committee process? Soon, maybe there will be no amendments on appropriations bills at all. This is a slippery slope, and I urge my Republican colleagues to carefully consider the dangerous road that we are going down. Americans deserve better from their leaders in Congress, especially when it comes to deciding how the American people’s hardearned tax dollars will be spent. Republicans talk about fiscal responsibility, but what I see here today is another reckless and bloated budget proposal that empties the Treasury vaults for wasteful military spending when we have so many critical priorities here at home that are in desperate need of funding. Now, apparently, House Republicans have no problem with spending $1.6 billion on President Trump’s border wall with Mexico, but when it comes to investing in our own communities here at home, they can’t be bothered. How about investing in our kids’ schools? Why aren’t we doing more to ensure that our young people have the resources and the support they need to get additional education? Make college more affordable, for example. Wouldn’t that be a radical idea? Republicans love to talk about personal responsibility and the need for Americans to work. Why aren’t we investing $1.6 billion more in job training programs and finding ways to increase wages? We should be making sure that more families have access to good jobs and that no one in America who works full time has to raise their family in poverty. President Trump had what feels like countless infrastructure weeks, but we have yet to see Republicans propose any legislation to make good on their promise to finally invest in America’s infrastructure and finally fix our Nation’s crumbling roads and bridges. Instead of making any of these policies the top priorities that they should be in this Congress, Republicans are just offering more of the same: empty rhetoric and broken promises. Now, to be clear, the legislation that we will consider today, H.R. 3219, does fund some important priorities. Our national security must be our number one priority with policies that are both strong and smart. I strongly support our men and women in uniform and believe that Congress should provide our troops everything that they need. Yet Republicans have deliberately created a security bill that raises serious concerns. Let’s recap for a second, Mr. Speaker. The final version of this bill will include $1.6 billion for the President’s useless and immoral border wall. It strips out the bipartisan Lee amendment that would have ensured Congress finally grapples with the wars that we are sending our troops to fight instead of continuing to write the White House a series of blank checks. And to top it all off, Mr. Speaker, the four bills contained in H.R. 3219 blow through the Budget Control Act cap on defense spending by $72 billion, threatening a 13 percent sequester cut to all defense accounts. While obliterating the defense spending cap, House Republicans have proposed reducing nondefense spending to $5 billion below its cap. It is legislative malpractice that Republicans have ignored this reality and have done nothing to work with Democrats to write a new bipartisan budget agreement to raise the Budget Control Act caps for both defense and nondefense spending. Republicans are setting us up for a train wreck, a government shutdown, or worse. This is not good, Mr. Speaker. This should concern every single Member of this Chamber, both Democrat and Republican. And so I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and finally take a stand against this process, which is rigged and closed and restrictive, and to oppose the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume before I go to my first speaker in order to respond to some of my friend’s points. I want to begin by talking about the amendment process just very quickly. 
It is worth noting 72 amendments are made in order here; 47 of those were actually Democratic amendments. Many of the amendments that my friend referred to that had been submitted to the Rules Committee, at least a third of them, were knocked out because they were simply out of order. But my friend is correct: it is not an open rule. I do remind him that the first people to eliminate open rules on appropriations bills were not Republicans. It was actually the Democratic majority in 2009 that ended the practice and, for 2 years, allowed almost no amendments on any appropriations bills, and most appropriations bills never came to the floor. So I think my friends bear a considerable amount of responsibility for where we find ourselves today. I do want to talk a little bit, too, briefly, about my friend’s comments about the AUMF, because he has been a good friend and a close ally in an area that we have a similar concern. I agree with my friend. We need to debate this, and we need to have an AUMF that is more in tune with the times and, frankly, reintroduces congressional power and congressional oversight. I have worked with my friend in the past on that. I am going to continue to work with him on it going forward. But in the case of the Lee amendment, which, in full disclosure, I supported in the Appropriations Committee, the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction, which is not the Appropriations Committee, made it known that he would lodge a point of order; so, in other words, that would never get to the floor. In place, we have put something that, frankly, will at least require the administration, on the passage of this bill or the Defense Authorization Act, in which it is also found, to submit a report that justifies where the administration is legally, lays out their strategy, lays out their costs, and gives us a chance to begin a debate. As a sign of good faith, I am happy to report that the Foreign Relations Committee, which actually does have jurisdiction here, actually had their first hearing on a new AUMF earlier this week. So I think we are trying to get to the same place. My friend may have a different way to get there, but I agree with him, we need to reexamine, redebate, and, I think, reenact a new AUMF. I think we are trying to get there in a stepbystep, logical progression. Finally, while my friend is concerned about where we will end up in this process and, I think, legitimately so, I also want to point out we have actually managed to come together here the last couple of years and, I suspect, will again. In fiscal year 2016, we had the same series of events, and yet Congress came to an agreement on full funding that was bipartisan and passed by substantial numbers of both parties participating, a majority in each party. The same thing was true in fiscal year 2017. My hope is that it will be true again in fiscal year 2018. But this is an important part of the process. We need to go through this. At the end of the day, and I tell this to my friends on the right and the left, we will end up with a bicameral, bipartisan appropriations bill. There is simply no other way to fund the Government of the United States, and we pledge to work toward that. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ), my good friend, a member of the Rules Committee, but also a distinguished member of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying bill. The Make America Secure Appropriations Act is all about protecting the American people and securing our homeland. Unfortunately, years of underfunding have severely hurt our military. With this bill, we can make real progress towards rebuilding the military and adding more troops, sailors, airmen, and marines to the force. Building on our pledge to boost the Navy to a 355ship fleet, the bill funds 11 new ships. Included in this are three littoral combat ships, of which the Independence class vessel is built by a fantastic workforce in southwest Alabama. Having stateoftheart facilities and resources is vital to the success of our military. To help repair dilapidated and aging military infrastructure, the bill provides a 25 percent increase in military construction funding. Supporting our servicemembers and their families is also a high priority of this bill, as it provides for the largest military pay raise in 8 years. That is not all it does. It also provides for our Nation’s veterans, the very people who devoted their lives to protecting our country and the values we hold so dear. This bill provides the highest level of funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs in our Nation’s history. This will help cut down on the claims backlog and move forward with a new electronic medical health records system. I am also pleased that this bill will allow us to begin increasing our Nation’s border security in an effort to keep bad actors out of our country. The American people sent a strong message last November that they wanted a wall securing our southern border. This bill will begin this process by providing over $1.5 billion requested by President Trump for physical barrier construction along the southern border. Mr. Speaker, over this last weekend a lot of people in America went to see a movie called ‘‘Dunkirk’’ about the evacuation of over 300,000 British and French troops back over to England. Prime Minister Winston Churchill had only been in office a couple of weeks at that point in time, but he had predicted for years before that in speeches before the House of Commons that that day was coming, and they took his speeches and they put them together in a book called, ‘‘While England Slept.’’ With this bill, we are sending a strong message to the world that America is not asleep. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me just remind my colleagues here that we are debating the rule, and this is about process. The gentleman from Oklahoma earlier talked about waivers and that the Lee AUMF language would be subject to a point of order. Well, the language that my Republican friends replaced the Lee amendment with is protected by a waiver of all points of order because it was also legislating on an appropriations bill. As I pointed out last night in the Rules Committee, you made in order amendment No. 19 by Mr. GRIFFITH , which violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act, and you provided a waiver for that. My Republican friends routinely grant waivers in bills that come before the Rules Committee. The problem is that the waivers are only granted for your amendments and never for our amendments, and that is just not fair and that is not right. So if your policy is going to be we are going to grant no waivers, then it ought to apply not just to Democrats; it ought to apply to Republicans, too. But there is this double standard here, and voices that you disagree with always seem to end up being cut off. So, Mr. Speaker, I just point that out because this process and the reason why so many of us are angry about this process is it is so blatantly unfair. The gentleman from Alabama talked about how we all want to commit to upholding the national security of this Nation. I agree with him, but I would say we are not doing our jobs if this floor is not a place where we can have a freeflowing debate, where Members can offer different ideas and be able to have a vote on them. I would just say, with all due respect to my Republican colleagues, you do not have a monopoly on all good ideas. b1300 You know, we have a couple of good ideas, too, and maybe some of your Members agree with that as well. The other thing we are going to object to is, again, the way my Republican friends selfexecute controversial measures like this border wall at $1.6 billion, basically denying an upor down vote. Maybe it is to protect your Members in swing districts; I have no idea. Maybe you don’t think you have the votes to do it. But if you don’t have the votes to do it, it ought not to be in this bill. That is just, to me, a sound way to approach legislating. All the normal rules seem to be thrown out the window here. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM ), the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. Mr. Speaker, we are in a constrained fiscal environment, and we need to make smart choices about the future of our country. I am disappointed to see that many of the choices that the Republican leaders have made in this bill are completely out of balance with the needs of the American people. Republicans have chosen to exclude eight of the appropriations bills from this legislation: funding for roads and bridges to drive on, quality healthcare for our family, protecting our clean air and our drinking water, and the education of future generations. These critical investments that all Americans depend upon are left by the wayside with no path forward. Republicans have chosen to put forward a bill that exceeds the defense caps by $72 billion. With no budget agreement in sight, this bill would trigger sequestration cuts that our military leaders have warned us would have catastrophic consequences for our men and women in uniform. Republicans have also once again declined to make commonsense cuts to defense spending by denying the Pentagon’s request for a new BRAC round. Make no mistake: this will waste billions of dollars over the next decade. At a time when countries like China are emphasizing research and investments in clean energy, Republicans have chosen to eliminate funding for ARPAE, doing great harm—great harm—to America’s global competitiveness in advanced research energy. Mr. Speaker, these choices are simply unacceptable to my constituents and to the American people, and I urge my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats to put forward appropriate funding bills that will advance the appropriations bills for all of America and to make America the strong country it should be. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, before I go to my next speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to my friends. First, to my good friend from Massachusetts, and he is very much my good friend, but when I was in the minority, I asked repeatedly, I used to come up to the Rules Committee, as a former member of the Rules Committee, and I always got the warmest, most gracious reception, but I don’t think I ever got an amendment approved. You can legislate on appropriations bills if the chairman of the authorizing committee consents to allow you to do it. I have a great deal of sympathy with my friend’s position on Ms. LEE’s amendment. I actually supported that amendment in subcommittee, but I recognize that we are not the appropriate committee, and if a different authorizing chairman wanted to do something, he could. Finally, with all due respect to my friend, we are not the ones that began this process of eliminating open rules on appropriations. My friend’s party is. We actually tried to restore it. I regret that we did not succeed in that. This was not something I like doing, but, frankly, it has gotten around here where people are more interested in ‘‘got you’’ amendments than real amendments, and that is basically what has happened here. I hope we can revisit that someday and go back to the traditional way of doing this. Finally, to my good friend from Minnesota, I want to make a pledge to her, and she knows it is sincere: we will work together. I don’t think this bill ultimately will be passed without bipartisan cooperation, and I look at the 2015, 2016, and 2017 bills that all did end up as cooperative measures. Just to refresh my friend’s memory, it was back in April that we passed a $1 trillionplus spending bill for fiscal year 2017 that was extremely bipartisan. A majority of my friends on the other side of the aisle voted for it, the majority of my friends voted for it, and the President of the United States signed it. This is a long and lengthy process to fund the government, and I suspect, at the end of it, we will come together. That is certainly what I am going to try to do as I work through the process. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS), a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for H.R. 3219. This bill provides funding for the Federal Government’s most critical function— national defense—with the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, as we are making sure the men and women who protect and defend our country have the best equipment and training in the world, and that they get the pay raise they deserve. Additionally, I am pleased to see my provisions I have worked on were included in this legislation to protect Lake Erie by preventing the Army Corps of Engineers from using open lake placement as a method of disposal of dredged material unless a State water quality certification is provided. This is ensuring that Lake Erie remains on the path towards a healthier natural resource. The bill also gives the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of the Army further authorization to withdraw the waters of the United States rule. Finally, this legislation provides the resources to better secure our border and protect our citizens and our national security. We are making good on our promises to build the wall. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule. I had a real bipartisan amendment that had been in order repeatedly in recent sessions, gaining bipartisan support, to be able to deal with the crisis that our veterans face in terms of addiction, opioids. The VA, sadly, has a horrible record in terms of how they deal with these veterans. They suffer suicide 50 percent higher than the general public. The opioid addiction rate is twice the general population. Mr. Speaker, I have been working for years in the area of medical marijuana. Twentynine States have now legalized it. I wish my friends on the Rules Committee had taken the time to listen to the stories of veterans and their families about what difference it made for people suffering from PTSD, chronic pain, and traumatic brain injury. Medical marijuana has helped change their lives, and it is not addictive and doesn’t kill them the way the abuse of opioids has. Yet the VA, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t even allow VA doctors to talk to veterans about medical marijuana in the States where it is legal. Our amendment is simple. It would eliminate that prohibition. It wouldn’t dispense marijuana on public land. It allowed the VA doctor to work with the patients—the people who know them best. It passed last year with 40 votes on a bipartisan basis. There were 18 bipartisan cosponsors for the amendment, 9 and 9, Republican and Democrat. It has already passed the Senate by a 3to1 margin in committee. It was actually approved by the House last Congress, but in conference committee, it was stripped out, led by former Senator Kirk. I sincerely believe that one of the reasons he is a former Senator is because Illinois veterans and their families were outraged about that action to reverse what Congress did. Now we are not even allowed to vote on it. I think that is incomprehensible. I don’t think it is fair to our veterans. My friends on the Rules Committee are on the wrong side of history. In Florida, last November, 71 percent of the people voted for medical marijuana. Our veterans deserve the right to work with their VA physicians to do what is right for them and their families and, hopefully, avoid the epidemic of opioid overdoses, overprescriptions, and not being able to treat them with a methodology that is not highly addictive and not dangerous. Mr. Speaker, there is no reason on God’s green earth that we shouldn’t have been allowed to at least vote on this bipartisan amendment to protect our veterans. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to respond very quickly to my good friend from Oregon. I just remind him this is a long and 
winding road. It is a long process. As he said, the Senate may very well move in a different direction. I tend to focus here on veterans’ issues as issues that have largely brought us together. Quite frankly, this bill has a very substantial increase in spending at the VA, and that is something that I know, in committee, garnered wide bipartisan support. Let’s wait and see where we go. I just want to say I think there will be continuing discussion about this, but there is also a concern, always, on something like this that is controversial. We have seen our friends do this before. Sometimes you will put an amendment in but you won’t vote for the final bill. When you are trying to calculate whether you pass something, you can’t have amendments that cost you votes, that don’t get you votes. I am not suggesting that is my friend’s purpose. It is not at all. I know it is not. I know he is very sincere in this. I am saying that could easily be the effect. All I can tell you is we will continue to work through the bill. I suspect when we get there, at the end of the day, this will be a very bipartisan bill. It will pass with a very bipartisan majority. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) so he may respond. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I would just say this was an opportunity to bring us together. It passed last Congress on the floor of the House with a 40vote margin. There is more support now, today, in the public and in the other body. This was an opportunity to avoid unnecessary controversy, to send a signal to our veterans, to change a destructive policy from the Veterans Administration that is overwhelmingly supported by the American public. If you would have allowed us to vote on the floor of the House, I will guarantee you we would have had even more votes this time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, when Speaker RYAN took the gavel, he promised to have ‘‘a process that is more open, more inclusive, more deliberative, and more participatory.’’ My friends like to highlight a number of amendments made in order today as if this is a good process. I would remind you, Mr. Speaker, that, rather than taking up one issue at a time, this is a rule for three appropriations bills. I say to my friends, you guys are worse than you used to be. There are 10 amendments allowed for the Legislative Branch. Last year you made in order 13. We have fewer amendments this year. For the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill, there are 16 amendments. Just a short time ago, in fiscal year 2016, we had a modified open rule. This rule is clearly much worse. We have the same situation with the Energy and Water bill. We have a structured rule this year, while we had a modified open rule just 2 years ago. The process in the House is getting worse. For the first time in history, we have a Speaker of the House who has never allowed a truly open rule. Now, we were not perfect, Mr. Speaker, but Speaker PELOSI allowed the Rules Committee to report open rules. Speaker Boehner allowed open rules. Every Speaker in modern history allowed some open rules, but we don’t even get modified open rules anymore. Mr. Speaker, we are seeing an alarming rise in the number of selfexecuting rules, what Republicans used to call ‘‘deem and pass rules.’’ Now, let me explain what that is. In his book, ‘‘Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders,’’ our dear Speaker, Mr. RYAN, described the selfexecution process. This is on page 98, if you are following along. But he called this process, ‘‘legislative trickery to enact legislation that does not have majority backing.’’ Now, sometime today we are going to go back up to the Rules Committee to do a little legislative trickery to fund the President’s border wall. News flash: Mexico is not paying for the wall. The language that the Speaker intends to deem passed without a vote uses good oldfashioned American greenbacks to pay for Trump’s wall. The American taxpayers are going to be stuck with this bill for this ridiculous wall. Mr. Speaker, this process is not good; it is not a better way; it is rotten; and the rule the majority will put on this floor tomorrow will be even worse. We are jamming through these important appropriation bills together, limiting debate, and moving further away from regular order. b1315 We don’t need this rule, and we don’t need a selfexecuting rule tomorrow. Now, if we defeat the previous question on this rule, I will offer an amendment to open up this process and consider the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Energy and Water Appropriation bills each under an open rule. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LUETKEMEYER ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me just conclude with this, Mr. Speaker: Members have a chance to vote for an open amendment process on these appropriations bills. That is what this PQ vote is about. Republicans will not control this House forever, and I hope that no Member who votes against this open rule amendment today will have the audacity to criticize any future Democratic majorities. If they do, Mr. Speaker, I assure you, we will remind them of this vote. To discuss our proposal, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ). Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, a lot of Members don’t know what a previous question motion is, and that is not really a surprise, because it is usually used to set up some issues, and it is a partyline vote. This is different. This is different because this would allow amendments to be offered to these appropriations bills. Now, the amendment process in appropriations is one of the few times that Members of Congress have an opportunity to offer an amendment. And it is not just Democrats. It is Republicans, too. I recall very well—I am a member, I am a cochair of the Fourth Amendment Caucus. It is Congressman TED POEand myself. And what members of the Fourth Amendment Caucus did was we put together an amendment that actually reformed section 702 of the PATRIOT Act. What it said was you can’t query the database accumulated under section 702 without a warrant. It is pretty obvious the Fourth Amendment protects Americans. That passed by a huge bipartisan vote twice. We don’t get to offer that amendment this time because it is not an open rule. So I am just asking that we treat this previous question vote as very different than the usual garden variety previous question vote, because this is different. This isn’t about idealogy. This isn’t about 30second adds and all that nonsense that we both do. No. This is about having the opportunity— Republicans and Democrats, Members of Congress—to offer an amendment in important areas, especially the Fourth Amendment. So please vote ‘‘yes’’ on the previous question this time, and let’s have open rules. Let’s have democracy in America. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to quickly respond to my friends and remind them that it wasn’t Republicans that got rid of open rules on appropriations. It was my friends. So you can’t set one standard for yourself, and then say: But you now have to go back to the way it was. We now have to be treated as a minority, in contrast to the way that we treated you. I am sorry, that is just difficult. We actually tried to do that for a couple of years, and we did come back to open rules. And I would still prefer that, to tell you the truth. I have lost this argument in my own conference. But if my friends will recall, last year on, I believe, the Energy and 
Water Appropriations bill, they slipped an amendment in. It was perfectly legitimate for them to do so. It was an open rule. They got that amendment adopted. They did not vote for the bill, even though the amendment was adopted. We lost a lot of votes, in consequence, because of the amendment. So there is always that calculus when you put these things together. There is a difference between an amendment that is a substantive amendment, and an amendment that is unrelated and a poisonpill amendment. Our side just decided they weren’t going to subject themselves to that any longer. I am not sure that I agree with that decision, but that is the reality of where we are. There is a second consideration here, too, in terms of limitation that I think is worth noting. We are moving under an expedited situation because we began this process late. I want to take responsibility for that on our side of the aisle. I think all of the appropriations bills could have and should have been finished for FY17 in December of 2016. Instead, we started to allow the new administration to have input. We pushed that off and did a 4month continuing resolution. During that period, we did not negotiate back and forth. We finally passed a bill in April. So we are moving with exceptional speed. I think it is pretty remarkable at this point that all 12 appropriations bills have been reported out of committee, and are preparing to go here. Our leadership made, I think, a smart decision, in that here are four that all relate to a common theme of security for the country. Let’s get those done. That is sort of first things first. Let’s come back and deal with the other eight in September. It is my hope that that is what we will do, probably in packages again. But we are trying to move quickly. It is also finally worth noting that, again, this process, compared to the process my Democratic friends followed, is far more open. There are far more amendments now, even under a structured rule like this, than they allowed when they were in the majority on appropriations bills. We can go get the numbers and count, but we are at least trying to get back to getting the bills to the floor and having a pretty generous latitude for serious amendments. We will always disagree over which ones are made in order. A lot of Republican amendments weren’t made in order either, but 72 amendments on an appropriations bill is a lot of amendments. Hopefully, this process can get better as we go forward. I want to work with my friends in that regard, but I am still very proud of the product that we are presenting and very proud of the number of amendments that are being allowed. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter signed by a number of civil rights groups, education groups, environmental groups, and women’s groups in opposition to this minibus. JULY25, 2017. Re Oppose H.R. 3219 Security Minibus—Vote No on Border wall. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of our coalition of almost 90 environmental, faith, immigration, and civil rights organizations, we are writing to strongly urge you to oppose funding for the continued construction of a border wall along the U.S.Mexico border. The construction of a border wall serves as a symbol of hostility towards immigrants, and undermines the civil rights of communities living along our southern border. It also imposes environmental costs and natural disaster threats on border communities, especially indigenous communities, harms native wildlife and wastes tens of billions in taxpayer dollars. As the House moves to consider the Fiscal Year 2018 Security Minibus, H.R. 3219, we are profoundly concerned about the inclusion of $1.6 billion slated for border wall. In addition to spending billions of taxpayer dollars, adding funding for the border wall in this legislative package undermines a fair and transparent legislative process. Instead of allowing legislators and the public to fully consider the impacts of funding wall construction, the Majority is using rushed and underhanded legislative maneuvers to circumvent the vast and legitimate opposition that exists for this measure, even within their own party. Including border wall funding in a Security Minibus is based on the false premise that our borders are somehow violent and insecure. This false premise has been used to justify and advance antiimmigrant, antiborder, procriminalization, and antienvironment legislation that has negative economic and civil rights impacts on border communities. The fact is that communities along the border are some of the safest in the country. According to the FBI’s Uniformed Crime Reports, cities on the border are safer than cities away from the border. Places like El Paso, Texas have long topped the lists of safest cities for their low crime and violence. Additionally, according to the American Immigration Council, communities with more immigrants are likely to be safer than places with fewer immigrants. Border walls are an ineffective tool in curbing undocumented migration between the United States and nations south of the border. Rather than deter migration, the current 650–mile barrier along the U.S.Mexico border has forced vulnerable migrant populations to pursue more dangerous routes of travel. The continued construction of a border wall portrays an attitude of hatred and animosity towards our neighboring nations. Additionally, construction of this wall would undermine indigenous border communities, potentially destroying elements of their history, archeology, and culture. Border security measures must consider the historic Tribal lands and families occupying the southern border. Finally, the current proposal in Fiscal Year 2018 Security Minibus calls for the construction of 60 miles of levee border wall in the South Texas Rio Grande Valley; 28 miles would be leveeborder wall, with 2.9 miles slated to be built in the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge. This Refuge is home to diverse wildlife species, ecotourism opportunities, and rich natural beauty. When levee border walls are constructed, they negatively impact wildlife migration, pose severe flooding risks, destroy natural habitats, and lead to potential increased extinction rates. In order to construct existing borderwalls, dozens of laws protecting our environment, public health, and sacred natural lands were waived. Our nation’s natural habitats, vibrant wildlife, and healthy ecosystems are an unacceptable sacrifice to make for ineffective security measures. For all of the above reasons, we strongly urge you to vote NO on the Fiscal Year 2018 Security Minibus, and oppose funding for border walls, levees, or additional infrastructure along the southern border of the United States. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely,

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter signed by 18 environmental groups opposed to H.R. 3219. 
JULY26, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of our millions of members, the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose H.R. 3219, the socalled Make American Secure Appropriations Act, 2018, which includes the Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water funding bills. This package includes provisions that are harmful to water and ocean resources, cuts funding for clean energy innovation, undermines safe nuclear waste storage, and attacks border communities. Furthermore, this bill continues the House Leadership’s pattern of adding harmful policy riders into spending bills in an attempt to avoid regular order. Lastly, the inclusion of $1.6 billion for the continued construction of a failed, divisive, and antienvironmental wall along the southern border of the United States would be the latest example of inserting harmful, controversial and even radical policy proposals onto spending bills, which undermines the legislative process and the already complex budget process. This bill reflects a set of values that is not shared by the American people—one of clean air and clean water, one of equity and prosperity, one of safety and security. 
BORDER WALL PROVISIONS  The border wall is a powerful symbol of hatred toward immigrants and undermines the civil rights of communities along our southern border, and it would increase the environmental and natural disaster risks to border communities, harm wildlife, and waste billions of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective border security tool. The current proposal would lead to the construction of 60 miles of new border wall to be built in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, including leveeborder walls and 2.9 miles built within the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge. This refuge is home to diverse wildlife species, ecotourism opportunities, and rich natural beauty. When leveeborder walls are constructed, they negatively impact wildlife migration, pose severe flooding risks, destroy natural habitats, and can increase the risk of wildlife extinctions occurring. In order to construct existing border walls, dozens of laws protecting our environment, public health, and sacred natural lands were waived. Our nation’s natural habitats, vibrant wildlife, and healthy ecosystems are an unacceptable sacrifice to make for ineffective security measures. 
WATER PROVISIONS  The Energy and Water Appropriations division includes damaging policy riders and report language in contravention of regular order. Specifically, Sec. 108(a) aims to allow the Trump administration to disregard countless laws as it carries out a scheme to undermine clean water safeguards. The provision would authorize EPA and the Army Corps to repeal the Clean Water Rule without following basic and longstanding processes aimed at giving people a voice in their government’s actions. For instance, a repeal could ignore Clean Water Act and Administrative Procedure Act requirements to meaningfully consider public comment. It could also interfere with the courts’ ability to review if the withdrawal is ‘‘arbitrary or capricious.’’ This fact reveals the real motivation for the rider—its proponents want to shield the Trump administration’s repeal of carefullydeveloped clean water protections from public scrutiny and from independent judicial review. Without the Clean Water Rule, the streams that help supply public drinking water systems serving one in three Americans will remain at risk. Additionally, Sec. 107 would exempt certain discharges of dredged or fill material from Army Corps’ permitting under the Clean Water Act. The Act already exempts these kinds of activities from such permits, but requires permitting when the impacts to waterways would be more harmful. This rider would have the effect of nullifying Congress’s direction to subject those nonexempt discharges to pollution control officials’ review. Another rider would undermine the restoration of the San Joaquin River, the second longest river in California. Sec. 203 would prohibit spending any funds to implement the legal settlement between the United States, fishing and conservation groups, and Friant water users regarding the restoration of the river. The settlement ended 20 years of litigation and continues to be supported by water users, conservation and fishing groups, and state and federal governments. Finally, the bill also includes a provision to halt implementation of the National Ocean Policy (Sec. 505), an important planning tool to coordinate the work of dozens of federal and state agencies with overlapping and sometimes conflicting responsibilities for addressing ocean development. These riders, and any further damaging policy provisions that will be offered, undercut the public process for determining how to implement the laws that Congress has passed. They are bad policies that will put American’s health and safety at risk and they have no place on a funding bill. ENERGY PROVISIONS  The bill also dramatically cuts federal clean energy spending, which has consistently proven its worth by directing RD&D funds that drive job creation, economic growth and reduce health and environmental costs. The committee bill cuts funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by $1 billion (48% reduction) hurting important programs that support the development and deployment of wind energy, solar energy, advanced manufacturing, sustainable transportation technologies, and building technologies. Recklessly, the bill eliminates funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy (ARPA–E) and the Title 17 loan guarantee program. Defunding ARPA–E cripples our ability to commercialize new technologies that will serve to meet our future clean energy needs. Furthermore, the Title 17 loan guarantee program has a strong track record of lowering the risks on deploying projects that can make cleaner and cheaper energy a reality. The bill also includes $120 million in a continued attempt to push the unworkable, long ago rejected proposal to dispose of nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. It also includes a rider in Sec. 507 that prevents funds being used to close the facility. Decades from now others will face the precise predicament we find ourselves in today if Congress tries to ram through unworkable nuclear waste solutions contentiously opposed by States, lacking a sound legal structure of sciencebased foundation, and devoid of public understanding and consent. The current efforts to quickly open Yucca Mountain and an interim storage facility simply will not work. This bill also rejects the sensible plan to cancel the risky and enormously costly mixed oxide (MOX) program, intended to dispose of excess plutonium from the U.S. nuclear weapons program by turning it into nuclear reactor fuel. Instead this bill mandates that the Department of Energy waste an additional $340 million on construction of the MOX fuel fabrication plant. Congress should reject the MOX program and support an improved approach for disposing of excess plutonium. We strongly oppose this minibus package, which would put our energy future at risk and would harm border communities, and it includes poison pill riders that will harm our nation’s public health, air, water, lands, and wildlife. We also urge opposition to any amendments that would harm health and the environment.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Coalition on Human Needs against this minibus. 
COALITION ON HUMAN NEEDS , Washington, DC, July 25, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the Coalition on Human Needs, I strongly urge you to vote against the package of military related appropriations bills expected to come to the House floor this week. These appropriations bills—including those for Defense, Military Construction and Veterans’ Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water— should not be taken up until there is a bipartisan agreement to lift the sequestration caps called for in the Budget Control Act in a way that provides for increased funding for domestic and international (nondefense discretionary, or NDD) appropriations, not just for the military. As you know, defense appropriations exceed the Budget Control Act cap for FY 2018 by $72 billion. Without legislation to raise the caps, sequestration will eliminate that increase through acrosstheboard cuts to military programs. Legislation to lift the caps requires bipartisan support, and we expect that support will not be forthcoming without an agreement to raise the caps for nondefense discretionary spending as well. The Coalition on Human Needs, which is made up of organizations representing millions of human service providers, faith organizations, policy experts, civil rights, labor, and other advocates concerned with meeting the needs of lowincome and vulnerable people, strongly believes that our national security depends on a balanced approach that invests in our domestic needs. Our people gain economic security from access to education and training, affordable housing, a reliable and modern infrastructure, and child care 
and other work supports. We need public health protections from epidemics and environmental protections to ensure clean air and water and to protect against climate disasters. Stopping the erosion in domestic human needs programs is necessary for our security and our future. NDD programs apart from Veterans Affairs will be cut by $22 billion in FY 2018, 5 percent below the previous year and 17 percent below the level in FY 2010, taking inflation into account. This harsh cut abandons previous congressional commitments to provide defense and nondefense programs with equal relief from sequestration. We urge you to vote against this package of defenserelated bills because they should not be considered without a comprehensive agreement to lift the caps for all the programs that contribute to our security. We also ask you to vote against this package of appropriations bills because it includes wasteful funding for the border wall that will not increase our security, and to oppose extraneous and irresponsible policy riders such as those restricting opportunities for young people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to enter the military or weakening the Congressional Budget Office. Please vote no on this package of appropriations bills, and instead make it a top priority to achieve a bipartisan agreement to lift sequestration caps for nondefense programs, not solely for the military. Sincerely yours, DEBORAH WEINSTEIN , Executive Director. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter to my colleagues from AFSCME opposed to this bill. 
AFSCME, Washington, DC, July 24, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose the ‘‘Minibus’’ appropriations bill which packages together the Defense, Military Construction and Veterans’ Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water funding bills. Congress should not craft funding bills that unilaterally violate the Budget Control Act (BCA) and the parity principle. In this case, defense is increased far above the cap while nondefense discretionary (NDD) spending is severely underfunded. In fact, passing this bill will not promote American security; rather it charts a direct course for deep cuts to the military. The defense funding levels would trigger sequestration in January of 2018, requiring cuts of $72 billion. Further, dramatically increasing only defense funding endangers investments in essential public services. This is evidenced by House Appropriations bills’ deep cuts of $5 billion below the current nondefense caps and deep cuts that harm labor, health, human services, education, housing, transportation and other important programs. Instead of reaching a bipartisan agreement as called for by many members of Congress, this bill makes it harder to address urgent needs in other nondefense programs. A budget deal remains the most likely path toward enactment of appropriation bills that responsibly meet the nation’s national security commitments and domestic needs. AFSCME urges Congress to focus attention on a budget solution that provides commensurate increases for both defense and nondefense funding. This is the best way to avoid a fall budget showdown that would leave defense and all government programs, including state and local governments, in the lurch with considerable budget uncertainty and the threat of deep and damaging cuts. We also oppose this minibus package, because it includes poison pill riders. This bill creates a new level of egregious riders by air dropping in controversial funding for a border wall that is unrelated to any of the four bills. It’s time to address the most basic of congressional responsibilities, which means passing clean funding bills in a timely manner under regular order. Sincerely, SCOTT FREY, Director of Federal Government Affairs. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, finally, I include in the RECORD a letter sent to my colleagues in opposition to this bill from American Federation of Teachers. 
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS , Washington, DC, July 26, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the American Federation of Teachers, I write to express our strong opposition to the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3219), the fiscal year 2018 appropriations ‘‘minibus’’ bill that bundles together the appropriations bills for defense, energy and water development, military construction, Veterans Affairs and the legislative branch. We oppose this bill because it moves in the wrong direction by failing to lift the sequester caps in a manner that maintains parity between defense and nondefense discretionary funding, and by including ideological poison pill riders. Our national security is critical, but it requires investments that help working families seize the opportunities they need and deserve, and appropriations bills must invest in critical public services that enable these opportunities. Sequester caps have unduly restricted these kinds of foundational investments; without removing arbitrary caps, crucial investments will suffer. Yet instead of working toward a bipartisan deal to lift these punitive funding caps in a way that treats nondefense discretionary funding equitably, the speaker is moving forward with a minibus package that promotes a strategy to drastically cut nondefense programs as a means to increase defense funding. This must not be an eitheror choice: National security requires strength at home and opportunities for our next generation, not the elimination of the funding they need to create those opportunities. In addition, the wellbeing of the nation is further undermined in this bill by the inclusion of ideological poison pill policy riders. We particularly object to the inclusion of funding for an illconceived and meanspirited border wall that is unrelated to any of the four appropriations bills included in the minibus. As the defense portion of this bill violates the Budget Control Act, the increases in funding proposed by this bill are imaginary. The cuts this bill proposes are not. I urge you to reject this bill and work to raise the sequester caps, to allow balanced funding bills—ones that adequately invest in the health, safety and education of our nation, and do not include ideological poison pill policy riders—to move forward. Until this has been accomplished, we urge you to oppose this bill. Sincerely, RANDI WEINGARTEN , President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my good friend from Oklahoma: The Republicans presided over the most closed Congress in history in the last session. In history. And this year you are on your way to beating that record. The gentleman talks about exceptional speed in which we are moving these appropriations bills to the floor. I am not so much impressed with exceptional speed when it comes to the spending of billions of taxpayer dollars. I want to make sure we get it right. That is why we are asking for an open process. The gentleman talked about poison pills. Let me go back to the Barbara Lee AUMF amendment. I hardly consider that a poison pill when it was unanimously approved in the Appropriations Committee, and the gentleman even voted for it. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN). Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, vote against the rule, vote against the bill. But the bill does contain one provision that I want to applaud the committee for including, and that is section 8907, which states: ‘‘None of the funds made available by this act may be used in contravention of the War Powers Act.’’ I first proposed this language in 2011. It failed at first, but now it has been included in every Defense Appropriations bill since FY12. It is necessary to enforce the War Powers Act because every Attorney General since the 1970s has advised Presidents that the War Powers Act isn’t binding on the President, and that the President can send unlimited numbers of troops anywhere in the world to fight any battle without a declaration of war. That is why we need this language, because Attorney General Mukasey, a Republican Attorney General, testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that by including this language in the appropriations bill, Congress enforces the War Powers Act and its proper role in international affairs. I thank the committee for including this language. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I certainly would never expect my friend to vote for the rule. I mean, I don’t think I have ever voted for a Democratic rule. I know very few Democrats have ever voted for our rules. I don’t think I know any. So that is kind of a normal part of the Chamber. I want to commend the gentleman for getting that language into the bill. Again, I respect the gentleman’s right to not vote for the bill. It is a big bill. There are lots of different things in it. But I think he makes an important point, indirectly, that there are lots of overlapping things where we do agree inside this bill. My friends are certainly free to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I suspect many will. There are many occasions in a bill like this, particularly related to defense and particularly related to veterans, where the component parts actually have enormous bipartisan support. 
That is certainly true in the Veterans Administration. It is certainly true with the gentleman’s provision that he has gotten in now successive bills even under Republican Congresses. I want to commend him for his work in that regard. I agree very much with his intention. My friend from Massachusetts and I may have some differences on this and that process, but that is another person that I agree with in terms of the War Powers Act and in terms of trying to get a new AUMF and reclaim congressional power. I actually think, strangely enough, even though we disagree on this, that this bill starts us maybe down that road again by requiring the administration to submit a report to justify legally where we are at and why, to tell us the strategy, to lay out the costs. I commend my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. ROYCE , for holding a hearing on that. I see us moving back in that way toward regular order and, hopefully, toward common ground. Again, I understand my friend’s objections, even when I don’t agree with him. But I also thank my friend from California for pointing out that there are parts where we do agree. They are important, and they are incorporated in this bill. Maybe we can make it better in the amendment process. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I include in the RECORD a letter from Amnesty International rejecting the border wall funding. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL , Washington, DC, July 26, 2017. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA U RGES HOUSE  
TOREJECT SOUTHERN BORDER WALLFUNDING  DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of Amnesty International USA and our more than one million members and supporters nationwide, we strongly urge you to reject any and all requests included in H.R. 3219 (Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018 AKA Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018) for the funding of a southern border wall. The construction of such a wall would pose serious human rights consequences and would violate international law and standards in two major ways. First, Congress should not approve funding for a wall that will cut through tribal land unless the U.S. government first obtains the free, prior, and informed consent of affected Nations, as prescribed by Article 19 of the United Nations (‘‘UN’’) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The U.S. must consult in good faith with Native American Nations who would be impacted by the construction of the proposed wall. The National Congress of American Indians and the Legislative Council of the Tohono O’odham, the secondlargest tribe in the United States by land holdings, have both passed resolutions opposing the construction of the wall without tribal consent. Without the free, prior, and informed consent of affected Native American Nations, the House cannot approve border wall funding without violating the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Second, the construction of a border wall risks escalation of the already serious violations experienced by asylum seekers seeking to enter the U.S. In order to provide a fair asylum process, the U.S. must ensure the existence of sufficiently located, secure, regulated border crossing points for asylum seekers. This is essential to ensure that the U.S. government does not violate the principle of nonrefoulement, which is enshrined in the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and binding on States Party to the 1967 Protocol. Amnesty International strongly urges you to reject funding for a southern border wall, in order to uphold U.S. obligations with respect to Native Americans and arriving asylum seekers. Sincerely, JOANNE LIN, Senior Managing Director, Advocacy and Government Relations. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter opposing the funding for the wall from the League of United Latin American Citizens. 
LEAGUE OF UNITED LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS , Washington, DC, July 19, 2017. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the nation’s oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization, I write to oppose any legislative attempts to keep funding the construction of a wall on the U.S.Mexico border, the expansion of a Trump deportation force, and the increase of detention beds in immigrant incarceration centers. As the House moves to consider the Fiscal Year 18 Department of Homeland Security Appropriation bill, and other security related bills, LULAC is deeply concerned about language that would provide billions for the construction of a costly and divisive wall along the Southern border, as well as hundreds of millions to hire a deportation force and expand immigrant incarceration. The continued criminalization of immigrants, militarization of the border, and rush to build a costly, ineffective, and destructive wall on the U.S.Mexico border are aims of radical politicians seeking to advance a xenophobic, antiLatino agenda in this Congress. Unfortunately, this administration has failed to focus on legitimate staffing concerns at ports of entry, rebuilding port infrastructure, and protecting the land, water, and environment of the border. Instead, it is looking to seize the private property of border residents, destroy the natural habitat and wildlife in border communities, endanger border water supplies, and turn immigrant neighbors, families, and children into criminals who merit incarceration and deportation. The House of Representatives should not enable these aims and should oppose any language seeking to advance the radical right wing agenda of demonizing border communities and scapegoating immigrants. LULAC opposes any DHS appropriation bill, or any other appropriation vehicle, that funds border walls/levees, the hiring of Trump’s deportation force and the continued expansion immigrant incarceration. Sincerely, ROGER C. R OCHA , Jr., LULAC National President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. I include in the RECORD a fact sheet by the Washington Office on Latin America entitled: ‘‘Key points about the $1.6 billion border wall.’’ JULY24, 2017. Please find below a rigorously sourced analysis of the $1.6 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.Mexico border. The border wall funding is expected to be attached to the appropriations ‘‘minibus’’ in the Rules Committee later this week. As a leading research and advocacy organization with years of field research and experience working on migration and border security issues, WOLA (the Washington Office on Latin America) outlines a number of reasons why this proposal will be costly, ineffective, and divisive. WOLA believes that these are overwhelming reasons to oppose President Trump’s request for a border wall and to vote against its inclusion in a bill claiming to fund national security. Regardless of party, it is clear that $1.6 billion spent to start building the wall is money wasted. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like more information. Best regards, ADAMISACSON . [From the Washington Office on Latin America, July 24, 2017] KEYPOINTS ABOUT THE $1.6 B ILLION BORDER  WALL 
WALL DOESN ’T BELONG IN A ‘‘NATIONAL SECU RITY’’ APPROPRIATION  The House of Representatives is rushing to the floor four Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 appropriations bills related to national security, which will be combined into a socalled ‘‘minibus.’’ In addition, the House Republican leadership is expected to carve out the most controversial part of the Homeland Security appropriations bill—President Trump’s full request to fund the border wall—and use a procedural maneuver in the Rules Committee to attach it to this week’s funding bill. Along with money for our military, veterans, and other defenserelated items, the House is expected to consider $1.6 billion to start building President Trump’s proposed border wall. 
THE BORDER WALL WOULD BE COSTLY  The bill would fund the Trump administration’s full request for $1.6 billion to build 60 miles of new border wall and fortify 14 miles of existing wall. That comes out to $21.2 million per mile. This is more than four times the $4.84 million per mile cost of fencing built since 2011. At the rate proposed by President Trump, building additional fencing along the 1,317 border miles that lack it would cost $28 billion. And that figure doesn’t count the cost of building in more difficult terrain, access roads, maintenance, or acquiring land in Texas, where almost all border landholdings are privately held. Building the wall carries a huge opportunity cost. $1.6 billion could support many more important border security priorities. These include upgrading and hiring more personnel for ports of entry, the main vector for illegal drugs. The ports have $5 billion in unmet infrastructure needs. They could include more technology so that bordersecurity agencies have a better idea of what is happening along the border. This would make continued National Guard deployments unnecessary. They could include greatly increased investment in moving costs and bonuses for Border Patrol agents who agree to relocate from quieter border sectors to busier ones in need of manpower. 
THE BORDER WALL WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE  The proposed border wall will not stop drug trafficking. To understand drug trafficking across the U.S.Mexico border, it’s first necessary to understand the difference 
between ‘‘ports of entry’’—the 44 official land border crossings—and the vast spaces between them, where fencing exists or where Trump’s wall would be built. The ports of entry are where U.S. border authorities seize the majority of heroin and opioids, methamphetamine, and cocaine. ‘‘The big issue, really, right now on drugs coming into the United States is the ports of entry,’’ Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told a Senate committee in April. Building a wall would have no effect on smuggling at ports of entry. Meanwhile, in the rural border areas where the White House proposes to build, a wall really isn’t much of a barrier. It slows individuals down for the 10 or 15 minutes it takes to climb over. In a populated area, where authorities can respond quickly, that 10 or 15 minutes makes a big difference. But almost all of these areas already have high fences, because of the hundreds of miles of building that followed the Secure Fence Act of 2006. In emptier areas, reducing a border crosser’s head start by 10 to 15 minutes is hardly a deterrent—and in Texas, the Rio Grande already serves that purpose. 
THE BORDER WALL WOULD BE DANGEROUS  More wallbuilding could have tragic consequences. Violence, poverty, and family ties ensure that migrants will continue attempting the risky journey through the border region’s inhospitable wilderness zones. Every year, U.S. authorities find the remains of hundreds of migrants, dead of dehydration and exposure in deserts and scrublands. With more fencing, migrants may attempt the crossing in even more remote areas, where the probability of death will be even higher. 
THE BORDER WALL WOULD BE DIVISIVE  Building a wall sends a toxic message to one of our two closest neighbors, a country on whose cooperation the United States’ national security and economic prosperity depends. Mexico is the United States’ third largest trading partner. Our common border is 1,970 miles long. Mexico collaborates on efforts to guard against extraregional terrorists hypothetically using its territory to enter the United States. After 12 years of steadily declining migration, more Mexican citizens leave the United States than enter it each year. In January, it extradited its most notorious drug lord to the United States. It makes no sense to undermine this relationship by building a permanent barrier along our border with Mexico. It makes no sense to jeopardize badly needed cooperation by portraying Mexico as a sinister source of threats that should foot the bill for the wall (which, the 2018 appropriation makes clear, it will not have to do). Mexico certainly has problems, particularly corruption and human rights abuse. But these are aspects of the relationship the United States must work on, rather than push Mexico away with an aggressive construction project. 
THE BORDER WALL SHOULD BE REJECTED  WOLA believes that these are overwhelming reasons to oppose President Trump’s request for a border wall and to vote against its inclusion in a bill claiming to fund national security. Regardless of party, it is clear that $1.6 billion spent to start building the wall is money wasted. Let’s stop this now before it becomes even larger, more costly, more counterproductive, and more divisive. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD an NBC News article on how the border wall is being planned to decimate the National Butterfly Center in the wildlife corridor of the lower Rio Grande Valley. [From NBC News, July 26, 2017] BORDER WALL PUSH CREATES FLAP IN  HOUSE —AND AT THE NATIONAL BUTTERFLY  CENTER  (By Suzanne Gamboa) WASHINGTON .—A national butterfly preserve is the latest flashpoint in the border wall debate as Democrats accuse the GOP of rigging the process to slip wall funding into a pack of House spending bills possibly up for a vote this week. While there are not specific details on exactly where $1.6 billion proposed for President Trump’s border wall will be spent, an amendment sponsored by Rep. JOHNCARTER , R–Texas, calls for $498 million to go to 28 miles of ‘‘new bollard levee wall’’ in Hidalgo County in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley—home to the National Butterfly Center. The amendment also calls for $251 million to repair secondary border fencing in the San Diego area and $38.2 million for planning future border wall construction. Another $784 million is for 32 miles of ‘‘border bollard fencing’’ in Starr County, Texas, also in the Rio Grande Valley. The butterfly center’s executive director Marianna Trevin˜o Wright said she found a work crew on the butterfly center’s property last week, and she worried that their efforts might be related to construction of the proposed border wall. The workers had chain saws and work trucks and had cut and shred brush, trees and plants, she said. Trevin ˜o Wright said she found surveyor stakes and ‘‘X’’ marks on the property. She posted photos on the center’s web site and Facebook page. The 100acre center is part of the wildlife corridor of the lower Rio Grande Valley, which is a migratory flyway for birds, butterflies and a host of other wildlife. The center’s property already is bisected by earthen levees. Two thirds of the property is below the levee, Trevin˜o Wright said. ‘‘The property we have acquired here used to be a commercial onion farm and we have spent the last 15 years fundraising for our efforts and growing plants and purchasing materials to revegetate this area, to plant native, host and nectar plants and provide breeding and feeding areas to support wildlife, especially butterflies,’’ she said. ‘‘We do have folks who come from around the state, nation, world for the birds and butterflies and other things we have here on the property. Sometimes people show up looking for indigo snakes,’’ Trevin ˜o Wright said. In a previously issued statement, the Army Corps of Engineers denied that its contractors cleared or removed trees at the center, but acknowledged the crew placed X markings on the ground for mapping and wooden stakes flagging proposed locations to bore holes for possible construction. The agency said its contractor collected two soil samples from the levee but did so away from the butterfly center. Neither U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Army Corps of Engineers, nor other agencies have outlined plans for the proposed border wall on the center property. Still, Trevin˜o Wright and her supporters worry about what the center called on Facebook the ‘‘government secret activity on our property.’’ There also is angst over the possibility of border wall construction in another refuge along the Rio Grande—the San Ana Wildlife Refuge. It is considered the ‘‘crown jewel’’ of wildlife refuges and one of the nation’s top birding spots. The Texas Observer first reported that crews were taking core samples, setting off a reaction among birders who flock to the spot that boasts 400 species of birds. The American Birding Association put out a plea to its members to write and call their members of Congress asking that they stop construction of the wall. Carlos Diaz, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, told NBC News he did not have information on what plans or hopes there are for putting fencing or a wall on the butterfly center’s property or the Santa Ana Refuge. In a previously issued news release following a meeting with Rio Grande Valley mayors last week, Customs and Border Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers said in a news release they are conducting research activities in areas slated for construction of new or replacement border wall, with $20 million in reprogrammed funds approved by Congress. Also money provided for fiscal 2017 is being used to replace pedestrian barriers in San Diego and El Centro, California; replace vehicle barriers and pedestrian barriers in El Paso, Texas and install 35 new gates at gaps in border fencing built already in the Rio Grande Valley, according to Army Corps of Engineers information provided by Diaz. In a hearing Monday held by the U.S. House Rules Committee, Rep. Jim McGovern, D–Mass., pointed out that American taxpayers are footing the tab for the border wall work, not Mexico as Trump had promised. That’s a point that should be debated and could be if the border wall funding was given it’s own vote, he said. ‘‘This is a rigged process,’’ McGovern said. With Congress closing in on a summer recess, the House is trying to push through a batch of four spending bills the GOP has said are critical for security. But the GOP plan to include $1.6 million for 74 miles of President Donald Trump’s border ‘‘wall’’ means those who oppose the border wall funding have to vote against the military spending. Rep. Pete Sessions, R–Texas, who chairs the Rules Committee, said Monday he made the amendment providing the border wall money ‘‘selfexecuting,’’ setting up the dilemma for opponents of the wall funding. ‘‘You are dadgum right I put it in there,’’ Sessions said. ‘‘We are going to comply with allowing the president to have things he wants also,’’ he said. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D–Ariz., called the move ‘‘sneaky’’ and said House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP House members were doing Trump’s ‘‘dirty work.’’ ‘‘They want to make sure Trump can build his wall, but they also want desperately to avoid a clean up or down vote on the issue,’’ Gallego told reporters in a call Monday. Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, said in an email that House and Senate Republicans’ agenda includes a commitment to increased border security ‘‘and we are following through on that promise.’’ 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, process matters. And I have come to the conclusion, after having served here for some time now, that a lousy process leads to a lousy product and lousy legislation. I know many of my colleagues were moved, like I was yesterday, when Senator JOHNMCCAINappeared on the Senate floor and not only engaged in Senate business, but actually gave a very eloquent, passionate speech. I want to quote Senator MCCAINfrom yesterday. He said: ‘‘Let’s return to regular order. We’ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle. 
That’s an approach that’s been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side, with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires. ‘‘We’re getting nothing done.’’ I agree with Senator MCCAIN, and I believe that a majority in this House, Democrats and Republicans, agree with Senator MCCAIN. But at some point we have to stop saying: ‘‘Well, we will get better. We will get better. It will be better next time. It will be better next time.’’ Because what is happening is, it is getting worse each time we bring legislations or appropriations to the floor. We are getting more and more restrictive. We are shutting out more and more voices, not just Democratic voices, but Republican voices as well. This is a deliberative body. We ought to be able to deliberate a little bit. And both Democrats and Republicans have good ideas. Let us use this opportunity to change things, to go back to the regular order that Senator MCCAINtalked so eloquently about yesterday. There is an opportunity to do that. It doesn’t stop us considering the appropriations bills, but what it says is that we will do so under an open rule. We will go back to the way we all say we want it to be, an open process. If you like some of these amendments, you vote for them. You make this legislation better. If you don’t like the amendments, then you vote against them. I mean, that is the way this body is supposed to operate; none of this underhanded, selfexecuting of controversial provisions that may not have the support of the majority in this House. Let’s go back to regular order. This is the moment. This is a defining moment. b1330 Democrats and Republicans, if you really mean it when you say you want regular order, then you have to vote for regular order once in a while. You can’t keep on making excuses. I think this is the moment that we have on these appropriations bills to send a message to the leadership that we want things done differently here. We want to open things up. I think that is what the majority on both sides really want. But the question is whether or not we all have the guts to vote for an open process. So we have an opportunity to do that. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can bring this legislation up today under an open rule. Let everybody offer their amendments. Let’s bring it up. Let’s do this today. No more excuses. If you mean what you say when you say you want regular order, this is the opportunity to vote for it. So please vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. And I oppose the underlying bill. Maybe I won’t if we can fix it through regular order. Maybe we can add a number of amendments, and even I would support some of these amendments. Let’s give it a chance. Let’s work in a bipartisan way. Let’s go back to the days when we did have open rules on appropriations. This is the opportunity to do it. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank, as always, my good friend for a spirited and thoughtful debate. He always makes good points. Frankly, I always find myself more comfortable when we are on the same side—as we occasionally are— than when we are on opposite sides. My friend has made many valuable contributions to this institution, particularly pushing us relentlessly in the right direction of reclaiming our war making authority. Having said that, it is always great to call for a new system, a new way, or a return to open rules without admitting you are the ones that abandoned them. We actually tried to restore them. I regret we failed in that, quite frankly, but I will have to say both sides have gotten used to not doing open rules because they don’t want to cast tough votes. That is why my friends abandoned the open rule process when they were in the majority in 2009, and, honestly, that is why we abandoned it last year. I regret that. I will work with my friend probably not today but going forward in trying to reclaim that because I think when we lost it, we diminished the power of every individual Member in Congress. We thought we were protecting them, but the reality is they now can no longer come to the floor as an individual and present their own idea. But at least in this case there are 72 amendments. The majority of them are from my friend’s side of the aisle. I would hope going forward, particularly when we consider the next eight appropriations bills, we will continue to be very generous in that regard. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule. H.R. 3219 represents the first step toward fulfilling our primary obligation as Members of Congress: to fund the government. We should all be proud of what we have accomplished in putting this bill forward. The bill contains the provisions of four of the bills passed out of the Appropriations Committee representing the work of the Subcommittees on Defense; Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies; Legislative Branch; and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. The bill will significantly increase funding for national defense and ensure that the men and women in the Armed Forces have the tools they need. We also increase funding to our veterans to ensure our fighting men and women will be taken care of long after they leave the service of their country, and we fund key Member priorities in the areas of Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies; and Legislative Branch. Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for their hard work. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows:

THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is ENTITLED to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution .....  [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule .....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLE.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3210) to require the Director of the National Background Investigations Bureau to submit a report on the backlog of personnel security clearance investigations, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3210 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act of 2017’’ or the ‘‘SECRET Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. REPORT ON BACKLOG OF PERSONNEL SECURITY CLEARANCE INVESTIGATIONS. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and quarterly thereafter for 5 years, the Director of the National Background Investigations Bureau of the Office of Personnel Management shall submit to Congress a report on the backlog of security clearance investigations that includes— (1) the size of the personnel security clearance investigation process backlog; and (2) the average length of time, for each sensitivity level, to carry out an initial investigation and a periodic investigation. 
SEC. 3. REPORT ON SECURITY CLEARANCE INVESTIGATIONS OF PERSONNEL OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the National Background Investigations Bureau of the Office of Personnel Management shall submit to Congress a report that explains the process for conducting and adjudicating security clearance investigations for personnel of the Executive Office of the President, including White House personnel. 
Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the National Background Investigations Bureau of the Office of Personnel Management shall submit to Congress a report on the cost of duplicating resources under the control or direction of the National Background Investigations Bureau for implementation of the plan referenced in section 951(a)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (10 U.S.C. 1564 note). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 3210, the SECRET Act of 2017, introduced by my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ). Mr. Speaker, the backlog of security clearance investigations causes tremendous waste for Federal employees and contractors and jeopardizes our national security. There are thousands of jobs waiting to be filled in important national security positions and at least as many qualified Americans eagerly ready to fill them, but they can’t, because they are waiting on their background investigation. As of June 2017, the backlog stood at 650,000 clearances for employees, new hires, and contractors waiting either for an investigation or a reinvestigation. Many of those people are unable to perform their jobs while waiting, leading to contract delays and a pure waste of time. Mr. Speaker, in order to fix the problem, you have to start by understanding the problem. Fixing the background investigation backlog requires information on the size, scope, and nature of the problem. Currently, Congress receives information about the size of the backlog through briefings—only through briefings. We receive no regular data on the backlog and have no way to track progress over time. My colleagues from California and Virginia, Representative KNIGHT and Representative GERALD CONNOLLY , authored this bipartisan bill to provide Congress the information it needs to assess these backlog investigations. H.R. 3210, Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act, requires a simple quarterly report from the National Background Investigations Bureau known as NBIB. The report will disclose the size of the backlog and the average length of an investigation broken down by level of clearance. Additionally, this bill requires two nonpartisan reports to help Congress plan potential reforms to the background investigation security clearance process. NBIB will be required to issue a report describing the general security clearance procedure in the Executive Office of the President. The bill also requires NBIB to issue a report on the duplicative costs that would likely arise from transferring responsibility for background investigations to the Department of Defense. Like the quarterly backlog report, this report will help Congress determine whether proposed options to reduce the backlog would do so or actually would increase it. This bill is an important first step in addressing the security clearance investigation backlog, thereby reducing waste and increasing our Nation’s security. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan good government bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for his remarks. Congressman STEVE KNIGHT and I introduced H.R. 3210, the Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act, or SECRET, to enable Congress to monitor the efficiency of the background investigation process. This bipartisan bill was passed unanimously by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. H.R. 3210 imposes a commonsense requirement on the National Background Investigations Bureau to report to Congress on backlogs that develop in the background investigation process. Backlogs have plagued us in the past, as my friend from Michigan just said. In 2004, when the Department of Defense was the lead agency performing background investigations, the Government Accountability Office determined the backlog was 375 days, more than 1 year. Over 100,000 new investigations or reinvestigations were delayed by that backlog. In response, Congress transferred responsibility for those investigations to the Office of Personnel Management, and more recently, created the National Background Investigations Bureau within the Office of Personnel Management. H.R. 3210 will provide Congress with the transparency needed to conduct oversight of the National Background Investigations Bureau and to help prevent backlogs like that in the future. I am also pleased that the bill includes an amendment I offered in committee to require a report to Congress on duplicative costs to assist us in making decisions that protect taxpayers. Last year, a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act asked the Department of Defense to develop a separate plan, to transfer responsibility for those background investigations of DOD personnel to the Pentagon instead of the National Background Investigations Bureau. The Bureau would continue to perform other background investigations for all the other government agencies, except the Pentagon. If that plan were implemented, resources and capabilities that are currently under the direction of the Bureau would have to be duplicated by the Department of Defense. H.R. 3210 would require a report to Congress on the cost of those duplicative resources and efforts. For Congress 
to make an informed choice on who should be responsible for conducting background investigations, we have got to know the costs. Finally, the Oversight Committee also adopted an amendment offered by my friend and colleague, the Congressman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ), that would require a report on the process for performing and adjudicating background investigations for personnel in the Executive Office of the President. This would help Congress ensure that those with access to the most sensitive information in the White House are thoroughly vetted. And I thank the gentleman for his thoughtful amendment which also passed unanimously in our committee. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 3210. I am proud to be the original Democratic cosponsor. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ), the sponsor of the bill. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. CONNOLLY for his help and his partnership in the SECRET Act. Today, I rise in support of this straightforward bipartisan legislation, the SECRET Act, or Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act. I am proud to say that this bill originated from concerns voiced by my constituents. California’s 25th District serves as a hub for many national security programs, and by extension, requires a highly skilled, security cleared industrial base and workforce. But this doesn’t just affect southern California. This is a national issue and must be addressed now. Many employers are either unable to recruit workers due to excessive backlog of security clearance investigations or are forced to place employees in unfulfilling positions while they wait unacceptable amounts of time for their investigations to be completed. b1415 Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate to live in a country with selfless citizens who seek to serve our Nation in critical national security positions and work towards safety at home and abroad. We need these bright minds to solve incredibly difficult problems and develop the next generation of Americanmade technology. We should reward them for choosing to work toward something greater than themselves, not punish them with jobs they don’t want just because our bureaucracies can’t move fast enough. I introduced the SECRET Act so Congress can do its job of oversight better. The transparency afforded in this bill will better inform us of how substantial the security clearance backlog is and how long it takes for investigations to be completed. Equipped with that information, we will hold the executive branch accountable and keep our country safe. I thank Chairman GOWDY and his committee staff for the diligent work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues for their support. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend, Mr. KNIGHT , for this bill. His leadership is really critical. In my district, like his, thousands and thousands of jobs are open because of this issue. We simply haven’t gotten the security clearances done in an expeditious way. We want them thorough, but we also, frankly, want our national security being addressed at full throttle, and that means full employment in these jobs. I couldn’t agree more with his sentiments, and I thank him again for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ), my friend and colleague and one of the upandcoming stars of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding, and I thank Mr. KNIGHT and Mr. M ITCHELL for their leadership on this. I also want to thank Ranking Member ELIJAH CUMMINGS for all that he has done to try to get the answers about executive branch background checks. For over 6 months, various Oversight and Government Reform Committee members have been working to get basic answers from the White House about its process for granting security clearances. In a February 2017 hearing, my colleague, Congresswoman PLASKETT , asked the Director of the National Background Investigations Bureau if any senior administration officials with access to sensitive material were under criminal investigation. Chairman Chaffetz specifically asked the Office of Personnel Management to get back to Representative PLASKETT  about her request. Unfortunately, neither OPM nor NBIB have answered these basic questions. That is why I am pleased that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee unanimously adopted my amendment during consideration of H.R. 3210 last week. My amendment is very simple. It requires the NBIB to report to Congress on the process for conducting and adjudicating security clearances at the White House. This bill is a necessary first step for Congress to conduct the oversight necessary to ensure that all personnel in the U.S. Government, regardless of administration, regardless of office, regardless of the President who happens to be in office at the time, will be thoroughly vetted and will not pose a threat to our national security. I encourage all Members to support this bipartisan bill. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this issue that Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI refers to is an issue that spans administrations and requires attention not for partisan matters, but for the safety and security of our country. I am pleased with the amendment. I supported the amendment in committee, and, as noted, it did pass unanimously. The reason I support this bill is because it pursues some commonsense goals. Think about it: 650,000 outstanding requests, and the only way we get information on that is we get a briefing, no routine reporting. I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for those comments, and I again thank him for his leadership. I thank Mr. KNIGHT for his vision for this bill. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor, and I am pleased to make sure this was shepherded through committee on a unanimous vote. I think we all recognize the criticality of classified background checking to make sure people trusted with our Nation’s secrets, in fact, have been properly checked and vetted. But, on the other hand, backlogs hurt our national security, and so expediting it and accelerating reporting on it are really critical, it seems to me, for both intelligence, homeland security, and defense work that protects our citizens. This is a very important step forward, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as I noted, I am new here in Congress, and I was astonished to find that we had no routine reporting on security clearances. I was astonished to find how much of a backlog we face and the damage it is doing to national security inefficiency. I support this bill because it pursues a commonsense goal: transparency and efficient operation of the government. I support the amendment on transparency on oversight of the clearances in the White House because I think it is something that should have happened a long time ago. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3210, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ), the author of this measure. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman MCCLINTOCK as well as the great leadership of the House Natural Resources Committee. This legislation impacts residents on Navarre Beach and Pensacola Beach in Florida’s First Congressional District. Some of those residents are now being double taxed because they have been forced to pay ad valorem property tax payments to the government in addition to lease payments. This legislation will grant fee simple title to these affected residents so that they are not double taxed and simply make an ad valorem payment like all other Floridians. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2370, introduced by Representative GAETZ , settles a longstanding land management issue in his Florida district. Specifically, the bill transfers land associated with the former Santa Rosa Island National Monument to Escambia County. Once it is transferred to Escambia County, the bill authorizes a second transfer to Santa Rosa County, without any conditions or further restrictions. The land in question was provided to the county by the Federal Government in 1947 under the condition it remain in use for a public purpose. In 1956, the county decided a 100year lease to neighboring Santa Rosa County was in the public interest. In the 61 years since, the counties have grown and prospered, but due to the terms of the original conveyance and subsequent lease, there is some confusion about Santa Rosa County’s power to tax. This bill will clear up some administrative challenges that have arisen out of this unusual arrangement, a goal that we support. However, it will also allow for developments that conflict with the terms of the original conveyance. As drafted, this bill authorizes activities that will do significant environmental damage to a fragile coastal barrier island and potentially lead to the privatization of land on Santa Rosa Island. Neither of these results is in the public interest or consistent with congressional intent. Congress granted Escambia County this land with one condition, which this bill completely ignores. We understand how important this bill is for Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties, but honoring the original intent of this land grant is as important as well. It is our hope that we can work with our colleagues in the Senate to make improvements to this legislation that will continue to protect the interests of the American taxpayers in this land deal. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by assuaging the concerns raised by my friend from Missouri. A provision in the bill—and I will simply read it—I think, answers his concerns rather clearly. It says: ‘‘. . . the county shall preserve in perpetuity the areas of the nonFederal land that, as of the date of enactment of this act, are dedicated for conservation, preservation, public recreation access, and public parking, in accordance with any resolutions of the Board of Commissioners of the county.’’ 
As my friend has pointed out, Congress established the Santa Rosa National Monument and directed the Secretary of the Interior to convey the Federal land in the monument to Escambia County, Florida, back in 1946. Just 6 months later, the land was deeded to the county. Under the terms of the conveyance, Escambia County was given the authority to lease the property on Santa Rosa Island; however, they were not allowed to issue title on the property or otherwise dispose of it or reconvey it. In the intervening years since then, Santa Rosa Island has experienced tremendous economic growth. This growth prompted county leaders to assess property taxes on the leased lands. The imposition of taxes led to several lawsuits centered on the question of whether island residents and businessowners paying lease fees for their land could be taxed, despite not having outright ownership of the property. Courts have reached different conclusions based on differences in the language of particular leases, which has created fairness issues for the county governments of Escambia and Santa Rosa. One property may be subject to property taxes, while a virtually identical property next door may not. This uneven treatment has prompted interest in removing the deed restriction prohibiting reconveyance, which then allows the county governments to convey ownership and create a uniform tax treatment for all properties on the beach. Recently, both Escambia County and neighboring Santa Rosa County passed resolutions asking for a Federal solution to allow current Santa Rosa Island leaseholders the option of attaining fee simple title while protecting public access to the beaches and conservation areas on the island. I commend my colleague, Congressman GAETZ , for listening to his constituents and working to find a solution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate my friend from California for that explanation. Hopefully, my colleague, Representative GAETZ , will try to strike a balance between protecting our environment, protecting the pristine nature of that island, as well as looking out for the best interests of his constituents when this bill gets to the Senate. So, therefore, we will not oppose it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I would simply add that one of the overarching objectives of the Federal Lands Subcommittee is to restore the Federal Government as a good neighbor to those communities impacted by the public lands. This bill is an example of that principle at work, and I would urge adoption of the measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2370. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1430 AFRICAN AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS NETWORK ACT OF 2017 Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1927) to amend title 54, United States Code, to establish within the National Park Service the African American Civil Rights Network, and for other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? 
There was no objection. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1927, the African American Civil Rights Network Act, introduced by our distinguished committee colleague, Congressman LACY CLAY from Missouri, directs the National Park Service to identify and create a national network of historic sites, research facilities, and educational programs connected to the modern AfricanAmerican civil rights movement. The network will be comprised of existing units and programs of the National Park Service related to the AfricanAmerican civil rights movement as well as the properties and programs of other Federal, State, local, and private entities that join the network. Establishing this network of historic sites connected to the AfricanAmerican civil rights movement will help preserve the legacy and the struggle of the many courageous individuals who risked their lives to secure racial equality and to put the full measure of the Declaration of Independence and its sacred principles into action. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the African American Civil Rights Network Act of 2017, updated and bipartisan legislation that I was proud to introduce along with my distinguished colleague from Missouri’s Eighth Congressional District, Congressman JASON SMITH. I appreciate his leadership and true friendship as well. Our legislation, which has already earned 72 cosponsors, would authorize the National Park Service to establish a program to preserve and protect the memory of the people and places that were significant in the struggle to securing equal rights for African Americans during the 20th century’s civil rights era between 1939 and 1968. The purpose of this legislation is to recognize, protect, and share the remarkable American story of the modern struggle for civil rights, a unique national experience that touches every American regardless of their age, region, or heritage, and yet this very American story is often left untold, without the level of honesty and accuracy that it surely deserves. In fact, the generation now coming of age has only scant knowledge of the history of the civil rights struggle. Young Americans find it difficult to believe that racial segregation was once considered normal and necessary in the United States. I truly believe that the healing potential for this legislation is essential to bringing our Nation together. The historic network that H.R. 1927 would create would offer tremendous educational opportunities by recognizing those brave souls from all walks of life who fought to make the promises enshrined in our Constitution finally ring true for every American regardless of the color of their skin. Across this great country, precious historic waypoints along the routes of that still largely untold story are at risk of being lost forever. My hope is that the historic civil rights trails and the programs that will grow from this act will honestly tell the truth, the full and sometimes painful story of the struggle for civil rights, not just for African Americans, but to foster healing, tolerance, and understanding among all Americans. This bill is similar to legislation that created the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1998, which is currently administered by the National Park Service. It directs the Secretary of the Interior to identify and create a national network of historic sites, stories, research facilities, and educational programs connected to the modern AfricanAmerican civil rights movement. This legislation has also earned the strong support of the National Urban League, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the National Parks Conservation Association, and the NAACP. Mr. Speaker, let me also commend the gentleman from California for his support of this legislation that came out of his subcommittee. I appreciate his help and strong support of it. I look at this opportunity as something that we should all want to embrace the transformative power of the real American story. We should seize it. This bill advances that worthy goal for our Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support this important act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE). Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman MCCLINTOCK for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1927. Nearly a decade ago, the National Park Service, with the help of the Organization of American Historians, completed a study to help identify significant sites related to the modern civil rights movement. Through this effort, the National Park Service found that many sites with a connection to the movement had not been formally recognized and that many were in severe disrepair and at risk of being permanently lost. This legislation establishes a network of sites to include all National Park Service’s units and programs, as well as other Federal, State, local, and privately owned properties for the National Register of Historic Places. A similar network was created previously by Congress to identify and commemorate the sites and stories related to the underground railroad. This bill would allow the National Park Service to build partnerships with other public and private entities to help preserve the remaining sites. As part of my religious beliefs, I believe that knowing who you are, where you come from, is a foundation of knowing where you are and where you will be going. History teaches us important lessons that we need to learn and grow from. Because of great leaders like Martin Luther King, President Abraham Lincoln, Rosa Parks, and many unsung heroes, I am here today as a Member of Congress representing the great State of Utah. We can be proud of who we are and what we believe in, that all men are created equal in the eyes of God. It is imperative that here in the United States, that we don’t make people feel like victims, and that all Americans are not afraid of, but empowered by, their history and our future. Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative CLAY for his sponsorship of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1927. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to commend my colleague, Mrs. LOVE from Utah. And it goes to show you that we can reach across the aisle and find common ground. I appreciate her support of this legislation, as well as I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to reciprocate the kind words of the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY). It has been a pleasure working with him on this bill. Shakespeare put it best: 
This story shall a good man teach his son. 
This bill tells that story of how the full measure of our Nation’s founding principles came to fruition. I would ask for Members’ support and adoption of this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1927, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CALLING FOR UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF U.S. CITIZENS AND PERMANENT RESIDENTS HELD FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES BY THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 317) calling for the unconditional release of United States citizens and legal permanent resident aliens being held for political purposes by the Government of Iran, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 317 Whereas Iran has taken as hostages several United States citizens, including Siamak and Baquer Namazi and Xiyue Wang, as well as United States legal permanent resident, Nizar Zakka; Whereas Siamak Namazi was detained on October 15, 2015, falsely accused, and convicted on October 18, 2016, for ‘‘collaborating with a hostile government’’ and has been held for extended periods in solitary confinement and under constant interrogation; Whereas former UNICEF official Baquer Namazi, the 80year old father of Siamak Namazi, was detained on February 22, 2016, falsely accused, and sentenced to 10 years in prison for the same crime as his son; Whereas former United Nations Secretary General Ban Kimoon urged Iranian authorities to release Baquer Namazi, whose health status is deteriorating, to allow his family to care for him; Whereas UNICEF has issued four public statements on Baquer Namazi’s behalf; Whereas Xiyue Wang, a graduate student at Princeton University, was arrested in Iran on or about August 7, 2016, while studying Farsi and researching the late Qajar dynasty as background for his doctoral dissertation, detained by Iran in Evin prison for almost a year, falsely charged with espionage, and sentenced to 10 years in prison; Whereas Robert Levinson, a United States citizen and retired agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, traveled to Kish Island, Iran, and disappeared on March 9, 2007; Whereas the United States Government had ‘‘secured a commitment from the Iranians . . . to try and gather information about Mr. Levinson’s possible whereabouts’’ but has not received any information thus far; Whereas Nizar Zakka, a United States legal permanent resident alien and Lebanese national, who is also in a weakened physical state, was unlawfully detained around September 18, 2015, after presenting at a conference in Iran at Iran’s invitation, and was later falsely charged with being a spy and sentenced to 10 years at the Evin prison; Whereas, on April 13, 2017, the Department of the Treasury sanctioned the Tehran Prisons Organization and its former head, Sohrab Soleimani, and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer noted ‘‘The sanctions against human rights abusers in Iran’s prisons come at a time when Iran continues to unjustly detain in its prisons various foreigners, including US citizens Siamak Namazi and Baquer Namazi’’; Whereas, on April 25, 2017, at the meeting of the Joint Commission overseeing implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Department of State reported that the United States delegation had ‘‘raised with the Iranian delegation its serious concerns regarding the cases of U.S. citizens detained and missing in Iran, and called on Iran to immediately release these U.S. citizens so they can be reunited with their families’’; Whereas elements of the Iranian regime are reportedly using nationals, dualnationals, and permanent residents from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries to exact political or financial concessions; and Whereas reports indicate that the Government of Iran is seeking additional payments or other concessions, including relief from economic sanctions, from the families of hostages and their governments as a condition of release, a practice banned by the 1979 International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages and other international legal norms: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives— (1) calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to release unconditionally Siamak Namazi, Baquer Namazi, Xiyue Wang, Nizar Zakka, and any other United States citizen, legal permanent resident alien, or foreign national being unjustly detained in Iran; (2) urges the President to make the release of United States citizens and legal permanent resident aliens held hostage by the Government of Iran the highest of priorities; (3) requests that the United States and its allies whose nationals have been detained consider establishing a multinational task force to secure the release of the detainees; (4) urges the Government of Iran to take meaningful steps towards fulfilling its repeated promises to assist in locating and returning Robert Levinson, including immediately providing all available information from all entities of the Government of Iran regarding the disappearance of Robert Levinson to the United States Government; (5) encourages the President to take meaningful action to secure the release of Siamak Namazi, Baquer Namazi, Xiyue Wang, Nizar Zakka, and any other United States citizen, legal permanent resident alien, or foreign national being unjustly detained in Iran if the Government of Iran does not release such United States citizens, legal permanent resident aliens, and foreign nationals; and (6) encourages the President to take meaningful action to secure the return of Robert Levinson if the Government of Iran does not locate and return him. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this particular resolution calls for the unconditional release of American citizens and legal permanent residents that are being held as prisoners right now, being held in jail by the Iranian regime. I would like to begin by thanking the ranking member and the chair of our Middle East Subcommittee—and that is both Ms. ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , the chair, who is with us, and Mr. TED DEUTCH —for their tireless work on behalf of these victims and on behalf of the families. They have introduced this resolution along with Congresswoman NITALOWEY and Congressman Judge TEDPOE. The reason for it, as you all know, is that Iran just continues to engage in this despicable practice of detaining people who are visiting Iran, and then they come up with fabricated criminal charges, and then these innocent people are held captive; but not just held captive, it is the brutal conditions which they find themselves in. When we have talked to those and they have shown us what they have been through, these former prisoners in Iran, these Americans, they describe being subjected to electric shock, to forced drug withdrawal, through whippings, solitary confinement, they are denied medical care oftentimes, and routinely forced to sleep on the floor, if they are permitted to sleep at all. Right now we have a number of U.S. citizens, Siamak and Baquer Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and U.S. permanent resident Nizar Zakka. These U.S. citizens and permanent residents were imprisoned after being falsely accused of collaborating with a hostile government or accused of espionage. Their families are paralyzed with fear about how they are being treated. Why is Iran so intent on holding Americans on bogus politicized charges? It is because the Iranian regime believes it can use detained Americans as leverage to demand concessions, like ransom or sanctions relief, in violation of the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. b1445 U.S. citizen Robert Levinson, he is still missing, and this is after 10 years. He disappeared 10 years ago in Iran, and Iran has not remotely fulfilled its commitment to try to help locate him. Our committee has held multiple hearings with these prisoners’ families, most recently yesterday, when family Members testified before our Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, and we thank them for their bravery in sharing their stories. We stand in solidarity with these citizens and with their families as we call for their release. We can’t imagine the horror that one would be experiencing, but our hearts are with you, and we are committed to advocate on behalf of you and your loved ones. H. Res. 317 calls on Iran to let these Americans, and all individuals being unjustly detained by Iran, come home. And it also calls on Iran to fulfill its many promises to help find Bob Levinson. It also urges the President to prioritize release of these captives and encourages him to take meaningful action to secure their release. Last week, the administration called on Iran to release these unjustly detained U.S. citizens, or to face new and serious consequences. We appreciate the administration’s actions so far and, with this resolution, urge continual attention to this matter until all of these prisoners have been safely returned to their families. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of this measure. Let me thank Chairman ROYCE , because here again is another piece of legislation from the Foreign Affairs Committee that we have shown we can work together within a bipartisan manner; so I am pleased to stand with the chairman. I am also pleased to stand with the gentlewoman from Florida, former chairman, and my good friend as well, ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN . She is now chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, along with the resolution’s other lead sponsors, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ), the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee’s ranking member, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). We are here today to talk about Americans illegally detained by the Iranian regime, and those Americans have had no stronger champions than the Members I have mentioned before through the years. Mr. Speaker, it is just outrageous that the Government of Iran continues to hold American citizens and residents on trumpedup charges. Siamak Namazi and his 80yearold father, a former UNICEF official in poor health; Baquer Namazi; Karan Vafadari, an American citizen, and his wife, Afarin Niasari; Nizar Zakka, who was detained after attending a conference at Iran’s invitation; another American citizen who has been kept anonymous by family for fear of that person’s wellbeing; and, of course, Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran more than 10 years ago. How cruel—10 years. His family doesn’t know where he is. His family doesn’t know how he is. This is a regime, the Iranian regime, which talks about piety and religion, and they don’t have any feeling of humankind from one person to another. The detainment and disappearance of these people, and citizens of America’s friends and allies, the pain and suffering and uncertainty that their families endure every single day, and the lack of cooperation and information coming out of Tehran, are a pretty clear indication of how this regime operates and what its values are. The measure we are considering today underscores what Congress has said before: This behavior is unacceptable, and it must stop. We call on the government in Iran to release these men and women immediately, without precondition. The people of Iran are the real captives of this regime, but these American citizens are our citizens, and we demand their release. The Government of Iran must do what it has long promised by providing information on the disappearance of Robert Levinson, and we urge the Trump administration to make resolving this issue a top priority. So I am glad to stand with my colleagues on both sides to support this measure. I, again, thank my friend from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for, as always, outstanding, stellar, and heartfelt work on these issues. I thank Chairman ROYCE again, and all the people I mentioned before. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, the author of this measure. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE , as well as my good friend, the ranking member, Mr. ENGEL , for their help in bringing H. Res. 317 to the floor today and for their tireless efforts to hold the Iranian regime accountable for all of its illicit activity, including the taking of American citizens and U.S. legal permanent residents as hostages. They have been incredible supporters of this movement, and I thank them for their unwavering support. Of course, I want to thank Ranking Member NITALOWEY for her help—I had the opportunity of meeting one of the family members with her before this presentation—and Judge POE, who is always at our side; and my south Florida colleague and my dear friend, TEDDEUTCH , the ranking member on our Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee. We have all joined together in authoring and introducing this resolution. The resolution, Mr. Speaker, is important for all of us. But for TED DEUTCH , for my friend from south Florida, I know how very personal this is for him because it is his constituent, Bob Levinson, who continues to be held by Iran 10 years after his disappearance. Just yesterday, Ted and I convened a hearing in our Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee with some of the family members who are named in this very resolution. Doug Levinson, for example, Bob’s youngest child, testified. Babak Namazi, son of Baquer and brother of Siamak testified. Omar Zakka, son of Nizar, testified. All three of them testified before our subcommittee, and their stories were moving, they were heartfelt, and they were heartbreaking. Each one, along with their families, forced to live in their own personal hell. In Doug Levinson’s case, Mr. Speaker, he presented photos, emails, even videos of his father who, after more than 10 years, is the Nation’s longest held hostage in our history. What a sad distinction. We heard how Iran has reportedly and repeatedly failed to live up to its promise to assist in Bob’s case and help return him to his loved ones, including the five grandchildren that Bob has yet to meet. We heard Omar plead for his father’s life, as Nizar is now 1 month into his fifth hunger strike. But this time, Mr. Speaker, Nizar has vowed that there will be no turning back. Nizar says that he will continue with his hunger strike for himself and the others who are unjustly held by Iran, stating, it is ‘‘liberty or death; there is no turning back.’’ So can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, being 19 years old, a teenager, and he is testifying in front of us yesterday, and he is hearing his father say that he is willing to die in Iran in pursuit of truth and justice, and his throat was breaking as he is testifying in front of us. We also heard Babak distress over the health of his father and his brother, two loved ones. Mr. Namazi’s father has lost more than 30 pounds in Iran’s notorious prisons. He is 81 years old. He suffers from a severe heart condition. He had to be hospitalized twice in just the past few months. Babak fears that his father’s physical and mental condition—they are both rapidly deteriorating. His brother, he fears, has given up hope because of the horrific conditions he is being held under. He is kept in isolation. He is mentally abused. He is physically abused. That is horrifying. That is heartbreaking. Though we heard the sorrow in their voices, Mr. Speaker, we also heard defiance and determination. Defiant in accepting the Iranian regime’s absurd claims against Bob, against Baquer, against Siamak, against Nizar; defiant in accepting that their fates are sealed, that there is nothing more that can be done; defiant in remaining silent as their loved ones suffer under the terror regime in Tehran. We saw their determination—determination as each of the witnesses before us yesterday vowed that their fight is not nearly over, that they remain determined that they can force the return of their loved ones. And they looked to us, Mr. Speaker, they looked to us to use our positions as Members of the United States House of Representatives to pressure the Iranian regime to release all American citizens, all American legal permanent residents, unconditionally. They looked to us to demand that Iran be held accountable for its tactic of taking our people hostage in order to get financial or political concessions. They looked to us to stand up and to decry this practice for what it is—morally corrupt, ethically corrupt, and legally wrong. That is why NITA, and T ED, and Judge POE, and Chairman R OYCE , and Ranking Member ENGEL , and I introduced this resolution before us today, and that is why Ted and I convened our hearing yesterday; and that is why, today, I am urging all of our colleagues to stand in solidarity with us, with the family members, with the hostages, and demand that Iran release all American citizens and legal permanent residents that it is holding hostage immediately and unconditionally. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ROYCE of California. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I hope that our colleagues will indeed stand with us. I hope that this resolution sends a strong message to Iran that this practice will not be tolerated. And I hope that it sends a strong message to our own administration that Congress is heavily invested in the fate of Americans being held by Iran and that we will demand action to win their unconditional release, their immediate release. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ), my esteemed colleague, friend, and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. We have districts that are adjoining. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank my very good friends, Chairman EDROYCE , Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL , my fellow New Yorker, and the strong advocate, ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN . I want to thank them for advancing this very important resolution. I rise in strong support of H. Res. 317, which I introduced with my friends, Representatives ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , TEDDEUTCH , and T EDPOE. This resolution calls for the unconditional release of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents being held on baseless charges by the Government of Iran. Two of these prisoners, Siamek Namazi and Baquer Namazi, were previously my constituents when they last lived in the United States. I have had the honor of getting to know Babak Namazi, the courageous brother and son of these two prisoners, who has tirelessly worked to free them from unjust imprisonment. While the Iranian Government continues to try and exact concessions with these prisoners from the United States, Baquer Namazi, an 80yearold former UNICEF leader, suffers from increasingly poor health in Evin Prison. A man who spent his entire life serving the world’s most vulnerable should not, cannot, spend his final years in such terrible conditions. But this is just one prisoner’s story. Each of the United States’ citizen and legal permanent resident prisoners is suffering while imprisoned on trumped up charges. Each has family members who worry, every hour of the day, whether they will ever see their loved ones again. b1500 The United States must do all we can to ensure these prisoners return home. This resolution sends a strong message to the Government of Iran. These heinous attempts will not pay off. All of the prisoners must be released immediately. And Iran must fulfill its previous promises to locate and return Representative DEUTCH ’s constituent, Robert Levinson, a U.S. citizen missing in Iran since 2007. Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank everyone who helped advance this resolution. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). He is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I want to thank him and the ranking member for moving this legislation forward. Mr. Speaker, Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism in the whole world. Out of 195 countries, they are the worst country in the world when it comes to exporting terrorism. The mullahs in Tehran not only support worldwide terrorist groups, terrorist groups that have American blood on their hands, they resort to terrorist tactics to extort and blackmail the American people. For decades, Iran has held American citizens in prisons unlawfully. They detain these Americans under the charge of espionage. We all know that this is just a ploy to extract concessions from the United States. Earlier this month, we learned that Iran threw another American citizen in jail last year. This time it was a Princeton Ph.D. student conducting research in Iran for his dissertation. This student is now being held in Iran’s most notorious prison, Evin Prison. If anyone thought that Iran was going to moderate as a result of the nuclear deal, these ongoing unlawful detentions are evidence to the contrary. Iran has been emboldened, and there is no indication they will stop this tactic of terror. We need to get the attention of the barbaric mullahs that seem to take delight in imprisoning Americans and even Iranian citizens for political reasons. We know at least eight Americans currently languish in Iranian jails. Iran is not content with just holding these Americans. They are actively working to extract payments and concessions from the United States, like sanctions relief, as a condition for their release. This is oldfashioned textbook extortion. This resolution will send a clear message to the mullahs: Release the Americans and return them to their homes. Let the American hostages go. I was glad to see the new sanctions imposed by the Treasury in April on the Tehran Prisons Organization. More pressure is needed by our country. I urge the administration to spare no effort to secure the release of American hostages. These hostages have been held by Iran too long, and Iran has proven that they do not respond very well to carrots. Since we gave away the courthouse and the mineral rights in the Iranian deal, maybe it is time we pull out the stick. As Teddy Roosevelt said: ‘‘Speak softly, and carry a big stick.’’ And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ), who has worked tirelessly to free his constituent from the Iranian regime. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 317, calling for the unconditional release of United States citizens held by Iran. Unfortunately, I am all too familiar with this issue. My constituent, and now my good friend, Amir Hekmati, a Marine veteran, was held by the Iranian regime in Evin Prison for 4
1⁄2brutal years. Thankfully, after a long struggle with the help of many voices across the country and across the world, including my friends, the ranking member and the chairman of this committee, who both used their good offices to advance the interests of Mr. Hekmati, ultimately he was freed. On January 16, 2016, he came home. But it is long past time for Iran to release those Americans that they are holding, particularly Mr. Levinson, with whom I became quite familiar and whose family I came to know during the period of time that I sought freedom for Mr. Hekmati. Mr. Levinson’s family has endured 10 unspeakable years of anguish trying to bring their father and husband home. If Iran ever wants to be taken seriously in the global community, it has to stop this practice of taking innocent people as political prisoners, people like Amir Hekmati, people like Mr. Levinson, and those other Americans being held today. It is also important to note, both for us here in this body, across the country, particularly for those watching in other parts of the world, including Iran, that there are times when we have divisions in this country. There are times when we have divisions in our government, even on the floor of this House of Representatives. This is not one of them. We stand absolutely united as Democrats, as Republicans, as Independents, as Americans, saying to the Iranian Government and speaking through the Iranian people to their government: You cannot take political prisoners and hold them and expect to be taken seriously as a member of the global community. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to send that strong message, to pass this resolution. I thank the sponsors of this resolution. I thank the chair and ranking member for their leadership on this issue now, and particularly at a time when my constituent most needed it, and I pray for the same success for those Americans that are being held now. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House spoke in no uncertain terms, in a bipartisan fashion, about what we think of Iran’s dangerous and destabilizing 
behavior. An overwhelming bipartisan majority voted to slap tough new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, for the regime’s support for terrorism, and for the awful record of human rights abuses against the Iranian people. Tehran should know that we mean business. We will not back down on any of these issues, and we certainly will not forget that Americans are being wrongfully held. I am glad to go on record once again, along with my colleagues, Chairman ROYCE , ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , N ITA LOWEY , everyone who has spoken today, shining a line on this abuse, to put it front and center in our foreign policy, to call on Iran’s leaders to release these people, and to say they will not be forgiven as long as these people are unlawfully held. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I am happy that we are bringing this important issue to the fore, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would just say that the individuals that we are talking about, the Americans that are being held in captivity and their families, have been suffering for far too long. I think our country needs to take decisive action to secure their release, and I believe that we have got to make sure that Iran and all other hostile actors who would follow Iran down this road know that taking U.S. prisoners does not pay. I again thank Mr. ENGEL and the gentlewoman and gentleman from Florida, ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN and T EDDEUTCH , for their leadership, along with NITA LOWEY and T EDPOE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as the next step toward bringing these innocent people back home to the United States, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 317, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the consideration of H.R. 3219, and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 473 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 3219. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1511 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, with Mr. BOSTin the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. General debate shall be confined to the bill and not exceed 2 hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 60 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 6 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to present an amendment to H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act. This legislative package provides critical appropriations for national security, including for the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Energy’s nuclear programs, and the Legislative Branch bill. My colleagues, this is the primary constitutional duty of the Congress: to ensure the safety of the homeland and the American people. This legislation is carefully crafted to meet that responsibility: funding our critical military priorities, supporting veterans, and making our borders more secure. The core of this package is fullyear funding for the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. I thank Chairwoman GRANGER for her leadership. In total, the Defense portion of the bill provides $658.1 billion for these functions, an increase of $68.1 billion in base discretionary funding above the fiscal year 2017 enacted levels. There is no doubt that this is a significant increase from the current spending levels, and certainly from the last 8 years. But this increase is vitally important to continue the process we started this spring: to rebuild, repair, and reequip our Armed Forces that we started in the 2017 appropriations package. b1515 Mr. Chairman, Secretary of Defense Mattis has quite correctly made readiness and modernization of our forces his top priorities. It is a fact today that we have too many aircraft that cannot fly, too many ships that cannot sail, and too many troops who cannot deploy either because they are not properly trained or there are not enough of them. So how did we get there? Because in recent years, we have been just getting by—reducing investments in our military as the world becomes more dangerous, and avoiding tough choices. The package before us today will sustain a muchneeded rebuilding of our military after a half decade of cuts, while our troops remained in constant combat, as they do today. We provided prioritized funding to necessary but unfunded equipment and weapons platforms. We have boosted missile defense, a program that has taken on critical importance as North Korea, unabatedly, tries to marry its nuclear warheads with new ballistic missiles. We increased funding for the vital training that prepares our warfighter for any contingency. This legislation also supports our military families. After all, they serve, too. We included a 2.4 percent pay increase for our servicemen and women, the largest such raise in 8 years, and they deserve it. Within the Military Construction and Veterans portion of this bill—and I thank Chairman DENT for his leadership—military infrastructure funding has increased by 25 percent above current levels. We continue our efforts to rebuild our Armed Forces by ensuring that our warfighters have the support they need. We cannot forget those who have served. This measure increases funding to the Department of Veterans Affairs to 5 percent over current levels to provide veterans and their families with access to medical care and other benefits they have earned and deserve. Within the Energy and Water section of this legislation—I thank Chairman SIMPSON for his leadership—funding is prioritized for critical nuclear programs that will help strengthen our security and deter threats around the globe. We also support the maintenance of our Nation’s waterways and support the work of the Army Corps to also ensure the resilience and security of our electricity infrastructure. We recommit to opening Yucca Mountain as a safe and secure location to permanently store the Nation’s nuclear fuel and highlevel radioactive wastes, and we promote basic science programs, which lay the foundation for new energy technologies. Finally, Mr. Chairman, this package also includes funding for important legislative branch functions—and I thank Chairman YODER for his leadership—improving security to ensure 
that our Members, our staffs, and visitors to this wonderful Capitol complex are always well protected. Mr. Chairman, before I close, I offer thanks to members of the Appropriations Committee for their hard work and tough decisions over the past few months producing two appropriations bills, fiscal year 2017 and 2018, in less than 3 months. As you know, we received the President’s budget on May 23, just over 2 months ago, and since then, we have worked nonstop to put all 12 bills through the committee in record time. Each and every one of these bills deserves to be sent to the President’s desk. I look forward to completing our work on all of our bills. I also would like to extend my personal thanks to the entire committee and to our remarkable staff for their hard work on these bills and the eight yet to come. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 4 minutes. Typically, the Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Energy and Water, and Defense bills would be debated and amended by the full House individually. Regrettably, we are debating this $790 billion socalled security minibus in only 2 hours for some reason other than necessity. Substantive amendments chosen at the discretion of the chairman of the Rules Committee will be debated for 10 minutes. We also expect $1.6 billion in border wall funding to be added through a rules gimmick meant to prevent an upordown vote on the wall. The undemocratic maneuver by the Rules Committee to unilaterally remove Congresswoman BARBARA LEE’s amendment to debate a new AUMF, which received bipartisan support in the committee, is simply outrageous. All the promises of Republican leadership of returning to regular order have been broken. I do, however, want to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for conducting business in the Appropriations Committee markups fairly and collegially, as the minority offered amendments late into the night. On top of the many procedural inequities, however, the majority’s increased defense spending is a mirage. Shattering budget control caps would trigger automatic, acrosstheboard cuts of 13 percent to every defense account. Yet, the majority pretends the sequester, which would cut $72 billion in defense funding in this bill, isn’t real. I want to make it very clear that Democrats are ready to work with our Republican colleagues to raise the caps on defense, but we must also raise the caps on important domestic priorities. Playing politics with the bill that funds the troops by inserting the toxic border wall into it is really beyond the pale. Why not include the FBI, or the entire Homeland Security bill? If the intention is to pass securityrelated bills, securing our homeland goes beyond the Department of Defense and our own budgets in the legislative branch. The Republican approach to funding our government for FY18 all but guarantees a shortterm, if not a fullyear, continuing resolution—just like every year. Democratic votes will be needed to enact appropriation law, and I really do hope we will soon start to work together again to invest responsibly in both defense and nondefense priorities to grow the economy, create jobs, and secure the country. As I conclude, I want to thank our distinguished chairman, Mr. FRELING HUYSEN , and his outstanding staff, as well as my outstanding staff. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 1 minute. However, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill which would waste $1.6 billion on Trump’s border wall, use fraudulent defense numbers, gut critical investments in clean energy, include poisonpill riders, and leave the remaining spending bills with no path forward. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS), the former chairman of the full committee and now the chairman of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, thank you for yielding the time. Congratulations to you on your maiden voyage in this role that you are occupying—very expertly, I might add. During the forced march that we undertook in the committee for the last 3 weeks, clearing all 12 bills through the full committee in a historically record time, we had a good drill sergeant, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN . Thank you for doing a great job. We held 74 oversight and budget hearings, heard from over 400 witnesses, with the overarching goal that each of the 12 bills we passed out of our committee addressed the needs of our constituents. I am proud to say that these bills do just that—advance our national defense and secure our borders, take care of our veterans, provide critical infrastructure funding, increase resources to combat the opioid epidemic, maintain our presence as a leader in global diplomacy—all the while maintaining fiscal discipline. I am disappointed that we won’t consider all 12 of these bills before the August recess, but this security package is an important step forward. It will ensure that we, as the Congress, uphold our most sacred responsibility to provide for our Nation’s common defense. Under the previous administration, our Department of Defense faced needless uncertainty. I am proud that we are now turning the tide, providing our troops and their commanders with the necessary resources to respond to threats from countries like Russia, China, and Iran, as well as crush the violent extremists who wish to do us harm. As promised to the American people, we are rebuilding and modernizing our military as an international powerhouse by better equipping our troops, strengthening counterterrorism efforts, and reestablishing confidence with our allies. At a time when our enemies continue to advance around the globe, the U.S. must remain at the forefront of military readiness and advanced technology to strengthen national defense at home and abroad. This bill also maintains our commitment to those brave men and women after their service has come to a close, providing for greater oversight and accountability at the VA and modernizing electronic health records to help our veterans receive the high quality of care they deserve. I am also pleased that this legislation includes the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which funds many of our national security interests and builds upon our country’s essential infrastructure needs. In particular, this bill protects the Appalachian Regional Commission, ARC, from proposed elimination, and ensures that its critical programs will continue in our hardest hit Appalachian coal communities. Since 1965, ARC has led efforts to innovate, partner, and invest in the region to build community capacity and strengthen economic growth. These investments have led to the creation of thousands of new jobs. It has improved local water and sewer systems, improved our schools, increased access to healthcare, and provided critical assistance to emerging businesses. After 8 years of strangulation by regulation in the Obama administration’s war on coal, Appalachia needs the ARC now more than ever. Mr. Chairman, thank you again for allowing me to speak on behalf of this bill. Is it everything we wanted? No. It is critical that we prioritize our national security, and that is what this bill does. Mr. Chairman, the motto of our Appropriations Committee is this: ‘‘A vision without funding is a hallucination.’’ Now we have got a visionary leader in our chairman, but we have got to provide the funding to make the dreams that we have come true, and that is what Appropriations does. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ). Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member LOWEY for the time, and I also thank Chairman FRELING HUYSEN on his maiden voyage—not his first voyage, but his first as chair of the full committee—and the members of our fine subcommittee, and especially the staff. I want to thank Chairman SIMPSON  for his fine leadership and value the hard work that he put into this bill and his congeniality throughout the process. I also want to thank our staff on both sides of the aisle for the many hours of hard work and dedication: Taunja Berquam on our side, Donna Shahbaz for the majority, and TJ Lowdermilk on my own staff. I appreciate that the chairman has allowed robust funding to the Corps of Engineers, which translates into real jobs from coast to coast. b1530 I also am pleased that this bill restores the more than $900 million that the administration proposed to cut from the science account and provides reasonable funding for energysaving weatherization in both cold and hot climates across our Nation. Unfortunately, the artificially low allocation has forced the chairman to make deep cuts to some of the most 
important programs in the bill, most notably the Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy. Too many here in Washington have been fooled by the rhetoric that poses a false choice between the environment and the economy. But, today, 288,000 Americans work in auto industry supply chain jobs manufacturing the parts that make vehicles cleaner and more fuel efficient. In addition, 360,000 people work in the solar industry. The single fastest growing job in America is wind turbine technician. An investment in clean energy is an investment in American jobs and our future. The response of this bill? An 83 percent cut from the Vehicle Technologies Office—now that is a backwards move; A 60 percent cut to the Advanced Manufacturing Office—and this Member is unwilling to see that turn to the Chinese; A 57 percent cut to solar energy—one of the fastest growing job sectors in our country; A 65 percent cut to wind energy; and ARPA–E, the most complex new energy technologies, zero; the program is eliminated. These cuts cede the future to offshore competitors who are hacking into our intellectual property and the bank accounts of firms involved in these industries hundreds of times a month trying to coopt their energy technology that American taxpayers have helped to develop. In an era where Wall Street chases shortterm quarterly profits and ever improving earnings reports, we owe it to our constituents and to our progeny to play the long game—making investments that may take decades to pay off, but they will. The longtime horizon in large initial capital investments of the energy sector for America means that, more than any other, pathbreaking energy research needs Federal support until it becomes commercially viable because energy research is complex. Though energy is an overlooked ingredient in economic supremacy, those nations that master its dimensions are leading in economic growth. For decades, American Presidents have made statements targeting energy independence. That makes national security sense. But this year, that target is finally in sight. A recent Energy Information Administration report expects the United States to be a net energy exporter by 2026. The Department of Energy deserves great credit for bringing us to this point. Beginning back in the old 1970s and eighties when this all got started, it took 30 years of Department of Energy support in concert with the private sector to unleash the fracking revolution that has helped change our world dramatically. Where was that technology developed? At the Department of Energy, and it didn’t happen in a year or 2. It took years. The next revolution will be the clean energy revolution. We must not forfeit that game. Finally, I would like to raise my concerns over the controversial riders that threaten not only the ultimate enactment of this bill, but also our most precious resource: water. Exempting the repeal of the Clean Water Rule from the Administrative Procedure Act cedes far too much authority to the executive branch and is something that I cannot support. For that reason, and for the draconian cuts to clean energy, I must urge my colleagues to oppose the Energy and Water portion of this spending package. When those concerns are rolled together with busting the spending caps and building an expensive border wall that doesn’t keep us safe or solve our immigration needs, I believe that there is no excuse for any Democrat to support the overall bill before us. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER ) who is the chair of the Defense Subcommittee. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, today we consider the Make America Secure Appropriations Act which includes the Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018. I ask all Members for their support of this very important legislation. Congress’ number one responsibility is to provide for the defense of this Nation. It is this bill that fulfills that most fundamental constitutional duty. This is urgent because the world is more dangerous and unstable than any time in recent history. North Korea is increasing the frequency of their missile tests, threatening American soil and our allies. On the Fourth of July, they launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. Russia continues to create instability in Ukraine, the Baltics, and the Balkans. They recklessly support and protect President Assad, the tyrant who has murdered thousands of Syrian men, women, and children. These actions hinder our fight against ISIS. China is militarizing the South China Sea and modernizing their military at an alarming pace. Just this week, Chinese fighter jets flew close to a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft in an aggressive and dangerous manner. Iran is increasing its influence in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, and they remain hostile. Just yesterday, an Iranian vessel pursued a U.S. Navy ship at a high speed in the Persian Gulf, forcing our ship to fire warning shots to halt the aggression. Meanwhile, ISIS and alQaida terrorists continue to spread their perverted version of Islam across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. All of our adversaries are acting in an aggressive and emboldened manner. We must ensure that the U.S. military is prepared to confront anyone who threatens us. This can only be done by reversing the years of budget instability, sequestration, and continuous cuts. Since becoming chair, I have made it my priority to listen first and foremost to our defense and intelligence experts, and this bill before you reflects their expert advice. This bill provides Secretary of Defense Mattis the resources he needs to rebuild our military and form a new national defense strategy. It has been an honor to work with my ranking member, Mr. VISCLOSKY , who has played a valuable role in this process. I want to thank Mr. FRELING HUYSEN , Ranking Member L OWEY , and all the members of the Defense Subcommittee for their involvement and their contributions. I would also like to thank the staff of the Defense Subcommittee: Jennifer Miller, Sherry Young, Walter Hearne, Brooke Boyer, B.G. Wright, Adrienne Ramsay, Allison Deters, Cornell Teaugue, Collin Lee, and Matt Bower; as well as Rebecca Leggieri, Jennifer Chartrand, and Chris Bigelow on the minority staff. From the personal staff, I thank Johnnie Kaberle, Jason Schenck, Joe DeVooght, and Adam Kahnke. In closing, I must remind the House of Joint Chief of Staff Chairman Dunford’s words when he told us that ‘‘without sustained, sufficient, and predictable funding, I assess that within 5 years we will lose our ability to project power; the basis of how we defend the homeland, advance U.S. interests, and meet our alliance commitments.’’ To ensure this doesn’t happen, the bill includes $28.6 billion above the President’s request for a National Defense Restoration Fund. We must keep this funding intact. We need to heed Secretary Mattis’ warning and give our military what it needs—no less. This is not a partisan issue. Again, I ask all my colleagues for their support. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROYBAL ALLARD ) who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Chairman, it is difficult to understand how a Make America Secure Appropriations minibus does not include the bill for the Department of Homeland Security which is responsible for security at our borders, security in the coastal maritime environment, security for air and surface transportation, security of cyber networks and critical infrastructure, and helping State and local jurisdictions prepare for, prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks and natural disasters. Instead of including the entire DHS funding bill in the minibus, the majority is expected to use a second rule to insert just one part of that bill—funding for the President’s border wall—ignoring much more pressing and immediate security needs. Furthermore, because the Department has failed to submit to Congress a required report laying out the long term plan and justification for border 
infrastructure, Members of Congress are unable to responsibly evaluate the longterm border security strategy and comprehensively assess its costs, benefits, and tradeoffs. Given this enormous $1.6 billion initial price tag, Members should, at a minimum, have the opportunity to vote on it separately and in the context of the entire Homeland Security bill. I submitted an amendment to prohibit the use of funds for border wall construction, and I hope the Rules Committee will make it in order. While I do not support the DHS bill in its current form, I firmly believe the House would be in a stronger position to make a more informed and responsible decision on how best to invest these $1.6 billion in the context of debating and amending the entire Department of Homeland Security funding bill. For example, instead of using $1.6 billion of taxpayer money for just 74 miles of border wall, we could pay for the first two heavy Coast Guard icebreakers which are critically needed to help the United States better counter the everincreasing Russian presence in the Arctic. Or we could invest in additional technology and hire thousands of new customs officers at every air, land, and sea port of entry in the United States, reducing wait times for travelers, better facilitating the flow of commerce and contributing to economic growth. This would also enhance our ability to intercept more illegal narcotics and other contraband because, contrary to what some may think, the vast majority of the worst illicit drugs flowing into our country arrive through the ports of entry, not between the ports. In 2016, 86 percent of the heroin and 81 percent of the cocaine and methamphetamine came through the ports of entry. In other words, more physical barriers at the border—in addition to the 654 miles of fencing already in place—is a misguided and ineffective strategy to address drug smuggling. In addition to the fact that we could be using these $1.6 billion for more pressing security needs, I am concerned that, by including only border wall funding from the DHS Appropriations bill, we would be sending a terrible message to frontline homeland security personnel—many of whom routinely put their personal safety at risk to serve our country—that the President’s border wall is more important than all the work they do. Mr. Chairman, when it comes to the security of our Nation and the American people, we in Congress have an obligation to act in their best interests and to invest their tax dollars wisely. If the only homeland security item in this bill is funding for 74 miles of border wall, we will fail to meet that obligation. This bill should not include funding for a border wall, and the House should have an opportunity to vote on this funding in the context of the entire Homeland Security funding bill. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON) who is the chair of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to bring the fiscal year 2018 Energy and Water bill before you today. Before I go into the details, I would like to recognize Chairman FRELING HUYSEN . It is because of his leadership and unswerving commitment to the appropriations process that our committee has managed to bring 12 bills through the full committee process and have them ready for consideration by the House. I would also like to thank Ranking Members LOWEY and K APTUR . As always, their thoughtful approach to issues has made this a better bill. The bill totals $37.6 billion, which is $209 million less than last year’s level and $3.2 billion above the request. b1545 Increases over last year are targeted to those areas where they are needed most: to provide for our Nation’s defense and support our Nation’s infrastructure. The bill provides strong support for the Department of Energy’s national defense programs. Weapons activities is funded at $10.24 billion, up $921 million from last year’s level, to keep our Nation’s nuclear deterrent reliable and effective. This increase will fully fund the ongoing stockpile life extension programs and will make substantial progress toward addressing the continued deterioration of infrastructure across the enterprise. The recommendations for Naval Reactors is $1.49 billion, and includes full funding for the Columbia class ballistic missile submarine, formerly referred to as the Ohioclass replacement. Additionally, the bill provides funding increases across the Department of Energy to defend against cyber attacks and, within Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, to strengthen energy sector cybersecurity preparedness, response, and recovery. This bill addresses the critical infrastructure work of the Army Corps of Engineers, providing a total of $6.2 billion, an increase of $120 million more than last year. This recommendation makes full use of all annual revenues from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The harbor maintenance trust fund activities are funded at $1.34 billion, which is $40 million more than fiscal year 2017, an increase of $375 million above the budget request, and the same as the WRDA target. The bill provides $74 million more than last year for flood and storm damage reduction activities. This is a responsibile bill, one that makes some difficult choices in order to prioritize the most critical Federal programs. As a result, as has been mentioned already, this bill eliminates the Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy—or ARPA–E, as it is known— and the title 17 loan guarantee program of the Department of Energy, as proposed by the President. I realized some people are concerned about that. These are programs that I happen to like also. But this is what happens when you are $20 trillion in debt: you have to make tough choices. And that is what the Appropriations Committee is doing: making some of the difficult choices that we have to make. This bill includes a number of targeted investments above the budget request to ensure a secure, independent, and prosperous energy future. Mr. Chairman, this is a strong bill that will protect our national security interests, address our most pressing infrastructure needs, and advance our economy. I urge everyone to support it. I would like to thank the staff of the Energy and Water Committee, both ranking and minority members, and of the full committee, for the work they have done in making sure we can get this bill to the floor. Again, I urge Members to support this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, while I rise to oppose this appropriations package, even though the Legislative Branch division of this package is worthy of our support, I commend Chairman YODER both for the product and for the way he reached across the aisle to work with me and other members of our committee and the minority in this process. For all of their hard work, I would also like to thank Liz Dawson, who is on their team; Jenny Panone and Tim Monahan from the Legislative Branch minority staff; Joe Eannello from Chairman YODER ’s office; Adam Berg on the minority staff; and Anne Sokolov and Ryan Keating on my team. This year’s Legislative Branch appropriations bill would, among other things, allow us to catch up on some deferred maintenance in our buildings; invest in information technology to modernize the Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service, and Copyright Office; and adjust to the new cybersecurity environment faced here in the United States Congress. I am also pleased to see that this bill provides additional funds for the Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Police to increase congressional security in the wake of the tragic shooting at our congressional baseball practice several months back. Our goal is to give them the resources they need to maintain the security on the Capitol campus and increase their coverage of Members and 
gatherings of Members that might be targeted. It is the responsibility of the House to look out for our safety and the safety of our constituents and staff, and the funding included in this bill is a step in the right direction. There are things I hope we can improve on as the bill moves forward. For example, I would like to see more money for personnel at the Library and CRS, not just for information technology; and more for the Government Accountability Office, which is flat funded in this budget. Because of inflation, GAO will have 200 fewer employees than expected at the end of the year. GAO’s audits and investigations root out waste, fraud, and abuse in government, something that we all agree upon here should be done. With the Trump administration resisting all of this oversight, GAO is more important today than it ever has been. While I would support the Legislative Branch bill if it came to the floor on its own, unfortunately, we are not considering it on its own. I oppose tying $1.6 billion of wasted taxpayer money for President Trump’s border wall to the Legislative Branch bill. We need bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform, which would include smarter, more effective enforcement of our laws. A few years ago, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said immigration reform would reduce our deficit by $900 billion and increase real GDP growth by over 3 percent. But simply building a ridiculous wall that faces opposition from both Democrats and Republicans won’t do anything for our economy, and it isn’t even a costeffective way to strengthen enforcement. Besides, we were told repeatedly over the course of the last 18 months that Mexico would pay for the wall. They would ask the President: Who is going to pay for the wall? Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Why is there a single dime of American taxpayer money for a border wall that President Trump promised Mexico would finance? I oppose the Republicans’ partisan budget strategy. By refusing to work with Democrats on a bipartisan budget deal that raises the Budget Control Act caps, Republicans are seriously risking some combination of sequestration, stopgap funding bills, government shutdown, and a catastrophic default on our national debt. Nondefense discretionary spending is onesixth of the Federal budget. Having already cut it to the bone, they are now sawing off the limbs. The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill; the Transportation bill; and the Financial Services bill that funds consumer protections and regulation of big banks will all see big cuts because of the draconian spending caps. Today’s package will squeeze out investments in our infrastructure, jobs programs, early childhood education, scientific research, and all the things that need to be priorities. We are turning our backs on working families across the country who depend on these programs every day. We all believe in the free market system. We all believe in capitalism. We all want to reward risktakers and provide a good environment for growth for those men and women who will make the investments to hire the workers. But capitalism is not a perfect system. It is these programs in this bill that we need to fund to make sure that we grow the entire economy, that we have sustained growth, we invest in education, we invest in research, and we invest in transportation infrastructure, in order for us to grow the economy. As former Appropriations Chairman David Obey used to say, those programs were about ‘‘knocking the rough edges off of capitalism.’’ On this side of the aisle, we believe making those investments is best for the economy. That is what is at stake. Yes, we must adequately fund defense, veterans programs, and the legislative branch of government. But that can’t come at the expense of everything else. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. DENT), chairman of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, the Appropriations Act before you today includes, in division C, appropriations for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies for Fiscal Year 2018. Division C is exactly the same as the MILCON–VA bill reported favorably out of the full committee on June 15. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN from New Jersey, Ranking Member NITALOWEY  from New York, and the partnership of Ranking Member DEBBIE WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ from Florida, this will provide necessary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs and military construction projects. We were able to include the vast majority of the subcommittee’s over 1,000 Member requests. This division demonstrates our firm commitment to fully supporting our Nation’s veterans and servicemembers. The total investment is $89 billion for Military Construction, VA, and Related Agencies, which is $6 billion above last year’s level. This division provides comprehensive support for servicemembers, military families, and veterans. We must make infrastructure investments if we value readiness. This bill increases military construction by 25 percent over last year’s level, delivering on our promise to the troops in line with the President’s focus on national defense. It supports our troops with the facilities and services necessary to maintain readiness and morale at bases here in the States and overseas. It provides for Defense Department schools and health clinics that take care of our military families. This division funds our veteran healthcare systems to ensure that our promise to care for those who have sacrificed in defense of this great Nation continues as those men and women return home. We owe this to our veterans, and we are committed to sustained oversight so that programs deliver what they promise and taxpayers are wellserved by the investments we make. The staff deserves credit for the sustained work and very long hours. I would like to recognize Sue Quantius, Sarah Young, Tracey Russell, Maureen Holohan, and Matt Washington on the committee staff, and Sean Snyder on my personal staff. On the military construction piece, this division provides a total of $10.2 billion for military construction projects and family housing, including base and overseas contingency operations funding, an increase over last year’s level and $197 million below the President’s request. This funding meets DOD’s most critical needs, including priority projects for the combatant commanders and funding new mission requirements. It provide $737 million for military medical facilities. It provides $249 million for Department of Defense education facilities for construction of renovation of four schools. It supports our Guard and Reserves through $575 million for facilities in 22 States. It also funds military family housing at $1.4 billion. It provides $178 million for the NATO Security Investment Program, which is $24 million over the President’s request, to deal with increasing threats and necessary investments overseas. Given all that is happening by Russia’s very bad behavior in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, this investment is absolutely essential. We were able to also include an additional $439 million in the services’ unfunded priorities, which are priority projects that were not included in the budget request. It is very important to many Members of this body. On Veterans Affairs, the legislation includes a total of $78.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. That is a $3.9 billion increase, or 5 percent, above fiscal year 2017 level. It is the highest level of VA funding ever provided. On VA medical care, the bill funds it at $69 billion, the full request, including an additional $2.6 billion beyond the advanced appropriations to cover unanticipated needs. Many Members expressed concerns about medical care issues, and were able to fully fund the budget request for mental health services at $8.4 billion; suicide prevention outreach at $186 million; homeless veterans treatment, services, housing, and job training at $7.3 billion; opioid abuse prevention at $50 million—we began that in the omnibus last year—rural health initiatives at $250 million; and caregiver stipends at $604 million. 
b1600 We repeat last year’s bill language regarding improved standards for the suicide prevention hotline. For disability claims processing, again another issue very important to so many Members in this body, but particularly to our veterans who are seeking services from the VA, or benefits, we provide $2.9 billion, which is $50 million over the request. As the number of disability applications increases, we need to be vigilant to be sure that the claims backlog doesn’t reappear. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, this legislation also contains $65 million, as requested, as VA switches gears and moves from modernizing its own aging electronic health record to acquiring the record DOD is using. The bill continues to include language restricting most of the funding until the VA meets milestones and certifies interoperability to meet statutory requirements. Our bill increases the request for VA research funding by $58 million, to a total of $698 million, recognizing strong congressional interest in the VA’s research to combat devastating conditions like PTSD and traumatic brain injury. In major construction, we continue oversight of those projects, holding back funding until it has contracted for outside management. In closing, I ask Members to support this important piece of legislation. It is very important to our servicemembers, our veterans, and their families. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from New York, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, for yielding, and more importantly, for her great leadership to advance the values of our country in allocation of resources. And I always admire the work of Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN , our distinguished chairman, as well. We may have a matter of disagreement here today, though. Mr. Chair, all of us, Members of Congress, all elected officials, people who serve in any office, take a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution, and that is an oath to protect the American people. Democrats, indeed all Americans, believe in a strong national defense. We believe in strong investments in our defense and in our brave men and women in uniform, in particular. But far from strengthening our security, the falsely inflated numbers in this spending bill will create uncertainty for our military and hollow out America’s communities at home. We face serious threats in the world. We know that. Those threats demand serious consideration in Congress. We should be making serious decisions about our national security mission. What is our mission? What are the resources that we need? We don’t want to spend more than we need, but we don’t want to spend less, and we should not be posturing in the Defense bill with false numbers and no real answers about the mission that these dollars would fund. We do not give certainty to our defense or confidence to our troops when we legislate with phony numbers when we refuse to make honest choices about our Defense budget. Instead of giving certainty to our heroes in uniform, this bill would breach the sequester spending limit by more than $70 billion, forcing a mandatory 13 percent cut to all Defense accounts. These phony numbers in this bill not only do violence to our Defense budget, they starve the strength of America by ransacking our domestic investments. In order to be the strongest possible America, we must measure our strength not only in our military might, but in the health, education, and wellbeing of the American people. And that is what the problem is, that we are stealing from the domestic budget with phony numbers for the Defense budget, which will be because of the sequester cut to the Defense accounts by 13 percent as we starve our domestic investments. Besides the direct danger this bill poses to our military, it is laden with poison pills. It would squander billions of taxpayer dollars on President Trump’s immoral, ineffective, and expensive border wall. The President said, during the campaign, he said: ‘‘I promise a wall.’’ No. He promised a wall that Mexico would pay for. He said it would cost $4 billion to $6 billion. The fact is it could cost as much as $30 billion, $40 billion, and he wants a down payment for that wall in this bill—one poison pill. It also eliminates ARPAE, the advanced energy research vital to our energy independence and to our national security to keep America the innovation superpower of the 21st century. Democrats will continue to demand real leadership to strengthen our national defense. Mr. Chair, on this day, July 26, 1948, President Harry Truman signed the executive order desegregating the U.S. military. How great that was for America. How great it is for our country to benefit from the service of so many people who had been serving all along but now with dignity and respect, which was justified. So how sad it is on this same day that the President of the United States, 69 years ago, recognized the value of respecting our men and women in uniform, that the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, fired 15,000 courageous men and women in uniform in a vile, hateful tweet. His actions regarding transgenders in the military were unworthy of their bravery and unworthy of the American people. Let us be thankful for the blessings of all of our men and women in uniform, our veterans who have served us, and our military families to whom we owe so much. Their courage, their service and leadership, and their sacrifice are what truly makes us the land of the free and the home of the brave, and it insists that we be serious and real and evidencebased as we make decisions about how we invest in the security of our country. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. YODER ), the chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in favor of the bill before us, paying particular attention to the work of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. I first want to thank my colleagues, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY , for their leadership; and Ranking Member RYAN, who has been a gentleman and a scholar, for working with me to develop this product, a great example of how representatives from opposite sides of the line can work together and create a model bipartisanship to build great legislation for the American people. Our total recommendation for the fiscal year 2018 Legislative Branch is $3.58 billion. In this bill, we focused on Capitol improvements, better security, more transparency and accountability all in a fiscally responsible manner. First and foremost, Mr. Chairman, the House continues to lead by example in its frugal operations. With this bill, we will be spending 12 percent below the 2010 levels, showing the American people fiscal discipline starts here in our House operations first. We also continue the policy of denying pay increases to Members of Congress for the eighth fiscal year in a row. This Republican Congress has tightened its belt since taking the majority, and we have never allowed a pay increase for Members of Congress, and we aren’t allowing one today, saving taxpayers over $68 million since 2011. In light of the recent shooting where Republican Members of Congress were targeted for their beliefs and our colleague and majority whip, STEVE SCALISE, was seriously wounded, this bill takes new focus on the security related to Congress, and I would like to recognize the United States Capitol Police Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey. As we all know in this body, the U.S. Capitol Police protect us, our staff, and the more than 9 million visitors we get here each year with bravery, putting their lives on the line each and every day to keep us safe. Special Agents Griner and Bailey put that heroism on display for the country and the world when they saved numerous Members of Congress from an 
attack at practice where some 25 of our colleagues were preparing for the Congressional Baseball Game for Charity. Their courage under fire saved the lives of countless Members of Congress, staff, and innocent bystanders, and both of them were wounded while carrying out their duties. STEVE SCALISE , Matt Mika, and Zack Barth, who were also injured that day, and everyone else on that baseball field, are alive today because of those Capitol Police officers, and we continue to wish a speedy recovery to everyone who has been injured. We, as a Congress, owe it to the Capitol Police to ensure they have the necessary resources to meet their mission in an increasingly polarized climate. And after working with Mr. RYAN, we believe we have appropriately prioritized those needs, taking a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safety and security of not only Members of Congress, but our staff, visitors, and the constituents we serve. We provide resources and make structural changes that will address security concerns both here at the Capitol and in our home districts, including $29 million in new resources to the Capitol Police for increased security, $5 million to the House Sergeant at Arms for district office security, and support for House Administration’s authorization to increase $25,000 per MRA account to address Members’ physical security when they are away from the Capitol complex. We also invest new resources in cybersecurity measures to protect attacks on our digital information. After more than 20 hearings, briefings, and tours of various portions of the Capitol complex since January, we have included $581 million in total for the Architect of the Capitol. We recognize the continuing challenge of preserving and maintaining our infrastructure and prioritizing critical projects in the current fiscal climate. We have included funding to restore and renovate House office buildings, upgrade the Capitol Power Plant, and several other projects. We fund a Revitalization Fund to finance major repairs and renovations to facilities in the House for future years, and we are planning ahead to try and save costs. Overall, we provided $648 million for the Library of Congress, with new funding going to IT improvements librarywide, as well as specific copyright modernization initiatives. In total, we provided $48.5 million for the CBO. Members of this body on both sides of the aisle have their differences in opinion with CBO estimates and how it arrives at those conclusions. In some cases, frankly, the CBO is wrong, but, at the end of the day, it serves an important purpose and needs the appropriate resources to do its job. We also increased funding for the Government Accountability Office to ensure that they root out fraud, waste, and abuse in government. Mr. Chair, in crafting this project, Ranking Member RYAN and I sought the thoughtful feedback of Members throughout this committee and this body. There are various initiatives we can all be proud of, initiatives that serve our constituents and produce efficiencies and transparency in the way that Congress operates, including increasing openness and transparency and producing efficiencies by publishing nonconfidential CRS reports online, expanding the Wounded Warrior Project, which helps Members hire veterans. We increased total slots by more than 57 percent. In conclusion, in all, this bill represents a frugal approach at funding the basic operations of Congress. We do so in a fiscally responsible manner, keeping House budgets historically low and prohibiting pay increases in Congress. We are improving transparency and accountability at the same time. I would like to thank Ranking Member RYAN and his staff, Anne Sokolov and Adam Berg, as well as my staff, Tim Monahan, Liz Dawson, Jenny Panone, and Joe Eannello, and to all the members of the subcommittee for their work and participation in the process this year. Mr. Chair, I urge this body support this legislation. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I served actively on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years. I am still a member on leave. Never, in the 36 years that I have been here, have I seen an omnibus appropriation bill or a minibus appropriation bill brought to the floor before the August break. Regular order is to bring each bill to the floor, debate each bill on its merit, have the opportunity to offer amendments, and debate the merits of the amendments and of that particular bill. However, the majority party has not done its job, and I do not hold accountable the members of the Appropriations Committee. I want to make that clear. But, for whatever reasons, regular order has not been followed, and so each Member of the Congress of the United States is confronted with either voting for all of the bill with component parts, the Legislative bill, Energy and Water, MILCON–VA, Defense bill, that they may not like, but if they vote ‘‘no,’’ they will be accused of being against the security of the United States. That, my friends, is baloney. In their pledge to America, Republicans said: ‘‘We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.’’ This belies that representation. The sponsors of this minibus package, Mr. Chair, claim it will make America more secure. I reject that argument. Senior military leaders have said that the greatest longterm threat to our national security is the growing national debt and the impact of interest payments on the debt as they crowd out our ability to invest in defense and domestic priorities. b1615 It is incumbent upon us, Mr. Chairman, to work together to pass a fiscally responsible budget agreement that lifts the sequester caps in a way consistent with the principle of parity between defense and nondefense spending. Mr. Chairman, we were supposed to pass a budget on or before April 15. It is now July 26. We have passed no budget. There is no plan for overall spending. This, therefore, is a pig in a poke, and nobody on this House floor or in this country knows the ramifications of the passage of this bill on the eight domestic spending bills that remain unattended. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman. Mr. HOYER. It is incumbent upon us, Mr. Chairman, to work together to pass a fiscally responsible budget agreement that lifts the sequester caps. We cannot simply skip to appropriations without determining what our budget priorities are first. It is as critical for our national defense as it is for our ability to support economic growth. Moreover, this is the earliest, as I have said before, that I can ever remember that the House considered either an omnibus or minibus appropriations bill. It is an acknowledgement by the majority that the House will not be able to move these bills through under regular order, given Republicans’ internal divisions over spending bills. So instead of working with Democrats to craft individual appropriations bills that can pass the House, they are resorting to legislative tactics to push them through on partisan votes. I will remind my friends across the aisle that they have been unable to enact a single funding bill in the past 7 years without ultimately appealing to Democratic votes. So I urge my colleagues to reject this minibus package and make it clear that we first ought to negotiate a budget agreement that provides certainty and clarity to the entire Federal Government, not just a handful of agencies. And we ought to do it through an open and transparent process, with Members permitted to offer amendments that can shape a budget and appropriations bills truly reflective of the Nation’s priority as a whole. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ so that we can get on with an appropriations process that is in regular order, that makes common sense, that is transparent, and that will give the American public the best product that we can produce. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), the chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act. First, I would like to commend Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for his tireless work to report out all 12 appropriations bills in the Appropriations Committee. He did it in record time and deserves a great deal of credit for getting us to this point today. The four bills included in H.R. 3219 reflect hours of hearings, staff work, Member input, and bipartisan cooperation. I would also like to express my gratitude to the chairs and ranking members of the Defense; Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies; Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies; and Legislative Branch Subcommittees. In particular, the Energy and Water division provides robust funding for water infrastructure—over $67 million—to create needed water storage in the West. I want to thank Chairman SIMPSON and his staff for their hard work. As a member of the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations, I thank Chairwoman KAYGRANGER for her leadership and her unwavering support of our men and women in uniform. I also would be remiss if I did not mention the professional staff of the subcommittee, who dedicated countless hours to craft a bill that meets the needs of the Department of Defense and reflects the will of Congress. Our greatest responsibility as Members of Congress is to provide for the resources necessary to the men and women of our Armed Forces. This bill includes $584.2 billion in base defense funding and $73.9 billion for overseas contingency operations. It provides for a 2.4 percent military pay raise and additional funding to increase end strength. The bill provides robust funding for shipbuilding, aviation, combat vehicles, and more. It invests in our greatest assets, the men and women who wear the uniform, through increased funds through training, equipment, and the best healthcare. We are at a crossroads. Right now, our military continues to operate at high tempo to carry out the national security interests of the United States. However, in order to meet the next challenge, whatever that may be, we must invest now. We know the situation we are in. National Security Advisor McMaster has stated that the U.S. is outranged and outgunned by potential adversaries. Out of the 58 brigade combat teams, the Army only has 3 that are combat ready. We have the lowest number of ships since World War I. And while capability is important, the vast oceans of the world desperately need our presence. Only 7 out of 10 aircraft in the Air Force are ready to fly, and the average age of aircraft across the service is 27 years. Airmen are flying the same planes as their grandfathers. Only 43 percent of the Marine Corps total aircraft inventory is considered flyable. Our marines deserve better. Today we have a chance to correct the course we have been on for the last 8 years. The U.S. Constitution creates a government of the people to ‘‘establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense.’’ This bill fulfills the promise enshrined in our Constitution to secure the blessings of liberty by providing for the defense of our Nation. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding me time and for her hard work during this arduous process. And I would also like to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Chairman DENTfor their hard work as well. As we all know, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill has a strong reputation for common ground and bipartisanship. Chairman DENT, like always, set a cooperative tone and was inclusive throughout this process. He has worked tirelessly to address many Members’ concerns, and I joined him in that effort, as well as critical issues impacting our veterans and Active and Reserve servicemembers. The Military Construction portion of this minibus provides adequate funding for both the Active and Reserve components. In addition, the bill funds the NATO Security Investment Program at the FY17 level, sending a strong message to our Nation’s allies that we stand with them as we continue to face evolving international threats. For the Department of Veterans Affairs, this bill provides $3.9 billion, which is a 5.3 percent increase over FY 2017. I am also pleased that this bill will address the issue of breast cancer awareness and prevention and provides almost $700 million for medical research, which will fund essential efforts, such as those to address TBI and PTSD, develop stateoftheart prosthetics, care for victims of military sexual trauma, and treat veterans suffering from mental illness. The bill also continues to fund important programs to combat veteran homelessness, provide our vets with effective and timely healthcare, and improve the veteran benefits application process and appeals process. I am also extremely grateful for Chairman DENT’s support for in vitro fertilization and coverage for assisted reproductive technologies for veterans who have sustained a serviceconnected injury that impacts their fertility. This issue is very important to me and to so many servicemembers. All veterans deserve to be able to start families. Moreover, providing access to IVF is consistent with the VA’s goals to support veterans and improve their quality of life. On a personal note, this bill will also address the issue of breast cancer awareness and prevention. This past spring, our subcommittee visited the Washington VA Medical Center. We learned that the VA was relying on the controversial USPSTF guidance for mammography in making coverage decisions. Last Congress, we passed a law that barred private insurers from making coverage decisions based on these guidelines through 2018. However, the moratorium did not apply, we learned in that visit to the VA, and so women in their forties who were veterans could be denied coverage for mammograms. To its credit, the VA changed its guideline regarding screening, and with Chairman DENT’s support, language is included to hold the VA to this better standard. As I stated during my testimony before the Rules Committee, Mr. Chairman, it is my sincere belief that if the MILCONVA bill were being considered as a standalone, as is tradition, under an open rule, it would receive strong bipartisan support. But, unfortunately, that is not what we are doing here today. Instead of following regular order, we, instead, are taking up four bills at once and adding funds to begin construction on President Trump’s irresponsible border wall that he promised Mexico would pay for, and now taxpayers are being stuck with the bill. This fiscally and morally irresponsible expenditure leaves the nondefense appropriations bills grossly underfunded. Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, this bill isn’t even great for defense. All this talk about making sure that we provide adequate resources for our defense and our national security ignores the fact that the Budget Control Act provides additional funds that would ultimately be sequestered without a cap adjustment. This minibus would breach this cap by more than $72 billion, resulting in a mandatory 13.2 percent sequester of all defense accounts, including the Military Construction title. And, by the way, I have said this repeatedly each time I have spoken on this legislation, and never once has anyone in the majority countered what I am suggesting. That is deeply troubling. So even if this bill is signed into law, which it will not be, DOD would not receive one dollar of this increase. Secretary Mattis testified ‘‘sequestration and the continued use of continuing resolutions would result in a steady erosion of military readiness.’’ That is the only outcome this bill guarantees. By taking up this minibus today, we are setting ourselves up for failure, and we have set ourselves up 
for an early fall with no real progress to be made on the FY 2018 appropriations bills. Mr. Chairman, we cannot continue to govern in this fashion. I believe it is time that we stop listening to the most extreme voices and get past these unrealistic beliefs that we can cut our way to prosperity. We cannot. If this failed philosophy persists, our work will only get more difficult. It is clear that passing any appropriations bill that will be signed into law will require a bipartisan majority of both Houses. As a result of this irresponsible posture, I will sadly be voting against the minibus, and I look forward to working towards an appropriations product that both parties can work on together in true bipartisan tradition. Mr. Chairman, lastly, before I close, I thank our staff in the MILCON–VA bill on both the majority and the minority side: Maureen Holohan, Sarah Young, Sue Quantius, Sean Snyder, and Tracey Russell with the majority; and Matt Washington, Rosalyn Kumar, and Jonathan Steinberg with the minority. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO ), a valuable member of the committee. Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Make America Secure Appropriations Act. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have witnessed firsthand the hard work that Chairman FRELING HUYSEN and his subcommittee chairmen have put into crafting this bill. They all should be congratulated for their work on this legislation, and so should their staffs. I firmly believe that the number one constitutional responsibility of Congress is to provide for the common defense of this Nation against all enemies, both domestic and foreign. That commitment, by increasing defense funding and restoring the cuts and budget shortfalls that threaten our military readiness and our ability to project force around the globe, is honored here today. Our bill also honors those who serve our country in the Armed Forces by giving them a muchdeserved 2.4 percent pay raise and making critical investments in equipment and training that help them perform the missions we give them and, most importantly, help them return home safely to their loved ones and their families and communities. This includes 11 Navy ships, including two destroyers for our Navy and a new LHA for our Marines. And I am proud to say that some of these ships will be built in my district by the greatest shipbuilders on Earth. The bill also honors the service of our veterans. Our commitment doesn’t stop when our men and women in uniform stop serving. We must continue to support them after they leave service, and this bill does just that, funding mental healthcare, care for our homeless veterans, and other national priorities. In addition, this bill makes critical investments in our Nation’s border security, including fully funding the President’s request for a physical barrier construction along our southern border. The President has promised this funding, the American people want this funding, and today the House is making good on that promise—after all, border security is national security. Mr. Chairman, this is a solid bill. It honors our commitments, it keeps Americans safe and fulfills our obligation to all those who serve this great country. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the underlying legislation. b1630 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Defense. (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding to me. Mr. Chairman, I, first of all, thank Chairwoman GRANGER . This is her first time leading the Defense Appropriations bill on the floor. She has done so under very difficult circumstances, with a steadfast commitment to maintaining the tradition of cooperative bipartisanship on our subcommittee, maintaining transparency, and taking a thoughtful approach to solving problems. Mr. Chairman, I would also like to express my immense gratitude to Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Ranking Member LOWEY , the members of our subcommittee, and our exceptional staff for all of their hard work. Mr. Chairman, we have a duty to provide predictable and timely appropriations to the Department of Defense and the rest of the Federal Government. This is a consistent request by our senior Defense leaders. However, the House bills exceed the cap of fiscal year 2018 defense spending established under the Budget Control Act of 2011 by $72.5 billion. If enacted as written and the budget control caps remain in place, the Department of Defense would face a sequestration of roughly 13 percent. The Department has still not recovered from the rash of problems caused the last time it was forced to deal with sequestration in 2013. In the second half of that fiscal year, the Department savaged its operations and maintenance accounts to continue ongoing contingency operations and to protect military personnel accounts. This resulted in the Navy idling an aircraft carrier at a pier in Norfolk, the Army canceling training rotations, and the Air Force reducing flight times for its combat aircraft, and widespread civilian furloughs. We simply cannot allow that to happen again in fiscal year 2018. We have avoided sequestration in the last 4 fiscal years by adjusting the budget caps for both defense and nondefense appropriations. Those modest adjustments, done in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion, provided needed funding for our military, but also for our country’s economic and physical infrastructure, scientific research, public health systems, and veterans’ care. Besides my frustration with the process, I have concerns about the significant increase in funding that this bill will provide to the Department: $60 billion more than last year and $29 billion more than requested by the administration. I support providing additional funds to the Department, as I believe we are asking too much of our brave servicemembers and their families, but, putting it mildly, the world is also an unsettled place and not trending towards stability. But that being said, I believe that the Department will have great difficulty spending so many additional dollars in a timely and efficient manner. Vacancies continue in important leadership positions. Hiring restrictions on civilian employees and a handful of ongoing strategic reviews will all slow the decisionmaking process. It is also unlikely that Congress will complete its work in a timely manner by October 1, and that any dollars provided will have to be spent in a compressed time period. Additionally, I am not convinced that the administration evaluates dollars being spent on the military with the same criteria as it does with the rest of the Federal Government. In the Office of Management and Budget’s Major Savings and Reform document for fiscal year 2018, it was a pageturner. With 150 proposals to allegedly save billions in discretionary programs, there was only one recommendation in 150—one—for the Department of Defense, with a potential to save only $2 billion by 2027. With a budget of roughly $600 billion a year, representing nearly half the discretionary spending, it is beyond the pale that OMB could only come up with a single savings point for the Department of Defense. One final point is that I am highly disappointed that the Republican leadership has watered down language during committee markup regarding the Authorization for Use of Military Force. Representative BARBARA LEE’s language would have established an eminently reasonable approach to updating 2001 legislation in authorization. Congress must stop hiding from the debate, and carry out its constitutional responsibilities to support our troops in uniform and the civilian support staff that helps them out. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would like, again, simply to reiterate my thanks to the members of our subcommittee and committee, and for our sterling staff who have done a superb job under the most difficult circumstances that I could imagine. 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ), a strong supporter of national defense. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for yielding to me, and I thank him for his tremendous leadership as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. New Jersey and, indeed, the entire Nation are fortunate to have Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN as chairman of this critical committee. Under the chairman’s leadership, all spending bills have advanced out of the committee, and now, today, we consider a package that affirms one of Congress’ most important responsibilities: to provide for the common defense. Included in this legislative package is an important measure that opens reports by the Congressional Research Service and opens those reports to the public. I have been involved in this issue for some time. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and subcommittee Chairman YODER for their support of this measure. American taxpayers spend more than $100 million a year supporting the work of the Congressional Research Service. Their findings, reports, and analyses should be public information. It is good public policy to allow educators, students, members of the news media, and everyday citizens across the Nation to have access to CRS’s nonpartisan, taxpayerfunded reports. By providing public access to CRS reports, we can elevate our national discourse and make it easier for citizens to cut through the misinformation that is too often involved in the national debate. Citizens should have full access to the same neutral, unbiased information that many of us in Congress use to help us make important decisions. CRS is governed by requirements for accuracy, objectivity, balance, and nonpartisanship—the very sort of analysis sought and valued by engaged constituents. Mr. Chairman, I, again, commend the chairman for including this measure in the Legislative Branch title. This is one of many victories for taxpayers in this important bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Labor, HHS. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. What does this bill do? It would force the Office of Management and Budget to issue an across theboard budget cut for defense spending come January. Why? Because the House appropriations bills exceed the defense budget spending cap by more than $72 billion. I might add that both Democrats and Republicans voted for these spending caps for defense spending and for nondefense spending. So the defense funding in the bill, their numbers are, in essence, fake. These are fake numbers. Republicans have no plan to raise both our need to support our national security and military readiness and our need to support hardworking middle class families who are struggling to get by. So if these bills are enacted, the only way to avoid this acrosstheboard defense spending cut is if we had another budget deal to revise the bipartisan Budget Control Act, which established spending caps for defense spending and for nondefense spending. Now, add to that, since military pay is usually exempt from budget cuts, if this bill and the other House appropriations bills are signed into law, the Office of Management and Budget, by law, would be required to cut defense spending by more than 13 percent, or $72 billion. We would need a new budget agreement so that we can increase both defense spending and nondefense spending to meet the needs of our country. My friends, this is not going to happen; hardly likely. The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. We must invest in programs that provide opportunities for hardworking Americans to be able to improve themselves and for our economy to grow. We need a country that works for the middle class and for the vulnerable, not just the wealthy and those with the most lobbyists. This budget process is irresponsible, and our military and our hardworking families will all be shortchanged. This is unacceptable. Congress needs to negotiate another budget deal that increases both the defense and the nondefense spending caps. The spending levels in the Defense bill are impossible to achieve unless there is a new budget deal and it is reached. So, again, the numbers are fake. If you vote ‘‘yes’’ on this, you are voting for a pig in a poke. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I thank both Chairman SIMPSON  and Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for their work on this legislation, but I would like to engage in this colloquy about the Denali Commission in Alaska. My proposal would have restored funding for the Denali Commission to its fiscal year 2017 level to continue the great work that it does to support the constituents of the rural areas of Alaska. My proposal would also restore the 2017 funding levels for the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional Authority, and the Northern Border Regional Commission. The Denali Commission started in 1998 with Senator Stevens as an independent Federal agency designed to provide critical utilities, infrastructure, and economic support throughout Alaska. With the creation of the Denali Commission, Congress acknowledged the need for increased interagency cooperation and a focus on Alaska’s remote communities. The Denali Commission operates in the most geographically diverse and challenging area in America, twice the size of Texas. In fact, this area would encompass both the Delta Regional Authority and the Appalachian Regional Commission. I continue to believe the Denali Commission is a model of efficient and innovative government. The Commission has also improved the living conditions of rural areas of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, Mr. SIMPSON has done the best he can, and you cannot believe all the programs that the Denali Commission provides for the State of Alaska and my constituents. I would appreciate Mr. SIMPSON looking at maybe a future time that we could fund it at the level that we were in 2017. Mr. Chairman, I do urge Mr. SIMPSON , as the chairman, to understand how important the Denali Commission is to Alaska. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I appreciate my colleague’s statement on the Denali Commission. He is a strong advocate for Alaska and the important work that the Denali Commission conducts in the State. The House mark this year supports the Denali Commission and its efforts rather than the administration’s request to terminate the agency. The elimination of the Denali Commission would have deprived many communities of essential infrastructure and economic development projects. In a time of economic change, these communities can scarcely afford to lose the millions of dollars in private investment leveraged by the Commission annually. In the event the subcommittee receives additional funding in conference, I would be happy to work with my colleague to ensure the Denali Commission is provided sufficient funds to support their efforts in his State. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that Mr. SIMPSON just mentioned it was eliminated by the administration, and he did restore some of the money. I am just requesting that, if he gets any more money, we would look for it in the Denali Commission so that the work it has done is well rewarded. Mr. Chairman, I thank both the chairmen for the work they have done establishing the Denali Commission in past years, and let’s go forth. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with the gentleman from Alaska. 
b1645 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER ), the distinguished vice ranking member of the committee. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the chairman and our ranking member. I have great respect for both of them. Mr. Chair, the most important responsibility we have is to keep our Nation and our citizens safe. In order to fulfill that responsibility, we have a commitment to those who serve, that they will have the training and equipment and support that they need to be the most capable fighting force the world has ever seen. We also have a commitment to the men and women who serve that we will have their back, not only when they are on duty, but when they come home. This Congress should support a pay raise for our Nation’s troops. This Congress should support a cuttingedge Naval fleet. This Congress should make sure that we can say that every veteran will get the care that he or she has earned. But this Congress should also be opposed to a bill that puts the Department of Defense right in the path of the acrosstheboard spending cuts known as sequestration. Now, I admit, I had not heard of sequestration until I first ran for this job. It turns out it is a Latin word for stupid, because when you face our military leaders, even in my district, they have implored this Congress to do away with the bind that sequestration threatens to put them in. They think this is a bad idea. But what we are doing this week ignores the advice of our top commanders and our military experts. Instead, it would put the Department of Defense on a collision course with sequestration. That would mean harmful cuts, acrosstheboard cuts to our military, regardless of priority. The failure of this Congress to pass a legitimate budget is a disservice to our Armed Forces and to every man and woman who serves in it. We should be giving those in uniform certainty that their paychecks will arrive on time, that their gear will be the best, that they will get the training that they need, and that cuts won’t hurt their readiness. So let’s get serious about a budget. Let’s vote down this bill and do better. Pass a responsible bill. Listen, a majority of the Members in this Chamber are willing to support a plan that not only funds our military, but also makes sure we don’t approach yet another government shutdown. That is what the American people sent us here to do, Mr. Chair. Let’s listen to their voices. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), the distinguished chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for yielding me time. I am very pleased to support H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act of 2018, especially because it includes H.R. 3266, which provides appropriations for the energy programs within the Science, Space, and Technology Committee’s jurisdiction. Chairman SIMPSON , who is on the floor behind me, has worked closely with us on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to include responsible, proscience funding levels for the Department of Energy. Chairman SIMPSON , your leadership and cooperation have been exceptional and are much appreciated. Thank you for your leadership in passing this legislation that sets America on a path to remain the world’s leader in innovation. The appropriations included in this legislation are consistent with the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act, which passed the House last Congress. This bill also funds programs authorized in H.R. 589, the DOE Research and Innovation Act, which passed the House earlier this year and was the product of over 3 years of work by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to advance basic research and set clear science priorities for the Department of Energy. American industry relies on Federal support for basic research to produce the scientific breakthroughs that fuel technological innovation, new industries, economic growth, and good jobs. Around the country, scientists at our National Labs and universities are conducting groundbreaking, basic science research that provides the foundation for next generation technology in energy, medicine, and manufacturing. This legislation provides strong support for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science at $5.4 billion for fiscal year 2018. The Office of Science will get increased funding for research in basic energy sciences, highperformance computing, nuclear physics, high energy physics, and fusion energy. The strong support for the Office of Science in the appropriations bill will prioritize the basic research programs that are the core mission of the Department and the National Labs and lead to scientific discoveries that can provide benefits across the economy. This legislation also includes responsible funding for DOE’s applied programs, prioritizing earlystage research in electricity, energy efficiency, renewables, fossil, and nuclear. An example of such critical early stage energy research involves nuclear energy where the bill’s funding supports the priorities outlined in the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which passed the House as a part of H.R. 589. That legislation, sponsored by Energy Subcommittee Chairman RANDY WEBER of Texas, combines the strengths of the National Labs, universities, and the private sector to develop advanced nuclear technology. This technology is our best opportunity to provide reliable, emissionfree electricity. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. SMITH of Texas. I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding me an additional minute. This appropriations bill also includes funding to begin design and construction for the research reactor authorized in H.R. 589, which will provide access to the fast neutrons necessary to enable the next generation of nuclear energy technology. As we shape the future of the Department of Energy, our priority must be basic and earlystage research that only the Federal Government has the incentives and resources to support and pursue. This will empower private sector innovators to develop and demonstrate resulting new capabilities that will attract the capital investments needed to take energy technology to the marketplace, creating jobs and expanding our economy. Mr. Chairman, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this pro science bill, proenergy appropriations bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ). Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding. I also want to thank the Appropriations chair from New Jersey and the staff, and also the ranking young lady from New York and the staff for being a bipartisan committee. The Appropriations Committee has been bipartisan. While this bill before us is a step toward getting the job done of passing the appropriations bill before the end of the fiscal year, we know this is only the first step. We still have a lot more work to do. I regret that the rule that we will take up tomorrow will likely include $1.6 billion for a wall. We who live on the border, we understand and we believe in border security, border security that is strong, sensible, common sense, and effective for the border. The wall is a 14th century solution to a 21st century challenge that we have. The border wall is not the right solution for border security. Why? Number one, private property rights. We believe in private property rights. In fact, there are some people that, for generations, have owned land along the border. I have several veterans that own land. In fact, there is one veteran in particular that buried his father— his father who served in World War II— and his family right along the riverbank. So if you put a wall, what is he going to do? Once you put the wall, how is he going to go visit the cemetery, the family cemetery along the border? 
What about cattle, livestock? How are they going to have access to water along the river? Number two, we have natural barriers along the Texas border. We have the rivers. You can see how the river snakes around. And what about the cliffs? Are you going to put a wall on top of this cliff? It just doesn’t make sense. Number three, what about taxpayers’ dollars? Mexico is not going to pay for this wall. We know that the American taxpayer is going to pay for this, $1.6 billion for 74 miles out of the 1,954 miles that we have. That is $21.2 million per mile for this wall, compared to $1 million of technology we wanted to put, technology cameras, sensors, aerostats for border security. And, oh, by the way, so $1.6 billion; all I need is $100, buy myself a good ladder, and we will take care of that wall. So, again, we have got to be smart about border security. Number four, environmental concerns, we have concerns with regard to wildlife refuges. What about the 40 percent out of the 11 million people that we have here who did visa overstays? So you can put the biggest wall, but people are going to fly, are going to drive across the bridge, are going to get a boat into Houston and just stay over their time. What about a cap analysis so we know what are the real needs that we have? That is number six. What about number seven, Mexico is an ally? It is not an enemy. Every day we have $1.3 billion of trade with our friends to the south—every day, 1.3. That is over $1 million of trade every single minute, 6 million American jobs that we have because of the trade that we have with our friends to the south. We need strong, commonsense border security, and I know this because I live on the border. I drink the water. I breathe the air. I understand this very well. The border area is very safe. Use FBI stats. The murder rate in my hometown of Laredo is three murders per 100,000. Here in Washington, D.C., it is 24.5 murders per 100,000. So if you want to talk about dangerous, when I leave the border to fly over to Washington, this is the most dangerous thing about my job. So the wall is a 14th century solution to a 21st century problem. I ask you to vote ‘‘no’’ on the border wall. Again, I want to thank the Appropriations Committee for being bipartisan. This is only the first step. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ). Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Make America Secure Appropriations Act of 2018. I am particularly pleased to support language from H.R. 3266, which provides appropriations for energy programs within the Science, Space, and Technology Committee’s jurisdiction. For years, the Energy Subcommittee, which I chair, has listened to experts and gathered data to determine appropriate priorities for the DOE. The bill brought before the House floor reflects the findings of the committee. It funds basic and earlystage research, and it does so all the while reducing spending. Importantly, this bill includes specific appropriations for programs authorized in my bill, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which establishes a clear timeline and parameters for DOE to complete a research reactor. This type of research requires access to fast neutrons currently only available in Russia. The completion of our own research reactor is crucial, Mr. Chairman, in ensuring materials and nuclear fuels R&D takes place in these United States of America. The versatile neutron source, or fast test reactor, authorized in my legislation will provide the United States with this vital capability. I want to thank Chairman FRELING HUYSEN for specifically including $35 million in funding, and Chairman SIMPSON, to begin the design and construction of vital research infrastructure in this appropriations bill. America must maintain our nuclear capabilities and continue to develop cuttingedge technology here at home. This bill provides direction and robust funding for earlystage nuclear energy research. Without it, we will fall behind. It is vital that we ensure this important research and development is fully funded. We cannot afford to miss the economic opportunities provided by next generation nuclear technology. I encourage my colleagues to support this proscience, fiscally responsible legislation. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENE GREEN ). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank our ranking member for yielding to me. I rise in opposition to funding for President Trump’s border wall. I have visited the border of Texas and Mexico many times. Communities all along and beyond the border in my home State of Texas are opposed to this border wall. Texas has deep and historic ties with our neighbor to the south, Mexico. The people of Texas and Mexico share a pride. A clear majority of our communities believe that the close ties between Texas and Mexico—cultural, economic, linguistic—benefit both Texas and Mexico. The construction of this ‘‘big, fat, beautiful wall,’’ to quote President Trump, along a 2,000milelong U.S. Mexico border is not only unnecessary, but would be harmful to our border communities and wildlife and natural habitats along the border, and become a symbol of spite and division toward Mexico and its people. b1700 Much of the border between the United States and Mexico is already separated by the Rio Grande River, a clear natural obstacle between the two countries. High traffic areas along our Southern border are further separated by over 650 miles of pedestrian and vehicle fencing currently on the border. Congress has provided the Department of Homeland Security with robust funding since the Department’s creation to sharply increase the number of Border Patrol officers and surveillance tools, including aerial drones along the border. As a result of these substantial investments by the American people, the number of immigrants without authorization has steadily declined, while the number of border apprehensions are near a 40year low. The $1.6 billion funded by taxpayer dollars included in this legislation for the President’s border wall should be directed for genuine needs, like expanding education opportunities for our children, rebuilding our Nation’s aging infrastructure. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues, if given the opportunity, to amend the legislation before this Chamber to remove the border wall funding. Otherwise, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in opposing the minibus appropriations bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I want to reiterate that this bill is a departure from regular order, wastes $1.6 billion on Trump’s border wall, uses fraudulent defense numbers, guts critical investments in clean energy, includes poisonpill riders, leaves the remaining spending bills with no path forward. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, before I close, I just want to take this opportunity to thank Mrs. LOWEY  for her work, and all of the staff here for the remarkable things they have been doing over the last 3 or 4 weeks. While we may disagree strongly on some issues, our committee, as Mr. CUELLAR said a few minutes ago, works in a bipartisan way to get our bills across the finish line. To all the members of the committee and our staff and to the ranking member, I thank them for the amicable way that all of us conduct business. It is part of the history and tradition of our committee. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I think I closed prematurely without thanking you for your leadership. It has been really a pleasure working with you. I do hope that as we move the process forward, we will be able to have a final product that we can all be very proud of. Thank you again. You have been a very delightful person to work with. And I thank the chairman, all my staff that has been so hardworking and 
so cooperative. We couldn’t do this without them on both sides of the aisle. I thank the chairman. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, in closing, I would remind the House that just yesterday we voted overwhelmingly in a bipartisan way to impose tough new sanctions on three aggressor nations: Russia, Iran and North Korea. Each pose their unique threats to our vital interests, their neighbors, and to global stability. But little in history would predict that sanction alone will change the maligned behavior of these three regimes. That is why we need to get this bill across the finish line, to guarantee that our military is always prepared to meet any threat from anyone anywhere, whether it be China in the Pacific; international terrorist groups like ISIS, alQaida, AlNusra, al Shabaab, Hezbollah, Hamas; and transnational drug smugglers and criminal gangs. Mr. Chairman, I repeat: Congress’ most important constitutional duty is to provide for the common defense. This appropriations package before us allows us to meet that solid responsibility. I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Chair, the unique circumstances of the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rulemaking warrant an expedited repeal of the rule. In November 2016, the Committee released a staff report titled ‘‘Politicization of the Waters of the United States Rulemaking,’’ detailing the findings of more than a yearlong investigation in to the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rulemaking. The investigation revealed widespread procedural violations, excessive unilateral and politically driven decisionmaking, and persistent failures of consultation and consideration of public comments. The EPA’s extraordinary efforts to push through this procedurally deficient and roundly disliked rulemaking created an insurmountable illegitimacy of the rulemaking that warrants immediate repeal. To facilitate this necessary action, Congress is exercising its authority to create exemptions to existing law in H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. Section 108 of the bill provides a singleuse exemption from regulatory procedure and legal requirements to allow EPA and the Secretary of the Army to immediately withdraw the WOTUS rule. The immediate repeal of WOTUS will allow EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to start with a clean slate as they conduct a joint rulemaking, between equal partners, with full consideration of the comments and concerns raised by the American public. In future rulemakings, including any WOTUS replacement, Congress expects federal agencies to approach their mandate to consult with state, local, and tribal governments and give full consideration to public comments with a commitment to administrative procedure and effective rulemaking. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I would like to state my strong objection to the Energy and Water Development Appropriations portion of H.R. 3219. It would completely eliminate ARPA–E, an agency that has already demonstrated incredible success in advancing highrisk, highreward energy technology solutions that neither the public nor the private sector had been willing or able to support in the past. This accomplishment was highlighted in a Congressionally mandated National Academies review of the agency released just last month. I would also note that ARPA–E recently announced that a group of 74 project teams has attracted over $1.8 billion in private sector followon funding since the agency’s founding in 2009. In addition, the agency announced that 56 projects have formed new companies and 68 projects have partnered with other government agencies for further development. Bipartisan industry leaders like Norm Augustine and Bill Gates have repeatedly called for tripling this agency’s budget given the unique role that it is now playing in our energy innovation pipeline. And I’d be remiss if I didn’t refer my colleagues to DOE Secretary Perry’s March 8th tweet, issued just 8 days before the Trump Administration proposed to eliminate the agency, which states, and I quote, ‘‘Innovators like the ones supported by our ARPA–E program are key to advancing America’s energy economy.’’ I couldn’t have said it better myself. In addition, this bill would eliminate DOE’s innovation technology loan guarantee program. The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held a hearing on this programs a few months ago, and we learned that its record of accomplishment more than justifies our continued support. The DOE Loan Programs Office has been instrumental in launching the utilityscale PV industry, Tesla Motors, and the construction of our first new nuclear reactors in 30 years. In addition, it is now supporting the commercialization of new carbon capture and reuse technologies. Overall the Loan Office’s losses are only about 2 percent of its entire portfolio—a rate that is lower than many venture capitalists achieve. And even after accounting for those losses, the interest payments from these loans and loan guarantees have returned over $1 billion to the Treasury. If we’re aiming to create jobs and reduce the deficit, this is exactly the type of program we should be supporting. Finally, this bill makes substantial cuts to many of the Department’s other critical energy technology offices for the grid, fossil energy, and nuclear energy, as well as a massive 47 percent cut to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Our national infrastructure for clean energy research would be irreparably harmed if these cuts were actually implemented. Now, I am not going to tell you that every program the Department currently implements is perfect, that reforms should never be considered, or that reasonable people can’t simply disagree on the best way to allocate its resources even after a careful, rigorous review. One of my largest concerns now, especially given the incredibly severe damage that this bill would impose on our entire energy research enterprise, is that such a thoughtful review never actually took place. In closing, I hope that we can all take a step back and more carefully consider the direction we want to move the Department in. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in the Senate to restore federal support for these vital programs. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I wanted to briefly discuss eating disorders and how it affects our servicemembers and their families. Eating disorders affects over 30 million Americans during their lifetimes, and have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness. Studies show that eating disorders affect our servicemembers and their families at a higher rate than the civilian population, with 34 percent of female active duty servicemembers and 20 percent of children of sevicemembers scoring at risk for an eating disorder. Additionally, a Military Medicine study of female military members and veterans found significant relationships between eating disorders, PTSD and sexual trauma. As we have much to learn on how eating disorders affect our military members and their families, I would encourage the House to start considering how we can address this issue within our military. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. TIPTON ). All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–30 shall be considered as adopted and the bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of further amendment under the 5minute rule and shall be considered as read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . CONNOLLY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 163, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $1,022,250)’’. Page 164, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $1,022,250)’’. Page 189, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $1,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would increase funding for the Government Accountability Office, offset by a minor decrease in the funding for the MRA accounts here in the House of Representatives. I am offering the amendment for three reasons: First, the bill significantly underfunds the GAO. Second, the administration is actively thwarting congressional oversight, which we need more of, not less of. Finally, Congress, which struck an aggressive posture in oversight during the previous administration, seems to have lost its way a bit in its constitutional duty to oversee the activities of this executive branch. The GAO is a vital resource not only for congressional overseers, but also anyone interested in studying or improving the effectiveness of Federal agencies. The GAO is often referred to as the congressional watchdog. I am sure every Member of Congress has supported or requested a GAO report with the purpose of examining broad and discrete issues of executive branch oversight at some point in their career. It is a vital institution that saves taxpayer dollars. Every dollar we invest in the GAO, Mr. Chairman, generates a $112 return for the Federal Government and for the taxpayer. This oversight dividend amounted to $63 billion in financial benefits for the Federal Government in fiscal year 2016 alone. Unfortunately, the bill before us provides $46.2 million less than the budget request for fiscal year 2018. This amendment would simply restore a modest $1 million of it. I know the lack of sufficient funding for the GAO has been a topic of discussion and debate between the majority and minority on the Appropriations Committee. I would note that the ranking member raised the issue in the ‘‘Additional Views’’ section of the committee report. In the report, Ranking Member LOWEY and Representative T IMRYAN, who is with us on the floor, stated it is irresponsible to underfund the GAO, especially when administration officials have reportedly been ordered not to comply with Democratic oversight requests. Which brings me to my second reason for offering the amendment: the indifferent and at times outright adversarial approach the Trump administration has decided to take to normal routine congressional oversight work. The administration has ignored the seven member rule, for example, an authority enacted into law in 1928, which delegates authority to any seven members of my committee, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, to require any executive branch agency to submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of our committee. The Trump administration released an opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel, arguing that agencies and departments could ignore requests for documents and other information from Members of the minority party. On June 7, Republican Senator CHUCK  GRASSLEY , who certainly knew the benefit of getting information requests in the minority answered, wrote a scathing letter to President Trump urging him to reject the opinion. The opinion stated that only requests from committees or their chairs are constitutionally authorized. Senator GRASSLEY , Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, called the opinion nonsense. In his letter to the President, he stated: ‘‘For OLC to fundamentally misunderstand and misstate such a simple fact exposes its shocking lack of professionalism and objectivity.’’ He also wrote: ‘‘Oversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability. And the opposite is true. Shutting down oversight requests doesn’t drain the swamp.’’ Those are the words of CHUCK GRASS LEY. As the vice ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I have witnessed firsthand the committee’s volteface on issues of oversight. Whereas, during the Obama administration, one would have thought that, like the British Empire, the Sun never set on the jurisdiction of our committee. Now, suddenly, the majority advances a tortured and narrow interpretation of the committee’s role as the primary oversight body for the House of Representatives. If the administration is going to ignore the minority in Congress and the majority is suddenly allergic to congressional oversight, the demands on the GAO are going to grow. With that greater responsibility should come greater resources. First and foremost, the House should join Senator GRASSLEY and demand that this administration not impede congressional oversight activities. In the absence of the administration acceding to this request, we have got to send a clear message about the importance to the executive branch of accountability by better funding the GAO. This amendment will not solve the GAO funding created by this bill, but it would send a message to our colleagues in the Senate about the premium we place on the principle of robust oversight of the executive branch. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment which would increase funding for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and offset that increase with a reduction in funding for the salaries and expenses of the House of Representatives. I am offering this amendment for three reasons. First, this bill significantly underfunds GAO. Second, this administration is actively thwarting congressional oversight. And finally, Congress, which struck an aggressive posture on oversight during the Obama Administration, seems to have forgotten its Constitutional duty to oversee the activities of the Executive Branch. GAO is a vital resource for not only Congressional overseers, but also anyone interested in studying or improving the effectiveness of federal agencies and the way in which they carry out their vital missions. GAO is often referred to as the ‘‘congressional watchdog.’’ I am sure nearly every Member of Congress has supported or requested a GAO report with the purpose of examining broad and discrete issues of Executive Branch oversight. It is a vital institution that helps ensure taxpayer dollars are invested wisely. Every dollar we invest in GAO generates a $112 return for the federal government. This oversight dividend amounted to $63 billion in financial benefits for the federal government in fiscal year 2016. Unfortunately, the bill before us provides $46.2 million less than the budget request for FY 2018, which would result in the loss of 200 GAO staff by the end of the coming fiscal year. 
I know the lack of sufficient funding for GAO has been a topic of discussion and debate between the Majority and the Minority on the Appropriations Committee. I would note that the Ranking Member raised this issue in the ‘‘Additional Views’’ section of the Committee report for the Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill. In the report, Ranking Member LOWEY and Representative TIMRYAN stated, ‘‘It is irresponsible to underfund the GAO, especially when Administration officials have reportedly been ordered not to comply with Democratic oversight requests.’’ Which brings me to my second reason for offering this amendment—the indifferent and, at times, hostile approach the Trump Administration has decided to take to Congressional oversight work. The administration has ignored the Seven Member Rule, an authority that was enacted into law in 1928 which delegates authority to any seven members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to require any Executive Branch agency to ‘‘submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee.’’ The Trump Administration released an opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel on May 1, 2017, arguing that agencies and departments could ignore requests for documents and other information from Members of Congress other than Republican Committee Chairmen. On June 7, 2017, Republican Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY wrote a scathing letter to President Trump urging him to reject the opinion issued by Office of Legal Counsel. The opinion stated that only requests from committees or their chairs are ‘‘constitutionally authorized.’’ Senator GRASSLEY called the opinion ‘‘nonsense.’’ In his letter to the president he stated, ‘‘For OLC to so fundamentally misunderstand and misstate such a simple fact exposes its shocking lack of professionalism and objectivity. Indeed, OLC appears to have utterly failed to live up to its own standards. You are being ill served and illadvised.’’ He also wrote, ‘‘Oversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability. And, the opposite is true. Shutting down oversight requests doesn’t drain the swamp, Mr. President. It floods the swamp.’’ And Congress is not blameless here. As the Vice Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I have witnessed firsthand that Committee’s volteface on issues of oversight. Whereas, during the Obama Administration one would have thought that like the British Empire the sun never set on the jurisdiction of the Oversight Committee, now the Majority advances a tortured and narrow interpretation of the Committee’s role as the primary oversight body for the House of Representatives. If the Administration is going to ignore the Minority in Congress, and the Majority is suddenly allergic to Congressional oversight, the demands on GAO are only going to grow. And with that greater responsibility should come greater resources. First and foremost, the House should join Senator GRASSLEY and demand that this administration not impede Congressional oversight activities. In the absence of the administration acceding to this demand, we must send a clear message about the importance of Executive Branch accountability by better funding GAO. This amendment will not solve the GAO funding difficulties created by this bill, but it would send a message to our colleagues in the Senate about the premium we place on the principle of robust oversight of the Executive Branch. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kansas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his amendment to add $1 million to the already $545 million that we spend on the Government Accountability Office. The GAO plays an important role in being a government watchdog. They are the sort of watchdog of what happens in this city. And we are all certainly concerned, whether it is a Democrat or Republican President, that we want a GAO that can do its work and to root out fraud, waste, and abuse, provide economic data for Congress, help us to do our job in holding our government accountable, and help the American people hold our government accountable. That is why we work on this bill, to keep funding steady for the GAO and to help centralize IG reports to make them ultimately public and online to increase transparency. But we have tight constraints on our budget. Even so, while we work to fund additional security needs, critical infrastructure projects that need to be funded, and muchneeded cybersecurity improvements, reducing the amount of money that goes to MRAs from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle would weaken our ability to represent our constituents, weaken our ability to effectively communicate with our constituents. I don’t think that is the gentleman’s intent here, but that would be the ultimate result. We actually have a slight increase in what the GAO can spend in our budget, getting up to $545 million. So there is a slight increase here, and that is at a time in which many budgets are being decreased across Congress. Many of our constituents are tightening their belts and learning how to do more with less in the challenges they face putting food on the table for their families and really working in a family budget. We have to do the same thing here in Congress, Mr. Chairman. The GAO actually gets slightly more money this year, and they have the ability to continue to carry out their function at $545 million. And I don’t believe going to $546 million is going to achieve the significant changes that maybe Mr. CONNOLLY would like to see. Ultimately, we are not able to accommodate this request, Mr. Chairman. Our Member budgets are already 12 percent below what they were when the Republicans took over the House in 2010. b1715 We are 12 percent below, even with this expenditure, and many Members are concerned that they don’t have the resources to provide what they need to for their constituents. So cutting these budgets by $1 million more would only exacerbate those problems. Mr. Chairman, we would have to oppose this amendment. We want the GAO to remain strong, and that is why we slightly increased their funding, but we can’t really rob the MRA budgets to add to that with the many challenges we have and many priorities in this Congress. Mr. Chairman, I would oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MRS . LOVE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 115–259. Mrs. LOVE. I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 164, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $11,025,000) (increased by $11,025,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Utah. Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to speak about my proposed amendment to the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. My amendment will have zero budgetary impact, and the intent is to merely advocate for the expansion of permissible uses of the MRA funds that have already been designated for Member security. Currently, the Appropriations Committee has provided MRA resources in the amount of $25,000 per Member for providing Member security away from the Capitol complex; however, this money may not be currently spent on security at a Member’s private residence. In the current environment, however, many Members, myself included, have faced threats that extend to our homes and our families. For me, that included a person putting my address on Facebook and Twitter with a statement that stated: ‘‘We’ve signed your death certificate. You won’t see us coming.’’ In fact, in recognition of this disturbing trend, a recent FEC advisory opinion held that the campaign funds may be used, ‘‘. . . to install or upgrade residential security systems that do not constitute structural improvements to a Members’ homes.’’ My amendment proposes that MRA funds for Member security may be used 
in this same way. We do not face these threats because we are candidates for office but because we are sitting Members of Congress. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ), my colleague from Louisiana’s Second Congressional District. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Chair, I rise to support the gentlewoman from Utah’s amendment. I think that it is very appropriate, and, unfortunately, we find ourselves in a time where this is needed. But we have the awesome responsibility, and we have to remind ourselves sometimes that we are the only 435 people in the country that will vote on this country going to war and making decisions that impact this country. Because of that, I think that we need to make sure that we safeguard ourselves in this rising time of new threats and dangers. Look, we all signed up for public service and to serve our country and to make it a more perfect Union; however, a lot of our families and our neighbors and our constituents that show up at our functions didn’t necessarily sign up for that. So for those reasons, I would just ask that my colleagues support it. I think it is a very prudent piece of legislation, amendment, at a very important time. Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. BRIDENSTINE ), my colleague from Oklahoma’s First Congressional District. Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to thank the gentlewoman from Utah for offering this very important amendment at this time in American history. A lot of us have received threats, and I think this is a good amendment. I would like to thank the gentleman from Louisiana for stepping up to support it as well. I would like to reiterate the point that this amendment could save lives, and it doesn’t add a single penny to the budget, to the debt, to the deficit. This doesn’t add a single penny, and yet it could be responsible for saving the lives of our colleagues. So I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Utah for offering it and the gentleman from Louisiana for supporting it. I would urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Chair, I would like to go ahead and reiterate my thanks to the Appropriations Committee and to my colleagues for all of the support on this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Kansas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Mrs. LOVE for her eloquence and leadership on this issue. She has provided a very serious proposal at a time in which, in light of the recent tragedy at a baseball park here in the suburbs of Virginia and what we have seen across the country, there are threats made daily against Members of Congress, both Democratic and Republican. In fact, threats are up this year over what they were all of last year combined. We know many of these threats are simply just hot air or anger being expressed in an overly vitriolic way. We have all seen it on social media, on Twitter, on Facebook pages, things that are just really shocking and lack the discourse and the civility that we need to solve problems in this country. But it reaches a different level when Members of Congress are put in threatening situations where they or their families legitimately believe that someone may try to harm them. So we must ensure that we do everything we can to protect this institution, that we protect this government, that we protect democracy. The idea that anyone in this body could be targeted based on their political beliefs, like my friend and our colleague, our majority whip, STEVE SCALISE, was when he was shot at a baseball practice by somebody who was specifically targeting Republicans for their beliefs, that is sort of new in the world of the shootings that we have seen around the country, that someone would be specifically targeted for their beliefs. It happened to Republicans now; it could happen to Democrats the next time. So I think we stand unified as a Congress that we must improve the security in order to protect democracy. We signed up for this, of course, and as my colleague, Mr. RICHMOND , said, our families didn’t. Home security relates to our children, our families, making sure there are cameras or whatever improvements need to be made so that people know that, if someone were to try to attack them at their home, they would be protected. In this bill, we have addressed security here in Washington, D.C. We have addressed security at our district offices at home. We have even allowed personal security. But what we haven’t done is allowed some support for home security. We have seen, in recent weeks, that the FEC has said you can spend campaign dollars for this, and I think it is a reasonable request that Mrs. LOVEis making, that others are standing up for, to allow the MRA to be utilized for that. So I think what the gentlewoman is raising will help with peace of mind. It will help stem real attacks, is limited in its scope, and ultimately protects democracy. Members of Congress should not be intimidated or injured or worse because of what they believe in. I ask the body to support this legislation, and I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), the ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I just want to make it unanimous here. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Utah for offering this amendment and Mr. RICHMOND for coming here to support it. Again, everything has been said. This is appropriate. We are in unchartered waters here. We were at the baseball practices. We saw what happened to our colleague. We go out to events; we can have security. We go to our office; we can have security. You come home, and you can’t. So I think this is appropriate. I want to thank you for taking this issue up on behalf of the body. We have so many Members today that will take opportunities to diminish this body, and you stood up and showed some leadership in enhancing this body. I want to support this amendment, and I thank the chairman for allowing this to happen. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . KILDEE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 163, line 25, after the dollar amount insert the following: ‘‘(increased by $250,000)’’. Page 167, line 3, after the dollar amount insert the following: ‘‘(increased by $250,000)’’. Page 167, line 14, after the dollar amount insert the following: ‘‘(increased by $250,000)’’. Page 176, line 18, after the dollar amount insert the following: ‘‘(reduced by $250,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is actually quite simple. It would expand the House Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program to ensure that even more wounded veterans have the opportunity to work here in Congress and contribute their talents to our work here. We need more veterans in public service. This amendment would provide additional opportunities for veterans to continue to serve their country here in the House of Representatives as legislative fellows. I think we know that these veterans bring a particular perspective and a particular set of experiences unlike anything else we hear, and this perspective should inform the conversations, the discussions, and the deliberations we have on all subjects, but particularly on subjects related to their 
experience and their particular perspective. We need these voices especially now more than ever. We do talk a lot about ways to help veterans transition from their service to the world of work following their time in the military. This would increase the number of veterans that are given the opportunity to, right here, work alongside us and to provide us with their perspective. This amendment is budget neutral and provides additional opportunities for veterans to help us in our work. I think it is the right thing. I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), the ranking member of the subcommittee. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman. I think the Wounded Warrior Project we have going on here in the House of Representatives is a great project. It is a great opportunity, as you articulated, to get people into the legislative process, both in our district offices and here in Washington, D.C., and I want to voice my support for that. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, even though I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kansas? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Mr. KILDEE for his leadership in bringing this to this body’s attention. I think the work of our men and women in service defending our Nation is the highest priority for this Congress, and our support for them in services, in healthcare, in helping them find work, in education, in training, all the things they need when they come home, I think we are unified in our support that they should be recognized as the heroes they are when they come back and leave service. Some of these men and women, in putting themselves in the field of battle have become wounded, and sometimes very severely. They have stood in the field of battle. They have stood up to our enemies. They have protected freedom around the globe and here at home, keeping us and our allies, our children, our families safe, keeping freedom and democracy safe; yet, when they come home, all too often, they don’t have everything they need. All too often, they don’t feel that the promises this government has made have been kept. So each and every day I think we are working on legislation to improve that. We have passed bills in recent weeks here to continue and improve veterans’ programs, but the House Wounded Warrior Program is a great example of how this Congress is leading by example by creating 2year fellowships for disabled veterans. The unemployment rate is higher for these men and women than it is for nonveterans, and disabled veterans in particular, and so this fellowship program provides a valuable job, a valuable experience, an opportunity for these men and women to help serve their country, which is in their DNA. It is who they are. When they are done serving on the battlefield, they can come serve in our congressional offices, and it provides a great service for us. They provide the opportunity for us to have an expert on not only veterans’ issues and military issues, but many issues. They can cover a whole range of things, providing better services for us and our constituents. In our legislation, the underlying bill, we increased the total number of fellowships to 85 from 54 because there is a waiting list. This is a 57 percent increase over the previous number. And 79 Member offices are on the waiting list right now to participate in this program, so the demand is there. We certainly know that there are many veterans who would love to serve in this capacity, and so we are excited to support this amendment putting more resources into this program, and we are going to work with the gentleman from Michigan to make sure that we can open up slots in a timely manner to help make sure we get these men and women into the offices so they can serve. Mr. Chairman, we support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1730 Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to express my appreciation to Chairman YODER for his support and for Ranking Member RYANfor their bipartisan support of this effort. It is the right thing to do. It will make a difference in the work that we do and especially will make a difference for those returning wounded warriors to give them a chance to start a career perhaps. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . PERRY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 176, line 2, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $25,436,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, our Nation is $20 trillion in debt, and there might be $100 trillion or $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities. I am not sure we really know what the answer is there. But we have got to find a way to reduce our spending and make sure that the things we are paying for are worthy and that we are getting something—we are actually getting what we are paying for. I am offering an amendment to H.R. 3219 to reduce the appropriations to the Congressional Budget Office by 50.4 percent. We all know and agree the Congressional Budget Office is tasked with determining the budget and economic impacts of proposed legislation which are critical to our everyday decisions. Oftentimes, they are late, and, unfortunately, too often they are woefully incorrect. I don’t mean to impugn the fine people who work at the CBO, but something is amiss. If we keep on accepting it, how are we ever going to get our policy right? The CBO’s fiscal analysis is consistently incorrect, and, as a result, has detrimental implications on a variety of policies. This amendment reduces the CBO’s fiscal year ’18 appropriations by 50.4 percent which just happens to be the exact same percentage that the CBO was off when it predicted the enrollment numbers for the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2016. In 2010, the CBO projected that 21 million people would enroll in the exchange plans by 2016. The actual enrollment was about 10.4 million people. That is an error of 50.4 percent, Mr. Chairman. Now, maybe the CBO’s projections would have improved as the ACA continued to take shape after 2010, and that seems reasonable. That is not correct. That is wrong. It didn’t improve. Four years later, the CBO predicted that, from 2016, between 23 and 25 million people would receive coverage through the exchanges. In 2014, the updated CBO analysis projected that 24 million people would receive coverage through the exchange in 2016. However, the actual 2016 enrollment in the ACA exchanges was 10.4 million people. So it is less than half. They always predict about twice as much, or costs twice as much, and the numbers always seem to be half as much. That is a big deal. We passed the American Health Care Act in here, and I went to my townhall, and CBO is saying: well, 23 to 24 million people are going to lose their insurance because of the American Health Care Act. Well, yes, if you use the CBO’s numbers which based the analysis on what they projected. They don’t even look at reality. We have got the reality right now. The reality is 10.4 million people, not 23 and 25 million—10.4. But that is how they view this thing, and that is what we vote on here. That is a problem. 
I also want to highlight the failure of the CBO to forecast the cost of the Medicaid expansion. In 2013, the CBO projected that 34 million people would be on Medicaid or CHIP in 2016; however, in 2016, the CBO doubled, once again, they doubled their earlier estimates to 68 million people. I mean, who gets to be off by that much and still receive—it is not like there is no accountability; there isn’t any accountability, Mr. Chairman. As a result, in March of 2016, the CBO increased its projection of Federal spending for Medicaid by $146 billion. These are figures that we make decisions on around here. Mr. Chairman, the CBO simply must be held accountable for its consistent failure to accurately or even reasonably predict budget and economic impacts of legislation. CBO is a critical contribution to our discussion and decisionmaking. We simply need to be able to depend on it as such. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I have been here long enough to recognize that, at times, the majority party will come to some level of disagreement with the Congressional Budget Office. We were here during the healthcare debate, we were here during tax cuts and all kinds of different things that happened in the last 15 years that I have been here. They are not perfect, and they sometimes annoy us. As I can tell from my good friend on the other side, he is in the annoyance period with the Congressional Budget Office. But this is an essential component to what we do here. The Congressional Budget Office sincerely attempts to give us the best, most accurate information that they could possibly provide us, and those estimates change over time as circumstances change over time. When you are talking about onesixth of the entire United States economy, it is going to be difficult to give you entirely accurate information. But not having this essential service here, I think, would be detrimental to this Congress, detrimental to our ability to even gauge and forecast into the future, and so I oppose this amendment strongly and vigorously. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH ) who I know also has a strong opinion on this matter. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment and urge my colleagues to reject it. Some Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration are engaged in a steadily escalating campaign to tear down the Congressional Budget Office and anyone else who does not tell them what they want to hear. This amendment is a direct assault eliminating half of CBO’s budget. The CBO is our impartial referee. Its vigorous work has been indispensable for Congress as we consider legislation that impacts the lives of the American people. This amendment is not good for democracy, and it is not consistent with the principles of good government. Republicans claim to care about fiscal responsibility, but this amendment would destroy the office we rely on to help us meet that standard. My Republican colleagues are willing to compromise the integrity of this House solely because they cannot defend the bill repealing the Affordable Care Act. They cannot effectively explain to their constituents why they voted to leave more than 20 million Americans uninsured and dramatically increase the cost of insurance for millions more. They are unable to justify cutting $1 trillion from Medicaid and jeopardizing care for seniors in nursing homes, children, and families struggling to make ends meet. What they are doing in all of this is to provide cuts for the wealthiest Americans. This amendment is a clear attempt to divert attention from that reality and to hide the truth from the American people. It will set a dangerous precedent. As students, we would all like to grade our own papers, but we can’t do that in Congress. We have to have somebody impartial who will grade them for us and tell us what this means to our budget and to the American people. Congress created CBO to give us our own sense of budgetary information and expertise so we would not have to rely on administration estimates. CBO improves our ability to protect the power of the purse. For more than 40 years, the CBO has steadfastly fulfilled its mission providing impartial analysis and expertise to inform our decisionmaking. The CBO Director and all personnel are appointed to their positions without regard to their political affiliation, solely based on their ability and qualifications. They show no allegiance or deference to any political ideology or party when preparing their analyses. It is all too easy these days to take refuge in information that tells us only what we want to hear. But that does not lead to sound policy. CBO does not exist to give us the information that we want to hear. Its job is to give us the information that we need to make informed, responsible decisions. It is one of few institutions in Washington that serves that role. It is beneath the Congress to attack the CBO which is only doing its job. It should be embarrassing to my Republican colleagues that they are launching these attacks simply because they do not have the courage to defend the damaging effects of their plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This needs to stop. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire of the time remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 1 minute remaining. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I don’t disagree with my colleagues on the other side. I said that. We need the CBO. We created the CBO. Congress needs to have reliable information. The problem is, it is not reliable. It is not reliable on the testimony that was just given against this amendment. That is the problem. The CBO—right now where there are 10.4 enrollees—is telling us, in 2 years, there are going to be 25 million enrollees. Meanwhile, there are less exchanges open, and there are fewer insurers available. It is not going up; it is going down. The CBO, when we say that they would reflect the current time, they absolutely don’t. That is the problem. They don’t even reflect reality when reality is right in front of them. The CBO needs to wake up. Who among us works for half the time and gets it doubly wrong and gets the same paycheck? The CBO. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division B (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. lll. The Budget Analysis Division of the Congressional Budget Office, comprising 89 employees with annual salaries aggregating $15,000,000, is hereby abolished. The duties imposed by law and regulation upon the employees of that Division are hereby transferred to the Office of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to read the amendment because I think there must be some confusion on this, and it will become important later in the debate: ‘‘The Budget Analysis Division of the Congressional Budget Office, comprising 89 employees with annual salaries aggregating $15 million is hereby abolished. The duties’’—underlined duties, because it is only duties—‘‘imposed by law and regulation upon the employees of that division are hereby transferred to the Office of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.’’ That is the simple amendment, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS ). Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my esteemed colleagues for raising the issue, but it is more an issue of accuracy than anything else. As we look at this, Mr. Chairman, it is real easy to look at CBO and realize that they are the one group that makes a weatherman’s 10day forecast look accurate. They consistently miss it all the time. When you look at the 2002 farm bill, they missed it by $137 billion. The 2008 farm bill, they missed by $309 billion. Eventually, it adds up to real money. But even with that, let’s look at the sale of 64 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve. They actually said that there is no income from that and that it costs the government to get rid of 64 million barrels of oil. What kind of analysis does that? So if my friend opposite wants to debate this over the accuracy, I welcome it. Mr. Chair, it is time that we deal with this. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, we have heard some of the problems with CBO from Mr. MEADOWS. We heard from Mr. P ERRY immediately before on his amendment. The CBO is meant to help Congress evaluate legislation. But I do not believe the agency, as currently constituted, has or can do so effectively. b1745 Too often, predictions made by CBO turn out to be far off the mark. We heard about the 2002 farm bill and the 2008 farm bill from Mr. MEADOWS . That is true, but people back home may not realize that, in fact, we don’t do a farm bill every year. We do one roughly every 5 years, sometimes a little later than that, so there have not been so many to score. One of our favorites on the Energy and Commerce Committee, on which I am pleased to serve, is the fact that, in 2015, we decided we would push forward and sell, as a nation, some broadband spectrum. CBO said zero dollars would be yielded from that sale. Now, I use this all the time when I am talking to high school students, because you don’t have to be a CBO person living in the ivory tower that they must live in to understand that broadband spectrum has value in today’s society, and zero is not the right score. In the end, it brought in $44 billion. When you take away the costs, it brought in a net $40 billion. CBO was wrong. CBO has overestimated on a number of things. Mr. PERRY talked about ObamaCare. But time after time after time, they have gotten things wrong. They said it cost more or didn’t save as much. In fact, I just saw, today, a report put out by Xcenda that the perpatient oncology drug costs were 0.06 to 2.3 times lower than what CBO said they were going to be from roughly 2003 to 2013, according to that study. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is breathtaking in its completely overt vindictiveness. Some Members don’t like the calls the refs have made in games. You can have your opposition and your opinion. Here, we are trying to get the referee fired. We cannot function as a group here if we are going to continue to try to demean and criticize this very group that is trying to help us do our job. As I said a few minutes ago, the Democrats have had a long list of frustrations with the CBO, but did we have the President, the leader of our party, and a significant number of Members of the United States Congress start bad mouthing the CBO? We did not. We had our complaints, in all fairness, but we think that this group of professionals is essential to how this body functions. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACK ), the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, if you are not going to just believe Democrats on this issue. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise to voice my concerns about this amendment. I think everyone in this House has a lot of issues, as has already been talked about, with the current modeling that is used by the Congressional Budget Office, and I am certainly one of these people, but this amendment is not the best way to accomplish our goal of obtaining better information and analysis from CBO. The CBO is an important organization that provides vital information that Congress does need to make the best decisions. However, the modeling and scoring methods they currently are using need to be scrutinized, especially their behavioral predictions. For example, in 2010, the CBO projected that 21 million Americans would be covered by ObamaCare in 2016, when, in reality, less than 13 million Americans have actually obtained coverage. In fact, during their scoring of the House Republican healthcare plan, CBO described their own estimates, which rely on behavioral predictions, as extremely uncertain. That is why the House Budget Committee plans to hold a series of hearings this fall on CBO to gain a better understanding of their methods and how we can work to improve their ability to give Congress better information, which we obviously need. As chairman of the Budget Committee, I take this responsibility very seriously, and we will approach these hearings in the pursuit of truth and accuracy so we can make laws that better serve the American people. We all realize that CBO has room for improvement, but this amendment being offered tonight is not the best way to achieve that. Instead, we need to have a deliberative discussion in the Budget Committee and amongst everyone in the House, and I look forward to doing exactly that in the coming weeks and months. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), the distinguished ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Chairman, the previous speaker said: How could a group be so far off in their analysis? Well, they were that far off with the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. Alan Greenspan was certainly off. In his commentary about economic growth, we had the slowest growth since Herbert Hoover was President, based upon $2.3 trillion worth of tax cuts. So this is analysis. It is an economic forecast. It is not an algorithm. When you pick up the computer, you push a button, and all of a sudden you get a score. I am in opposition to this amendment because they play a vital role every single day, even when they are not entirely accurate, in keeping a scorecard. Members and staff on both sides, particularly at the Ways and Means Committee, rely much upon their hardworking and nonpartisan analysis for what they do every day. I have never, in 29 years in this House, said to a member of CBO: Are you a Republican or are you a Democrat? When we demean professional achievement from economists who try and strive every single day to come up with an accurate forecast, we do this institution no good. We should have a high regard for what these people do every single day—and let me say this, by the way, more accurate than the Office of Management and Budget, in my recollection, who work for Presidents and who, generally, didn’t come up 
with forecasts that Presidents might or might not like. The CBO is an independent agency and we need to keep it here. Congress could not do its work without the CBO. As TIMRYANsaid a few moments ago, this is the equivalent of let’s beat up the referee after we don’t like the outcome of the soccer game. Let’s jump the referee and tell him: You better go back in and change the score so that we might meet, perhaps, popular polling forecasts, which I also might tell you, based on what happened in November, weren’t so good, either, for all of us. Regardless of what political party we are Members of, we should have regard for this House of Representatives and the independent role that CBO offers. Chairman KEVIN BRADY stands with me on this. Leave the CBO alone. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Ohio has expired. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member LOWEY , I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. As one of the three cochairs of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of Democrats committed to bringing our Nation’s deficit and debt under control, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment would, in fact, eliminate the division in the CBO area. Frankly, it serves, as we all know, a valuable role as a nonpartisan adviser to Congress on the costs and tradeoffs on legislation and the budget of the United States. Although you don’t see these folks on TV every day, the CBO staff consists of professionals who put facts and transparency first. Forecasting the economic impacts of legislation is complicated, and no estimate will ever be perfect, let’s face that. The CBO, though, is transparent about that. That said, estimates provided by the CBO are objective and are based on facts and transparent calculations. The staff who make these estimates up aren’t swayed by the political rhetoric on either side of the spectrum on the House floor, and that is what lawmakers need in order to govern responsibly. Without the CBO, lawmakers in Washington would be flying blind, developing major legislation without knowing what the real consequences are. Just like you wouldn’t drive a car while blindfolded, you shouldn’t be voting on legislation without knowing the real costs, intended or unintended. After all, these are taxpayer dollars. This amendment is dangerous for our Nation, and there is no other way to describe it. As a society, one must accept facts as they are, whether the facts are in our favor or not. Facts are facts, I guess, unless you believe in alternative facts. In fact, CBO acts as an umpire for us here in Congress, calling balls and strikes as best it can. You may not like the call, you may not like the strike zone, you may think it is simply wrong, but you don’t attack the umpire. That is what this is: attacking the umpire because you don’t like the call. If you attack the umpire, why don’t you improve your game? At the end of the day, what we are talking about here is taxpayer dollars. We need to keep the Congressional Budget Office intact, and I oppose this legislation, as do all of the Blue Dogs. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ). Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I, too, rise in strong opposition to this mean spirited amendment. This attack on the integrity and professionalism of the Congressional Budget Office is shameful and is part of a strategic assault on the objectivity and expertise in our civil service. With this amendment, the Republicans are seeking to punish the nonpartisan CBO because they don’t agree with their finding regarding the Republican plan to replace ObamaCare. I understand that, for Republicans and the Trump administration, it is an inconvenient truth that 23 million Americans would lose coverage under their plan, but just because you are losing the game doesn’t mean you can fire the refs. Partisan talking points cannot replace unbiased analysis. Let’s not forget the CBO’s Director was appointed by a Republican Speaker and praised effusively by thenBudget chairman and current Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price. Mr. Chairman, I represent more Federal employees than any other Member of the House. Most of these 89 positions at the CBO that this amendment seeks to eliminate are my constituents. It is simply unacceptable that we somehow suggest that they and others in the civil service are not honest. The choice to pursue this political attack on the CBO through the so called Holman rule should concern every Member of Congress. Back in January, when Republicans passed their rules package enabling Members to target individual Federal employees and their pay, I warned that the Holman rule would be abused and used as a way to politically target civil servants. That is exactly what we are seeing today. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, let me just say quickly again and reiterate that we are living in a world now where facts are trying to be diminished, science is trying to be diminished, and we rely on these professionals to give us as accurate information as we can possibly obtain at the time from the professionals that are in this office. We rely on this office very much to make the decisions that we make here that have such great importance. While they are not always perfect, I think they always put forth a good product for us. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, we have heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we ought to trust the CBO, that the referee should be taken at their word and that they are doing the best they can. But let’s look at this amendment. The CBO scored it, and they said: CBO estimates that your amendment would have no net effect on budget authority or outlays in fiscal year 2018. 
No net effect. Who here actually believes that eliminating 89 positions, as the gentleman from Virginia, my friend, just said it is going to affect his people, who believes that 89 people being eliminated and $15 million in aggregate salaries has no net effect on budget authority or outlays? I don’t think any of us believe that. So here is the conundrum that my friends have on the other side of this issue: a ‘‘yes’’ vote means that you agree with me that something needs to be reformed at CBO; a ‘‘no’’ vote means that you agree with CBO’s assessment that this amendment abolishing 89 employees will have no effect. Therefore, I would submit to you that the CBO has, in effect, determined that their budget analysis division has no value. Therefore, if you actually support CBO, you must vote ‘‘present.’’ Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to join me with a ‘‘yes,’’ and let’s start the reform at CBO so we can get accurate numbers. If you don’t agree with this reform, I ask that you vote ‘‘present,’’ or else you, too, are agreeing with the CBO that the budget analysis division has no value. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, I have great respect for gentlemen who offered this amendment. They are my colleagues, and they are my friends. Mr. MEADOWS and I work very closely together on the Government Operations Subcommittee. He is my Chairman, and he knows I value his collaboration. Mr. GRIFFITH is a fellow Virginian, and I have the pleasure of serving on committees with Mr. JORDAN (OGR) and Mr. P ERRY  (HFAC). And that is why it especially pains me to say this. But this amendment, which uses the disgraceful Holman Rule to eviscerate the Congressional Budget Office’s Budget Analysis Division, is so transparent and so cynical it makes me want to weep. This amendment would punish the Congressional Budget Office for exposing the House Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act as a cruel bill that would deprive 23 million Americans of healthcare. CBO is being retaliated against for the earnest work it conducted on the Trump Budget, 
which demonstrated that the president’s budget misrepresents deficit projections by $2.3 trillion. This amendment says facts don’t matter anymore. And that is something to mourn. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia will be postponed. b1800 
AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . CICILLINE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 176, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $100,000) (increased by $100,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 3219 will help ensure that buildings such as the Capitol and the House and Senate office buildings have adequate baby changing tables. Last year, this Congress passed into law my legislation called the BABIES Act requiring that both male and female restrooms in many public buildings be equipped with baby changing facilities that are physically safe, sanitary, and appropriate. That legislation ensures that there are appropriate and sanitary facilities for parents and caretakers to change the diapers of infants and toddlers in publicly accessible Federal buildings controlled by the General Services Administration. In the same vein, I was pleased that the Legislative Branch Subcommittee included report language in its fiscal year 2017 bill recognizing the importance of providing designated baby changing stations for members of the public who visited the Capitol complex and encouraging the Architect of the Capitol to take steps to provide baby changing stations at easily accessible locations. I want to thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and Chairman YODER for their support of these efforts. My amendment today to H.R. 3219 would similarly encourage the construction of safe, appropriate, and sanitary baby changing stations in Federal public buildings controlled by the Architect of the Capitol such as the Capitol complex, the House, and Senate office buildings, the Botanic Gardens, and the Library of Congress. With more than 20 million visitors coming to Washington, D.C., each year, families are often surprised by the lack of adequate baby changing facilities in public buildings. Currently, there are only nine baby changing stations in the House office buildings, none of which are in the Rayburn Building, where my office is located. That means that when Rhode Island families who come to visit my office have to try to find a changing station, they go all the way to Cannon or Longworth, or they have to decide to change their baby on the bathroom floor, which is a terrible option. It is not sanitary either for the parents or for the children. Access to these changing stations in restrooms in Federal buildings will help in protecting the health and safety of children at a very de minimus cost, about $200 per changing station. This nominal amount will go a very long way to encouraging a family friendly environment and ensuring the safety and comfort of our constituents who visit us. And I want to again thank Chairman YODER and Ranking Member R YAN for their support of this amendment, and I look forward to working with them to help ensure that our constituents are able to have a safe and enjoyable visit to our beautiful Capitol buildings. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), the ranking member. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Let me just say briefly that I support this amendment. Making the Capitol complex and other buildings in the legislative branch more family friendly is an important priority. People come here from all over the country to meet with us, to see the sights, and to witness democracy in action. If you have traveled far and wide with your family like I have, you know how much of a difference that it would make even for a brief part of your day, like the inevitability of having to change a diaper. This amendment will make it a little bit easier. So this is just a very thoughtful, practical pro family amendment, and I encourage all of our colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. YODER ). Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island. I, too, support the gentleman’s efforts here, and, as a supporter of the BABIES Act, last year, H.R. 5147, I am happy to report, because of the language we included with the Architect of the Capitol last year, they presented a plan, which they are going to move forward with, which will install additional baby changing stations around campus, 54 of which will be going into House Office Buildings. And as a father of two little girls, I have used these changing tables myself in restrooms from time to time, as Mr. RYAN has. I know he has got a young son. And so we know how important these are and how families, when they need to make a change, they need to make a change. They need to have a space to do that. So we need to be family friendly here in the U.S. Capitol and in our House Office Buildings, and so I thank the gentleman for raising this important issue. It deserves attention. I will be happy to continue to work with the gentleman, as well as the Architect of the Capitol, to ensure that adequate number of changing stations are installed around the Capitol complex for families, for the 9 million visitors that come to this Capitol every year, that many of those have families with young children, that they are able to, as well as the Members of Congress like Mr. RYANand ourselves and many others who have young children, use these changing stations as well. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RODNEY  DAVIS of Illinois). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MR . TAKANO  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division B (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. lll. There is appropriated, for salaries and expenses of the Office of Technology Assessment as authorized by the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 (2 U.S.C. 471 et seq.) $2,500,000, to be derived from a reduction of $2,647,000 in the amount provided in this Act for the item for ‘‘Architect of the Capitol, Capital Construction and Operations’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment, which would restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment, or otherwise known as OTA. I would like to thank my cosponsors, Representatives Esty, Foster, Langevin, Lieu, and Lujan. The foundation for good policy is accurate and objective analysis, and, for more than two decades, the OTA set that foundation by providing relevant, unbiased technical and scientific assessments for Members of Congress and staff. 
But in 1995, the OTA was defunded, stripping Congress of a valuable resource to understand both emerging technologies as well as the nuances of the legislative process. In its absence, the need for OTA has only grown. Many of the issues OTA studied 20 years ago are even more pressing today. Antibiotic resistant bacteria, electronic surveillance in the digital age, and testing in America’s schools, these are the complex challenges our Nation will continue to face, and Congress should have access to the thorough and insightful analysis OTA can provide. Investing in the OTA now will actually save us money in the future. In the last year it operated, the OTA’s budget was $23 million, but its studies on the synthetic fuels corporation saved taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. Our amendment restores a modest $2.5 million to the OTA account for salaries and expenses to begin rebuilding the office. The cost is offset by a reduction to the Architect of the Capitol’s construction and operations account. This administrative account will not take resources from specific construction projects. Mr. Chair, a great surgeon does not operate without modern tools, a master chef does not cook without fresh ingredients, and Members of Congress should not make policy decisions without relevant and unbiased information. And with that in mind, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, to restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. PERRY ). The gentleman from Kansas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my good friend and colleague and cochair of the Deaf Caucus, Mr. TAKANO from California, for bringing this amendment, and unfortunately, I cannot support it, Mr. Chairman, and we would ask that the body reject it. You know, Congress terminated funding for the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995, so some 22 years ago, but it is back from the dead to be here on the floor today to be reestablished. At one point, funding totaled over $20 million for the Office of Technology Assessment, but Congress did one of the things it has attempted to do in many areas, which is try to consolidate government, make government more efficient, make it do more with less, and so they transferred the functions from the Office of Technology Assessment over to the GAO. We have heard debate on this floor within the last hour about the value of the GAO and the great work they do and how the GAO is a trustworthy organization and how it is important that we continue to fund them, yet, in this instance, they want to take these responsibilities away from the GAO. In fact, in fiscal year 2008, a permanent technology assessment function within the GAO was established by a recommendation from the Senate Committee on Appropriations. They allocate at least $2.5 million per year to technology assessment, and they have established the capability to produce technology assessments in many areas. They have hired scientists, engineers, and other technical specialists to respond to congressional requests. They produce three to four technology assessment reports each year. The GAO uses its technical staff to support other reports for Congress that have technology implications, such as privacy and vulnerability of computer components in cars. The GAO receives three to four requests per year specifically for technology assessments, and many others have a technology as an aspect. They have been able to testify on these topics recently on the Zika virus and on transfer of technologies developed with Federal research funds to the marketplace. They provide thorough and balanced analysis of critical technological innovations that affect our society, the environment, and the economy. And so creating another Federal agency that is going to require additional resources and to have it offset from investment in capital projects, to me, is the wrong direction. I think, in current law, we have more than enough resources heading in this direction. Taxpayers are counting on us to find ways to spend less money, to keep programs efficient, and so the idea that we create a new agency that has been gone for 20 years today and fund it for millions of dollars, to me, is inconsistent with the values we all, I think, espouse about making government more efficient, more effective. Mr. Chairman, with that, I would oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ), a member of the Science Committee and also a physicist. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from California (Mr. TAKANO ) and my colleagues, Representatives ESTY, LANGEVIN , LIEU, and L UJAN for cosponsoring this amendment. Our amendment would provide $2.5 million to revive the Office of Technology Assessment to provide Congress with unbiased, timely, and nonpartisan reports on a wide range of issues in science and technology. This office is no less necessary today than when it was first started in 1972, or when it was defunded in 1995. As technology continues to advance at an increasingly rapid pace and our partisan divide seems to grow deeper, Congress needs this now more than ever. The OTA did important work in a number of areas, but I would like to highlight just one of those areas in particular. One of the last recommendations the OTA made was that the U.S. should move rapidly to computerized health records and that standards should be put in place to ensure what we now call interoperability. Had we heeded this advice rather than defunding the OTA, we could have saved hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money and saved hundreds of thousands of American lives by ensuring accurate, uptodate patient data that was accessible regardless of where the patient turned up for care. This also could have helped slow or prevent the opioid epidemic by ensuring that patients would not be able to doctor shop to acquire numerous opioid prescriptions. While we cannot slow down the rapid pace of technology, we can give our country back an important and proven tool. So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to restore this vital source of credible, nonpartisan scientific expertise to the U.S. Congress. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I reiterate my support for the Office of Technology Assessment. Congress does not suffer from a lack of information, but it does suffer from a lack of trusted information to help make wise policy decisions. Today, we do need the Office of Technology Assessment more than ever. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MS . SHEA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division B (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. lll. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to mail any mass mailing (as defined in subparagraph (E) of section 3210(a)(6) of title 39, United States Code) which is larger than 4
1⁄4inches high x 6 inches long x 0.016 inches thick. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman 
from New Hampshire (Ms. S HEAPORTER) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple and straightforward. It would change the way our official taxpayerfunded mass mailings to constituents look by limiting the mailer to the size of a standard postcard. As Members of Congress, it is our job to set the standard for responsible stewardship of taxpayer funds, and public resources should not be spent on excessive campaignstyle mailers. b1815 A significant part of our duties as elected representatives is to keep our constituents informed about what we are doing in our offices. I support mass mailings to our constituents, but we can keep them informed by sending a simple postcard, without all of the glitz and gloss. Also, when official mail looks like campaign mailers, people are more likely to toss it out, thereby defeating the very purpose of informing our constituents. Our official mail should not look like campaign ads or junk mail. Our constituents don’t want large mailers. They just want information. This amendment delivers. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kansas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire’s amendment on postcard sizes, primarily because this issue has yet to go through any sort of process. We don’t have information on the floor to know how this would affect Member offices. It has not gone through the Franking Commission or come before our committee, so I don’t think it is ready for consideration and debate. Franked mailings of standard postcard size currently only account for roughly 10 percent of the total franked mailings that Members send. This amendment would prohibit Members from sending mass mailings on their own letterhead. They wouldn’t be able to send printed newsletters, fliers, letters, or regular or large postcards, among others. I think it would really have a dramatic impact on the ability of Members of Congress to communicate with their constituents. They wouldn’t be able to send them a letter or they wouldn’t be able to send them a newsletter. I certainly am about saving money and about making government more efficient, but this idea, I think, is not ready for prime time. I appreciate my colleague from New Hampshire bringing it forward, but I can’t support it at this point, and I would oppose it. Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, the Franking Commission, of which I am the chairman, is a bipartisan commission made up of an equal number of members from both parties that approve all the franking and mailing materials that go out. We were not contacted by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire about this amendment, and that is one reason I am opposed. There are a number of reasons why I am opposed to the amendment, the chief of which this amendment is going to negatively impact two very large constituencies—people in rural America that I serve, and many of us serve, and also areas where there is not ready access to electronic communications. Many Americans who don’t have access to electronic communications will be the most affected by the fact that Members of Congress cannot contact their constituents via mail. By limiting how Members can communicate with their constituents, Members may be more likely to make mistakes and violate the franking rules. We want to make sure that the franking rules work. Currently, postcards, communications that are 4
1⁄2by 6, the size mandated by this amendment, as Chairman YODER said, make up only 10 percent of all postal mail communications. This amendment would severely limit what many Members, both Republicans and Democrats, are able to do. By reducing the size of any mailer to a postcard, Members of Congress of both parties wouldn’t even be able to communicate via letterhead in a mass mailing, so this is an amendment that I oppose. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Chairman, while I certainly appreciate my colleagues’ opinions on this and I recognize that it is not a perfect solution, I don’t think that this is a surprise. We certainly have heard from our constituents, pretty much every election cycle, when they start talking about all the mass mailings they are receiving, with many pictures and lots of ideas about what has been accomplished by the incumbent in office. It has been around for a while. Like I said, I do appreciate it, but they are still able to mail directly to a response from their colleagues or from any of their constituents. The reality is that most people are not looking at just a postcard in this world. They do look online. I understand what you are talking about. I have rural areas as well. They look online. Also, they can receive a number of other correspondence from us. It does not in any way impact the correspondence when they write to us. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY  DAVIS). Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, again, I wish our colleague would have gone through the process. If she would come to the Franking Commission, we would be glad to take her ideas into consideration. But this amendment severely limits the ability of Members of Congress to reach out to their constituents. Members would not be able to send a mailer on official letterhead. Members who budgeted their funds wisely and printed postcards that they then send to their Members that might not fit this size would be a waste of taxpayer dollars because they would not be able to use those. Also, under this amendment, many endoftheyear communications that my colleague has sent from her office herself would not be eligible under this amendment right now. So let’s make sure that we have a discussion at the Franking Commission level. We would enjoy debating this issue with Members, Republicans and Democrats, who equally make up the Franking Commission. We would like to take your concerns into consideration, but give us a chance to do that. I urge my colleague to do that in the future. Mr. Chairman, again, I oppose this amendment. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. SHEAPORTER ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 9 OFFERED BY MR . RUSSELL  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division B (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. lll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Federal Register to the office of a Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress), unless a printed copy is requested by the Member (or Delegate or Resident Commissioner). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, which restructures the way the Federal Register is distributed to Members’ offices, will save approximately $1 million annually. 
The Federal Register contains a large amount of information, including proposed rules and public notices, regulations, executive orders, and Presidential documents. This information is compiled by the great folks at the National Archives, and published daily by the Government Printing Office, or the GPO. Since 1994, the GPO began publishing the Federal Register online. To improve the user experience, the digital version has been enhanced over time and is now fully searchable and downloadable, and is the preferred method that staff and Members use the Register, making for quick access to any document. Sadly, despite these advances in technology, Members of Congress still receive printed copies of the Federal Register every day. This results in thousands of copies going directly into the trash, costing taxpayers $1 million annually. Put another way, Mr. Chairman, this means that approximately 96 Americans have to work all year long and pay their taxes so that we can put these Federal Registers in the trash. This amendment simply prevents the distribution of printed copies to Members’ offices, unless the Member opts in to receiving a copy. Digital copies are already daily distributed. This amendment is in line with H.R. 195, a bill I introduced, which passed this House unanimously without any opposition, and was cosponsored by Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that we can now make it law. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RODNEY  DAVIS of Illinois). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kansas? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kansas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL) for continuing the tradition that he and others, particularly in Oklahoma, for some reason, have focused on cutting out government waste, finding sometimes small things, sometimes big things, and all things in between that we can reduce, cut, or eliminate that saves taxpayers’ money. Mr. Chair, $1 million is big money in States like Kansas and Oklahoma and across the country. It is real dollars to the people who get up and pay their taxes to this country. There are too many milliondollar expenditures that happen in this government that are overlooked and unnecessary because they are not maybe big enough for folks here to take time to pay attention to. What Mr. RUSSELL is doing today is standing up for fiscal responsibility, for efficiency of government, and for helping the environment. This is wasted printed paper that is unnecessary. I think it is a good government measure that will help modernize and make our government more efficient and effective. It is consistent with what this House has already done when it passed H.R. 195 earlier, which bars the distribution of the Federal Register to congressional offices and Federal agencies. That is in the Senate being marked up, maybe even today. This is a smart amendment. It is the kind of thing that we need to keep doing more of to save money for taxpayers. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. RUSSELL  for his work, and I ask my colleagues to support the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague from Kansas for his kind remarks. I also appreciate the colleagues from the other side of the aisle who have shown continued support for this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 115–259. 
AMENDMENT NO . 11 OFFERED BY MR . BERGMAN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 219, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(decreased by $30,000,000)’’. Page 226, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $30,000,000)’’. Page 226, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $30,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Chairman, advances in technology have given us the opportunity to increase access and streamline processes for veterans not only in the First District and across Michigan, but across the country. That said, we must ensure that technology is an asset and not an added burden to veterans, as it has been within the VA. The Department of Veterans Affairs IT landscape has been the primary topic of hearings within the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, due to its everexpanding modernization timeline for outdated systems and lack of interoperability within and outside the Department. The solution is undisputed. The VA must modernize its IT systems or continue to face uphill struggles in timely claims and appeals processing, community care, scheduling, and financial management. Earlier this week, the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee received an update from Secretary Shulkin that shows a continued lack of planning and implementation of its data center optimization program, an issue which was initially pointed out by the GAO during a hearing back in February. With all this in mind, I was understandably troubled when I saw the underlying bill provided $52 million less for IT development and modernization than last year’s appropriation. I understand that cuts need to be made, and that this bill aims to address other issues plaguing the VA, but it is imperative I make this point to the chairman and the ranking member. Our veterans deserve immediate access to care and timely adjudication of their disability claims from an efficient, effective Department of Veterans Affairs. This simply cannot happen until the VA addresses the woeful state of its IT systems. I ask that the chairman, the ranking member, and the rest of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee work with me to address this issue going forward. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. b1830 Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ), I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN ). Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chair, I have a question for the chairman of the MILCON Committee about the language in his committee report regarding colorectal cancer screening in the VA. Mr. Chairman, in his report, Mr. DENT encourages the VA to increase colorectal cancer screening in the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the other body, they have language that directs the VA to offer each one of the seven approaches for screening that are currently approved by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and are more closely aligned with other Federal health programs. Can I assume that the intention is the same and the efforts are aimed at urging the VA to offer all of the approved methods of screening? Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Wisconsin is correct. It is our intention to urge the VA to offer all of the approved methods of screening. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for that clarification. 
Mr. DENT. I yield back the balance of my time. 
AMENDMENTS EN BLOC NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR .

LEE OF TEXAS  At the end of division C (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. ll. The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are revised by reducing the amount made available for ‘‘Department of Veterans Affairs—Departmental Administration—Information Technology Services’’ (and the amount specified under such heading for operations and maintenance), and by increasing the amount made available in fiscal year 2018 for ‘‘Veterans Health Administration—Medical Services’’, by $2,500,000 and $2,000,000, respectively.

AMENDMENT NO . 26 OFFERED BY MR . CONNOLLY  
OF VIRGINIA  At the end of division C (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to charge a veteran a fee for a veterans identification card pursuant to section 5706(c) of title 38, United States Code, if the veteran uses form DD–214 to apply for the identification card and indicates on the form that the veteran is ‘‘homeless’’. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. DENT) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, these amendments have been made in order by the rule allowing consideration of H.R. 3219, and their inclusion in the en bloc has been agreed to by both sides. I support the adoption of the en bloc package, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment and support the en bloc amendments. I appreciate the chairman’s inclusion of amendments from Democratic Members. The amendments included range from therapy grants to combating opioid abuse. These amendments will deliver better care to our veterans. The minority has no objection to this amendment, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the en bloc amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers on the amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ). Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, my amendment would direct the Vet Centers to use $2.5 million of the additional funding allocated in the underlying bill to provide outdoor experiences for veterans as part of their continuum of care. This program would support veterans in developing a community of support to treat combatrelated injuries, especially those related to their behavioral health. The Vet Centers are uniquely positioned for the collaboration and development of alternative and supplemental approaches. We know that traditional mental health services are underutilized by veterans, but a 2014 University of Texas study found that, after just a oneweeklong Outward Bound veterans wilderness expedition, those veterans who participated showed clinically significant improvements in mental health variables like sense of social connection and attitudes towards seeking psychological help. They also showed important decreases in depression and anxiety. The Senate Appropriations Committee has already included the same language in their version of the MILCONVeterans Administration Appropriations bill. Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. I am very grateful to the chairman of the subcommittee for including this in the en bloc amendments because it will enable Vet Centers to explore alternative avenues for engaging veterans in a supportive environment to help with both mental health and readjustment to civilian life. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ). Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ) for yielding and to my colleagues for including this amendment en bloc. Mr. Chair, this amendment addresses the ongoing and, unfortunately, growing opioid epidemic in our communities. There are 60,000 overdose deaths each year. I am vice chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic. We are looking for ways to address this issue. It is a complex issue, and we want to take a variety of actions to help those suffering from the disease of addiction. Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, are at increased risk of abusing opioids according to the AMA, the American Medical Association. Many brave men and women who serve come back with what is described as invisible wounds. We know they are not invisible. We see it every day. I have spoken to those veterans who live in my community who suffer from PTSD and, unfortunately, from the disease of addiction. My amendment would set aside $5 million for the National Center for PTSD to study the connection between addiction and PTSD. Our veterans are suffering, and this investment will help them. Let’s get to the bottom of the connection between PTSD and opioid abuse. It is a simple but necessary way to address the epidemic. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ), who has been a passionate advocate to improve services to his rural communities. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member and the chairman for accepting my amendment. Mr. Chairman, veterans have made an incredible sacrifice for our country, and they deserve the highest quality treatment and care when they return to their civilian lives. The Department of Veterans Affairs has the obligation to provide critical services to veterans and ensure that America’s veterans have access to highquality and affordable healthcare in their communities. Recently, the VA decided not to renew its contract with the Ely Community Clinic in my district, and it is forcing veterans in Ely and the surrounding communities to rely solely on the Choice Program to access care. We owe it to our veterans not to use the Choice Program as a crutch, but to make the proper investment in the healthcare of our veterans and the healthcare that they deserve. Veterans 
have already fought for their country. They shouldn’t have to fight to keep their VA clinic in Ely. The intention behind my amendment is to remind the VA that they have the responsibility to continue operating the healthcare clinic in Ely, Nevada, and to emphasize the importance of continuing to provide care in rural communities across the country. The Choice Program was not intended to allow the VA to shirk its responsibility for certain veterans; instead, it was supposed to help veterans who have nowhere else to turn. I was sent to Congress by the people of the Fourth Congressional District to fight for Nevada’s veterans, and I will continue fighting to ensure that veterans in rural Nevada and communities across the country do not lose access to the VA and make sure that they receive the healthcare that they have earned and deserve. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to briefly explain Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22. Before I begin, let me express my appreciation and thanks to my good friends, Chairman DENT and Ranking Member W ASSERMAN  SCHULTZ for their hard and constructive work in shepherding this important legislation to the floor. Chairman DENTand I worked together constructively for many years on the Homeland Security Committee and he has always distinguished himself as one of the most bipartisan members of the House. And Ranking Member WASSERMAN SCHULTZ  has for years been one of the ablest Members of this body; I thank them both for their commitment to the important work of ensuring that our veterans receive the care and support they have earned from a grateful nation. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22 makes a modest but important improvement to the bill by increasing the amount of funding for the ‘‘Supportive Services for Veterans’ Families’’ account by $2 million, offset by a reduction of $2.5 million to the $4 billion allocated to the VA’s ‘‘Information Technology Systems’’ account. Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male and female) who are homeless on any given night. And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. The VA’s ‘‘Supportive Services for Veterans’ Families’’ Program helps veterans; and their families, who may have fallen on hard times or hit a rough patch in life and need a little help from the country they selflessly risked their life to defend. Homeless veterans or veterans facing homelessness who have minor age children are in need of special programs that allow for housing that welcomes children. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22 will enable this vital program to serve more veterans’ families in need of help by providing a bit more funding for grants to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives that provide supportive services to very lowincome veteran families living in or transitioning to permanent housing. The SSVF Program ensures that eligible veteran families receive the outreach, case management, and assistance in obtaining VA and other benefits. These services may include health care, daily living, legal services, fiduciary and payee services, personal financial planning, child care, transportation, housing counseling. The SSVF Program enables VA staff and local homeless service providers to work together to effectively address the unique challenges that make it difficult for some veterans and their families to remain stably housed. Many homeless veterans, including in my own state of Texas, lack housing because they lost their job or could no longer afford rent; many suffer from an untreated mental illness that keeps them from working. Every day the SSVF program makes a real difference in the lives of real people. Veterans like the Air Force veteran who, hoping to utilize the skills he learned in the service, instead bounced from job to job after being discharged and found himself sleeping at night on the cold cement under a bridge in Chicago. Through the Thresholds Veterans Project, funded through the SSVF, this hero received steady community service support and eventually was placed in his own studio apartment. He now says, in his own words: ‘‘I have a home. I enjoy bein’ inside.’’ Veterans like the one in Texas who because he lost his job at a manufacturing plant and was unable to pay the bills, was forced to seek shelter for himself and his family at a homeless shelter. Fortunately, the homeless shelter was a SSVF grantee and was able to assist the veteran obtain employment and his family in securing affordable lowcost housing. There are thousands of similar success stories made possible by the SSVF Program that I could share but all of them share a common theme: they involve veterans who served their country proudly, fell down on their luck, picked themselves back up, and found affordable and sustainable housing for their families because of the assistance and support made possible by the SSVF program. Ensuring that veterans have a place of their own to call home is the very least we can do. I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment and commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness in America. I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22. 
‘‘HEROISM KNOWS NO GENDER ’’ Liz (Names and some identifying information have been changed to protect confidentiality) is an Army Veteran and a single mom. After losing her job, she struggled to pay the rent and provide for her daughter. Liz’s landlord said she had always been an excellent tenant but his patience was wearing thin as her rent arrears continued to increase. Disheartened with a fruitless job search and unsure of where else to turn, Liz came to the Veterans Outreach Center (VOC). She was immediately connected with a Case Manager, an Employment Specialist, an Accredited State Veterans Benefits Counselor, and the SSVF team. In order to avoid the immediate crisis of homelessness, the Services To Enable Positive Solutions (S.T.E.P.S) program at the VOC paid Liz’s rent arrears, which had escalated to an amount that was insurmountable. Within a few short days of connecting with the team at VOC, Liz had a job interview that resulted in fulltime, meaningful employment. In less than a week, she had a benefits review with an onsite counselor from the New York State Division of Veterans Affairs during which she applied for an increase in disability compensation. The payment of Liz’s back rent allowed her and her daughter to keep a roof over their head. With a roof over their heads and their living situation stabilized, Liz was able to focus on her employment and securing her benefits, which are both components of an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that will help Liz sustain permanent housing in the future. The VOC was able to stabilize Liz and her daughter while concurrently providing the supportive services necessary for her to maintain permanent housing. The temporary financial assistance was delivered to the landlord in a timely, efficient manner with the help of a S.T.E.P.S collaborative partner. Through coordinated case management, the aforementioned supportive services were provided quickly and effectively. The longterm result of this effort is yet to be determined, but at the 90day benchmark, Liz has retained both her job and her home. She has realized this goal independently, without requesting any additional financial assistance. Consequently, the VOC was able to better the lives of a mom (a Veteran) and her child immeasurably through SSVF funding. ‘‘YOUR UNSELFISH HELPING HAND GAVE US  
HOPE ’’ Mariano Salas and his family were the first clients to participate in Community Psychiatric Clinic’s (CPC) SSVF program. Both Mariano and his wife had lost their jobs and they and their young daughter were facing homelessness. The SSVF program secured their housing and helped stabilize their lives. Here is Mariano’s story in his own words: ‘‘I was on the brink of giving up completely. But truthfully one thing I can say, no words express enough our sincerest gratitude to you in assisting my family and I during a very difficult hardship. Desperation, fear and depression were daily emotions upon my family. But with your unselfish helping hand, you gave us hope, peace, and great big smiles on our faces. Your untiring assistance has given us tremendous hope for a better future. SSVF gave us a boost as we are working so hard to get decent paying jobs to support our family and put food on our table. Today, instead of focusing all our energies on fear of being homeless, we are focusing our energy on securing a stable job and to become selfsufficient. My wife is working now and I have interviews lined up so we can support ourselves and manage our daily living expenses. I am privileged and honored to have been served by SSVF. Thank you SSVF and GOD BLESS YOU ALL.’’ With deepest gratitude, Mariano Salas 
Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain describe Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25, which simply provides that: ‘‘None of the funds made available by this Act for the Department of Veteran Affairs— Benefits for Homeless Veterans and Training and Outreach Programs may be used in contravention of the title 38, Part II, Chapter 20, Subchapter II and III of the U.S. Code. This amendment will help ensure that the rate of homelessness among veterans in the United States does not increase. I thank Subcommittee Chairman DENT and Ranking Member WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for their hard work in shepherding this important legislation to the floor. I offer Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25 because I believe reducing and eliminating 
homelessness among veterans, those who risked their lives to protect our freedom, should also be one of the nation’s highest priorities. Homelessness among the American veteran population is on the rise in the United States and we must be proactive in giving back to those who have given so much to us. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25 will help remind us of our obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes adequately funding for programs Veterans Administration Supportive Housing (VASH) that provide case management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and address other areas that contribute to veteran homelessness. VASH is a jointlyadministered permanent supportive housing program for disabled Veterans experiencing homelessness in which VA medical Centers provide referrals and case management while Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) administer the Section 8 housing vouchers. Mr. Chair, our veterans deserve the best services available, and I believe that we could be doing much more for them. Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male and female) who are homeless on any given night. And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal living conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard housing. While significant progress has been made, ending homelessness among veterans remains a big challenge. In my hometown of Houston for example, between the years 2010 and 2012, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162. We must remain vigilant and continue to fight for those who put on the uniform and fought for us. Providing a home for veterans to come home to every night is the very least we can do. Mr. Chair, programs like VASH have succeeded in changing lives. In 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in the public housing provided by VASH. I have seen the impact of such grants in my home state of Texas, and within my congressional district in Houston, and I am sure that this funding has positively impacted many communities across this country. In Texas, there are committed groups in Houston, working to eradicate the issue of homelessness. For example, the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center has been involved in changing veterans’ lives in a mighty way by providing Veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and medical services that will help them get back on their feet. Mr. Chair, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue. I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25 and commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness in America. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. DENT). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . AL GREEN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 220, line 22, after the dollar amount insert the following: ‘‘(increased by $70,000,000)’’. Page 225, line 6, after the dollar amount insert the following: ‘‘(reduced by $70,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I will be withdrawing my amendment, but I do desire to make some points. I am grateful to the chairperson of the committee and the ranking member as well. I know them to be admirable persons who desire to do the very best for our veterans. I would like to state, Mr. Chairman, that we have many people who are on the front line of democracy. These are the people who go to distant places, and a good many of them don’t always return the same way they left, and, Mr. Chairman, as a result of this, they need special attention. They need medical attention. We have a circumstance in our country that breaks the hearts of a good many Americans each and every day when they see persons standing on the streets with signs indicating that they are veterans and that they need help. Mr. Chairman, what we propose to do with this amendment is to provide that additional help that they need. This amendment would accord an additional $70 million to medical services for homeless veterans, the veterans that we see living in the streets of life, the veterans who are appealing to us for help. A good many of them need help that goes beyond something that is physically wrong with them. A good many of them may need some help because of some mental illness that they may have. Mr. Chairman, in Texas, we have, on any given night, about 1,768 veterans who are living on the streets. According to the VA, about 40,000 veterans were homeless on a single night in January of 2016. This is a decrease from where we have been. The decline is admirable and we ought not overlook the decline, but my belief is we can still do better and we can still help those who are in need of some services. So this amendment would accord the $70 million and bring us back to our 2017 levels. Mr. Chair, I would ask that the chairperson and the ranking member please understand that my desire is to be of service to our veterans. Mr. Chairman, if I may engage in a colloquy at this time. You have heard my appeal. My hope is that Congressman DENTand I might be able to work together to do what we can to enhance the services that are needed to provide medical attention for homeless veterans. I am sure that Congressman DENThas seen the evidence of it, and the empirical evidence is available for us to review if we would like to, but I would like as much assistance as we can get. Mr. DENT. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his genuine concern and thoughtfulness with respect to veterans’ homelessness. It is indeed a very severe problem. I do look forward to working with him on this issue, but I also want to mention that I think our bill does respond quite admirably in many ways to the homelessness challenge. We support more than $7.3 billion in medical care, housing, social service, and job training assistance for homeless veterans, and that is about $197 million more this year than in fiscal year 2017 and almost $450 million more than 2 years ago. But Congressman GREEN is correct that we can always do more and that this challenge continues to plague us. We have made great progress in this country, but I pledge to work with Mr. GREEN on this issue. Mr. AL GREEN. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman DENT. And if I may just say to the ranking member on our side, I greatly appreciate Congresswoman WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ having helped us to bring this to the floor to this extent, and I look forward to working with her as well. Mr. Chair, the need to help people who are willing to give it all for us is something that we can never overlook, and I am grateful. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Ranking Member LOWEY , I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, President Trump, the ‘‘Commander in Tweet,’’ tweeted this morning announcing a ban on transgender military service, which was a completely baseless and hateful assault on transgender Americans. Make no mistake: this was not just a midnight tweet. This was a statement of this administration’s discriminatory policies and a step backwards for our Nation. 
While the President tweeted that his decision came after consulting, supposedly, with our Nation’s top generals, that was apparently news to them, as it was met with utter surprise and silence from Pentagon leaders. b1845 Additionally, the President may want to speak to his VA Secretary, as the VA has unequivocally stated VA’s policy has not changed. The VA provides care, benefits, and other VA services to all veterans, including transgender veterans. The President’s policy reversal comes after our military has undertaken a measured and thoughtful process to make our military open to LGBT Americans to serve their Nation with pride and patriotism. This thoughtful process included the successful repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, which had the support of civilian and military defense leaders and an overwhelming number of Americans. Unlike the President’s tweets, the decision to make our military more open was not made rashly or with the intention to discriminate. With over 6,000 transgender Americans serving on Active Duty, in the National Guard, and in our Reserve forces, it would be reckless, dangerous, and cruel to remove brave servicemembers from their critical roles protecting the American people. It is reckless and dangerous to immediately leave vacant positions that are so vital to our national security. It would be cruel to perniciously discharge these servicemembers less than honorably, an act that could gravely impact whether they are eligible for VA benefits. Time and again, we see the dramatic and unintended consequences of this President’s thoughtless actions. As we fight for an open military, we will also fight to provide the proper care and resources to the over 130,000 transgender veterans that fought to defend this Nation. Additionally, whatever my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may say, this decision was not based on a financial costbenefit analysis. Allowing transgender people to serve in the military would raise defense health spending by less than 0.1 percent annually, including funds for gender reassignment surgeries. That is just $2.4 million to $8.4 million. In comparison, just so we are illustrative, the Pentagon spends $84.24 million annually on erectile dysfunction prescriptions. Of that, $41.6 million was specifically spent on Viagra. Moreover, research has shown that greater inclusion has little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness. In fact, commanders have noted that these policies benefited all servicemembers by creating a more inclusive and diverse force. Mr. Chairman, several things are clear: This was not a decision based on fiscal responsibility. This was not a decision based on military readiness. This decision was apparently made to save the President’s immoral, irresponsible border wall, because some Republican Members threatened to bring down the entire minibus appropriations bill that we are debating here today over transgender medical treatment in the military. This decision, at the end of the day, was based purely on bigotry and hate, and it is one that we will vehemently oppose. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
AMENDMENT NO . 20 OFFERED BY MR . RATCLIFFE  
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. L AHOOD). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 20 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division C (before the short title) insert the following: SEC. ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to propose, plan for, or execute a new or additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman DENTand the ranking member for their hard work on behalf of the 63,000 veterans in my district, as well as servicemembers and veterans from all across the country. I am also grateful for the support of Congressman SHUSTER in offering this amendment, an amendment which would simply prohibit any funds made available in this division from being used to propose, plan for, or execute a new or additional round of base realignment and closure, or BRAC. Mr. Chairman, I am honored to represent the Fourth Congressional District of Texas, which is home to the Red River Army Depot. The Depot has supported the warfighter since 1941. Although the Depot community has weathered a lot of changes over the years, their commitment to mission has always remained the same. On the placards inside each vehicle there are the words: ‘‘We build it as if our lives depend on it. Theirs do.’’ The Red River Army Depot is a vital job creator for northeast Texas and my district, and it is a critical component to our national defense. And as we continue our constitutional obligation to appropriate money, we have to be careful stewards of taxpayer dollars, and focus our limited resources on addressing the critical national security objectives and military readiness. Having another round of BRAC, Mr. Chairman, won’t help us achieve this goal. According to the Government Accountability Office, the last round of BRAC in 2005 actually cost the American taxpayers $35.1 billion, which is 67 percent more than the original cost estimate. At the same time, the expected savings from the last round of BRAC have been reduced by 73 percent. Starting another BRAC would weaken our capabilities, and it would increase our vulnerability in the face of critical threats that face this Nation right now. I thank my colleagues who have supported this important amendment for the past 2 years, and I look forward to having this amendment included in this year’s Military Construction and VA Appropriations bill. Mr. DENT. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. RATCLIFFE. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. DENT. I just want to say for the RECORD that I appreciate the gentleman’s concern for his district. I am not going to oppose the amendment, but I did want to say that, at some point, there will need to be a BRAC. There is a lot of excess capacity in the Army and the Air Force. But for fiscal year ‘18, I can accept this amendment, but down the road I see the need. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for accepting the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I, like many Members, have concerns regarding another round of BRAC. I realize that this is a complicated issue for all Members of Congress, especially those with military facilities in their congressional districts. I have had this conversation with my chairman, Mr. DENT, several times. And while we both share the concerns of those Members with military bases in their district and other military facilities, the gentleman is right. We are going to need to address that we have facilities all across the country that really need to be evaluated because they are, essentially, maintaining infrastructure that is no longer needed. For example, the estimate of excess capacity for the Army is 22 percent. The Air Force’s estimate of excess capacity is roughly 30 percent. Both the Army and the Air Force are strong supporters of another BRAC round. While this amendment really has no effect because we don’t actually have any funding in this bill for another BRAC round, it does send the message that Congress is unwilling to tackle what is arguably a tough issue. This amendment would be, essentially, an abdication of our duties as Members of this House to ensure that taxpayer resources are being used in a wise and fiscally responsible way, and 
that is something that we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle regularly. And given that we have a very significant increase in the defense appropriations bill, when we have resources that we are expending or, essentially, wasting by not having a BRAC round, then we are, essentially, leaving that money on the table when we could provide it for our national defense. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. And I recognize that the chairman is willing to accept it, but we should underscore that there are no funds in this bill for a round of BRAC, so, essentially, the acceptance of this amendment adopts the same posture that this bill already holds. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 21 OFFERED BY MR . BRAT  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 21 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division C (before the short title) insert the following: SEC. ll. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be used by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to purchase, breed, transport, house, feed, maintain, dispose of, or experiment on dogs as part of the conduct of any study assigned to pain category D or E, as defined by the Department of Agriculture. (b) This section shall not apply to training programs or studies of service dogs described in section 1714 of title 38 United States Code or section 17.148 of title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BRAT) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to the bill, H.R. 3219. I would like to thank DINATITUS, TEDPOE, ROKHANNA , BRIAN MAST, and TEDLIEUfor cosponsoring this amendment. In short, my amendment will stop funding for painful dog experiments at the VA. It also includes protections to ensure service dog training programs can continue unencumbered so that veterans affected by conditions from blindness to PTSD can receive the help they need. My amendment combines three bipartisan issues: puppies, veterans, and government accountability. Earlier this year, when my wife Laura and I read the news report about the VA’s dog testing program at the Richmond VA Medical Center, we were disturbed by the descriptions of the types of experiments conducted on these puppies. From what I read, the type of work they were doing was on the level of torture. In Richmond, this included inducing heart attacks. At other labs, the VA was giving methamphetamine to narcoleptic Dobermans. My family had a Doberman, and he was part of our family years back. I can’t imagine conducting these tests on man’s best friend. I believe our veterans deserve to receive the highest quality of healthcare. The Richmond VA Hospital is staffed by talented healthcare professionals. However, the experiments being conducted at the Richmond dog research lab have questionable medical benefit. The resources, money, time, and space being used to conduct these experiments would be better utilized to deliver highquality healthcare to Richmond veterans. The VA’s first priority should be caring for our veterans. A recent report by the VA Office of Research Oversight that was made public by a FOIA request found widespread lapses in adhering to protocol, failure to follow Federal animal welfare regulations, and the lack of sufficient documentation to justify the severity of these disturbing experiments. Federal taxpayer dollars are better spent directly caring for our Nation’s veterans. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to defund these harmful experiments on man’s best friend. Mr. POE of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BRAT. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for filing this amendment. Mr. Chairman, the VA has been using taxpayer dollars to have experiments on dogs. It is hard to believe that would occur in our culture today. I have had three Dalmatians over the years, and I know there are a lot of other people who have dogs. They have service dogs that are used by our vets and our agencies. And the thought that our Veterans Administration would go ahead and torture dogs in the name of science and experiments is not acceptable; it is just not. If citizens committed these acts that the VA is committing on dogs, under most laws, that would be animal cruelty. They could be prosecuted and go to jail. But because it is the VA, because it is a government agency, that doesn’t apply. But we do want the agency to stop torturing dogs in the name of science. There are better ways that they can spend the money, better ways they can figure out how to help our veterans besides taking careless actions against, as my friend from Virginia said, man’s best friend. And if it’s going to be man’s best friend, maybe we shouldn’t be, or we should not be torturing those dogs for any reason. So I support the amendment. Ms. TITUS. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BRAT. I yield to the gentlewoman from Nevada. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Chairman, I, too, rise in support of this bipartisan amendment. I thank my colleagues, Mr. BRAT, Mr. P OE, and Mr. K HANNA , for introducing it. We want to prohibit funds from being used by the Department of the VA on studies that cause significant pain and distress to dogs. As a former member of the House Veterans Affairs’ Committee and a longtime advocate of animal protection, I firmly believe we should not be using taxpayer dollars to fund painful and unnecessary experimental procedures when we have technological advances that can move us toward alternative methods. b1900 We have seen the NIH in their chimpanzee research, and they said that available technologies are more accurate, faster, and less expensive than animal testing. The U.S. military is moving away from using live animals in trauma medical testing. We have seen that when the Coast Guard gave up their live tissue training program. The Los Angeles VA just recently announced it is suspending controversial and gruesome experiments on a colony of narcoleptic Dobermans. It is now time for the rest of the VA to do the same thing. This amendment is supported by the Humane Society, the Animal Welfare Institute, and the White Coat Waste Project. It is estimated that 44 percent of all households—and you heard my colleagues mention this—in the United States have a dog. In our culture, they are considered cherished pets, and they are a member of the family. They are not to be used for experiments. Even veterans themselves depend on dogs on the battlefield and at home for therapy. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and that is just the way it is. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, but I do not plan to oppose it. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. GALLAGHER ). Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), the ranking member. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, the VA conducts animal research at 74 of its facilities, and only 3 of these—Cleveland, Milwaukee, and Richmond—are still conducting experiments on dogs that involve inflicting significant pain and distress. Just 
yesterday, another whistleblower went public with graphic photos of mutilated dogs and other troubling information about dog testing at that facility. In addition, a recent VA Office of Research Oversight investigation found that the VA failed to keep adequate records about sick and suffering dogs and has consistently underreported the number of dogs used in experiments to Federal authorities. I want to be clear that this amendment, unfortunately, does not stop all animal research at the VA, and it doesn’t even stop all dog research at the VA—again, unfortunately. Far from it, in fact. This amendment rightly and simply prohibits taxpayers’ dollars from being spent on research that causes dogs significant pain and distress. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment on behalf of Bailey, Demmy, Coqui, Minnie, and Maddie Schultz. Mr. DENT. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BRAT). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 23 OFFERED BY MR . KING OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 23 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made in order by the rule. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division C (before the short title), insert the following SEC. ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the prevailing wage requirements in subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code (commonly referred to as the DavisBacon Act). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, this is a DavisBacon amendment that addresses the MILCON component of the legislation that is before us. This Congress has had this debate a number of times over the past years. The history of the DavisBacon Act goes back to, I will say, a couple of Republicans that got together and decided they didn’t want the construction market to have to face the competition of African Americans coming out of Alabama to build a Federal building in New York City. They took such great offense to that that they wrote legislation that is known as the DavisBacon Act, and the language says it requires a prevailing wage. I have spent 42 years in the construction business, if I count the work my son does as he owns that company today, and we have dealt with that, I would say, nearly every year, if not every year, throughout all that time. What we have is the Federal Government interfering in the relationship between the employer and the employee and setting a wage scale that is called prevailing wage. But that is set by folks sitting inside a room with a closed door, and they come out of there with the equivalent of a union wage mandated by the Federal Government. That is the net effect. As we have kept records over the years, the increase in the cost of the projects for us has been between 8 and 35 percent, depending on how much is labor, how much is materials, and the nature of the job. The Heritage Foundation has done a study or two. They come with a number kind of in that area. So I just boil it down to 20 percent. It is a 20 percent increase over the otherwise cost of a project, and that means this: without the DavisBacon wage scale imposed upon it by the Federal Government, the merit shop employees who meet plans and specs and do highquality work—and there is nothing in our 42 years of history that would indicate otherwise—that we can build 5 miles of road instead of 4, we can build five barracks instead of four, we can build five bridges instead of four. This is an unnecessary cost to the taxpayer. It brings efficiency to the expenditures of the taxpayers’ money, and it does a lot better job of taking care of our military. Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of my amendment, which simply does this: it says that none of the funds may be used to implement, administer, or enforce prevailing wage requirements that is referenced as DavisBacon. Mr. Chairman, I urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, DavisBacon is a pretty simple concept, and a fair one at that. What the DavisBacon Act does is to protect the government as well as the workers in carrying out the policy that is very simple and very straightforward: paying decent wages on government contracts. The DavisBacon Act requires that workers on federally funded construction projects be paid no less than the wages paid in the community for similar work. It requires that every contract for construction of which the Federal Government is a party in excess of $2,000 contain a provision defining the minimum wages paid to various classes of laborers and mechanics. Mr. Chairman, the House has taken numerous and repeated votes on this issue, and on every vote, this body has voted to maintain DavisBacon requirements. In fact, most recently, during consideration of the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, in a bipartisan fashion, the House firmly rejected a similar amendment 242–183. Last year, we avoided including divisive language like this in this bill, and it is my hope that we stop attacking the working class and defeat the amendment before us today and move on to more important matters as we surely have in front of us. Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, as I listen to that rebuttal, I would like to bring back a little more of the history of this, and it is this: that Davis Bacon, and I have been looking at this a long time, as far as I know, and I believe it is true, is the last remaining Jim Crow law that exists in Federal statute today. We should take care to pull it out of the Federal code. Its legacy is badly tainted. It was built as a racist law, and that needs to be eliminated, and we need to have a merit shop society where people can compete rather than the Federal Government deciding with a board or a commission behind closed doors. Let’s build more roads, more bridges, more barracks, more airstrips. Let’s put our money to the best use we can. That is in keeping with Donald Trump’s philosophy: get more for less. That is what you get with the King amendment, more for less, and we get to eliminate at least the effectiveness of this Jim Crow law on our MILCON as a starter. If we do this here, we have got an opportunity, then, to go forward with this and finally one day completely repeal DavisBacon. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ), who has been a passionate advocate and fighter for working men and women of this country. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the Congresswoman for yielding me time. I rise in strong opposition to this misguided DavisBacon amendment. Why would anybody come to this floor and say: I want to lower the wages for the people I represent? Why would anybody want to do that? We are here to help people raise their local standards of living. That is what this amendment would do: it would lower the wages for the working conditions of those very men and women that we were elected to serve. It would hurt the local economy, devalue the workers’ pay. Almost 100 years ago, two Republicans, Congressman James Davis and Robert Bacon, realized there was a problem with the Federal Government and contracts. The contracts were unfair to those local economies. In 1931, 
unanimously approved, DavisBacon prevailing wage, it ensured construction workers coming in are paid the same as local labor—as local labor. It levels the playing field, ensures workers get paid a fair day’s pay for a hard day’s work—easy answers, very easy answers. For my colleagues supporting this amendment, I have a few questions of you. Do you want the Federal Government to make bad investments? Do you want to cut those wages for the very people who elected you? Do you want local workers to suffer, people coming into your town and your community, and cut the wages? I don’t think so. We are not here to lower the standards. We are here to raise the standards. Speaking of President Trump, guess who used and paid prevailing wage? You have got it. Donald Trump in Atlantic City. He paid prevailing wages. He didn’t have to. He did because he understood he wanted to help the people in that economy build a good product. This is what we are talking about: quality wages to people who go to work each and every day and play hard and work hard, follow the rules. That is what prevailing wage is, giving local communities a say in the Federal Government. The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair, not to others in the Chamber in the second person. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on each side. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Iowa has 1
1⁄2 minutes remaining. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, as I listen to the gentleman, unfair; there is no such thing as unfair when you have someone who applies for a job and they are willing to work for a wage, and we want to hire the best people we can hire. We want to keep the best people we hire, and we want to pay the best benefits we can. But when we have the Federal Government interfering with the efficiency of our operations and deciding that this machine pays $25 an hour and this machine pays $35 an hour, and on this shovel, if you are leaning on it, that pays 20 bucks an hour, who is going to climb into which machine and do what? The efficiencies of our operations go downhill when you have got the Federal Government setting those kinds of things. We had a project years ago where the center line of the highway—we worked on both sides of a highway. The center line of the highway was a difference between two different regions with different prevailing wage scales. It was almost twice as much money on the south side of the highway as it was on the north side of the highway. Well, where do you think my crews wanted to work? They wanted to work on the south side of the highway. You have got to fight that constantly. We don’t need the Federal Government interfering. There used to be a gentleman from Massachusetts that would say that we should not have the Federal Government interfering between any relationship between two consenting adults. That is what an employment is, two consenting adults. It is a contract. We don’t need the Federal Government there. We need to build more projects for less money for the same standard of work. It is not unfair. It is highquality work coming out of all the records of merit shop employees, and it is consistent with what America needs to do to compete with the rest of the world. Mr. Chairman, I urge that the body come forward and vote for this amendment and block the DavisBacon wage scales and end up with an efficient form of construction for MILCON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, it is unfortunate that the gentleman from Iowa repeatedly engages in revisionist history when it comes to walking the Chamber through the history of why we have Davis Bacon. It was actually in 1927 that a contractor who was employing African American workers was building a Veterans Bureau hospital—fitting that we are debating this on this bill in the district of Congressman Bacon. What Congressman Bacon found was that there were very serious issues related to low wages being paid, competitive pressure towards those lower wages, discrimination against the wages of migrant workers, and so he introduced Davis Bacon initially to be able to make sure that workers on construction projects would be able to be paid the prevailing wages in the community. These workers happened to be African American. That is about the only thing that is at all related to the so called Jim Crow reference that the gentleman from Iowa made. We need to make sure that, no matter where you work on a Federal Government project, construction workers, working people who are trying to make sure that they produce quality work, are able to produce that quality work by being paid the prevailing wage in a community based on those standards. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. b1915 The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be postponed. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 24 printed in House Report 115–259. AMENDMENT NO . 27 OFFERED BY MR . BERGMAN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 27 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 267, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $1,000,000)’’. Page 273, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(decreased by $1,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to the Make America Secure Appropriations Act bill. My amendment simply adds $1 million to the U.S. Corps of Engineers’ investigations account to assist with projects across the country that the Army Corps is in charge of overseeing. Projects like modernizing the Soo Locks, the lock system located in my district in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan which connects Lake Superior to the lower part of the Great Lakes through the St. Marys River. This is a project that has been around for a long time on the books. Projects like this that have more than 4,500 vessels and 80 million tons of cargo moving through the Soo Locks each year, this lock system plays a critical role in the transport of raw materials and other goods through the Great Lakes region to ports around the entire country. And currently, the construction of a new lock, which is integral not only to my district, but the entire United States, is caught in a mire of uncertainty, and it all comes down to one thing: funding. I think it is appropriate that we are considering this amendment in the context of making America secure because it might be a surprise to some to learn that modernizing the Soo Locks is a matter of national security. A recent Department of Homeland Security report has made clear that an unexpected interruption to the Poe— the largest lock in the system—would have disastrous economic impacts across the Nation, to include a $1.1 trillion fall in national gross domestic product and a spike in national unemployment to a rate of 11.3 percent. Again, this is the Department of Homeland Security saying this. And while Congress has authorized the construction of a new lock twice now over several years, the Soo has been tied up 
in economic reevaluations and studies that have ultimately kept Congress and the Corps from spending the necessary funds to complete the project. This amendment sends a message to the Army Corps and reminds Congress that projects like the Soo Locks modernization must be a priority. During a time when infrastructure projects and national security are at the forefront of our policy conversations, projects like the Soo Locks should not be delayed because of funding uncertainty or limits to the Army Corps of Engineers’ ability to do its due diligence in conducting the studies. I also wanted to take a minute and thank the chairman for working with me and understanding how significant and important the Soo Locks modernization and projects like this around the country are to our economy and our national security. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I rise in very reluctant opposition to this amendment. I agree with the goal. I agree with the fine Congressman’s goal of getting that lock modernized, improving the access, and securing the Great Lakes region for generations to come. My problem lies in the offset coming out of the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy accounts. So I would only ask the gentleman to consider advising his colleagues, who will go into conference, if we could find a different offset, it would sure be a lot more comfortable on this side of the aisle. I want to congratulate him for his amendment and, again, reluctantly rise in opposition. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Idaho. Mr. SIMPSON. Actually, the offset does not come out of EERE. Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio. Ms. KAPTUR. May I inquire of the gentleman, where does the offset come from? Mr. SIMPSON. It comes from Corps expenses and administration. Ms. KAPTUR. Well, that changes my position. Mr. SIMPSON. I knew we could get through this. Let me just say, Mr. Chairman, I understand that the Soo Locks project is of great importance to my colleague from Michigan, as well as other Members from the Great Lakes. I would be happy to work with them to see if we can advance this project to ensure continued navigation on the Great Lakes. I have to remind my colleague that the amendment increases the funding level of an account. It does not direct that funding level to a particular activity, and, for that reason, the amendment does not constitute a major shift in funding between accounts, and I will support the amendment. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 28 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO) for the purpose of entering into a colloquy. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman SIMPSON for yielding the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3219, the Defense, Military Construction, Veteran Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water Development National Security Appropriations Act. Specifically, I would like to discuss division D of the bill, which appropriates additional funding to the Army Corps of Engineers. This bill allocates $289.5 million to fund projects and activities to enhance the Nation’s economic growth. The Whaley Lake Dam, located in my district in Pawling, New York, Dutchess County, will be eligible to compete for these funds, and is authorized pursuant to section 5003 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. Originally built in the mid1800s, the Whaley Lake Dam is in critical need of repair. The outlet of the dam feeds a stream necessary to the movement of treated wastewater from multiple municipal water treatment facilities. Additionally, the town of Pawling is the home to nearly 9,000 residents, including 500 homes located on Whaley Lake specifically. Mr. Chairman, could the chairman please confirm that the Whaley Lake Dam project could compete for funding included in the bill? Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. FASOfor the question. The gentleman is correct on his reading of the bill. Projects authorized under section 5003 of the 2007 water bill are eligible for this additional funding by the Army Corps of Engineers. This is reflected in report language from the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman SIMPSON for this confirmation. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. AMENDMENTS EN BLOC NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR .

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473 the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON ) and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Idaho. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that the en bloc amendments have been agreed to by both sides, and I would urge my Members to support the en bloc amendments. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ). Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment which ensures that the Department of Energy continues to fund Energy Innovation Hubs in the Offices of Science, Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, and Nuclear Energy. b1930 The current report language accompanying H.R. 3266, which is the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, directs the DOE not to fund these centers. By passing this amendment, we will clearly express Congress’ intent to continue funding these innovation hubs and request that the final report language be edited to reflect our intent. The four existing innovation hubs conduct critical research across energy fields including nuclear, solar, advanced storage, and energy supply chains. These hubs are modeled off of the iconic Bell Laboratories, but private industry no longer sustains this type of research due to increasing pressure to make shortterm profits. That is why it is essential that the government conduct this research. Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support the en bloc and amend the final report language so these vital innovation hubs continue to receive funding. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, first, I thank Chairman SIMPSON for the committee’s continued support for the Rahway River flood control project in the district I serve. This project is essential to the safety and security of communities in the district. These communities have worked extensively with the district office of the Army Corps, which, together with their colleagues at Corps headquarters in Washington, prepared a Tentatively Selected Plan. We are waiting for Corps headquarters to schedule an agency milestone meeting to finalize the details and begin the process of compiling a chief’s report. Is it the committee’s intent in providing funding that the Corps should complete the Rahway River feasibility study? Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentleman for his question. Yes. It has been the committee’s intent that funds provided to date were to be used to complete the feasibility study and issue a chief’s report. There is additional funding provided in this bill that could be allocated to the Rahway River study, if necessary. Mr. LANCE. I would further ask your assistance to ensure that the extensive work, expertise, and planning at the district level and the extensive community involvement is also followed by the Army Corps headquarters. There is growing concern in the communities I serve that Army Corps headquarters might shelve this project despite its continued authorization—as recently as the 2016 WRDA bill—and the ongoing funding from your subcommittee. This would represent the worst kind of disconnect between the needs of communities in need and the bureaucracy of Washington. Doing nothing, wasting taxpayers’ time and money, and allowing the current hazards to endure are not an acceptable outcome. I would respectfully ask the full committee chairman and subcommittee chairman to assist in convening a meeting with the affected Members of Congress and the Corps to ensure we continue to move forward with this chosen alternative, and proceed with the project now. Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentleman for his comments. We would be pleased to work with the gentleman from New Jersey on such a meeting and to ensure a successful conclusion to the feasibility study. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that Amendment No. 31 will not be offered. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Ranking Member LOWEY , I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I want to express my appreciation to Congressman MIKESIMPSON and all the members of our subcommittee on both sides of the aisle for completing our work on time and for reaching agreement on many of these amendments that will save the Members angst tonight, and, hopefully, we won’t have to work beyond midnight. I want to say, with the mark that we have received, we continue to move America forward on energy independence. We know that by 8 or 9 years it is projected that America will finally be exporting more energy than we are importing, and we will be 100 percent energyefficient and energyindependent here at home. That is quite an accomplishment thinking back to the period of time in our Nation’s history in the last century when we, as a nation, were subjected to rising oil prices because of embargoes, particularly in the Middle East, and we fell into deep recession here in our country back in the 1970s; and subsequent to that, every time gasoline went over $4 a gallon. So when we consider the Energy and Water bill, I think we all have to pat America on the back for having had consistent enlightened leaders on both sides of the aisle who understood what was important in the Nation’s best interests. So as we consider this bill today— there were particular amendments on subjects that range as far afield as the Soo Locks and the Energy Information Administration, which we will get into in a moment, water projects that are some of the biggest job creators across this country—let’s not lose sight of the big frame. The big frame really is that this is a bill that makes America more secure and that allows us to make progress here at home from coast to coast. All of our ports and all of our water infrastructure that is so vital not just west of the Mississippi, but the Great Lakes region and our coasts, some of the challenges we face in the Everglades, these are issues that all of America cares about, particularly when it is in your own backyard. This is a really important bill for the country. It is not the largest bill that is considered as part of the appropriations process, but it is one that is extraordinarily important. And, of course, over half of our budget deals with our nuclear weapons complement and making sure that that great asset that we have is maintained, is the finest in the world, and is the best managed. So this subcommittee has quite a jurisdiction from coast to coast. I really want to compliment all the Members who worked so very hard to bring our bill to the floor on time, within the mark that we were given. I thank staffs on both sides of the aisle as we proceed forward here. I know that the efforts in this bill to fund the future and new energy sources that are coming forward are in America’s national interests. 
We look at the field of solar, for example. We have over 300,000 people working in the solar energy field, actually more than work in the coal fields now. Some of those solar companies are in districts that I represent. This is a new industry. Renewables now comprise 10 percent of all the energy that the country produces, and this has been a major accomplishment in just the last few decades. A lot of photovoltaic research goes back to the 1980s. We are now looking at wind energy, the fastest growing job sector in America. It is really for wind technicians. I thank the members of our committee on both sides of the aisle for appreciating the opportunity to grow this massive industry, including with investments such as LEEDCo in the State of Ohio; capturing the Saudi Arabia of wind, which is Lake Erie’s complement. So we feel a sense of accomplishment tonight as we bring this bill to the floor and we look at the horizons ahead. We know that we have to deal with the other body, we have to compromise out any of our differences, but I have a hunch that we are going to be able to do that very well. I thank all those who may be listening this evening, particularly those who are working in our National Labs, the finest labs in the world that are inventing the future from coast to coast. Over a dozen and a half of those labs have America’s best scientists working on not just energy research, but derivative spinoffs in the commercial sector that eventually benefit the entire country. As I mentioned, the natural gas discovery that has really been responsible for leading us toward energy independence was made possible by the fracking technology developed over many years at the U.S. Department of Energy. So as you look at gas prices going down at the pump and you look at the competition in the energy industry, we have a lot of people, many unsung heroes across our country in these labs who work tirelessly on behalf of the American people. Some are retired and some are still in place, but we owe them a deep debt of gratitude for serving the American people so nobly. We are going to have several other amendments that come before us tonight. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman if he wishes to make a statement. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman. It is wonderful to have someone who can talk with some intelligence about what we are doing here, and keep the attention of the body as we are waiting for Members to come to the floor. Ms. KAPTUR. I think it is fair to say, Mr. Chairman, that you do such a fine job and move the bill along that people were anticipating their amendments would come up later in the evening. But, as usual, this is not just an energy efficient committee, but a very efficient committee. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker Pro Tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ) having assumed the chair, Mr. GALLAGHER , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
PERMISSION TO CONSIDER AMENDMENT NO. 32 AND AMENDMENT NO. 35 PRINTED IN HOUSE REPORT 115–259 OUT OF SEQUENCE Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, during further consideration of H.R. 3219, pursuant to House Resolution 473, amendment No. 32 and amendment No. 35, printed in House Report 115–259, may be offered out of sequence. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Idaho? There was no objection.

AMENDMENT NO . 36 OFFERED BY MR . MITCHELL  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 36 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 273, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $18,100,000)’’. Page 273, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $476,400)’’. Page 282, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,900,000)’’. Page 296, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $28,169,300)’’. Page 326, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $52,645,700)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my fiscally responsible amendment that is one step in securing America’s future. My amendment is a simple 10 percent cut to administrative expenses of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, Department of the Interior, and Department of Energy. These savings would be used to reduce the deficit. Our national debt stands at $20 trillion, and growing. Our unfunded liabilities add another $100 trillion to $200 trillion to the Federal debt, and that is only a guess. Our deficit last year was over $500 billion. That is not sustainable. It jeopardizes our future and must be taken seriously. Paying lip service to the problem will not solve it. Talk is cheap. We must now be responsible, before it is too late. I come from the world of private business and know the importance of having our fiscal house in order. I also know that being fiscally responsible starts with small steps, which, when added together, make a big impact. Early in my career, I worked at Chrysler at the time when Lee Iacocca was CEO and went through the first loan guarantee. His famous fiscal savvy and focus helped save Chrysler, which was destined for bankruptcy. If not for Iacocca taking strong but necessary measures, a great Michigan company would have been lost. Lee Iacocca understood that fiscal responsibility starts on a small scale. He once said if he had a manager who couldn’t cut administrative costs by 10 percent, he needed a new manager. Mr. Chair, that is what I propose today, a 10 percent cut to administrative costs of government agencies, which is a small step that, when combined with others like it, could yield back results and big savings for taxpayers. Moreover, these cuts would restrain an overactive government bureaucracy. The Republicanled Congress has worked hard to undo years of copious overregulation, but another solution is to have fewer regulators and fewer bureaucrats passing on regulations that make it hard for businesses to survive and taxpayers to live their lives. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to choose fiscal responsibility, choose a secure American future, make a modest cut in the administrations costs of 
our government, and support my amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I understand that reducing the size of the bureaucracy is an important issue for many Members, and should be for all of us. As chair of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am always open to hearing if my colleagues have particular concerns with agency budget requests. I could be supportive of thoughtful strategies for reducing the size of government by making agencies more efficient and carrying out their statutory goals. That is not what this amendment does. This amendment simply slashes 10 percent from each administrative account in the bill. Most of these accounts have been held flat or even slightly decreased over the past several years. Reducing them an additional 10 percent, with no clear idea on how such cuts would be absorbed, is simply not the right way to address the size of the Federal Government. It could take longer to review and improve important water resource projects—I hear about that all the time from my colleagues—or to issue grants and approve research agreements—I hear about that all the time from my colleagues—or to respond to congressional information requests—I hear about that all the time from my colleagues. These cuts would also put at risk the cybersecurity efforts of each agency, reducing their efforts to secure their own IT infrastructure. I don’t think that is what the gentleman from Michigan intended, but that is a very possible result of this amendment. Mr. Chair, for those reasons, I must urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I also rise in opposition to this amendment. I respect the gentleman from Michigan, particularly because he is from the Great Lakes region, too, and we need him as a strong voice for our Great Lakes, but I do think that cuts to these particular accounts really are counterproductive, for the following reasons. First of all, the most important step any country can take to deal with the deficit is to grow the economy. This particular budget, this particular set of accounts, particularly the Army Corps of Engineers, has the type of construction and building accounts that produce income. They produce income for people who do the work, but they also improve our ports. If you look all around Michigan, if you look at the Soo Locks, if you look at the assets just in our region of the country, the progress that a region can make, because it improves its ports and attendant roads and rails and so forth, creates opportunity for companies to locate and to grow. We just had a phenomenal announcement in the city of Toledo this week by the ClevelandCliffs company. We have been working for 30 years to improve the port to connect rail and to have east to west, north to south highway improvements. By golly, it worked with a $700 million investment by the private sector. It was just so exciting to bring ore from Michigan and Minnesota into the lower lakes. It was really quite incredible. So these dollars yield results. They don’t happen in one year. They take a while to happen, but they happen. I also oppose the gentleman’s amendment because there are $62 billion of backlogged projects at the Army Corps of Engineers alone. I don’t know if you saw the stories about the Department of the Interior. People are lined up to get into the national parks through those turnstiles, trying to get into our national parks. We need to improve those parks. We need to make sure that we are doing things like dealing with the Forest Service so that the underbrush is cut out and that our forests aren’t burning up all over the country. We have such a maintenance backlog across this Nation, and with budgets of this size, we don’t want to be in a position where we under account for the funds that are being spent. So to reduce funding for critical oversight in the administrative departments of these very large agencies, I think is not wise. In fact, it is penny wise and poundfoolish in the end. Mr. Chair, for all of those reasons— our jobs, the security of taxpayer funds, and for the sake of the future— I oppose the gentleman’s amendment and urge my colleagues to join me. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Chair, I certainly did not intend the adverse impacts that are outlined by the chairman or the ranking member, nor do I believe they will arise. My experience in years of management is that, rather than detail item byitem the cuts to be made, allow the leadership of agencies to determine where they can be more efficient. I honestly have to say, I can’t imagine that we cannot be more efficient than we are in the Federal Government. I admit, my experience is somewhat more brief than many, but I am, frankly, shocked some days. I urge support of my amendment. I realize it may not be popular, but, at some point in time, we need to start to cut the incredible costs of this government. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 32 OFFERED BY MR . MAST  
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, it is now in order to consider amendment No. 32 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. MAST. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 268, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $500,000)’’. Page 270, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $500,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. MAST. Mr. Chairman, I rise today because I represent the Treasure Coast of Florida, and it is facing an environmental disaster that, sadly, communities across the Nation face, from down along the Mississippi, up in Michigan, to the east coast of Florida. We face these disasters year after year. This disaster is toxic algal blooms. The water that is discharged into my area comes out of Lake Okeechobee and goes into the Treasure Coast of Florida. It puts people out of business, kills sea life, sea grass, manatees, and fish. It makes people sick. It destroys home values and businesses. It is all because of a guacamolelike toxic algal bloom that can occur year after year. This can’t continue. Our communities can’t wait any longer. Our lagoons, beaches, and water have to be restored. My amendment increases the Aquatic Plant Control Research Program within the Army Corps of Engineers’ Engineer Research and Development Center, or ERDC, by $500,000 above the appropriated level. The Aquatic Plant Control Research Program is the only federally authorized research program directed to develop the kind of technology for management of nonindigenous aquatic plant species, like these toxic blooms. When I talk to the Corps about the issue in my community and the communities across the country, I am told that they don’t have the technology to scale the type of equipment that cleans out fish tanks to the level that we are facing in these large bodies of water. This amendment replaces the $500,000 shortfall from last year’s appropriation and makes important investments in the research in order to ensure that the Army Corps has all of the information required to develop that technology that can scale the size needed to successfully complete their mission. Mr. Chair, I urge immediate passage, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I understand what the gentleman’s concern is. In fact, it is a concern not only in Florida, but all over the country. It is a concern in Ohio. It is actually a concern in Idaho. You wouldn’t think about that, but they are having some problems in Idaho with algal blooms, also. So it is something that we need to get on top of. I would just like to clarify that the amendment does not direct funds to any particular activities so that doesn’t necessarily mean that this will get done, but I understand what the gentleman is trying to do. For that reason, and because it doesn’t upset the balance of the bill, I will not oppose the amendment, but I want to work with him, as well as, I am sure, the ranking member, because this is an issue we have got to address across the country. I appreciate him bringing this matter and this issue to our attention so that we can talk about it. Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to add a bit to that. I thank Congressman MAST very much for offering this amendment. I do think we need to work with the Corps. Obviously, this is a growing problem. We have heard from Florida colleagues. We have heard from colleagues in Nevada, throughout the Great Lakes region. These algal blooms are truly frightening. In the Midwest, in the Great Lakes region, a major water system was shut down for 3 days in the city of Toledo, denying water to over half a million people for 3 days. It is quite frightening. At the moment, there is no—and I say this for the Corps’ benefit, because it would require cooperation with other agencies—ecosystem satellite mapping or drone technology currently that is able to photo large regions and home in on where the nutrients are that are causing the problem. b2000 As I have gotten into this more deeply, we need high science, whether it is highfrequency infrared or whatever we use. We do not have the ability to home in on where the causes are coming from and then target the toxic portions of those algal blooms. So a lot of work is needed, and I really appreciate the gentleman rising tonight. I know you have gotten the Corps’ attention as you have gotten our attention, and we will work with the chairman to see if we can’t make progress on this really vexing issue. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman’s comments, and we not only need to work with the Corps, but we also need to work with the EPA in trying to address this issue because it is a lot broader than most people think. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 35 OFFERED BY MR . HECK  
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. D ONOVAN ). Pursuant to the order of the House of today, it is now in order to consider amendment No. 35 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. HECK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 270, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $500,000)’’. Page 273, line 1, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(reduced by 500,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is about tackling a problem that, frankly, affects every single one of us in every single one of our districts, and that is storm water. Most of us probably don’t think about it very much, but, frankly, when rain falls—it does a lot of that in the Northwest—and flows through our streets and off the shoulders of our highways, it picks up all sorts and kinds of pollutants. We are talking, frankly, about some really nasty stuff: toxic chemicals like arsenic and flame retardants, as well as oil and pesticides. Stop and think. The single largest contributor of water pollution in the United States of America is storm water runoff—up to 80 percent in some places. Toxic storm water runoff harms our rivers and our lakes and our waterways. But it not only harms our environment, it harms our businesses that depend on clean water, like the shellfish industry of Washington State which employes, literally, thousands of people. In Puget Sound, the largest estuary in America, storm water runoff literally can kill a salmon in a few hours. Well, salmon and other fish are a way of life in Washington, to the tune of a $30 billion, with a B, economy. Salmon also serve as a vital resource of immeasurable value. For the 19 federally recognized Tribes in the Puget Sound, salmon is their way of life. They are called the salmon people. If we fail to address the problem posed by storm water, these resources will continue to decline, and our communities will continue to pay an avoidable price. So what are we doing right now to stop this from happening? The answer is: a few things, but nowhere near enough. If we are going to truly address the problem, the Federal Government needs to do the basic, and that is set an example. The good news is that Congress has recognized this in the past, because about 10 years ago this body passed a law which requires Federal agencies to reduce storm water runoff when they develop or redevelop property. That is a commonsense requirement, but we can’t stop there. Research shows that the most cost effective and efficient way to reduce storm water runoff is through what is called green infrastructure, or lowimpact development, things like rain gardens and permeable pavement and green roofs. You probably won’t be surprised when I share that the largest storm water research center in the United States of America is in my district at our landgrant university, Washington State University’s extension campus in Puyallup. So I am a witness to the promise and the potential of this approach. This amendment simply provides funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to determine to what extent they are using these technologies and techniques to comply with the requirements already imposed by Congress. Mr. Chairman, if we are going to help communities and businesses impacted by toxic storm water runoff, it is crucial that the Federal Government set the example and lead the way. So I ask you to join me as responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and ensure that Federal agencies are using the latest and most efficient technology to manage storm water runoff. Finally, I want to extend my deepest appreciation to the chair of the committee, my friend from Idaho, and the ranking member from Ohio very, very much. I urge adoption of this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I agree with what the gentleman is trying to do. I would just point out again that this amendment does not direct the funds to any particular activity, so it will actually take some coordination with us and some conversation with the Army Corps of Engineers to make sure that this goes in the area that we would like it to go to to study just what the gentleman was talking about. But because it doesn’t direct it to a particular activity, for that reason and because it does not upset the balance of 
the bill, I will not oppose the amendment. In fact, I will support the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 37 OFFERED BY MS . KAPTUR  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 37 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Congressman BEYER , and I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 277, beginning on line 12, strike section 108. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would essentially strike the provision related to the waters of the United States, section 108. Unfortunately, Republican insistence on the inclusion of poison pill riders like this one has derailed several important pieces of legislation over the last few years, especially clean water rural riders. However, let me be plain. This rider is worse than any of those previous versions, and it will not gain the Democratic votes necessary to become law. It actually is a roadblock in the way of us moving our bills forward. This rider would exempt the repeal of the clean water rule from laws that would otherwise apply, including the Administrative Procedure Act, essentially allowing the President to act unilaterally, the executive branch to act unilaterally without any input from the public. That doesn’t sound like America to me. The Administrative Procedure Act was a Republican idea to make sure that government is accountable to its citizens and that their input be considered. People have come to expect this in their own communities. Exempting this action on clean water is a very slippery slope toward government by fiat, by an administration which deserves more scrutiny, I might add, on that front than any in our history. So I urge all my colleagues to support the KapturBeyer amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, this is going to be something that the ranking member and I happen to disagree on. Poison pill riders—I have always liked that term, ‘‘poison pill riders.’’ What they are are policy changes. If they are policy changes you like, they are policy changes. If you don’t like them, they are poison pill riders. So when they had the majority, they put what we considered poison pill riders in their bill, but they were policy changes, and that is what we do in some appropriations bills. But I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. I have been debating this issue for, I don’t know, probably 10 years. While the change in the administration means that we are able to reduce the number of the issues we needed to address in this bill, some issues warrant continued congressional attention—WOTUS is one of them. My reason for opposing the Obama administration’s WOTUS rule remains the same. The rule would greatly expand Federal jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court has twice ruled that the definition used under the Clean Water Act of navigable waters was hard to define and told them that they need a new definition. Well, the EPA’s design on a new definition is, okay, we will just control everything. So everybody thinks that those waters that are now under control of the Clean Water—I mean, of the WOTUS rule written by the Obama administration were unregulated before. They were not unregulated. They were regulated by the States, and the States did a good job of regulating those things. But now the Federal Government has come in and taken control of all of those States. We think, and the courts have ruled, that this is too broad a definition of what they intended and what the Clean Water rule states. Nobody wants dirty water—nobody. But what we want is a rule that separates what the Federal Government has the authority to control and what the States have the authority to control. President Trump moved quickly on this issue by issuing an executive order in February, and a few weeks ago, the EPA and the Corps announced the first step in a twostep process: a proposed rule to rescind the WOTUS rule and recodify the previous regulatory text. The second step will be a second rulemaking to reevaluate the definition of waters of the United States in a manner consistent with the Supreme Court decision. The provision in this bill is supportive of these efforts. First, it provides clear authorization to withdraw the Obama administration’s rule. Second, it clarifies what rule will be in effect if the WOTUS rule is withdrawn, specifically, the same rules that were in effect immediately prior to the promulgation of the final WOTUS rule. And third, it does not affect the Trump administration’s ability to develop a new rule, one that will provide more clarity and certainty for the regulated community while staying within the legal bounds provided by the Supreme Court. For these reasons, I have to oppose this amendment, and I strongly oppose this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to comment, in asking my colleagues to support this amendment, that the amendment itself is intended to address the two Supreme Court decisions. And in addition, if we leave this language in the bill, the chairman was correct, this is at the policy level. This doesn’t belong in an appropriation bill. Let them deal with this in the courts and the authorizing committees. I think it creates a very, very high speed bump that threatens our bill’s passage as we move forward, so I ask my colleagues to support us on striking the provision related to the waters of the United States, section 108 offered by myself and Mr. BEYER of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS). Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman so much for his leadership on this issue. WOTUS, waters of the U.S., it has really been talked about for a number of years. This is a classic case of Barack Obama, the administration previous to the Trump administration, overreaching its authority. This is executive branch takeover, waters of the U.S., saying that we have got what is called navigable waters and using the executive authority to redefine what navigable waters are. This hurts farmers. This hurts small businesses. The suggestion that just a puddle, a small creek is defined as a navigable water, we know that is simply not the case. Let me remind folks about the three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judiciary. We have Supreme Court decisions that were putting a stop to the overreach of the Obama administration’s WOTUS rule. Thank you to the courts. We now have an opportunity as the legislative branch. We appreciate the work of the executive branch. We appreciate the fact that Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt and this administration are working to put a stop to it, because the Court said, as we all know, the Obama administration overreached. Now what we are doing, what this appropriations bill provides is the voice of the legislative branch to say, yes, the prior administration overreached; the executive branch historically needs to be curtailed; the courts were right. We need to speak as the legislative branch giving the authority to stop this onerous rule. I applaud the work of the Appropriations Committee. We need to put the legislative stamp of approval on what the Trump administration is doing to stop this overregulation. 
I thank the chair, and I certainly oppose this proposed amendment. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ). The amendment was rejected. b2015 
AMENDMENT NO . 38 OFFERED BY MS . CASTOR OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 38 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $177,000,000)’’. Page 288, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $355,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, this Republican bill weakens America’s commitment to clean energy. It harms the huge number of jobs that are being created in the renewable energy sector. And it stalls consumer cost savings tied to energy efficiency. Democrats have a different vision. It is one that lowers costs on our neighbors back home, and helps create the higher paying jobs of the future. My amendment increases funding for the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy account by about $177 million, and it reduces funding for the fossil Energy Research and Development account by about $355 million. Energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives across America have a proven return on investment for taxpayers. This amendment is paid for by reducing, but not eliminating, accounts that do not have the same return on investment for taxpayers. Investments in energy efficiency and renewables create jobs and help make our businesses more competitive. Energy efficiency reduces costs for consumers. And wouldn’t that be a positive development for taxpayers back home, that the Congress is asking to put more money back into their pockets? The amount proposed for energy efficiency and renewable energy in the Republican bill is so low that America will have to reduce the number of research, development, and demonstration projects that are often supported with industry, at our great national laboratories, and at our fantastic universities. Mr. Chairman, America should be a leader in innovation and technological advancement. But, instead, the Republican bill says America should take a back seat. Well, America should not take a back seat to anyone. We are in the midst of a technological revolution when it comes to energy and energy efficiency. Look what is happening all across America. We have a very diverse energy portfolio and a growing clean energy and efficiency sector. This is especially important as we tackle the costs and challenges of the changing climate. Look at what we are today because of robust investments of the past decade. The solar industry is creating jobs 12 times faster than the overall U.S. workforce. In 2016, 1 out of every 50 new jobs was in solar energy. Republicans used to say they were for alloftheabove sources of energy. Well, you can’t say that anymore. The Trump administration and House Republicans are ceding America’s leadership role in the world by failing to invest in technologies that will save families and businesses money. Instead, we should work together and face the challenges of the changing climate headon and not bury our heads in the sand. Sixteen of the 17 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001; including 2016, which was the third consecutive recordbreaking year. The rising costs of the changing climate are a real threat to everyone, especially to the families I represent back home in Florida, which is why I filed another amendment that was not ruled in order, an amendment that would limit the Department of Energy from removing the term ‘‘climate change’’ from their publications. That is right, the Trump administration has already removed mention of climate change from government websites, and has deleted a sentence linking climate change to sea level rise in a press release. Ignoring or trying to hide the cost of the changing climate will simply cost us more in the long run. We should be working together on investing in a clean energy future, but that, unfortunately, seems farther away today, unless we adopt an amendment like mine and begin to understand the realities that we are facing. If we don’t unleash American ingenuity now, our neighbors back home will face higher AC bills, property insurance bills, flood insurance bills, and have to put more property taxes into replacing water and wastewater infrastructure. I appreciate Ranking Member KAPTUR’s vision. A little while ago, she was talking about our national labs—the fact that we have the best scientists in the world. Don’t hamstring them by cutting back on our investments in clean energy and energy efficiency. She understands that this is our future that we are talking about. I appreciate her work. I appreciate the work of Chairman SIMPSON . I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on the Castor amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, let’s step back a minute on this issue. As you can see from this chart, coal, natural gas, and oil—fossil fuels—make up 81 percent of this country’s energy consumption—81 percent. But the proportion of R&D funding, you can see, is only 18 percent, which is far below what is currently being spent on renewables and nuclear. The reality is that America and the entire world are going to be dependent on fossil fuels for years to come. The Energy Information Administration estimates that by the year 2040, fossil energy will still make up 78 percent of the energy used around the globe. Are my friends on the other side serious about addressing these emissions? Shouldn’t America’s goal be to develop the technologies so that we can utilize coal and natural gas around the world in the cleanest, most efficient way possible? Shouldn’t America be that global leader on energy technology? You can’t do that without research. Mr. Chairman, we can’t be cutting research on fossil fuels and technology. We should actually be increasing it. Fossil fuels will be around for the foreseeable future. I think we have a responsibility for our children and our grandchildren to make sure that it is burned and used in the most efficient, clean manner that we can, and this requires research. Mr. Chairman, the House has soundly defeated similar amendments to this in the past, year after year, and I hope they will defeat this one, too. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman from West Virginia. He is a wellspoken advocate for his State. I am not zeroing out the fossil fuel research for R&D, but, instead, we have got to look towards the future. Where are the jobs being created now? It is in renewable energy and energy efficiency, things that are going to put money back into the pockets of consumers and unleash this technological revolution so America can stay the leader in the world. Mr. Chairman, I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote on the Castor amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Ms. CASTOR ’s remarks, and I enjoy working with her in committee. But the realization is fossil fuels are consumed in all 50 States. It is not West Virginia we are dealing with. I think Ms. CASTOR is concerned about her State, the water quality in her State, and that is what this research is going to take care of. We have got to maximize the amount of money that has been put into it. In 
the past, we had far more amount of money in this. We need to preserve what we have, and, actually, I am hoping we can plus it up a little bit. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 39 OFFERED BY MR . NORCROSS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 39 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $161,725,000)’’. Page 288, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $323,450,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, this important amendment looks to the future and what we need for our 21st century clean energy economy. It redirects funds so we are sufficiently investing in renewable energy jobs of tomorrow. It is a simple change. The amendment simply moves $162 million to the Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy. It leaves the amount in that account, and the underlying bill still exceeds what the administration requested. Certainly my colleague from West Virginia understands that investing in the future in technology is extremely important. This bill provides $354 million more for fossil fuels. But by providing the additional resources for energy efficiency and renewable energy, we can better meet the needs of the future economy. I happen to agree, we need to invest in all of the above. But we also must invest in solar, wind, water, and geothermal. In fact, New Jersey is second in the Nation leading in solar and renewables. We must seek that costeffective way of reducing energy costs for our manufacturing plants, our office buildings, and certainly our homes. We shouldn’t underfund our energy future, let’s make that clear. We should invest in it, the way we are in this bill. But we can redirect a small portion of that for future needs of renewable energy. Tomorrow might be too late to do the investigation and that research. We can do it today because we need a long term strategy that takes the best of what we do here in America and continues that. If it is clean coal, we can do that. If it is solar, we can do that. If it is wind, we can do that. We have the ability to do all that, and add high paying jobs. Let’s make this simple change and reallocate just a small portion of the fund. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and embrace the clean energy future. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman from New Jersey’s amendment. The fossil Energy Research and Development account actually helps the Nation use the full extent of our resources safely, wisely, and efficiently. I always hear Members say—and I have heard it several times tonight already—that they support an ‘‘allof theabove’’ energy strategy. Unfortunately, this amendment does just the opposite. It picks energy winners and losers. The level of funding for fossil Energy R&D in this year’s bill recognizes the important role fossil energy plays in our Nation’s future. At a time when fossil power generation is actually expanding around the globe, the activities funded in the bill advance our Nation’s position as a leader in fossil energy technologies. I just hosted a conference in my home State of West Virginia on something that is getting a lot of attention lately: rare earth elements. I want everybody just to think about that phone that they hold in their hand or, if they are watching on TV, that TV in their home. Guess what. These phones and those TVs have what is called rare earth elements. And you would think by the term ‘‘rare earth,’’ it must mean, gosh, they are rare, hard to find. Guess what. Rare earth elements are found in many places. Amazingly, coal contains an abundant supply of rare earth elements. This is important to our national security because, currently, China has a monopoly on the rare earth element market. Ninety percent of all rare earth elements that are in every phone and every TV are controlled by China. But we know that coal, through research, can unlock an abundant supply of these critical elements that we need for everyday technology. So this just isn’t about energy production. This is about everyday items that impact our life. b2030 So for our Nation’s security and electric grid reliability and use of our domestic fossil fuel resources, investment in fossil R&D is critical. Each of these programs represent a partnership with the private sector that provides an even greater leverage to Federal funds. Therefore, I urge our Members to vote against the gentleman from New Jersey’s amendment so we can support fossil energy R&D for our country and for our future. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, in many ways, I think my colleague from the other side of the aisle is agreeing with me. We need to do research, that R&D that he is speaking about, but it is about balance. The dollars that were in the underlying bill far exceeded that of what the administration asked for. We are simply saying, let’s not pick one winner, let’s pick them all, and see where that technology of tomorrow is taking us. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the Congresswoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ) for her remarks. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of the Norcross amendment, and I want to thank my colleague for calling attention to this issue and the importance of EERE. I represent the State of Maine, and we have over 3,000 miles of tidal coastline and millions of acres of forest. We are famous for our natural resources and the recreational opportunities that they provide, so it would be no surprise that these resources are providing our residents with an abundance of renewable energy sources. Our State’s natural resources and our efforts have made us one of the leaders in renewable energy development. From solar, to wind, to tidal, to biomass, Maine is a leader in renewable energy. Because our State is largely a rural one, with many diverse energy needs in our rural and island communities, we are particularly attentive to rising energy costs and the need to have more ways to solve them. This amendment today would restore funds to the EERE account, and it will help the State of Maine, like so many other States like it that are working hard to move our energy policy to the 21st century. We have traditionally been in one of the most oildependent States in the country, but this will help us address rising energy costs with more tools and technologies at our disposal. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support renewable energy, and I support this amendment. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman from New Jersey’s amendment. Let me simply state, while he politely suggests we have agreement, bottom line, his amendment guts the fossil energy R&D. It takes over $300 million out of the fossil research and development, the kinds of research and 
development that can generate rare Earth elements and other things that we have talked about, in addition to use for our power generation. Mr. Chair, I simply oppose this amendment and ask for its rejection. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have left. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, this is the first time I have ever heard ‘‘gutting’’ by giving millions of additional dollars over the administration. I have worked in nuclear power houses, I have worked in coal power houses, gasfired, I have worked in solar fields. This is absolutely about the future of our energy needs. We don’t know what it holds, but I do know that investing in research and development is the way to go. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 40 OFFERED BY MR . QUIGLEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 40 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(increased $921,000,000)’’. Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(reduced by $921,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chairman, some of us in this room are old enough to remember duck and cover. As kids, the notion was that, if you hid under a halfinch plywood piece of desk under a thermonuclear attack, you would be safe. It is not a particularly rational idea, but not much more rational than our current nuclear posture. For decades, Presidents and Members of Congress from both parties have worked together to prevent the use and spread of nuclear weapons and materials. Starting with President Reagan’s leadership, American Presidents have reduced the size of America’s nuclear arsenal from its Cold War peak. In fact, Republican Presidents have cut the arsenal far more aggressively than their Democratic counterparts, yet this year’s Energy and Water bill doubles down on an outdated Cold War strategy by unnecessarily diverting precious resources to build new nukes. It remains unclear how these weapons will solve 21st century national security threats such as terrorism, cyber attacks, or global warming. Rather than wasting dollars to keep up the status quo, we must find ways to replace the U.S. nuclear arsenal while maintaining a force capable of deterring nuclear attack against the U.S. and its allies. In 2013, the Pentagon determined that the U.S. could reduce its deployed strategic nuclear force by onethird below its current levels and still meet security requirements. According to the former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military utility of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, such as the B61, is practically nil. Defense Secretary Mattis has raised doubts about the need for the new ICBMs, and they need to take a closer look at the new nucleararmed cruise missile. Rather than wasting tax dollars to keep up the status quo, we must find ways to replace the U.S. nuclear arsenal while maintaining a force capable of nuclear deterrent. It is worse than that. This bill proposes to add nearly $1 billion to the nuclear weapons activities account by gutting the Department of Energy office responsible for research and application of technology to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy. DOE’s EERE has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support and is crucial to research and development in clean renewable energies, energy use reduction technologies, vehicle engines, geothermal technology, and advanced batteries. This is a government success story. The $12 billion we invested in EERE, through 2012, yielded a more than $230 billion benefit to the U.S. economy, and EERE has an annual return on investment of more than 20 percent. Entire industries are built on the back of the work EERE does, stimulating a robust domestic clean energy economy. The role of EERE is also critical to furthering the transition to a lowcarbon economy and ensuring longterm, robust, sustainable economic growth. That is why this amendment would take $922 million from nuclear weapons activities and give it back to EERE. Just to be clear, this would still be a cut to that office. The current bill funds EERE at $986 million less than the current enacted level, but it would go a long way towards fixing this mistake. Mr. Chair, I urge committee members to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment—not just opposition to this amendment, but strong opposition to this amendment. This bill fully funds the request of $10.2 billion for weapons activities, which is, as the gentleman stated, an increase of $921 million over fiscal year 2017. I have got to tell you, from his comments, you would think we were growing the nuclear stockpile. The reality is we are decreasing the size of the nuclear stockpile currently under the new START program. But even having done that, we have to fund the modernization of our nuclear stockpile, and it is one of my highest priorities in this bill. The activities the gentleman proposes to cut are the primary reasons the Energy and Water bill is being included as a division in the Defense minibus, because maintaining the nuclear weapons stockpile is essential to our Nation’s national security. The increase provided in this bill to weapons activities is needed to extend the life of four nuclear warheads and to address the continued deterioration of the infrastructure at the Department of Energy’s nuclear sites. These investments are long overdue and must be funded if our Nation is to have a credible nuclear deterrent, regardless of the size of that nuclear deterrent. I would say that the Department of Defense is carrying out a nuclear posture review that will inform future funding needs. Until that concludes, there is no change in our Nation’s nuclear defense requirements, and Congress, I believe, must fully fund those requirements if our Nation is to have a credible nuclear deterrent. Increases are also needed, as I said, to address the aging infrastructure at the Department of Energy’s nuclear energy sites. Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment that the gentleman from Illinois is offering and would encourage my colleagues to vote against it. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chairman, respectfully, what the gentleman is talking about has been done many times. Again, in 2013, the Pentagon said we could do this with onethird of the weapons we have now. The cost of restoring a weapon like the B61 is more than its weight in gold. We have already been told we have too many. So the plan here is, let’s restore as many as possible, build as many as we possibly can, and maybe in the future we will be told again that we don’t need this many. In the meantime, we are using those resources to cut necessary programs. Mr. Chair, I ask for Members’ support, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I would say that the Secretary of Energy is required to report to the President on 
the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. This is part of that requirement by the Department of Energy so that they can assure the President that our nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. Modernizing these nuclear weapons makes sense. Now, we can sit and argue whether we need all these nuclear weapons or not—I happen to think we can get by on quite a number fewer nuclear weapons—but we still have to maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile that we currently have and let the Department of Defense do their Nuclear Posture Review and make a determination of what ought to be the ultimate number of nuclear weapons we have, but, as long as we have this, we have got to make sure they are safe and they are reliable. Mr. Chair, I would encourage my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 41 OFFERED BY MR . POLIS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 41 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $986,292,000)’’. Page 288, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $634,600,000)’’. Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $352,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, my amendment would simply restore the funding cuts to the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy account just to fund at the same levels it was funded last year. That is $986 million. And I will tell you where we find those funds and take it from in a minute. It takes them from two programs: the fossil fuel energy and research account and the nuclear weapons account. So we should invest in our future for energy efficiency and renewable energy rather than throwing more money at the past and into nuclear weapons. Fossil fuel research and development is a dead end for America, for our economy, for the clean air that we need, and for our water. Continuing to fund fossil fuels, whether it makes them marginally cleaner or not, is simply throwing money at the past rather than the future. Regardless of how clean we make fossil fuel extraction, it is never as clean or, more importantly, as sustainable as renewable energy, and definitely won’t be as cheap or sustainable as clean energy. I am the proud sponsor of a bill for our country to reach 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, but to be able to do that, we need the investment in research and development. Frankly, investing in nuclear weapons when we already have enough nuclear capabilities to destroy every man, woman, and child on this planet seven times over is simply wasteful. Nuclear weapons receive over $10 billion, while renewable energy receives a measly $986 million. I was talking to one of my constituents a little while ago, Nancy Cronk from Colorado, and she agreed that we simply spend too much on potentially having the capability of destroying the world through nuclear weapons, rather than investing in a renewable energy future. We don’t live in Cold War times. We don’t need Cold Warlevel spending for facilities that the military hasn’t used in over 20 years. b2045 We should be following the advice, in this case, of the Department of Defense and focusing on the renewable energy account, which helps fund national labs like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden. The most recent study of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s economic impact alone shows it totaled over $800 million nationally. In addition, CU Boulder and NREL jointly operate the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute, which is located in Colorado, which helps advance renewable energy science, engineering, and analysis through industry partnerships and education. That is the future of our country, Mr. Chairman, and the future of the world. And by undercutting our investment in our future and throwing money at the past, and being able to kill every man, woman, and child seven times instead of six times, we are losing the forest through the trees, and we are making our country less secure, not more secure. The Building Technologies Offices, NREL, and many others receiving funds under this account do amazing work to pull us into the 21st century, like using 3D printing for wind blades. Not only that, their work helps save consumers money because of energy efficiency. In fact, an estimate shows that from 2009 to 2015, the work of the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy program has saved consumers more than $543 billion and reduced carbon pollution by 2.3 billion metric tons. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I am not opposed to the EERE. I actually like the program. But we had to make some difficult decisions, and our highest priority is maintaining our nuclear stockpile and making sure that our defense activities were fully funded. Secondly, it was making sure that the Army Corps of Engineers was fully funded at the WRDA level that our colleagues here on the floor always insist on. That means we had to make some difficult decisions within the Department of Energy. EERE, we did the best we could. But when the gentleman says, you know, we are not living in the Cold War anymore, so we don’t need the nuclear weapons and stuff and we don’t need these facilities and stuff, you are right, we are not living in the Cold War anymore. It is scarier times right now than it was in the Cold War. You never need those facilities until you need those facilities, and you better have had them by then. That is the problem. It is not looking forward. So I oppose this amendment because we have done our best within the weapons activities to make sure that we do what our Nation requires, and that is to make sure that we have a safe, reliable, and secure nuclear stockpile. And we ought to let the Defense Department come out with their Nuclear Posture Review and tell us what they believe we need as a weapons system, altogether, when that review comes out. I oppose it also because it takes money for the arguments made by my friends from West Virginia, because it takes money out of the fossil energy research. As they said every time I have asked the Department of Energy, ‘‘What do you think the amount of energy we are going to consume over the next 20 or 30 years that comes from hydrocarbons, coal, and natural gas, is going to be in the future,’’ it is actually a larger part, not a smaller part. And while I have been to NREL, I think NREL is a great lab. They do some incredible work out there. We want to support them. We want to make sure that they stay open and that they can do the job that we have asked them to do and that our other labs can also. But this amendment, I think, is directly the wrong direction to go. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief. By my calculation, this is about the third or fourth amendment from the minority trying to take money out of a very important futurelooking initiative, the fossil energy R&D, and redirect it elsewhere. They keep trying to raid this important funding. I am sitting here with my colleague from West Virginia, who NETL is actually physically in his district. There is no stronger champion of NETL than 
the gentleman from West Virginia. This is hundreds of jobs in our State, in his district, but the impact of their work reaches across the country and literally around the world. I spoke on a previous attack on this funding a moment ago. I defend strongly the work of the fossil energy R&D. And to suggest this is just looking to yesterday is missing the point that I made a moment ago talking about rare earth elements and unlocking the potential that these fossil resources have in so many ways, not just energy production. So I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for recognizing and supporting fossil energy R&D; and my colleague from West Virginia, who is such a staunch supporter of NETL, and my ability to work with him. Please, I encourage people to reject the gentleman’s amendment. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for recognizing the importance of the Energy Efficient & Renewable Energy account. It is an incredibly high priority for economic development. We talked about the jobs and technology transfers that come out of that fund. We also talked about its need for energy independence in our future. I hope the chairman is willing to work on finding other agreeable funding sources to hold that account harmless and plus it up. I want to highlight a couple of other important projects funded from the EERE account, large and small. One example is the EERE’s Vehicle Technologies Office which awarded $500,000. It doesn’t sound like a lot, but it makes an enormous difference on the ground for the Clean City Coalition to support Project FEVER, to foster the development of Colorado State’s acceleration of plugin electric vehicles, which are in extremely high demand. The Clean Cities project helped to develop a comprehensive electric vehicle strategy, including supply readiness and implementation. The project has already saved over 7.5 billion gallons of petroleum. These are just some of the many projects that we should be focused on because they are truly our future. Rather than expanding our nuclear arsenal, rather than throwing money into the past with additional fossil fuel research, we can move toward cleaner air, cleaner water, more jobs, a stronger economy, and energy independence through clean, renewable energy. That is why I ask you to support my amendment that will increase EERE funding and decrease funding for fossil fuel research and unnecessary and dangerous nukes that would destroy the world more than is reasonably needed as a deterrent. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS). The amendment was rejected. AMENDMENT NO . 42 OFFERED BY MR . MCKINLEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 42 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
On page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $33,400,000)’’. On page 288 line 15, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $33,400,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple. We are merely restoring the Fossil Energy Research & Development program back to the levels of 2017—merely back to the levels of 2017. We must put it in perspective. It is still $300 million less than it was under President Bush. Let’s also put it in perspective. As I showed earlier on the chart, the consumption of fossil fuels make up 81 percent of all the country’s energy consumption; 81 percent fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and oil. But the level of research is only at 18 percent of the money that we have currently. Now, I just heard a minute ago someone say this is pretty balanced. Look, I may be just an engineer, but I don’t think 18 percent is the equivalent of 81 percent. There is something wrong with that. I am not here to argue that America shouldn’t be investing in renewables and nuclear. That wouldn’t be appropriate. But the reality is that America and the entire world will be relying on fossil energy for years to come. The Energy Information Administration estimated that by 2040, fossil energy is still going to make up 78 percent of the world’s consumption. So shouldn’t it be America’s goal to lead the world, to have that mantle of leadership, to develop the technologies that we can export to other countries around the world that are going to continue to use coal and gas and oil in the cleanest and most efficient way? Shouldn’t we, again, be that global leader on this? But we can’t do this without leadership. Mr. Chairman, let’s consider the history of this, the fossil research from the Federal Government. Just remember the threat years ago, back in the eighties, we had of acid rain. It was the research in our Federal labs all across America that reduced the emissions of SOx and NOXgases and addressing cleaned up acid rain and reduced it. The reduction in CO2emissions around the globe and around America have come as a result of fossil fuel research. On a per capita basis today, we are now emitting—on a per capita basis, this is the lowest level of CO2 emissions we have had in over 50 years, thanks to fossil fuel research. And the shale gas revolution that made America the biggest producer of gas in the world, it originated in our Federal laboratories in research. That is just part of where we have been. Now go into the future. Someone said this is a fuel of the past. How can it be when the R&D money—look what they are working on in our labs all across America, virtually in every one of our districts across this country. We are doing a carbon capture, utilization, and storage. We are doing chemical looping. They are studying and understanding methane hydrates. You talked earlier about rare earth elements are being detected now in coal seams all across America. What about oxycombustion? All of that is coming out of current research, fresh research that we will be able to export around the world so that other countries will be able to burn their coal more cleanly. So, look, Congress should not be in the way, picking winners or losers, and it shouldn’t jeopardize the work of our laboratories. If we are serious about reducing emissions, Congress should be putting more money into this program, not reducing it. In an ideal world, the funding level for R&D should be much higher. As I said, under President Bush it was $300 million more than it is today. But I understand the fiscal constraints we have. So let’s utilize our domestic energy source, energy supply in the most efficient and clean way possible. We do that through our research from our Federal laboratories. Mr. Chairman, I urge the House to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. I respect Congressman MCKINLEY ’s amendment and his desire to help America and help his own State. And for my entire career, I have voted for clean coal research and development because southern Ohio has a whole lot of Btus underground in the form of coal. However, I really object to the gentleman taking the funds from the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy account. I would like you to know that that account, in this bill, is cut $986 million below last year’s level, and that is a deep concern because that is the part of our economy that is growing. Ten percent of the jobs produced in the energy sector are in renewables, and we actually employ more people in solar and in wind energy than we do in coal extraction. So we know that a major part of our future lies in new energy technologies, these developing 
technologies which have been proving themselves. An additional cut of $33.4 million in the EERE account would further weaken these new technologies. And I will guarantee you that the technologies are so valuable that the Russians and the Chinese are hacking into these companies repeatedly because of their importance to the future, and they recognize where the future is headed. And we have got a real job on our hands to hold on to these technologies because of that and because of their market manipulation. China is a great market manipulator. She has a staterun economy, and it is not fair. If they can’t steal the technology directly—if you invest over there and you take your technology there, they steal your IT there. b2100 So just since 2003, our country has spent $2.6 trillion importing foreign petroleum. When you think about the importance of America being energy independent here at home, coal, clean coal, has a role to play in that, but these new technologies have a major role to play as well. We all support a diverse energy portfolio to eliminate our reliance on imported energy—some would say addiction to imported energy. We have been breaking that addiction. We should be advancing technology to clean up fossil energy, yes, and this bill already does that with sufficient funding to the fossil energy accounts. Our country should be leading investment in these technologies, not just for our own energy security, but also for economic opportunities and the jobs that this expanding market is already providing us. We can’t really afford to cede this market to any other country in the world, and I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, let me just close quickly by saying we are not talking about West Virginia. We are talking about all across the country. These laboratories are located in colleges and universities all across America. Coal is something that is expanding. Our exports are up 58 percent. People around the world are going to use coal. I think it is the responsibility for us to show them how to burn it cleanly. China is going to increase their use by 43 percent. India is going to double its consumption in that same timeframe. When you compare the amount of research, only 18 percent currently of all the Federal dollars for research is in fossil fuel, but 56 percent is in renewable. That is not balanced. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. WEBER of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. DONOVAN , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3219, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES Mr. SESSIONS, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–261) on the resolution (H. Res. 478) providing for further consideration of the bill (H.R. 3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, and providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 473 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 3219. Will the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) kindly resume the chair. b2104 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, with Mr. DONOVAN  (Acting Chair) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, amendment No. 42 printed in House Report 115–259, offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ) had been disposed of. 
AMENDMENT NO . 43 OFFERED BY MR . PERRY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 43 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $15,000,000)’’. Page 296, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $15,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking the chairman of the full committee for his extraordinary work and for the chairman of the subcommittee for this auspicious opportunity. I have been listening to the arguments recently that we have had on the floor regarding the most recent amendments between fossil fuels and renewables, and I am hoping to strike a sweet spot here. I am not picking on fossil fuels, and I am going to talk about a renewable that I think everybody has an affinity for and an agreement with. This amendment simply increases funding for hydroelectric through the EERE by $15 million and decreases funding to the bureaucracy. There is no increase to the budget. This amendment just increases the appropriation for the Office of Energy and Efficiency and Renewable Energy because hydropower is available in every region of the country; 2,200 hydropower plants provide America’s most abundant source of clean, renewable electricity. I would say it is the first renewable. It accounts for 67 percent of domestic renewable generation and, clearly, 7 percent of total electricity generation. By 2025, hydropower would create almost a million and a half new, good, highpaying jobs. It can be implemented in rivers, harbors, coastal areas, et cetera, to capture energy from currents and tides. Harnessing this energy will create a truly and absolutely renewable and green source of energy without any emissions and with little fanfare to everybody involved. Hydro is predictable yearround power output, while other renewable source outputs can be variable in some areas and necessitate the use of large battery banks and alternate power sources. For instance, sometimes when the wind doesn’t blow, believe it or not, if you don’t know it, there is a gas fired generator often associated with those windmill farms that has to come on because base load isn’t being serviced. Hydropower facilities are quiet, unobtrusive, while many people report that considerable noise is generated by wind power and that land is taken up by huge solar farms. Hydropower is base load energy. That means it is on all the time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, just sitting there turning out the power so that you can hit the light switch when you come home and not wonder: Is the power going to be on? It backs up other intermittent sources of energy. 
Hydropower is safe. It harms neither fish nor man. It all faces a comprehensive and regular regulatory approval process. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of Mr. PERRY ’s amendment and the power and potential of clean marine hydrokinetic energy, and I first want to thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member KAPTUR for their leadership in supporting the Water Power Technologies Office. The Water Power Technologies Office invests in research and development that supports hydropower, pumped storage, and marine energy. Furthermore, I want to thank the chair and ranking member for including $30 million in the 2017 omnibus for the creation of a wave energy test center, which is now located at Oregon State University. This robust investment will help the United States lead in the field of marine hydrokinetic energy. The increase this amendment proposes will support hydropower and the development of innovative hydropower technologies, along with marine and hydrokinetic energy technologies. Development of these new technologies can offer the United States leadership in an emerging area of abundant renewable energy. Marine and hydrokinetic energy, in particular, energy from waves, currents, and tides, is an exciting frontier in the renewable energy sector. Currently, Oregon State University, University of Washington, and the University of Alaska Fairbanks are partnering to support the testing and research activities of the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center. This center will provide visionary entrepreneurs with a domestic location to test wave energy devices, along with other technologies, rather than traveling to Scotland to use the European test center. Without continued Federal investment, Europe will remain the leader in this important work. When fully developed, wave and tidal energy systems could generate a significant amount of total energy used in the United States. As Congress promotes technologies that can help lower our constituents’ energy bills, we must explore new and innovative solutions like marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. Thank you again to the chairman and ranking member for their hard work and legislative leadership on this issue, and thank you to Representative PERRY for his leadership. Mr. Chair, I urge support for this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, a lot of what we hear is is that our constituents wish that we would work together more often, and I thank the gentlewoman for her comments and her support; and I think it is just proof that we can work together for something that we agree on, which is clean power, the power to just power our future, and that comes from hydroelectricity. I don’t know why it is not as sexy as it should be. I think it is one of the greatest marvels of technology starting back since the beginning of time and when power was first generated, and I don’t understand why we don’t rely on it more. To that end, literally 60,000 megawatts of preliminary permits and projects await final approval and are pending before FERC in 45 States right now. Eighty thousand—80,000—nonpowered dams in the United States, of which 600 have immediate hydro capability, right now could be producing energy. Mr. Chair, 80,000 nonpowered dams in the United States, just think about that. And the State I hail from and I am privileged to represent a portion of, Pennsylvania, has 678 megawatts of untapped hydropower right now. Mr. Chairman, I would just urge all of our colleagues to vote for this amendment. I, again, appreciate the chairmen of the committee and of the subcommittee for this opportunity, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the remaining time, please. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 21⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. BONAMICI. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ), a strong supporter of hydropower. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much to my colleague from Oregon for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, I, too, want to rise in support, today, of the Perry amendment. I thank my colleague from Oregon and my colleague from Pennsylvania for their leadership on this important renewable energy issue. I also want to thank the chair of the subcommittee, Mr. SIMPSON , whom I am fortunate to also serve on the Interior Committee with. Mr. SIMPSON has worked hard on this bill to increase some of the levels of funding above the abysmal levels that were proposed by the administration’s budget earlier this year. And also, to our ranking member, Ms. KAPTUR , my friend from Ohio, I thank her for her commitment to renewable energy and our energy future. The amendment before us today would provide a modest increase in funding to the Department of Energy’s Water Power Program. It is a bipartisan effort, and I am pleased to be part of that. It comes from the fact that many parts of the country are seeking the real benefits of tidal energy that generates incredible power, or of hydrokinetic power that taps the power of flowing water. In response to my colleague from Pennsylvania, in Maine, we think tidal energy is very sexy. The Department of Energy supports private sector research, development, and implementation of hydropower, pumped storage, and marine tidal energy. It supports cuttingedge research and makes sure that the office supports all three types of waterbased technologies. Last year, nearly 100 teams competed in a competition for an Energy Departmentfunded wave energy prize, with 20 finalists coming from 10 States, showing the breadth of interest in this work. Congress needs to support multifaceted work at a level that will continue to allow for innovation. Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to support renewable energy, support water power, and support the Perry amendment. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment and encourage all of you to do the same. As the sponsor of the amendment explained, this does not take additional money, cuts down on bureaucracy, and puts the dollars into important work, like marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. Mr. Chairman, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ). The amendment was agreed to. b2115 
AMENDMENT NO . 44 OFFERED BY MS . ESTY OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 44 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $20,000,000)’’. Page 288, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $40,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to increase funding for the Advanced Manufacturing Office by $20 million. I want to thank my colleagues, Representative TOMREED, JOHN KATKO , and JACKY ROSEN for their partnership in this bipartisan amendment. Our amendment is about protecting and creating millions of goodpaying 
jobs in Connecticut and across the country. Our amendment will help us ensure that the technologically advanced products of the future will be manufactured, not in China, not in India, but right here in the United States of America. The Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office is the only technology development office within the Federal Government that is dedicated to enhancing American manufacturing competitiveness. The Advanced Manufacturing Office works to help manufacturers improve energy and material efficiency, technology, and productivity. Unfortunately, the appropriations bill before us today cuts funding to the Advanced Manufacturing Office by $155.5 million from fiscal year 2017 enacted levels, and that is a mistake. Manufacturing is one of the most important sectors of the U.S. economy. In 2016, manufacturing contributed $2.18 trillion to our economy and employed 12.3 million workers. In my home State of Connecticut, manufacturing has long been our economic backbone. Connecticut is home to nearly 5,000 manufacturing companies that provide goodpaying jobs for 76,000 Connecticut residents. This amendment helps American manufacturers all across the country to be more competitive by reducing energy costs. Manufacturing is very energy intensive. In fact, according to the National Association of Manufacturers, manufacturers consume more than 30 percent of our Nation’s energy. That translates to $130 billion in costs to U.S. manufacturers every year. Adequately funding the Advanced Manufacturing Office, will help reduce energy costs to manufacturers, freeing up their budgets to invest in research and development, expand their facilities, and, most importantly, hire more people. Our amendment also helps American manufacturers become more competitive by addressing critical workforce needs in energy efficiency. Last year, I visited Forum Plastics, a plastic molding company based in Waterbury, Connecticut. I met with employees to discuss the expectations and challenges facing manufacturers in America today, and one of the topics that came up was how businesses struggle to hire workers with the right skills. Yet, that same year, Forum Plastics partnered with the Advanced Manufacturing Office to carry out an industrial assessment project. The Industrial Assessment Centers program is a tool for employers to recruit individuals with handson experience in energy efficiency. Mr. Chairman, now is not the time to roll back investments in American manufacturing. It is the time to increase our support for U.S. manufacturing. I know all of us in this Chamber are committed to promoting good paying jobs in the communities we represent, but it is not enough to say we are committed. We need to make job creation a priority, and that means making American manufacturing a priority. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment which increases funding to the Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office by $20 million, fully paid for by a reduction in the more than $350 million plusup to funding for the Office of Fossil Energy Research & Development. This bipartisan amendment is a win for American manufacturing and a win for our economy. I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, first, let me say, it was not a $300someoddmillion plusup in the fossil energy research. In fact, I think the fossil energy research account was down from last year. It was more than the President requested, but it is not a plusup from what it was in 2017. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The amendment would increase funding for the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy by $20 million but has to use $40 million from the Fossil Energy Research & Development account as an offset. This bill was the result of some tough choices. I have to admit, they were some tough choices. It is not that I oppose the program that the good lady advocates for, but there were some tough choices. We had to prioritize research and development that will increase our energy independence. Our domestic energy resources are vast, and this bill strikes a balance to lay the foundations for future energy generation technologies, while maintaining full support for the resources we use most today. Increasing funding for EERE by diverting funding from fossil energy strikes the wrong balance when considering the Nation’s electricity needs. Fossil fuels produce 65 percent of the electricity we use today and will continue to provide the majority of the Nation’s energy needs in the future. This amendment would reduce funding for a program that ensures that we use our Nation’s fossil fuel resources as well, and as cleanly as possible. For all of the reasons that team fossil talked about earlier tonight, I must oppose the amendment and urge my Members to do the same. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 30 seconds remaining. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to support this. If we can help our manufacturers be more efficient in their use of energy, we can help them be more competitive, hire more people, and develop that clean energy technology for coal. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut will be postponed. The Chair understands that amendment No. 46 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO . 49 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 49 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 296, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, in these difficult times, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member, Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member KAPTUR of the subcommittee, for shepherding this legislation to the floor, and for their efforts, and the commitment that we all have to preserving America’s great natural environment and resources so that they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come. My amendment increases funding for the DOE departmental administration by $1 million, which should be used to enhance the Department’s Environmental Justice program activities. The Environmental Justice program is an essential tool in the effort to improve the lives of lowincome and minority communities, as well as the environment at large. Twenty years ago, this particular program was established directing Federal agencies to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their actions on minority and lowincome populations. So we have engaged with Historically Black Colleges, minorityserving institutions, Tribal colleges, and other organizations to improve and develop the sustainability through developing 
young people and faculty to work on these important issues. The crisis in Flint, Michigan, teaches us how important it is that minority groups and lowincome communities are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to environmental threats and hazards like lead in drinking water or nesting areas for mosquitos carrying the Zika virus. I particularly remember convening a Zika task force in Houston to ensure that areas in my community, because of the sitting water and a lot of heat, did not breed these mosquitos to create a devastating condition in some of our communities. This Environmental Justice program is extremely important, involving community education and advisory projects, community capacity building through technology, the Community Leaders Institute, but, more importantly, it works on important research. Mr. Chair, might I find out how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I want to make note of the fact that in some of the universities that participate in this program, the chairs— meaning the faculty chairs—are a team of worldclass scholars, researchers, and educators from 14 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, one Hispanicserving institution, who advance research, enhance academics, promote partnerships, and effect outreach in the environmental sciences. Finally, the Minority Serving Institutions Program that includes a wide array of institutions provides funding to minorityserving institutions to advance scientific research, student internships, faculty fellowships, and curriculum development. Mr. Chair, the more we can invest in science and research, helping to improve our environment—and let me make it very clear, in urban and rural areas. This is not an urban program only. It is urban and rural areas. The more we can help our communities be clean and environmentally safe and secure, the more we create a better quality of life for all people, no matter what their economic station in life or where they live. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member K APTUR for shep herding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment to preserving America’s great natural environment and resources so that they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come. My amendment increases funding for DOE departmental administration by $1,000,000 which should be used to enhance the Department’s Environmental Justice program activities. Mr. Chair, the Environmental Justice Program is an essential tool in the effort to improve the lives of low income and minority communities as well as the environment at large. Twenty years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their actions on minority and lowincome populations. A healthy environment sustains a productive and healthy community which fosters personal and economic growth. Maintaining funds for environmental justice that go to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges, and other organizations is imperative to protecting sustainability and growth of the community and environment. The funding of these programs is vital to ensuring that minority groups are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the environment and the continued preservation of their homes. The crisis in Flint, Michigan teaches us how important it that minority groups and lowincome communities are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to environment threats and hazards like lead in drinking water or nesting areas for mosquitos carrying the Zika virus. Through education about the importance of environmental sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and how citizens can improve their surroundings. Funds that would be awarded to this important cause would increase youth involvement in STEM fields and also promote clean energy, weatherization, cleanup, and asset revitalization. These improvements would provide protection to our most vulnerable groups. This program provides better access to technology for underserved communities. Together, the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture have distributed over 5,000 computers to low income populations. The Community Leaders Institute is another vital component of the Environmental Justice Program. It ensures that those in leadership positions understand what is happening in their communities and can therefore make informed decisions in regards to their communities. In addition to promoting environmental sustainability, CLI also brings important factors including public health and economic development into the discussion for community leaders. The CLI program has been expanded to better serve Native Americans and Alaska Natives, which is a prime example of how various other minority groups can be assisted as well. Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also benefitted by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management, and other related subjects. The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority institutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The DOE also works to increase low income and minority access to STEM fields and help students attain graduate degrees as well as find employment. Since 2002, the Tribal Energy Program has also funded 175 energy projects amounting to over $41.8 million in order to help tribes invest in renewable sources of energy. With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can provide clean energy options to our most underserved communities and help improve their environments, which will yield better health outcomes and greater public awareness. We must help our low income and minority communities and ensure equality for those who are most vulnerable in our country. I ask my colleagues to join me and support the Jackson Lee Amendment for the Environmental Justice Program. Mr. Chair, I ask my friends and my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 50 OFFERED BY MS . MICHELLE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 50 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $98,000,000) (increased by $98,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN  GRISHAM ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, my amendment ensures that NNSA has adequate work space to fulfil its national security mission. In my home State of New Mexico, over 1,000 Federal and contract employees at NNSA currently work in a network of old and rapidly deteriorating facilities on Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. A portion of the existing facility includes a 60yearold former military barracks, which creates a number of health, safety, and qualityoflife issues for its employees. These employees are involved in some of our Nation’s most important national security work, including managing our Nation’s nuclear deterrent and reducing global nuclear and radiological threats. The NNSA administrator, Lieutenant General Klotz, said that: 
The highly talented employees in Albuquerque are frankly forced to work in facilities that are inadequate to NNSA’s current mission. 
Furthermore, because of the age of the buildings, NNSA is forced to spend approximately $6 million every year on maintenance and repairs just to keep them habitable. In fact, the $40 million worth of deferred maintenance alone on the old buildings is approximately onefifth of what it would cost to build a new, modern, and reliable facility. So this is a perfect opportunity to save money in the long run. I strongly support NNSA’s efforts to replace the existing complex with a single new building that will provide 
safe, reliable, and sustainable infrastructure that improves the safety and working environment for approximately 1,200 employees. The new stateoftheart facility will meet enhanced environmental standards and consolidate staff for a more efficient delivery and support of the important national security work at NNSA. b2130 The current total project cost is $202 million, and I agree with Chairman SIMPSON that we have an obligation to ensure that every single taxpayer dollar for this project is used efficiently and effectively. I know that the chairman shares my concerns to ensure that NNSA has the infrastructure and resources it needs to fulfill its national security mission now and in the future. That is why I am pleased that he has agreed to work with me on this issue to ensure that we are fulfilling our oversight responsibilities while moving the construction of the Albuquerque complex project forward. With that, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentlewoman’s concern and thank her for her advocacy for this project. The committee has been supportive of this project and has provided $42 million in prior years. The bill includes an additional $18 million to ensure that the project moves forward, and I am happy to work with her as the project advances and understand this amendment will be withdrawn, and I appreciate that. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman’s words and respect his work prior to this and in this current effort to get this space and the facility infrastructure issues addressed. I look forward to working with him on a variety of ideas to make sure that we get this project completed in a timely and effective manner. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. 
AMENDMENT NO . 51 OFFERED BY MR . FOSTER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 51 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $10,000,000) (increased by $10,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a symbolic adjustment to the NNSA budget intended to raise awareness about two areas of emerging national security risk that I believe deserve more attention and investment. As the only Ph.D. physicist in Congress, I feel a special responsibility to speak out on issues of national security, especially when they concern emerging technological threats that Congress may not be sufficiently aware of. Any student of the history of warfare is well aware of the dangers of fighting the last war, and for more than 70 years, nuclear weapons have held center stage among threats to our national security and global safety because of their unique capabilities to threaten the existence of mankind. That threat remains, but I fear that the balance of our defensive investments do not adequately reflect emerging threats. We now appear to be in the process of deciding to spend over $1 trillion to upgrade our nuclear weapons despite the fact that our existing systems are far more sufficient to deter any rational actor. There is no adversary of ours who is not intimidated by our nuclear arsenal but who will suddenly fall in line if we add just one more upgrade or additional weapons manufacturing capability. Put simply, another generation of nuclear weapons will not make us significantly safer. On the other hand, we live in a world where newly emerging and potentially equally great threats loom: first, bioterror, driven by recent breakthroughs in genetic engineering and offtheshelf biotechnology; and, second, lethal autonomous weapons systems driven by recent breakthroughs in machine vision, facial recognition, and artificial intelligence. These are small, inexpensive lethal drones and similar devices that use machine vision and artificial intelligence to target individuals or groups of humans, potentially without any human involvement in the kill decision. For those of my colleagues unfamiliar with these technologies, perform an internet search for the term ‘‘lethal autonomous weapons systems,’’ sometimes abbreviated ‘‘LAWS’’; or read the recent press coverage of the ab initio synthesis of the horsepox virus, a close variant of the smallpox virus that killed millions; then search for the term ‘‘biohacking.’’ For more detailed information, I urge my colleagues to request a classified or unclassified briefing on recent studies of these subjects by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Both of these technologies pose unique threats to our national security for two reasons: The first is because of the small physical footprint of a terror facility based on either of these technologies. Either a bioterror laboratory or a small shop to produce and program small lethal drones could easily fit in a basement or small apartment. There is no radiological signature to detect them as there is with nuclear material. The second is because of the low cost and general availability of key enabling technological components. The monetary investment necessary for a capable terror facility is in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps less. The relevant technologies are already in wide use in industry. Contrast this with the threats of nuclear proliferation, where the multibilliondollar investment to enrich and separate nuclear fissile material pretty much limits nuclear weapons either to established nationstates or perhaps terrorist organizations with access to fissile material from poorly guarded facilities. Anyone who is unconvinced that we need to take these emerging threats seriously needs only to look at what happened in cybersecurity. One of the painful lessons we have learned in recent years is that everything evil that can be done with computer viruses has, in fact, been done. In large part, this is because of the low barriers to entry and the difficulty of attributing an attack. Both of these features are shared fully by both bioterror and lethal autonomous weapons systems. So if we are going to stay ahead of these threats, we need to be strategic about our investments. It is time to reconsider the wisdom of pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into Cold War weapons which contribute negligibly to our national security and past time to consider a much more rapid increase in investments in defensive measures against lethal autonomous weapons systems and against bioterror, because by the time they become a reality, it will be too late to react. As a leader in technology and innovation, the United States should act now to circumvent any danger these technologies could pose. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentleman’s concern on this issue and appreciate the fact that 
he brought it up for discussion here tonight. I would note that the weapons activities accounts provides funding to ensure the reliability of our Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile. The NNSA does not use funds within this account to counter proliferation of biological weapons, although I understand it is an important issue, and I agree with them we need to address this issue. However, this amendment increases and decreases the same account and has no effect on the bill overall, so I will accept the gentleman’s amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to take the time to educate themselves about these emerging threats. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 52 OFFERED BY MR . GARAMENDI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 52 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(reduced by $118,017,000)’’. Page 298, line 11, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(increased by $118,017,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I think we ought to be on a roll here, given the last amendment being accepted on a ‘‘yes’’ vote. This amendment would make America more secure by focusing our very limited tax dollars on programs to keep nuclear material out of the hands of terrorists rather than excess national laboratory infrastructure spending. According to The Washington Post, the world dodged a bullet when ISIS failed to realize that it had the ingredients for a dirty bomb under its control in Mosul for more than 3 years. This underscores the importance of the need for U.S. leadership and resources to secure nuclear material around the world. My amendment would provide an increase of $118 million for the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, DNN, funding. DNN funding includes critical programs such as the nuclear smuggling and detection program, which works with partner countries to improve intelligence, law enforcement, and border security capabilities to detect nuclear material trafficking. It also supports programs to improve the security of radiological material around the world and to remove it from areas when nuclear materials cannot be adequately and safely secured. The Make America Secure Appropriations Act makes significant cuts to these programs which keep nuclear material out of the hands of terrorists and those who would then use that material to do us harm. For example, there is a 30 percent cut from the nuclear smuggling detection funding, a 79 percent cut from the highly enriched uranium reduction programs, and, overall, a $150 million cut to this program. At the same time, the underlying legislation would increase by 38 percent, a plusup above what the administration recommended for the weapons activities infrastructure recapitalization budget line. This increase was not requested by the administration and is not supported by the Senate. The underlying bill already includes a $59 million increase in infrastructure recapitalization spending and a $71 million increase over the fiscal year 2017enacted level for maintenance and repair facilities. We can go on and on. We have heard discussions here already about the trilliondollarplus expansion of the nuclear weapons programs. Specifically, this money that I would move out of this particular infrastructure recapitalization account is for the construction of a new facility to build nuclear plutonium pits. These pits are presumably going to be needed for a weapon that is almost certainly not going to be built, which is the interoperable new bomb. The interoperable weapon is to go on existing and remodeled rockets for the Navy and for the Air Force, neither of whom thinks it is a particularly good idea. So that program, should it ever come to pass, could be delayed, and we could then use this $118 million now to deal with a known problem. If, in the future, we decide that we need to be able to produce somewhere between 30 and 80 new pits a year, there is time enough to do that. The account that calls for the maintenance of the existing facilities will provide sufficient funds to meet all of the known needs, with the exception of the interoperable nuclear weapon, which, in all probability, is not ever going to be built or needed. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, although I am opposed to the amendment, I have to admit that I do enjoy our annual discussion on this. I oppose this amendment because the bill already shows strong support for the nonproliferation programs of the NNSA. Funding for nuclear defense nonproliferation is $1.83 billion—$76.5 million below fiscal year 2017 and $16.8 million below the budget request. Within nonproliferation, the bill largely supports funding as requested, but makes a limited number of realignments within the account to emphasize the importance of nonproliferation research and development activities and to meet international commitments for plutonium disposition. Our understanding—and this is the important point. Our understanding is that budget request is down because NNSA still has significant unexpended balances in this account due to slow progress on international nonproliferation agreements. Specifically, the NNSA reported in May that it had approximately $2.2 billion in funds available to carry out its nonproliferation mission, of which over $680 million is left over from prior years. For years, NNSA has struggled to execute funding in its nonproliferation budget because it could not obtain agreement from other nations to do the work as quickly as planned or as we would maybe like to. This amendment also targets funding from the weapons activities infrastructure recapitalization program. Created in fiscal year 2014 by Congress, the recapitalization program has been highly successful in addressing the aging and deteriorating infrastructure at NNSA sites. Replacing things like telephone poles, leaking fireman valves, roofing, and addressing other basic infrastructure needs are essential to the safe and continued operation of these nuclear security sites. The budget request proposed to cut the program, and the bill increases funding $118 million above the request to restore that program to the fiscal year 2017 level. We should not divert funding needed to address these urgent infrastructure needs, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. GARAMENDI. That might be sufficient, Mr. Chairman, although I doubt I will persuade the worthy chairman with whom we have had this little tussle back and forth. The fact of the matter is that there are two accounts to deal with this issue of the nuclear sites and the maintenance of them. b2145 One is a maintenance facility, which is plussedup and sufficient to maintain and upgrade the existing facilities, particularly the plutonium pit, the metallurgical facility, as well as continue the construction of the highly enriched uranium facilities. 
Those are already available and that money is in those accounts. It turns out that this money for recapitalization is for the construction of a new pit production facility. The NNSA claims that it needs that facility to build additional pits beyond the 20 to 30 that could be constructed in the refurbished existing pit. The need for the new pit production facility is specifically for the interoperable nuclear warhead, which is not likely to be needed. And should it be decided at a future date to be needed, there is plenty of time to build the facility and construct the additional nuclear plutonium pits. The bottom line is that this money is not needed now for that facility. Could the money be used in the nonproliferation? It could. Why were those agreements delayed? Because of many different reasons, but the fact of the matter is that those agreements are going to be going forward. The fact of the matter is that there is a continuing problem of loose nukes and materials around the world, which can cause a problem. The Mosul situation is one of many examples. The cuts that do take place in smuggling, in research, and the like are serious. We ought to be paying attention. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the continuation of this discussion, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I would just say that this infrastructure need is not for a new pit facility. They would need to come to us and ask us what they were going to do with funding, and request funding for that. They did not do that. This is for infrastructure needs and upgrades. But the other thing is that I am as much a nonproliferation activist as anyone in this body. I think it is important work. But the reality is that there are $681 million unexpended from previous years, not because funding is not available—the money is there—but they haven’t been able to get agreements with other countries. Unfortunately, you can’t do work in other countries without having agreements with those countries. So, consequently, we are—I guess you could maybe say—overfunded in nonproliferation if we can’t spend the money on that activity. That is the problem. Why would we put the money into that when we need the money in infrastructure and building and repairing the buildings and facilities that NNSA has? It just doesn’t make any sense to me. I am sure if this amendment is defeated, we will have this discussion next year, and I hope my colleagues will vote against this. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 53 OFFERED BY MS . ROSEN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 53 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 301, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $30,000,000)’’. Page 326, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $30,000,000)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. ROSEN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Nevada. Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to strip funding for defense nuclear waste disposal and return this money to the Treasury in order to reduce the deficit. The $30 million allocated under the appropriations bill being considered here tonight has the potential to be used to expand Yucca Mountain so that it can be used to store defense waste, in addition to civilian nuclear waste. If there is one issue a majority of Nevadans agree on, it is that we wholeheartedly oppose becoming the Nation’s dumping ground for radioactive waste. First, for my nonNevada friends, some history. In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and targeted Yucca Mountain, located less than 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, as the sole site for our Nation’s geological repository. It is a fancy way of choosing Nevada as their nuclear dump. For over 30 years, the State of Nevada and local communities have rejected this misguided project on safety, public health, and environmental grounds. In fact, we have filed 218 contentions against the Department of Energy’s license application, citing safety and environmental issues in its assessments. Numerous scientific studies have deemed Yucca Mountain unsafe based on the fact that it sits above an aquifer and is in a seismically active area that just experienced a 4.1 magnitude earthquake. Any plans involving Yucca Mountain, including the recently introduced Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Acts, or any proposed plans to comingle defense and civilian nuclear waste at Yucca, ignore the environmental, safety, and security concerns of Nevadans who would be forced to store nuclear waste that they had no role in creating. Using Yucca Mountain as the Nation’s dumping ground would require transporting over 70,000 metric tons of radioactive waste, much of it through my district and through the heart of Las Vegas, a city that attracts over 43 million visitors annually and generates over $59 billion in revenue. Not only does this project endanger those in Nevada, Mr. Chairman, it also threatens the health and safety of millions of Americans from over 329 congressional districts across this country who live along the proposed transportation route. As if this wasn’t bad enough, now the Nation’s most egregious nuclear waste producers and even some of my colleagues across the aisle are suggesting that we comingle defense waste with civilian waste from power plants, inappropriately increasing the amount of highlevel radioactive material dumped in Nevada by 37 percent. This means more nuclear material coming to Yucca, and more waste traveling through 44 States and Washington, D.C. There are also concerns that this will hinder the Air Force’s readiness and our country’s ability to defend itself. Last week, the Las Vegas ReviewJournal ran a story featuring Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force, and her concerns with the Yucca Mountain project. She cited how it will directly impact Nellis Air Force Base’s ability to complete its mission to train servicemembers for war, because there is no route across the range that would not impact testing and training. Her concerns, unfortunately, are not new. Since 2003, the Air Force has consistently stated that they know of no route through the Nevada Test and Training Range that would avoid sensitive areas or not negatively impact readiness activities. I understand that our country’s nuclear waste must go somewhere, but this decadesold battle has proven that Yucca is not the place. We must stop wasting billions of taxpayer dollars by resurrecting a project that has been dead for over 30 years, and, instead, identify viable alternatives for the longterm repository in areas that are proven safe and whose communities consent to storage. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment, with the understanding that we will begin a serious discussion on how to properly handle our country’s waste, instead of continuing down the path of forcing this waste on my State. I fully understand we have to put our country’s defense and civilian waste somewhere. But for the first time, let’s bring Nevadans to the table and let’s share the responsibility of facing the consequences of nuclear production. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time and withdraw my amendment. 
AMENDMENT NO . 54 OFFERED BY MS . PINGREE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 54 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maine. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the PingreeCarbajal BonamiciLangevinLowenthal CicillineSchneiderBeyer amendment, which is widely supported. All of the cosponsors of this amendment care passionately about the need for ocean planning, and I commend the leadership of my colleagues on this issue each and every year that we fight this battle for sensible ocean policy. We need, as a Congress, to recognize the importance of our oceans and ocean planning. Ocean planning works, and is working already in New England, where we have a success story of fishermen, lobstermen, Native American Tribes, local communities, and other stakeholders developing voluntary regional ocean plans. I have heard from many of my constituents working in Maine’s island communities about the importance not only of ocean planning, but of eco based management of our oceans, a core part of moving forward to a 21st century fishery. Our fishery is changing, and coastal communities want to be attentive to changes in our ecosystems to resource development and other uses for our oceans. For example, our plan in New England ensures that there is advanced ecological data available to help decisionmakers, enhance ocean stakeholder engagement through the collection of stakeholderdriven information, and facilitates agency coordination. The language in today’s underlying bill would make it even more difficult for Federal agencies, State, and local communities to work together on the future of our ocean resources. For those of us representing coastal districts, this rider is a bad addition to the bill, and we need to strike it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ). Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support and as a proud cosponsor of this amendment. I do so in defense of one of our most magnificent natural resources: the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes contain a fifth of the world’s and 95 percent of our Nation’s surface water. The Lakes are an important asset to our economy and the quality of life of our Nation, and in my district in particular. The National Ocean Policy also helps protect the vitality of our Great Lakes ecosystem. However, section 505 of this bill will undermine our National Ocean Policy and the ability of agencies to coordinate with States, local governments, and other agencies to protect these beautiful waters. That is why I support striking section 505. We have a profound obligation to be responsible stewards of the environment and to pass on a clean, healthy, and dynamic environment for future generations. Mr. Chair, I support the Pingree amendment. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. While there may be instances—and I am sure there are—in which greater coordination would be helpful in ensuring our coastal resources are available for future generations, any such coordination must be done carefully to protect against Federal overreach. As we saw with the Obama administration’s WOTUS rule to redefine waters of the United States, thorough and strong Congressional oversight is needed to ensure that we protect private property rights. Unfortunately, the way the Obama administration developed the National Ocean Policy increased the opportunities for Federal overreach. The implementation plan is so broad and so sweeping that it may allow the Federal Government to affect agricultural practices, mining, energy producers, fishermen, and anyone else whose actions may have an impact on the oceans. The facts is that the previous administration did not work with Congress. This is their National Ocean Policy. They never brought it to Congress. If you are going to do something this sweeping, you need to have congressional input. They never came to Congress to develop its plan, and they had even refused to provide relevant information to Congress. So we can’t be sure how sweeping it actually could be if left unchecked. b2200 That is why I support the language of the underlying bill and, therefore, oppose this amendment. But I understand their concern. But why not bring it to Congress? Why not have Congress enact the National Ocean Policy instead of just relying on the executive branch to do whatever they want to do? That is the problem the Natural Resources Committee has with this. It is a problem I have with this, and that is why I oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, if my good colleague could guarantee me he could give me the votes on the floor, I would be happy to bring a bill like that forward to Congress. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL ). Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, my district is a poster child for the need for ocean coordination and information sharing. In my district, we have the busiest port complex in North America, we have offshore drilling, we have San Clemente Island, which is a naval training ground where they have a shiptoshore firing range. We have abundant wildlife in the district. On top of that, sea level rise and extreme weather threatens neighborhoods and businesses all along the coast of my district. With so much activity happening, it simply makes sense to have the various stakeholders at the table, to make sure ships come in and out of port safely, to ensure that our thriving economy stays thriving, and to give the military space to train. We want these collaborations to happen because we want to have a sustainable ocean economy. By developing regional plans and having a framework for multistakeholder involvement, we can promote a robust ocean economy that also conserves our precious ocean resources. The country and my district needs a comprehensive approach to our ocean resources, which the National Ocean Policy provides. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I will just say it is kind of interesting that I don’t disagree with anything Ms. PINGREE is saying. The problem is, there is a process, and Congress needs to be involved. The last administration did not involve Congress. If it is a good policy, why don’t we just let the administration do it? If you can’t get the votes on the floor, doesn’t that tell you something? Maybe you need to go and work this out and bring the policy to the floor. But if we are just going to let the administration do that, I don’t know, maybe we will let this administration just enact a tax policy because we have a tough time doing it here in Congress. I don’t know, maybe we will let them enact the healthcare policy because we can’t get together on the floor to see what to do about our healthcare system, so let’s just let the administration do it all. It is exactly what you are doing with this. You bring an actual ocean policy to the floor, if I think it is a good bill 
and necessary, I will vote for it. I can’t tell you what I will vote for yet because I haven’t seen it. But just because Congress hasn’t acted doesn’t give the administrative branch of government the right to interject itself and take on the legislative branch of government’s responsibility. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, with all due respect, I think there are frequently moments when the administration overrides the opinion of the Congress or don’t always agree and the administration gets their way. Take the decision the administration made this morning on military policy, which was contrary to the vote we took just this week on the appropriations process. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ). Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, I want to thank all of my colleagues for their leadership and work on this important amendment to strike this harmful rider, to prevent implementation of the National Ocean Policy. The National Ocean Policy ensures we are able to implement marine planning efforts based on management components of the National Ocean Policy. It also allows coordination between Federal agencies to make sure they are working in a collaborative manner to improve our ocean’s health. This brings all stakeholders together, including conservationists, fishermen, scientists, shipping companies, and those who live and work in our ocean communities, and it will allow them to have a voice in finding solutions for effective management of our oceans. Healthy sustainable ecosystems and economic growth are not mutually exclusive. That is why we need to make sure we strike this harmful rider. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman from Maine has expired. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I will just say, the usurpation by the administrative branch of government over Congress happens with both Republican and Democratic administrations. I remember someone standing up and saying: Well, if Congress won’t do it, I have a pen and a phone. This is Congress surrendering our responsibility, and even though you might like the outcome of what they do, it is the wrong thing to do, and Congress needs to stand up at times and take back our responsibility than just saying: Well, I don’t really like the way it was done, but I like the policy, so I will just support it. And that is what we are doing here. That is the problem with the National Ocean Policy. Again, I would encourage the supporters of this, and who knows, I might be one of them, to bring it to Congress. Let’s debate it. Let’s have a good healthy debate on this floor. Go through the committee process, go through the regular order, and then it is something that we might be able to support in the appropriations process. Other than that, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member LOWEY , I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentlewoman’s amendment to support the growth of vibrant coastal economies and creation of fisheries and agriculture jobs. The National Ocean Policy is helping agencies and States collaborate to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and one can just take a look that the ocean policy supports almost 2 million fisheriesrelated jobs in our country and $5.3 billion in commercial fish landings, as well as enhanced tourism, and the National Ocean Policy doesn’t cost us anything. I just want to remind people that our country currently imports 91 percent of consumed seafood, with half coming from foreign agriculture. So this policy is extraordinarily important. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ) for the purpose of entering into a colloquy. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I rise today to speak in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague, Congresswoman PINGREE , which would strike the harmful provision that undermines the importance of the National Ocean Policy. For over 7 years, the National Ocean Policy has helped guide ocean management through spurring coordination among government agencies. Ocean planning and coordination is an important aspect in supporting economic growth, protecting coastal habitats, and strengthening coastal communities. The National Ocean Policy does not create any regulations, supersede current regulations, or modify any agency’s established mission, jurisdiction, or authority. Rather, it helps coordinate the implementation of existing regulations by Federal agencies to establish a more efficient and effective decisionmaking process. Throughout the northeast, the Regional Ocean Council allows our States to pool resources and businesses to have a strong voice in decisions that will impact their communities and facilitate coordination with Federal partners. I am proud to say that the Northeast Regional Ocean Council is the first in the Nation to release a draft regional ocean plan. My home State of Rhode Island, the ocean State, has benefited greatly from the National Ocean Policy. With help from NOP, the Block Island Wind Farm project was successfully completed and today is capable of powering an estimated 17,000 homes. At a time when our oceans are facing significant challenges and changes, maintaining coordination and planning is necessary in continuing to strengthen our country’s coastal communities and ocean industries. Allowing Federal agencies to coordinate implementation of over 100 ocean laws and giving State and local governments a voice in the ocean planning process is smart policy, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and strike this illadvised provision. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ). Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, the establishment of a National Ocean Policy was a landmark step for our country. I particularly want to commend Senator SHELDON  WHITEHOUSE from Rhode Island for his leadership on this issue. Ocean planning just makes sense, as we have seen in Rhode Island during implementation of our Special Area Management Plan. Instead of haphazard policymaking or turning the ocean into a political football, we brought all stakeholders to the table, commercial and recreational fishermen, energy development companies, conservationists, and other local interests. The National Ocean Policy builds on this type of collaboration. It is a bottomup approach, and it empowers local communities who use our oceans. I want to echo the words also of my colleague, the Congressman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ), in support of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to allow this forwardthinking approach to continue. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman so much for coming to the floor tonight, and I want to thank all of our colleagues who have spoken out so eloquently on the importance of National Ocean Policy in supporting the Pingree, et al. amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Maine will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 55 OFFERED BY MR . KIHUEN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 55 printed in House Report 115–259. 
Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes language in the bill that would prohibit the closure of the Yucca Mountain project, which includes the storage of highlevel nuclear waste in my district. As you may know, in 1987, Nevada was targeted as our Nation’s nuclear waste dump through the ‘‘Screw Nevada’’ bill. In the 30 years since the bill passed, Congress has wasted $3.7 billion of taxpayer money. Yucca Mountain sits in a seismically active area less than 100 miles away from Las Vegas, which holds an urban area with over 2 million residents. Mr. Chairman, just last week, there was an earthquake 33 miles away from Yucca Mountain. This place is not safe for our nuclear waste. Moreover, the city sees tens of thousands of visitors traveling to Las Vegas each and every year, many of whom are your constituents from your districts. In 2016 alone, over 40 million visitors traveled to Las Vegas. I have grave concerns with the transportation of nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain should this project continue against the will of my constituents. This project will not just impact my constituents. It impacts constituents in 329 congressional districts in 44 different States and Washington, D.C. Putting a nuclear repository in our backyard means that this highlevel nuclear waste must travel through your backyards first. Your constituents will see highlevel nuclear waste transported through their communities on rail and truck. A simple car crash or train derailment would leave your constituents at risk and cost our taxpayers more money to clean up the mess. As it stands, Mr. Chairman, this transportation plan also damages our national security and the ability of the Nevada Test and Training Range, the largest air and ground range in the contiguous United States, to meet and train our servicemembers. b2215 Mr. Chairman, I have been to Yucca Mountain. I have driven through the desert that is home to the bighorn sheep and desert tortoises and ancient petroglyphs and relics of the westward expansion. It is clear that reopening Yucca Mountain threatens the health and safety of Nevadans and Americans from across the country. Our State, which has no nuclear energyproducing facilities, should not be the dumping ground for the rest of the country’s nuclear waste. And the bottom line is this: If any of my colleagues would support this bill to bring Yucca Mountain nuclear waste to our State, then I am sure you support bringing it to your State. I am sure we can find a location in your State, and I would love to work with you on that. I am sure you wouldn’t like your neighbors bringing their trash to your backyard. Don’t bring it to my backyard either. Don’t bring it to my constituents. Don’t bring it to Nevada. I urge your support for my amendment. Prevent billions and billions of dollars, taxpayer dollars, being wasted by continuing to pursue the Yucca Mountain project. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. WALKER ). The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I would tell the gentleman that they have brought a lot of nuclear waste to the State of Idaho. We process it there. It was Rocky Flats that was, they say, cleaned up. It wasn’t cleaned up; it was moved to Idaho because we got most of their stuff there. That is kind of what happens. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment. I think we all understand why my colleagues from Nevada oppose Yucca Mountain, their position on Yucca Mountain; however, I cannot support this amendment. It is time to move forward with the Yucca licensing process. The previous administration ignored the law. I repeat that—ignored the law. Ignoring our obligation to take responsibility for this spent fuel, and breaking trust with 32 States stopped this process in its tracks. I don’t think I have to state why that happened. It wasn’t because of science or anything else. We all know why they stopped the licensing process at Yucca Mountain. The decision has already cost taxpayers $6 billion in claims, and the Department of Energy estimates at least another $24 billion in claims. This administration has taken swift action to put us back on track, and the budget request proposed in this bill includes $150 million for Yucca licensing efforts. Licensing efforts will continue to involve experts in geochemistry, hydrology, geology, seismology, volcanology, and more to ensure that Yucca Mountain, already one of the most studied pieces of land on Earth— I would say the most studied piece of land on Earth. There were 52 or 53 National Academy of Sciences studies on Yucca Mountain that have been done. But it will get a careful review from all aspects of its license applications. Once that application is finished, all Members of this body and of the Senate will have the opportunity to decide whether we move forward to construct and use the facility. But killing the process at this point is shortsighted, and, therefore, I oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. ROSEN ), my esteemed colleague. Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Chairman, I want to echo the sentiments of my colleague from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) by making one thing perfectly clear: Nevadans are completely against becoming the Nation’s nuclear dumping ground. And make no mistake, that is exactly what this appropriations bill does. Without Mr. KIHUEN ’s amendment, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, Congress will tie the hands of this administration by explicitly prohibiting, even considering, closing Yucca Mountain or conducting a technical review before licensing activities begin. You heard that right. The underlying bill forbids any funds from being used to conduct activities that preclude Yucca Mountain from becoming the Nation’s dumping ground for radioactive waste, no matter the science, no matter the evidence. And we already have the evidence that bringing America’s nuclear waste to Yucca is bad for Nevadans and bad for Americans. We know that Yucca is unsafe for nuclear waste because it is seismically active and sits above an aquifer. And with 70,000 metric tons of radioactive waste through my district and through the heart of Las Vegas, those visitors from all across the country and the world will be exposed. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I would just say in response: Then change the law. The law is that Yucca Mountain is the waste repository for highlevel nuclear waste. All we are asking is to continue the licensing process. As I said during my opening statement, Congress will have a chance to vote on whether to proceed with the construction of this facility. That is the reality. But we have got to get off the dime and start moving and handling this nuclear waste or it is going to cost us billions and billions and billions more. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 56 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 56 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. 
At the end of division D, before the short title, insert the following: SEC. ll. The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are revised by reducing the amount made available for ‘‘Corps of EngineersCivil—Investigations’’, and increasing the amount made available for the same account, by $3,000,000. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am going to take this opportunity just to show this picture to my colleagues on the floor of the House and the headline that says: ‘‘Urban Flooding in Houston is on the Rise.’’ I clearly just used the city of Houston by coincidence, but I will tell you that this is what we are facing, really, across America. The opening sentence of the article says: ‘‘Before you can fix a problem, you need to know what’s causing it.’’ My amendment is just that. My amendment—as I thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member K APTUR  for their work on this legislation in doing the best that we can under the circumstances of trying to preserve the balance—speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ investigations account by redirecting $3 million for increased funding for postdisaster watershed assessment studies, like the one that has been contemplated in many areas around the country. As the Federal agency that collects and studies basic information pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed studies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor and flood and storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a critical role in building, maintaining, and expanding the most critical of the Nation’s infrastructure. When questioning the Army Corps of Engineers about a certain area in my community covering a number of bayous, which we are called The Bayou City—Sims Bayou, Greens Bayou, Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunting Bayou, and Clear Creek Bayou—it is the same all over the Nation: the Army Corps of Engineers said they need to study the issue to know how to best resolve it. My amendment is just that. It is resources to be directed to ensure that we are allowed to study issues so that we can focus the dollars correctly as we attempt to work collaboratively with our local communities. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I make this point: such a study is certainly needed, given the frequency and severity of historic level flood events in many parts around our Nation and in the area in which I live. On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in the Houston area over a 12hour period. Let me be very mindful, this is not an earmark. It simply says that we should have the resources to study these issues so that we can direct moneys in the right way. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 21⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me conclude my remarks by indicating that I believe this particular amendment will be helpful in general to, in essence, provide funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ investigations account and ensuring that a postdisaster watershed assessment can result. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Ms. KAPTUR in particular. We have spoken about this for probably over a 2year period. I think the very fact that my particular area can be cited as an example of what happens when you have urban flooding is just an example. Over this past summer, we know that we have had some serious loss of life when rivers have overflowed or areas where water is and people have been recreating have overflowed, and so the idea of saving lives is part of my amendment as well. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member K APTUR for shep herding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment to preserving America’s great natural environment and resources so that they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come. My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ‘‘Investigations’’ account by redirecting $3 million for increased funding for postdisaster watershed assessment studies, like the one that is being contemplated for the Houston/Harris County metropolitan area. As the federal agency that collects and studies basic information pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed studies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor, and flood and storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a critical role in the building, maintaining, and expanding of the most critical of the nation’s infrastructure. We understand this very well in my home state of Texas and the Eighteenth Congressional District that I represent. The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County Flood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within Harris County. Current projects include 6 federal flood risk management projects: Sims Bayou, Greens Bayou, Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunting Bayou, and Clear Creek. In addition to these ongoing projects, the Army Corps of Engineers operates and maintains the Addicks and Barker (A&B) Detention Dams in northwest Harris County. Mr. Chair, I am pleased that the bill provides that the Secretary of the Army may initiate up to six new study starts during fiscal year 2018, and that five of those studies are to consist of studies where the majority of the benefits are derived from flood and storm damage reduction or from navigation transportation savings. I am optimistic that one of those new study starts will be the Houston Regional Watershed Assessment Flood Risk Management Feasibility study. Such a study is certainly needed given the frequency and severity of historiclevel flood events in recent years in and around the Houston metropolitan area. On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in the Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas exceeding the 100 to 500 year flood event record. The areas that experience these historic rainfalls were west of I–45, north of I–10, and Greens Bayou. Additionally, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the Cypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours. The purpose of the Houston Regional Watershed Assessment is to identify risk reduction measures and optimize performance from a multiobjective systems performance perspective of the regional network of nested and intermingled watersheds, reservoir dams, flood flow conveyance channels, storm water detention basins, and related Flood Risk Management (FRM) infrastructure. Special emphases of the study, which covers 22 primary watersheds within Harris County’s 1,756 square miles, will be placed on extreme flood events that exceed the system capacity resulting in impacts to asset conditions/ functions and loss of life. Mr. Chair, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,015 homes were flooded and 8 persons died; during the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400 homes were flooded and 8 deaths recorded. The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at $3 billion; the 2016 estimate is being compiled and is estimated to be well above $2 billion. Mr. Chair, minimizing the risk of flood damage to the Houston and Harris County metropolitan area, the nation’s 4th largest, is a matter of national significance because the region is one of the nation’s major technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers: 1. Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world; 2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and treatment center; 3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank representation and second only to New York City as home to the most Fortune 500 companies; and 4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major Hurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast region. I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 56. I thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member KAPTUR for their work in shepherding this bill to the floor. 
[From the Houston Public Media] URBAN FLOODING IN HOUSTON ISO NT H E RISE (By Marissa Cummings) Before you can fix a problem, you need to know what’s causing it. 
Dr. Sam Brody, Professor at A&M Galveston, is doing exactly that. He focuses on urban flooding and says Houston is the poster child. ‘‘The bigger driver of this urban flood problem is human development, it’s the spread of impervious surfaces and I calculated the Houston region increased its pavement by 25 percent over a 15 year period from 1996 to 2010,’’ says Brody. He is also contributing to national research that will help alleviate urban flooding across the U.S. Stephen Costello, Houston’s Flood Czar, agrees with Brody’s assessment. Part of the solution he says is investing in innovative infrastructure. ‘‘But there has to be a commitment on the part of the community to invest in infrastructure,’’ Costello says. ‘‘And that’s what the voters should be looking at saying ‘OK, so let’s make sure we continue to invest in the infrastructure,’ and that’s where the public needs to get involved.’’ Although, we cannot stop flooding from happening, Costello says we need to mitigate and reduce the risk. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

AMENDMENT NO . 57 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON  
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. W ALKER ). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 57 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division D, before the short title, insert the following: SEC. ll. The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are revised by reducing the amount made available for ‘‘Corps of EngineersCivil—Construction’’, and increasing 
the amount made available for the same account, by $100,000,000. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I again thank the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee for this very critical work. My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ construction account by redirecting $100 million for increased funding for critical construction projects like those projects that are current and future projects throughout the Nation. As a Federal agency that collects and studies basic information pertaining to river and harbor, and flood and storm damage reduction, it is important that the Army Corps of Engineers and the construction unit have the funding to focus its resources around the Nation again. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a critical role in the building, maintaining, and expanding of the most critical of the Nation’s infrastructures. The Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee has an important responsibility, and it is to ensure the safety of the Nation’s waterways. Some of these waterways are in and around many of our States, particularly in the State of Texas. Not only do we have a concept of bayous, but, for example, we are surrounded in many parts by the Gulf. We have an enormous amount of water in rivers, and the Army Corps of Engineers is particularly important as it relates to flooding. But we have seen flooding across America. So this particular amendment is to ensure that resources are there as Americans face unusual flooding that has been occurring over the last decades. I will give you an example. During May 2015, in the Houston flood, 3,015 homes were flooded and eight people died. During the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400 homes were flooded and eight deaths were recorded. The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at $3 billion. I want my colleagues to know that this amendment is not for a region or an area. It is really to help the Nation. Mr. Chairman, I would like to conclude by simply thanking the committee and staff and, again, reminding individuals that we can save lives through the work of the Army Corps of Engineers in stopping flooding that impacts not only my region of the country, but really across the country. I conclude with one final statement: We in our community are entering hurricane season. This will be a very important amendment as we enter hurricane season all over the Nation. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member K APTUR for shep herding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment to preserving America’s great natural environment and resources so that they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come. My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ‘‘Construction’’ account by redirecting $100 million for increased funding for critical construction projects, like those current and future projects proposed for the Houston/Harris County metropolitan area. As the federal agency that collects and studies basic information pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed studies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor, and flood and storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer plays a critical role in the building, maintaining, and expanding the most critical of the nation’s infrastructure. We understand this very well in my home state of Texas and the Eighteenth Congressional District that I represent. The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County Flood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within Harris County. Current projects include 6 federal flood risk management projects: 1. Sims Bayou 2. Greens Bayou 3. Brays Bayou 4. White Oak Bayou 5. Hunting Bayou, and 6. Clear Creek. In addition to these ongoing projects, the Army Corps of Engineers operates and maintains the Addicks and Barker (A&B) Detention Dams in northwest Harris County. Such a study is certainly needed given the frequency and severity of historiclevel flood events in recent years in and around the Houston metropolitan area, it is clear that much more needs to be done to minimize the vulnerability of the nation’s 4th largest metropolitan area and economic engine from the flood damage. On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in the Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas exceeding the 100 to 500 year flood event record. The areas that experienced these historic rain falls were west of I–45, north of I–10, and Greens Bayou. Additionally, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the Cypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours. Mr. Chair, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,015 homes were flooded and 8 persons died; during the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400 homes were flooded and 8 deaths recorded. The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at $3 billion; the 2016 estimate is being compiled and is estimated to be well above $2 billion. Mr. Chair, minimizing the risk of flood damage to the Houston and Harris County metropolitan area, the nation’s 4th largest, is a matter of national significance because the region is one of the nation’s major technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers: 1. Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world; 2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and treatment center; 3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank representation and second only to New York City as home to the most Fortune 500 companies; and 4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major Hurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast region. I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 57. I thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member KAPTUR for their work in shepherding this bill to the floor. Mr. Chairman, I ask support for the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 58 OFFERED BY MS . JACKSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 58 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division D (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. ll. None of the funds made available by this Act for ‘‘Department of Energy—Energy Programs—Science’’ may be used in contravention of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a very simple amendment that promotes STEM education, which is really a vital part of the future of this Nation. In particular, my amendment says: ‘‘None of the funds made available by this act for ‘Department of Energy— Energy Programs—Science’ may be used in contravention of the Department of Energy Organization Act.’’ This amendment was approved and adopted just in the last session. Twenty years ago, on February 11, we were directed to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their actions on minority and low income populations. The Department of Energy ceased to provide equal access in these opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including minorities, Native Americans, and women. Mr. Chairman, women and minorities make up 70 percent of college students, but only 45 percent of undergraduates 
are STEM degree holders. This large pool of untapped talent is a great potential source of STEM professional, but it also deprives the United States of its best minds to be able to help it in the 21st century. As the Nation’s demographics are shifting and now more children under the age of 1 are minorities, it is critical that we close the gap in the number of minorities who seek system opportunities. Mr. Chairman, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to be solved. And perhaps one of these days, a minority engineer or biologist will come up with some of the solutions. As many have done in the past, the larger point is that we need more STEM educators and more minorities to qualify them. My amendment turns our importance to the importance of energy and science education programs, funded in part by this bill, and will help to ensure that members of unrepresented communities are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to environmental sustainability, preservation, and health. b2330 Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me take note of some of the colleagues that I have had the privilege of being neighbors to. NASA’s Johnson Space Center is, if I might say, one of the neighbors of my community, great respect for the astronauts; Major Bolden, who serves as head of NASA; and Mae Jemison is my neighbor, the first AfricanAmerican woman who went into space. I want more of those individuals coming from our Nation’s schools, and I ask my colleagues to support this amendment that will encourage those in low income communities and minorities, Native Americans, and others to join in and support the opportunities for STEM education. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman SIMPSON and Ranking Member K APTUR for shep herding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment to preserving America’s great natural environment and resources so that they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 58 simply provides that: ‘‘None of the funds made available by this Act for ‘Department of Energy—Energy Programs—Science’ be used in contravention of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.).’’ This amendment was approved and adopted in identical form on April 29, 2015, during the 114th Congress as an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Energy and Water Resources Appropriations Act of 2016. Mr. Chair, twenty years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their actions on minority and lowincome populations. The Department of Energy seeks to provide equal access in these opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including minorities, Native Americans, and women. Mr. Chair, women and minorities make up 70 percent of college students, but only 45 percent of undergraduate STEM degree holders. This large pool of untapped talent is a great potential source of STEM professionals. As the nation’s demographics are shifting and now most children under the age of one are minorities, it is critical that we close the gap in the number of minorities who seek STEM opportunities. I encourage Energy Secretary Perry to surpass the commitment of his predecessors’ toward increasing the nation’s economic competitiveness and enabling more of our people to realize their full potential. Mr. Chair, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to be solved—and perhaps one of these days a minority engineer or biologist will comeup with some of the solutions. The larger point is that we need more STEM educators and more minorities to qualify for them. The energy and science education programs funded in part by this bill will help ensure that members of underrepresented communities are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the environmental sustainability, preservation, and health. Through education about the importance of environmental sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and how citizens can improve their surroundings. Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also benefitted by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management, and other related subjects. The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority institutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The DOE also works to increase low income and minority access to STEM fields and help students attain graduate degrees as well as find employment. With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can increase diversity, provide clean energy options to our most underserved communities, and help improve their environments, which will yield better health outcomes and greater public awareness. But most importantly businesses will have more consumers to whom they may engage in related commercial activities. My amendment will help ensure that underrepresented communities are able to participate and contribute equitably in the energy and scientific future. I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 58. Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 59 OFFERED BY MR . GOSAR  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 59 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of division D (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. lll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to prepare, propose, or promulgate any regulation or guidance that references or relies on the analysis contained in— (1) ‘‘Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866’’, published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government, in February 2010; (2) ‘‘Technical Support Document: Technical Update of the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866’’, published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government, in May 2013 and revised in November 2013; (3) ‘‘Revised Draft Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of Climate Change in NEPA Reviews’’, published by the Council on Environmental Quality on December 24, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 77801); (4) ‘‘Technical Support Document: Technical Update of the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866’’, published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government, in July 2015; (5) ‘‘Addendum to the Technical Support Document on Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866: Application of the Methodology to Estimate the Social Cost of Methane and the Social Cost of Nitrous Oxide’’, published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, United States Government, in August 2016; or (6) ‘‘Technical Support Document: Technical Update of the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866’’, published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, United States Government, in August 2016. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will protect American jobs and the economy by prohibiting funds from being used to implement the Obama administration’s flawed Social Cost of Carbon, or SCC, valuation. This jobkilling and unlawful guidance sneakily attempts to pave the way for capandtradelike mandates. Congress and the American people have repeatedly rejected capandtrade proposals. Knowing that he could not lawfully enact a carbon tax plan, President Obama attempted to circumvent Congress by playing loose and fast with the Clean Air Act to unilaterally implement this unlawful new requirement under the guise of guidance. The Obama administration continuously used the SCC valuation models, which can be easily manipulated, to try and justify new jobkilling regulations. Although President Trump issued an executive order in March to disband the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, Federal 
agencies continue to work on the SCC valuation. My amendment is necessary to strengthen the intent of President Trump’s executive order while also ensuring that it is Congress, not the executive branch, which sets tax and environmental policy. The committee wisely issued guidance in the bill report to delay the promulgation of SCC regulations until a new working group is convened. My amendment explicitly prohibits funds from being used to implement the deeply flawed Social Cost of Carbon guidance in the bill text. The House has a clear, consistent, and strong record of opposition to the Social Cost of Carbon. My colleagues voted in favor of my amendment in FY17 appropriations by a clear majority of 230–188. In fact, the House has decisively voted 10 times to block, defund, or oppose the Social Cost of Carbon since 2013. My amendment ensures this Chamber’s position remains consistent and crystal clear in FY18. Roger Martella, a selfdescribed lifelong environmentalist and career environmental lawyer, testified at the May 2015 House Natural Resources Committee hearing on the revised SCC guidance and the flaws associated with the Social Cost of Carbon model, stating that the ‘‘’Social Cost of Carbon’ estimates suffer from a number of significant flaws that should exclude them from the NEPA process.’’ Amongst these flaws are, one, that the ‘‘projected costs of carbon emissions can be manipulated by changing key parameters such as timeframes, discount rates, and other values that have no relation to a given project undergoing review.’’ Two, ‘‘OMB and the other Federal agencies developed the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates without any known peer review or opportunity for public comment during the development process.’’ Three, ‘‘OMB’s draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates are based primarily on global rather than domestic costs and benefits.’’ Four, ‘‘there is still considerable uncertainty in many of the assumptions and data elements used to create the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates, such as the damage functions and modeled time horizons.’’ Mr. Martella’s testimony was spot on. Congress, not Washington bureaucrats, should dictate our country’s climate change policy. The sweeping and costly changes that the Social Cost of Carbon metric would impose are not only misguided and unwise, they are also based on fundamentally flawed policies that sidestepped Congress, did not go through the normal regulatory process, and received no public comment. Worse yet, the model utilized to predict the Social Cost of Carbon can be easily manipulated to arrive at the desired outcome. Regardless of one’s positions on climate change, my colleagues surely must respect the constitutional role of the legislative branch and oppose bureaucratic efforts to circumvent Congress to impose an extremist environmental agenda that is not based on best available science. Congress must provide certainty to business and consumers that the costly and scientifically bankrupt Social Cost of Carbon valuation will not creep its way into our regulatory process. My amendment provides that certainty. Over the last 2 years, this effort has received support from the American Energy Alliance, Americans for Limited Government, Americans for Tax Reform, Arch Coal, Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, FreedomWorks, National Mining Association, the National Taxpayers Union, and Taxpayers Protection Alliance. Congress, not anonymous Washington bureaucrats, should dictate our country’s tax and climate change policy. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to, once again, block the flawed Social Cost of Carbon. I commend the chairman and the committee for their efforts on this legislation, and I urge support of my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I think the gentleman has a point of view that I do not support, but in terms of this amendment, it really is not necessary. It is redundant. On March 28 of this year, Executive Order No. 13783, signed by President Donald Trump, has rescinded every one of the analyses that the gentleman referenced in his proposed amendment. So this amendment does less than nothing. It has already been dealt with through executive order. I would just encourage my colleagues to let’s move the agenda along this evening where we will have significant debate perhaps on other matters. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment because it is redundant at this point, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I want to reiterate even though President Trump issued an executive order in March to disband the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, Federal agencies continue to work on the SCC valuation. So I, at the very least, would expect everybody to support this. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 60 OFFERED BY MS . DELBENE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 60 printed in House Report 115–259. Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division D, before the short title, insert the following: SEC. ll. None of the funds made available in this division may be used for the procurement of anchor chain that is not subject to the restrictions in section 225.70071 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DELBENE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington. Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an important amendment to this year’s Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. It fixes a serious problem that must be addressed to protect hardworking Americans in my district and across the country. Both parties can agree that our Nation should be spending taxpayer dollars on goods manufactured here at home, not overseas, whenever we can. Doing so not only supports American jobs in our communities but also reinforces our national security. Even President Trump called for strengthening enforcing laws that promote American industry and American workers. So I hope my colleagues from both sides of the aisle can come together on this issue. Particularly in these uncertain times, it is imperative that we protect American production capabilities by supporting U.S. manufacturers. Every year since 1991, Congress has included a provision in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill to require that military agencies purchase anchor chain from American businesses. For the last 2 years, the House and Senate have supported an amendment of mine clarifying that this requirement applies to the Army Corps of Engineers. Unfortunately, the Corps has continued to ignore clear congressional intent and has made several acquisitions of foreignmade anchor chain from countries like China and Korea. Until the Army Corps follows the policy, I will keep fighting to support U.S. manufacturers and their workers, and I hope the whole Chamber will join me in this effort. My amendment strengthens the existing language in this bill to better protect the critical production capability, support our manufacturing industry, and put American workers first. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I recognize the underlying bill has language on this issue, but I understand that the requirement may not be as comprehensive as my colleague supports. I am concerned that the amendment before us may have unintended consequences. If my colleague would withdraw the amendment today, I will commit to working together as this bill moves through the legislative process to see if we can address her concerns in a manner acceptable to everyone. Otherwise, I will have to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Ohio. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the intent of the gentlewoman’s amendment. I am very glad to hear what the gentlewoman is saying. She is trying to do everything she can to support Americanmade products and particularly Americanmade anchor chain. I would be willing to work with the chairman and the gentlewoman as the process goes forward to ensure we purchase Americanmade products. I just wanted to express that support. I thank the gentleman for his offer. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, if the gentlewoman is willing to withdraw the amendment, we will work together to see if we can solve this. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman’s willingness to work with me on this important issue and also Representative KAPTUR for her support. Our Nation can’t afford to lose its critical production capability. We should not allow American workers to be left behind, so I look forward to working with the gentleman and the gentlewoman. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. 
AMENDMENT NO . 61 OFFERED BY MR . BURGESS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 61 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division D (before the short title) insert the following new section: SEC. ll. None of the funds made available in this division may be used— (1) to implement or enforce section 430.32(x) of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations; or (2) to implement or enforce the standards established by the tables contained in section 325(i)(1)(B) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)(B)) with respect to BPAR incandescent reflector lamps, BR incandescent reflector lamps, and ER incandescent reflector lamps. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to prevent the distortion of the free market by the Federal Government. Since its passage in 2007 of the Energy Independence and Security Act, I have heard from virtually tens of thousands of constituents about the language in that act and how it will take away consumer choice when constituents are deciding which lightbulbs they will use in their homes. Mr. Chairman, they are right. Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, I want to point out this exact amendment has been accepted for the past 6 years by the House. Three of those years it was accepted by voice vote. It was included in the annual appropriations legislation signed into law by President Obama every year since its first inclusion in 2011, and has been a priority of the Republican Conference since its adoption into law. It allows consumers to continue to have a choice and to have a say about what type of lightbulb they will put into their homes. Congress should fight to preserve the free market. It is common sense. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, with all the respect I have for Congressman BURGESS , I oppose this damaging rider which would block the Department of Energy from implementing or enforcing commonsense energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs. This rider was a bad idea when it was first offered 7 years ago, and it is even more unsupportable now. Why do I say that? Because every claim made by proponents of the rider have been proven wrong. Number one, we have been told, including by Dr. BURGESS , that the energy efficiency standards would ban incandescent lightbulbs. That is simply false. You can go to the store today and see shelves of modern energy efficient incandescent lightbulbs that meet the standard, and they are the same as the old bulbs except they last longer, use less electricity, and save consumers money. Then we heard for years that the energy efficiency standards restrict consumer choice. b2345 If you have shopped for lightbulbs lately, which I have, you know that isn’t true. In fact, modern incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lightbulbs, and LEDs of every shape, size, and color are now available. Consumers have never had more choice, and the efficiency standard spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers. I am amazed how many shelves lightbulbs now occupy in the stores. Critics of the efficiency standards claim that they would cost consumers money. In fact, the opposite is true. When the standards are in full effect, the average American family will save about $100 per year. That is pretty good. That is $12.5 billion in savings for consumers and businesses nationwide every year. That is $12.5 billion. But this rider threatens those savings. That is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider. Here is the reality. The 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to enjoy overwhelming industry support. U.S. manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards. The effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old, inefficient lightbulbs in the United States that violate the efficiency standards. That is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in U.S. plants to make efficient bulbs that meet the standards. Why on Earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalize U.S. manufacturers who are following our laws? But it gets even worse. The mere existence of this rider poses and additional threat to U.S. manufacturing. The bipartisan 2007 Energy bill required the Department of Energy to establish updated lightbulb efficiency standards by January 1 of this year. It also provided that, if final updated standards are not issued by then, a more stringent backstop standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect, and incandescent lightbulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard. Well, we are well into 2017, and the Burgess lightbulb rider has remained on the books. So, earlier this year, the Department of Energy had to go forward with finalizing the 45lumensper watt backstop standard. Approving this rider year after year is ultimately what blocked the Department of Energy from issuing the required efficiency standards in time to avoid such stringent measures. Ironically, it is this rider that would effectively ban the incandescent lightbulb in 2020. The Burgess rider directly threatens existing lightbulb manufacturing jobs in the United States. It would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing. This rider aims to reverse years of technological progress, only to kill jobs, increase electricity bills for our consumers, and worsen pollution. 
It is time to choose common sense over rigid ideology. It is time to listen to the manufacturing companies, consumer groups, and efficiency advocates who all agree that this rider is harmful. Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on the Burgess lightbulb rider, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I will disagree on the economics that were just presented. But apart from the economics of the lightbulb mandate, that is, in fact, only part of the story. With the extreme expansion of Federal powers undertaken in the last administration, when the Democrats were in charge of Congress for 4 years, Americans have just now begun to see how far the Constitution’s Commerce Clause has been manipulated from its original intent. The lightbulb mandate is a perfect example of this manipulation. The Commerce Clause was intended by our Founding Fathers to be a limitation on Federal authority, not a catchall in order to allow for any topic to be regulated by Washington. Indeed, it is clear that the Founding Fathers never intended for this clause to be used to allow the Federal Government to regulate and pass mandates on consumer products that do not pose a risk to either human health or safety. Mr. Chairman, in December of 2007, when this bill was first passed, the columnist George Will observed on television one Sunday morning that it is the job of the Federal Government to defend the borders and deliver the mail. But instead of keeping up with those two tasks, we instead decided to ban the incandescent bulb. It was wrong in 2007. It is wrong in 2017. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 62 printed in House Report 115–259. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division D (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. ll. Each amount appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act that is not required to be appropriated or otherwise made available by a provision of law is hereby reduced by 1 percent. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to begin by thanking the committee for their hard work on this appropriations bill. Every year, I come to this floor through the appropriations process to present amendments calling for 1 percent acrosstheboard cuts. So many years I have come down here to talk about how the spending continues to increase. Indeed, our budget does increase. But I have to tell you, the chairman and his team have done an incredible job this year. The outlays that we see in this bill this year are $209 million—think about that—less than the budget authority from last year. That is significant, and it should be recognized and should be praised, because that is the type of work that we need to see. Now, I do continue to present the 1 percent acrosstheboard amendment because we are facing a time in our Nation where 1 percent makes a difference, just as we are seeing from the good work that they have done. Passing this amendment for the 1 percent acrosstheboard spending reduction would save us an additional $376 million. It is important to do because our Nation is facing $20 trillion in debt. Because of that, we have to ask ourselves: Is it important to spend some of the money that is being spent on programs that we see taking place in the Department of Energy? It causes us to look at these programs and talk about priorities, where we should spend those precious dollars that are not Federal dollars. They are taxpayer dollars that are coming out of the pockets of hardworking men and women. Indeed, we have, many times, quoted Admiral Mullins’ comments from July 6, 2010, that the greatest threat to our Nation’s security is our Nation’s debt. Because of that, I recognize and applaud the good work that has been done, but I encourage support for my amendment and the continued honing and prioritizing of what takes the taxpayer money that is spent by this body. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, let me first say that I compliment the gentlewoman for her consistency. She is a true budget hawk in trying to make sure that we ultimately balance this budget. It is tough work to do that. We have actually, as she mentioned, reduced spending in this bill over last year. Could we reduce it another 1 percent across the board? The problem is we have to choose some priority in the bill. The highest priority we had was our Nation’s defense, the nuclear weapons program. Even though the overall bill is down $206 million, the defense activities are actually up nearly a billion dollars. We then have to look at the infrastructure of this Nation and the fact that we have deteriorating infrastructure, and Congress has told us that each year we have to meet what is called the WRDA target. We have to spend with the Army Corps of Engineers to meet the infrastructure of our harbors, dams, and inland waterways and restore those things, because it is very important to our commerce and something the Congress supports greatly. So when we have had to increase the Army Corps of Engineers funding over what was spent last year and then we have had to increase weapons activity, that means the Department of Energy has been significantly reduced over what they were last year. We have had to make some very hard choices. We have cut the EERE, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, program in half from $2 billion to $1 billion, roughly. We have had to eliminate the ARPA– E program, a program that I happen to support, but we just don’t have the money for it. We have had to eliminate the loan guarantee program, a program that, again, I support, but we just don’t have the money for it. So we have made some significant reductions while prioritizing basic science research and those types of activities within the Department of Energy. I think we have done a good job, given a pretty skinny budget. We have made tough choices. That is okay. That is what we do all the time in the Appropriations Committee. The reality is, if we are ever going to balance this budget, if anybody looks at the numbers, right now we are spending about 70 percent of our total Federal budget on mandatory programs. We have been reducing discretionary spending over the years. As a portion of the total budget, it has gone down every year. If we don’t get a hold of mandatory spending—Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest on the debt— within 10 years we will have enough money for our mandatory programs and defense, nothing else—zero. We are not going to balance this budget by reducing discretionary spending. Keeping control of it, you bet, that is what we have been doing. That is what the Appropriations Committee has been doing since 2010, or earlier. We have actually been reducing spending. It is very important that we do that. But we have to get a hold of mandatory spending if we are going to balance the budget. So while I appreciate what the gentlewoman is trying to do, I agree with her, we need to balance this budget. We need to balance this budget. Unfortunately, this is not the way to do it. So I have to oppose this amendment and hope my colleagues would oppose it also. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I will tell you every comment that Mr. SIMPSON made about the mandatory spending is something that I agree with. Yes, we have to do that. But just as we in Congress have reduced our Legislative Branch budget by about 20 percent over the last few years, and just as our Appropriations Committee has done a wonderful job of pulling back on the spending that is done to discretionary, we need to give that same challenge to the bureaucracy, to those rankandfile Federal employees and challenge them to go save a penny on a dollar out of what they are appropriated. Find a way to yield savings to the work that they do and help us with this process to rein in spending. Mr. Chairman, I encourage support of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACK BURN ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 63 OFFERED BY MR . PERRY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 63 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division D (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. lll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement or enforce the final rule published by the Secretary of Energy entitled ‘‘Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps’’ published on January 5, 2017 (82 Fed. Reg. 1426). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank the Appropriations Committee for the extraordinary work they have done in a very limited amount of time. This amendment would prohibit the use of funds to implement or enforce the final rule published by the former Secretary of Energy, entitled: ‘‘Test Procedures for Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps.’’ Mr. Chairman, this is simply an example of too much Washington, too much government. I am sure it was wellintended, but I am not sure if the good idea fairies in Washington really realized fully what they did. b0000 Certainly we want to have test standards and so on and so forth, but the onesizefitsall approach that comes out of Washington misses some folks and can cause some irreparable damage to businesses all around the country. And all around the country there are small manufacturers that are trying to build some airconditioners. In particular, there is one in the district that I represent that builds custommade airconditioners and heat pumps for skyscrapers and highrise buildings. If I can picture the scene, the original units are put in when the buildings are being constructed. So there are cranes available, there are openings in the walls and in the structure, and they just move the stuff in, and then they close it all up. In 10, 15, 20, 30 years later when they go to replace it, well, the walls are in, the windows are in, the people are in, the offices are in. There is no crane available, and they have to piece this thing together through the elevator and into the closet. So this company, like other ones around the country, make custommade ones, each one for a specific application—each one. But the Department of Energy, and this rule in particular, says that this company must test each model that they make for these efficiency standards—each one—an arduous test taking months, if not years, in documentation for one application. Again, I am sure the Department of Energy was wellintended. However, this rule is going to put a business out. They work in the city of York, a fine city in central Pennsylvania, right downtown where we want manufacturing to happen, where people can walk to work. These folks are trying. They are struggling to survive in this economy, and the only thing that is going to put them out is this regulation, Mr. Chairman. While wellintended, it is not going to be helpful. These folks are trying to do the right thing, but the government is getting in the way. Believe it or not, Consumer Reports actually recommended against buying some of these systems under this testing rule because the systems had higher costs and poor repair records. Believe it or not, Mr. Chairman, the free market actually fixes most of this stuff. Most of us want to buy more efficient things that are cheaper, that are easier to maintain, and have a better record. This is Consumer Reports talking. This isn’t PERRY ’s record. This is Consumer Reports talking. Let us not put this company out of business. Let us not put these companies out of business. Let us be responsible. I urge passage. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this particular amendment. I say to the gentleman: For the company in your district, the regulations include the opportunity for waiver. And I would hope that the company in your district would be able to work that out. The amendment that the gentleman proposes seeks to prohibit the Department of Energy from implementing testing procedures for the energy efficiency standards set for heat pumps and airconditioners. I, as the consumer, whether I am buying a heat pump, a furnace, a refrigerator—and every American who now shops looks for those—that is like the sticker. That is what you really look for, and you want to know how much you are going to pay every year for what that product will cost you for energy. And the better product you have, and you are able to put that on a label and it is verified by the Department of Energy, that helps sales. The original standards that were created were supported and have been supported by the Edison Electric Institute, the association which represents all investorowned utilities. The amendment, by the way, is opposed by the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, which represents manufacturers of HVAC systems that employ over 1.3 million Americans. And industry opposes the amendment, environmentalists oppose it, because it would cost an average—a cumulative cost to Americans of $12.2 billion over 30 years. So there is a lot of opposition to this. It is important to note that these standards were negotiated in a collaborative process by industry groups, environmental nonprofits, and consumer advocates with the Department of Energy. A rider like this one damages the integrity of the negotiated rulemaking process, which is designed to provide certainty and voice to the industry and education and information to consumers. Test procedures are simple and important. The Department of Energy develops them to make sure companies are rating their product accurately so consumers don’t get stuck paying higher bills than they expect, so you know what you buy. Let’s be clear. This amendment would effectively nullify the efficiency standards for heating and cooling systems, in spite of the fact that these standards project that it will save billions of dollars over the period that they are applied, and that is equivalent to having 1 million fewer homes connected to the grid over the same period. It is an enormous savings. If there is a particular company that is unfairly impacted by these rules, there are outlets for regulatory relief through waivers, as I have mentioned, and this amendment would neuter 
those standards and thereby allow cheap imports to undercut American products by exploiting the lack of standards. We don’t want to go back to that. I look for those yellow labels. To protect American manufacturers, to save Americans money on their utility bills, and to reduce air pollution, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ The gentleman may have a good intention in offering this amendment, but I don’t think you want to take away the benefits to the American people for one company in your district when that company, in fact, can negotiate and receive a waiver. I would just ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, we are in agreement that the regulations have to be in place. I, too, like the yellow sticker, just like she does; and somehow the yellow stickers are in place without this new rule. They are there right now. You have been seeing them for years. This is new—this is a new regulation. I would contend that, yeah, the manufacturers have gotten on board and they have negotiated this rule. Because what choice did they have, right? The Federal Government is going to regulate. They are going to do it. You either get in the game and play ball or you know what happens to the bat. Right? They didn’t want to be in that position, so they took the best they could. I am telling you and it is my contention that the free market is going to figure this out because we all want the most efficient, the most costeffective, and the most maintenanceeffective, whether it is an airconditioner, whether it is a car, or whether it is an electric toothbrush. We don’t need the Federal Government telling us to do it. By the way, this company has applied for a waiver, years in the making. They literally have the president of the company spending almost, he said, 85 percent of his time dealing with Federal regulation compliance. The president of the company is the guy who wants to hire these 125 people, go make sales, and produce things. Instead, all he is doing is dealing with the Federal Government. Somehow, someway we all got to this point. It feels pretty cool in the Capitol right now, right? It feels pretty cool in the House of Representatives. The yellow labels were there before this regulation ever happened. Mr. Chairman, I ask and urge the Members to vote in favor of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 64 OFFERED BY MR . BUDD  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 64 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY ), I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of the division D (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the prevailing wage requirements in subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code (commonly referred to as the DavisBacon Act). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the DavisBacon Act hinders economic growth and increases the Federal deficit. It imposes enormous burdens, stifles contractor productivity, ignores skill differences for different jobs, and imposes rigid craftwork rules. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the DavisBacon Act will raise Federal construction costs by $13 billion between 2015 and 2023. Now, wages are often set at or above the union scale, despite the fact that only 13 percent of the private construction workforce is even unionized nationwide, Mr. Chairman. b0010 The DavisBacon wage determinations have also been known to be lower than the current market rate, which is equally problematic and especially detrimental for local contractors. It is just erratic. The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has repeatedly criticized DOL’s DavisBacon wage determination process for its lack of transparency in the published wage rates and its tendency to gather erroneous data through unscientific wage surveys. Repealing the DBA would allow the government to build more infrastructure and create 155,000 new constructionrelated jobs at the very same cost to the taxpayers. In fact, repealing DavisBacon would have saved the Federal Government $10.9 billion, and that was back in 2011. This amendment would uphold the government’s responsibility to deliver quality infrastructure improvements at the best possible price to the taxpayers, which is certainly what we owe them. It is imperative that all levels of government guarantee the general public that their tax dollars are being spent in the most effective way possible. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY ) for his work on this amendment, and I withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. The Chair understands that amendment No. 65 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO . 70 OFFERED BY MR . MITCHELL  
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. P ERRY ). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 70 printed in House Report 115–259. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of division D (before the short title), insert the following: SEC. lll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to delay the release of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Interbasin Study (GLMRIS) Brandon Road Study. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today as an advocate of the Great Lakes. It is with that spirit I propose my amendment to prevent funds to be used to further delay the release of the Brandon Road Study. Anyone who has spent time in my home State of Michigan or any of the Great Lakes States knows the beauty and importance of the lakes. In addition to their majesty, the Great Lakes supply 90 percent of the United States freshwater supply. Thirty million people live at the Great Lakes Basin, and they are all impacted by the quality of our lakes, whether as a water source, source of business, recreational opportunity, or the lakes’ inherent value as a natural wonder. Any risk to the Great Lakes is a significant problem, no matter how you measure that risk. One of the threats facing our lakes is the potential entry of invasive species, the most pressing of which, at this time, is the threat of Asian carp entering the Great Lakes. Asian carp have no natural predators in the lakes, meaning once they enter the Great Lakes, there is no way to stop their spread. Their unrestrained growth would disrupt the entire ecosystem. In addition to the damage to native wildlife in the lakes, the introduction of Asian carp would damage several multibilliondollar industries, including the fishing and boating industries which support countless jobs in my 
home State of Michigan and the Great Lakes. Given the threat imposed by invasive species, the Army Corps of Engineers has been studying the best way to prevent introduction of the Asian carp into the Great Lakes Basin. Their study, the Brandon Road Study, was initially slated to be released on February 28 but has been delayed until further notice. Delaying this study impedes the ability of all interested parties to develop a longterm strategy to thwart this threat. The continued delays create a great risk, yet no reason for delaying that release has been provided. In late June, a live Asian carp was caught in the Illinois waterway about 2 miles below the T.J. O’Brien Lock and Dam, 9 miles from Lake Michigan. This is the first time an Asian carp has been discovered in such close proximity to our lakes. Though further study is necessary to determine how this carp entered the area, it is an alarming warning that the window is quickly closing to prevent largescale devastation to the Great Lakes’ ecosystem. The best way to mitigate the damage of Asian carp in our lakes is to stop it from happening altogether. For several months, members of the Great Lakes Task Force have requested the release of the Brandon Road Study, to no avail. I stand here today to again call on the Army Corps to release the study, which we have already paid for and they have conducted. My amendment would prevent the Corps from using any more money—our money—to delay the release of the study. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment for the sake of the Great Lakes and for the well being of our entire region. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment offered by my friends, Mr. MITCHELL and Mr. HUIZENGA and, I have no doubt, many fellow travelers from the Great Lakes delegation on both sides of the aisle. I find it somewhat unusual that it is the last amendment this evening after midnight. I wish it had come up about 6 o’clock on the evening news. This is an issue we know well, as Mr. HUIZENGA , Mr. M ITCHELL , and certainly our chairman, Mr. SIMPSON , has heard a great deal about this now, and our ranking members on the full committee as well. We introduced a bill last month with the same ultimate effect of preventing the spread of Asian carp into the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes represent a $7 billion fishery, deeply threatened by these critters, Asian carp, that shouldn’t even be in this country but began their movement up the Mississippi River when they were brought in to do bottom cleaning in Mississippi in the special fish tanks that were set up down there many years ago as bottom feeders. There was some type of storm and they hopped out. The walls were breached, and they began their journey up the Mississippi until now. They are within just a few miles of Lake Michigan. Just a few weeks ago, a 28inch Asian carp was caught beyond the protective barriers, which is a temporary solution, only 9 miles from Lake Michigan. Yet, even in this time of greatest danger, the Brandon Road Study, which Congressman MITCHELL outlined, which merely identifies options for preventing Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes, has not been released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This amendment would prevent the administration from expending any more funds to further delay the release of this study for public comment. My colleagues should know that this study is already completed. After working on it for years at a cost of nearly $7 million, it now sits on a shelf at the Corps, and they are unwilling to release it for reasons we do not understand. Asian carp represent a serious economic and environmental threat to the entire Great Lakes. These mean critters are voracious eaters. They destroy native species and overwhelm their new ecosystems. They have gotten into the Ohio River, and they have gotten into rivers near Peoria. They eat up everything in their sight. They completely upend native ecosystems, and it is truly terrifying what they will do to our lakes, as you can see in this photograph. They are prolific, they are large, and they are predatory. We should be aggressively pursuing action to prevent the spread of the Asian carp to the Great Lakes, yet the roadmap to getting there is locked in bureaucratic purgatory. Finally, I would like to point out that this is not a partisan issue. Our substantively similar bill has 15 Republican and 16 Democratic cosponsors, who represent the vast majority of the Great Lakes coastline. In these hyperpartisan times, our constituents are united in their love for the Great Lakes, their desire to protect them, and their understanding of how vital they are to the future of this country and continent. Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this amendment from all of my colleagues in order to save the national treasures that are the Great Lakes. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman MITCHELL and Congressman H UIZENGA  for taking the lead this evening from the great Wolverine State—and we Buckeyes don’t often say that, do we— for embracing what is truly important to all of us, and I urge my colleagues to support the MitchellHuizenga amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, while I would like to support this amendment, unfortunately, I can’t. But, believe me, I understand and have learned from Ms. KAPTUR and the members of the Great Lakes States when I was chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. And now she sits on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee with me, and they have all come and talked to me about this problem. This, unfortunately, pits kind of one State against another, and what I am trying to do is find a solution to this, because I happen to agree with these individuals that it seems rather silly that we go out and ask for a report to be done and then can’t seem to get it released—not only the final report, we can’t even get a draft report released that will go out for comment. That doesn’t make any sense to me. b0020 But I know that there are Members who also have concerns about that, but that is, frankly, why you release a draft report, so that you can get the comments. During full committee consideration on the Energy and Water bill, we discussed a similar amendment that was offered by Ms. KAPTUR , my ranking member, Mr. JOYCE , and Mr. MOOLENAAR ; and I committed to them at the time that I would work with all interested parties and Members to try to move these efforts forward, and I am happy to reiterate that commitment now. What I am asking is if the gentleman will withdraw the amendment, give me a chance, and I commit to try to get this report out, because I think it needs to get done, and I think, together, we can convince the Army Corps and maybe the administration that it needs to get done. So that would be my request. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Chair, in deference to Mr. SIMPSON , I will work with him and others in the Great Lakes Legislative Caucus to see if we can’t move forward on this issue. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
MITCHELL ) having assumed the chair, Mr. PERRY , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
ADJOURNMENT Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn. The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 22 minutes a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until today, Thursday, July 27, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morninghour debate.
