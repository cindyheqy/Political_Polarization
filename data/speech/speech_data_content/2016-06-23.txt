PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MCGOVERN. Does House Resolution 797 provide for any debate time at all on a conference report that we just received a few hours ago, that is quite lengthy? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will invite the gentleman to consult House Resolution 797. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, a further parliamentary inquiry; I did, and I don’t see any time for debate, which kind of surprises me. But my further parliamentary inquiry is: Will the House be allowed to have a separate vote on whether or not we remain here and deliberate on other business or adjourn? Will we have a separate vote on that? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated a parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MCGOVERN. Well, when I read the rule, apparently we don’t, so we are locked out of everything, if I am understanding the rule correctly. This is a lousy process, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman have a parliamentary inquiry? Mr. MCGOVERN. I think I have stated——
