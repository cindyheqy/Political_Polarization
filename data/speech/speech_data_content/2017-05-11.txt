Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in strong opposition to H.R. 1628, which is a bill to take away health care from 24 million Americans. Whether you believe it or not, health care is a basic right. This shameful bill steals from the most vul-nerable among us, including seniors, veterans, people living with HIV, children, and the dis-abled. And this new bill is even more dan-gerous and destructive than when they brought it to the Floor last time. It would, yes, rip away health care from 24 million people. It would reduce benefits, make families pay more for less, and transfer $600 billion in tax cuts to the very wealthy. This is outrageous. Access to women’s health is denied by defunding Planned Parent-hood. Medicaid, as we know it, will end. Healthcare costs for working families and sen-iors will skyrocket. It allows states to eliminate essential health benefits like maternity care, cancer screenings, and emergency care. Mr. Speaker, this is not a health bill at all. This is a massive tax giveaway to the wealthy. Let me tell you, as a woman of faith, I am appalled and I am saddened by the hypocrisy displayed in this bill by people who say they are religious. I want to remind you—in the Scriptures, the Book of Mark, chapter 12:31, we are reminded to love your neighbor as yourself. I hope Republicans remember to love their neighbor as themselves today and vote ‘‘no’’ on this mean-spirited and evil bill. Let’s defeat this harmful and morally bankrupt bill. This is a matter of life and death, and the American people deserve better.

AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 4, 2017 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for the American Health Care Act. As I have said from the beginning, when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, we should keep what works and change what doesn’t. I urge support for the AHCA because it does just that. The AHCA stops the Washington, DC, one- size-fits-all approach to healthcare and puts choice and freedom back in the hands of states, counties, families, and individuals. With the AHCA’s monumental strides in reforming Medicaid to ensure its solvency for our most vulnerable citizens and repealing burdensome taxes on the middle class, it is a win across the board for all Americans, but specifically Upstate New Yorkers. Upstate New York residents will see addi-tional benefits due to an amendment which Congressman COLLINS and I have included in the bill. This language is one of the greatest pieces of state mandate relief that New York-ers have ever seen. By normalizing the fash-ion in which New York State funds Medicaid, those in my district alone will see more than $224 million in tax relief every year. The fact is that New York funds its Medicaid program by imposing a portion of the state’s funding responsibility on the counties. Home ownership is burdened by lower property val-ues due to high taxes. This also lessens busi-ness competitiveness in areas like Upstate NY. The extent to which New York burdens its counties is unlike any other: of the approxi-mately $9.5 billion in Medicaid costs shoul-dered by localities nationwide, New York local-ities account for more than $7 billion of the total. Albany mandates ensure that New York spends more on Medicaid than Texas and Florida combined. This is simply unsustainable. The people of Upstate New York demand relief: relief from burdensome Albany man-dates; relief from rising property taxes; relief from Washington-controlled, bureaucratic healthcare; relief from ACA-imposed, middle- class healthcare taxes. For these reasons, I support the AHCA and urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to have the op-portunity to meet these brave men and women who exemplify the best of our country. Their sacrifice and commitment to the duty to our nation can never be fully repaid, and I hope that when they visit our nation’s monuments in Washington, D.C., the gratitude and respect we have for them will truly be reflected. Colleagues, please join me in thanking these veterans and their families for their ex-emplary dedication and service to this great nation. I would also like to extend a special thank you to the local communities, all of the volunteers, and Ms. Teresa Galloway and Mr. John West for their extensive work in orga-nizing this Honor Flight. This trip would not have been possible without all the financial and emotional support of the people who have put in so much hard work and personal time to make sure this trip could be possible. f 
A TRIBUTE TO LT. COL. DAVID WORLEY 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant Colonel David Worley, who is retiring after forty-two years of distinguished service with the United States Air Force. Born in Los Angeles in 1953, Dave grew up in Woodland Hills, California. An excellent stu-dent and astronomy enthusiast, he attended Serrania Avenue Elementary School, Parkman Jr. High and Taft High School. Dave met his future wife, Gayle, in Sunday School, and after their high school graduation, they attended Pierce College together. In 1975, Dave en-listed in the United States Air Force (USAF) and he and Gayle married shortly after his en-listment. Upon completion of his basic training, he was assigned to the Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi for technical train-ing. After finishing his technical training, he was assigned to Dover AFB for a one year as-signment. He was reassigned back to Keesler AFB in Biloxi, where their children, Valerie and Bryan were born. Dave served as an Air Traffic Controller Manager for seven years, after which he re-ceived his commission. Upon completing train-ing as an Air Battalion Manager, then-Second Lieutenant Worley was stationed in Germany

for eight years, where he served as a mobile Theater Air Control specialist and evaluator and was promoted to the subsequent ranks of First Lieutenant and Captain. In 1992, Captain Worley served as a Flight Commander at the Squadron Officer School at the Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama and in 1994, he was stationed in Korea where he was promoted to Major and worked as Battle Director for air-space control. In 1995, Major Worley returned to the Squadron Officer School as Chief of Plans and Programs, then attended college in Virginia, and after college, began a three year tour at the U.S. Central Command Head-quarters in Tampa, Florida. While in Florida, he served as the Chief of the Theater Air and Missile Defense Branch as Executive Officer to the Director of Operations, where he re-ceived the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 2000, Lt. Col. Worley returned once again to Alabama as Commander of the 30th Student Squadron Officers School, where he com-manded hundreds of USAF officers, inter-national officers and U.S. Department of De-fense civilian personnel as an airpower and leadership education scholar, before his retire-ment in 2002. In 2003, Dave became a Senior Aerospace Science instructor at Crescenta Valley High School in La Crescenta, California. Lt. Col. Worley was responsible for administering the Air Force Junior Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) program, a citizenship-based pro-gram for nearly 100 high school student ‘‘ca-dets,’’ who are expanding their aerospace science and leadership education to become better leaders and citizens. During his illustrious career in the United States Air Force, Lt. Col. Worley has received several decorations including the Joint Service Commendation Medal, five Meritorious Service Medals, a Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and two USAF Commendation Medals, and was honored in 2007 and in 2008 with the AFJROTC outstanding instructor award, which is presented annually to the top twenty per-cent of all AFJROTC instructors worldwide. I ask all Members of Congress to join me in thanking Lt. Col. Worley for his many years of dedicated service to our country, the AFJROTC students at Crescenta Valley High School, and the greater foothills community.

HONORING THE JOHNSTOWN RO-TARY CLUB’S 100TH ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. KEITH J. ROTHFUS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Johnstown Rotary Club’s 100th Anniversary. Since its founding in May 1917, the Johns-town Rotary Club has aided many community organizations such as scouting, child relief agencies, arts and theater organizations, po-lice and fire departments and health and serv-ice organizations. It has also sponsored Inter-act Clubs at local high schools and awarded scholarships to outstanding high school stu-dents. In addition to providing dictionaries to every third grader in the Johnstown area, Johnstown Rotarians are also involved in var-ious literacy initiatives such as the One Book, One Community Program. The Johnstown Rotary Club has also been actively involved in international service initia-tives such as supporting clean water projects in developing nations. They have been very involved in hosting high school exchange stu-dents from numerous countries including Spain, France, Slovakia, Turkey, Venezuela, Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, Bolivia, the Do-minican Republic and Japan. Since 1968, when Rotary International first took on the challenge of eradicating polio, the Johnstown Rotary Club has participated in various projects, which helped to bring the number of countries experiencing the polio endemic from 122 down to two. I thank the Johnstown Rotarians for their dedication to improving both the Johnstown community and the international community through their commitment to supporting edu-cation, providing clean water, promoting peace, saving mothers and children, growing local economies and fighting disease. Con-gratulations to the Rotary Club of Johnstown on its 100th Anniversary. f 
IN HONOR OF THE COMMEMORA-TION OF THE GREAT FALLS LI-BRARY COMMUNITY ROOM 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the commemoration of the Great Falls Library Community Room in honor of Marge Gersic and also to recognize her tre-mendous contributions to not only the Great Falls Community Library, but the entire 10th District of Virginia over the course of her 20 years of public service. Growing up as the child of two German im-migrants in Queens, New York, Ms. Gersic often found herself in her local library, reading books written in English. There she not only gained an appreciation for books, but she also learned about the impact libraries can have on a community. Ms. Gersic began her work in the Great Falls community after moving to the area in 1971 with her husband and then new-born son. As both a member of the Library Board and as President of the Great Falls Citi-zens Association, she was instrumental in placing a library in Great Falls and also in pre-serving it throughout the years. In both 1989 and 1996, as a skilled and dedicated public organizer, Ms. Gersic led community movements to keep the Great Falls mini-library open amidst budget cuts that would have eliminated numerous mini-libraries across Fairfax County. By organizing drives, collecting signatures, and leading these move-ments, she was able to keep the local mini-li-brary open. In fact, during the 1996 budget cuts, four mini-libraries across Fairfax closed, but due to her initiatives the Great Falls library remained open. In addition to her efforts to preserve the library throughout the years, as a member of the Fairfax County Library Board, Gersic was also integral in the funding and the eventual expansion of the library to its current location, which opened in October of 2000. Honoring the life of Ms. Gersic with a room in the library, which she worked so hard to maintain and expand is only fitting, and I am thankful for the Great Falls Citizens Associa-tion’s dedication to preserving her legacy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Marge Gersic and the commemora-tion of the Great Falls Library Community Room, which will serve as a permanent re-minder of all her contributions to both the li-brary and the community at large. f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE & LEGACY OF FATHER JOHN K. RING 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay trib-ute to the life and legacy of a dear friend and beloved pillar of the San Francisco commu-nity, Father John Ring, who served for 25 years as Pastor of St. Vincent de Paul Church. Born and raised in San Francisco, Father Ring’s leadership and compassion were in-valuable to our parish and our community, in times of joy and sorrow alike. In the suffering of the Loma Prieta earthquake, Father Ring bound up the wounds of our community, con-soling and encouraging us, tending his flock. During his entire Pastorate, we saw the cre-ation of a mass for young adults, a group of Home Visitors to care for the sick and home-bound in the parish and beyond, and for the first time girls were allowed to be altar servers. He also poured himself into the service of the parish’s children, and the strength of the St. Vincent de Paul school will be an enduring part of Father Ring’s rich legacy. My husband Paul, my family and I were deeply saddened to hear of Father Ring’s passing. Our family has been parishioners at St. Vincent de Paul for generations, since Paul’s parents John and Corinne Pelosi be-came parishioners in the 1930s. We count ourselves deeply blessed to have known Fa-ther Ring, and it was a special privilege to join in celebrating the Golden Jubilee of his priestly service in 2011. He will remain an in-spiration to our family. Father Ring once said that Christ’s farewell to his disciples was one of his favorite parts of Scripture. In the Gospel according to John, Jesus says, ‘‘Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be trou-bled, nor let it be fearful.’’ Truly, Father Ring was an instrument of God’s peace. The families of Father Ring’s parish were blessed with a Pastor who strengthened their church and school, built community, and in-spired their love for service and their love for God. May it bring comfort to all those who loved and admired Father Ring that so many join in remembering this extraordinary man and the blessing he was to our community.

founder and CEO of DEL Records, a flour-ishing music company located in Bell Gar-dens, California, in my 40th Congressional District. Since his launch of DEL Records in 2008, Angel has built the label into a place where young and independent Regional Mexi-can artists can develop their talents and find success. Angel’s passion for music, his busi-ness acumen, and his civic and philanthropic efforts have built DEL Records into a vibrant, thriving part of the local community. DEL Records exists because of Angel’s vi-sion: he knew that the entertainment industry was full of talented artists who were not signed to a label and were not receiving the support they needed in order to build a career. When he began DEL Records, Angel spent time searching YouTube for young musicians. In the years since, his hard work has paid off: today, the label boasts a broad slate of major artists. Musicians like Gerardo Ortiz, Luis Coronel, Chiquis, Jose Manuel Lopez, and the late Ariel Camacho are just a few of those who have been a part of the DEL Records family. Angel has used his success at DEL Records as a driving force to create positive change in the community. He has been tire-less in giving back time, effort, and resources to help his neighbors. Angel and DEL Records work to lift up the less fortunate, and to give individuals of all ages the opportunity to thrive and excel. As we work to build communities that protect the vulnerable and support those in need, the good works of civic-minded com-munity leaders like Angel are invaluable to that endeavor. With the help of his sister Maria, and guided always by the inspirational example of his par-ents Jose Angel and Frances, Angel Del Villar has made DEL Records a key Southeast LA County business and a vital voice in the Re-gional Mexican music scene. I commend Angel and his team at DEL Records for their achievements in music and contributions to the community, and wish them all the best for the future.

IN RECOGNITION OF ORCHARDS CHILDRENS’ SERVICES ON ITS 55TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Orchards Childrens’ Services as it celebrates its 55th anniversary. Orchards pro-vides critical adoption, foster parenting and family preservation services throughout south-east Michigan. Founded in 1962 by the Greater Detroit Section of the National Council of Jewish Women, Orchards Children’s Services pro-vides comprehensive services and supports to vulnerable children in the southeast Michigan community. The organization recruits, trains and licenses foster parents to provide care for children in need of these services. Addition-ally, Orchards facilitates adoptions and runs several Post Adoption Resource Centers to ensure that these children and their adoptive families receive the support and resources to help make the transition a success. The orga-nization also maintains a scholarship fund to help Orchards foster children afford a college education. Orchards’ Promise Scholarships provide critical financial support to help these children achieve success in college, and every child who receives an Orchard Promise schol-arship has achieved at least a 3.0 GPA at a Michigan University. Orchards Children’s Services has played a key role in providing resources and support to vulnerable children in the southeast Michigan community. Since the organization began its adoption program in 1986, it has helped place over 3,000 children with adoptive families. It also serves over 5,000 children through its family preservation programs, which provide assistance like household organization and other skills training to help stabilize families and keep them together. Collectively, these initiatives have helped empower children in need to reach their potential and provide them resources for success later in life, and I am confident that Orchards will continue its excel-lent work in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Orchards Childrens’ Services on their 55th anniversary for their work on behalf of Michigan’s children. Orchards’ programs have helped support vulnerable children in southeast Michigan. f

HON. LOUIE GOHMERT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is with enor-mous pride that I recognize and congratulate the Kilgore High School Bulldogs on achieving the title of 2017 Texas State Soccer Cham-pions. This is the third straight appearance for the Bulldogs in the state soccer showdown, but this is Kilgore High School’s first state team title since 2004. Despite losing their team captain to injury during the state semifinals, the Bulldogs pulled together and made their way to the state final against the Bridgeport Bulls. After the end of grueling regulation play, the match was tied 2– 2, and went to penalty kicks. Two brilliant saves by keeper and championship MVP Kaleb Jett, on back-to-back shots, brought the Bulldogs a hard-earned 4–2 victory on pen-alties. Congratulations should be extended to team members Kaleb Jett, Yonatan Contreras, Jesus Gonzalez, Jovany Gonzalez, Noe Zavaleta, Raul Cedillo, Jamie Veloz, Elian Torres, Mateo Meraz, Brandon Espinoza, Dan-iel Sifford, Tucker Konczak, Jordi Contreras, Diego Huerta, Wayne McIntyre, Jose Gon-zalez, David Garcia, Jose Arrendondo, Jack-son Hatcher. This recognition of their accomplishment is extended to all of the athletic staff including Coaches: Austin Walker, Mark Roskos; Train-ers/Managers: Head Trainer, Darrell ‘‘Red’’ Ganus; Student Trainer, Brandon Mayers; Manager, Carlos Godoy; Videographer, Josue Reyes. The staff and faculty who led and in-spired the Bulldogs in pursuit of the state crown include Superintendent Cara Cooke; Principal Greg Brown; Athletic Director Mi-chael Wood; Assistant Athletic Director Doug Duke. The faculty, staff and friends of Kilgore Inde-pendent School District and the entire commu-nity of Kilgore have devoted countless hours to support and encourage these outstanding young athletes in the pursuit of their dreams. It is my most esteemed honor to congratu-late everyone involved with this endeavor. May God continue to bless these students, their families and friends, and all those individ-uals who call Kilgore, Texas their home. Con-gratulations to the 2017 Class 4A State Soc-cer Champions, the Kilgore Bulldogs, as their championship legacy is now recorded and will endure as long as there is a United States of America. f 
CELEBRATING ISRAEL INDEPENDENCE DAY

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Israel Independ-ence Celebration in my hometown of Hun-tington, West Virginia, that took place on Sun-day, May 7. This event honoring the establish-ment of one of our nation’s greatest allies was made possible by the hard work of Jewish Charities of Huntington and Christ Temple Church of Huntington. I thank Linda Klein and Pastor Chuck Lawrence for their steadfast leadership as well. Just like West Virginia, Israel’s greatest strength is the resolve and resilience of its people. I witnessed firsthand the importance of the relationship between our two countries during my recent visit to Israel, where it was evident that the nation is under threat like never before. That is why I will continue to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its nu-clear and ballistic missile programs so that it will never be able to obtain a nuclear weapon. I have also been a vocal supporter of placing stronger sanctions on Iran until it no longer fi-nancially supports terrorist groups that pose a threat to both Israel and the United States, and to providing aid and support to Israel to help it defend itself. Israel will always have a friend in the United States, and in me. I congratulate the citizens of Israel on 69 years of independence and look forward to many more years of friendship between our people.

IN RECOGNITION OF TOYOTA MOTOR NORTH AMERICA ON THE DATE OF ITS SUPPLIER CENTER GRAND OPENING 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Toyota Motor North America on the date of the Toyota Supplier Center and Proto-type Development Facility grand opening. Toy-ota Motor North America has been a strong partner to southeast Michigan by utilizing our state’s automotive expertise to help produce its next generation of automobiles. Originally established in July 1977, Toyota Motor North America’s Research and Develop-ment has contributed significantly to the lead-ership of southeast Michigan as a leader in automotive engineering, driving important breakthroughs in automotive design and safe-ty. Toyota employs approximately 1,440 indi-viduals in its Ann Arbor and York Township fa-cilities whose work has critical input to many of Toyota’s most popular vehicles. These fa-cilities collectively have contributed to the ve-hicle development of many of Toyota’s most popular vehicles, including the 2014 Tundra and 2015 Camry designs, and its advanced research and prototype development efforts continue to serve as a critical source of inno-vation for the company at large. Toyota Motor North America’s significant in-vestment in expanding and upgrading its Ann Arbor and York Township engineering facilities underscores the importance of the groundbreaking research and development being done here. The expansion of the powertrain development facility in Ann Arbor Township, as well as further improvements to the York Township site, will allow a continu-ation of the successful partnership between Toyota and the State of Michigan. The tal-ented and educated southeast Michigan work-force, combined with Toyota’s new facilities and additional resources, will help ensure that Michigan’s automotive industry remains a worldwide leader in the coming decades. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Toyota Motor North America and Mr. Toyoda during the grand opening of the Toyota Supplier Center and Prototype Devel-opment Facility expansion. This critical invest-ment will leverage Michigan’s talented work-force to conduct cutting edge automotive re-search and development.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND OPENING OF CENTERFUSE 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the grand opening of CenterFuse in Manassas, Virginia, an innovative business accelerator that will allow individuals, entre-preneurs, start-up companies, and established firms to lease office space and conference rooms. This state of the art facility is equipped with brand new office and conference equip-ment, including smart televisions, fast wifi, and a fully functional kitchen. While offering some of the most modern technology, and yet at the same time being situated in Old Town Manas-sas, CenterFuse will provide the residents of Virginia’s 10th Congressional District with 24/ 7 access to a unique combination of advanced technology and a relaxed and familiar setting. The idea for CenterFuse was originally con-ceived by Gail and Bennet Whitlock, of Whitlock Financial, and Jacqueline and Ken Krick, of ECU Communications, who formed an LLC to purchase the Hyson Building in Ma-nassas on the corner of Center Street and Main Street. The two firms have their own of-fices upstairs, but below, where the Fauquier Bank once stood, they built CenterFuse. To fund the construction of CenterFuse, they formed a public-private partnership with the City of Manassas, receiving a $200,000 grant from Manassas City leaders. The day-to-day operations will be overseen by Historic Manas-sas, Inc. (HMI) and their Executive Director/ CEO, Debbie Haight, and under her leader-ship, HMI will manage the office’s front desk, organize classes and activities, and lead the recruiting efforts for new clients. In today’s competitive economy, many small companies and individuals require modern workspaces, yet often find it difficult to secure or maintain an office. CenterFuse will amelio-rate this problem by offering a variety of op-tions for businesses, ranging from year-long leases for private offices to co-working day passes. This will enable these growing busi-nesses or individuals to work in an environ-ment that caters to their specific needs. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues join me in applauding the Grand Opening of CenterFuse. It is my hope that CenterFuse will help Virginia’s 10th Congressional District to continue to be a catalyst for new businesses to thrive. I am very thankful for the broad range of opportunities it will afford my constitu-ents and I look forward to the positive impact it will have on individuals, entrepreneurs, busi-nesses and our commonwealth as a whole. f 
IN HONOR OF MR. FREDERICK VAN HOOSE’S FORTY YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Frederick Van Hoose, Executive Director of the Northwest Field Office of SourceAmerica, who is retiring after 40 years of service. Mr. Van Hoose grew up in the agricultural heartland of eastern Washington, where he learned at a young age the value of honest work. He also came to understand work as a social connection—an activity that, in bringing people together for a common purpose, vali-dates our collective worth and impact on each other. After receiving his bachelor’s degree from Central Washington University and his MBA from City University of Seattle, Mr. Van Hoose built a career centered on the needs of persons living with disabilities. As an executive manager at Provident Industries in Yakima, Washington, and Northwest Center Industries in Seattle, he developed employment opportu-nities that increased the quality of life for hun-dreds of workers with disabilities. In March 1997, Mr. Van Hoose secured a position as an Operations Manager with Na-tional Industries for the Severely Handi-capped—now SourceAmerica—a non-profit agency that works through the provisions of the Javits-Wagner-O’Day Act to facilitate meaningful employment for persons living with disabilities. Mr. Van Hoose has helped scores of non-profit agencies build business systems to expand their capacity to compete for con-tracts, and he has worked with Federal pro-curement professionals to find contracting so-lutions that enhanced the double bottom line: quality services and products for a fair price, while supporting access to employment for persons living with disabilities. During his tenure with SourceAmerica, Mr. Van Hoose has served as a model of the self-less spirit and inspired leadership that has helped the program grow to employ many indi-viduals living with the full range of disabling conditions, including many wounded warriors. Mr. Van Hoose’s dedication to enhancing the lives of Americans living with disabilities ex-tends to his personal life, as he serves as guardian to a man living with a severe dis-ability. For his years of dedicated service, it is ap-propriate to express our deep appreciation for Frederick Van Hoose’s long and exceptional career and his outstanding volunteer service, and to wish him well on his retirement. f 
CONGRATULATING NIEMANN FOODS’ 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. L
AHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to honor Niemann Foods as they cele-brate one hundred years of business. In 1917, brothers Ferd Sr. and Steve Niemann achieved the American dream by opening their first grocery store, Niemann Brothers, in Quincy, Illinois. By providing qual-ity produce, goods, and customer service, the Niemanns afforded the opportunity to expand their operations to thirty grocery stores by 1930. One decade later, the Neimann brothers opened Quincy’s first full service supermarket, Food Center, which was open seven days a week. Food Center became the heart of the town and was the beginning of the area’s modern shopping tradition. Today, Niemann Foods, an ESOP company, provides employ-ment for over 5000 hard-working people spread throughout their retail banners, which include County Market, Save-A-Lot, Ace Hard-ware, Pet Supplies Plus and Haymakers con-venience stores. As the Niemann tradition continues to thrive, consumers can find their quality products and customer service at more than one hundred stores all across the Mid-west. For one hundred years, Niemann Foods has given back to their community through hard work, generosity, and their commitment to helping others. Without a doubt, Niemann Foods is a staple of Illinois’ 18th District and I am proud to consider them our neighbors. Congratulations to Niemann Foods on a pros-perous century and I wish them one hundred more years of success.

IN RECOGNITION OF BYRON BUNK-ER FOR BEING NAMED A FINAL-IST FOR THE SAMUEL J. HEYMAN SERVICE TO AMERICA MEDAL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Byron Bunker for being named a fi-nalist for the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal. Mr. Bunker’s work as Director of Compliance Programs for the Environ-mental Protection Agency was key to uncover-ing Volkswagen Group’s automotive emissions evasion scheme and safeguarding public health. Since 1999, Mr. Bunker has worked for the EPA’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which con-ducts tests to certify that vehicles and engines meet the United States’ emissions and fuel economy standards. As Director of the NVFEL’s Compliance Division, Mr. Bunker tests automobiles and their components to en-sure that they comply with clean air regula-tions. Working in conjunction with academic researchers and other federal officials, Mr. Bunker helped uncover and halt a scheme by Volkswagen to evade emissions standards through the use of software designed to inten-tionally fool regulators about the true emis-sions levels of its diesel vehicles. This dis-covery eventually resulted in the largest pen-alty ever levied against a car manufacturer and helped lay the foundation for additional criminal investigations. These have resulted in $4.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties, as well as indictments against Volkswagen ex-ecutives. Mr. Bunker’s expertise and tireless efforts played a critical role in uncovering this wrong-doing and underscore the importance of the EPA’s enforcement efforts. As a result of Mr. Bunker’s work, the EPA was not only able to detect a sophisticated and widespread emis-sions evasion scheme, but also strengthen its testing procedures to prevent similar decep-tions in the future. Through his rigorous work and collaboration with other officials in the EPA, Mr. Bunker has been an important driver of efforts to protect Americans’ health and the environment, and it is my hope that he con-tinues to effectively safeguard public health and safety in the years ahead. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Byron Bunker for being named a finalist for the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal. Mr. Bunker’s rigorous enforce-ment work has been important in protecting public health and safety.

HONORING NEAL A. D EANGELO 
HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I honor my good friend, Neal DeAngelo, and congratulate him on being named the 2017 Distinguished Citizen of the Year by the Greater Hazleton Area Boy Scouts. With years of success with his family business, and his commitment to giving back to Hazleton and the broader community of Pennsylvania’s 11th district, it comes as no surprise to me that he has been chosen to re-ceive this honor. Neal has been an instrumental figure in the Hazleton community. I can say with certainty that there are few people who have done as much for Hazleton as Neal. He has served on the boards of several non-profit organizations, including the YMCA and United Way. He has also served as the President of the Profes-sional Lawn Care Association of America, and is a founding member of the State Associa-tion, for which he also served as President. Neal has been a longtime supporter of Scout-ing in the Greater Hazleton Area. Through his generosity and commitment, Neal has helped make a positive difference in the lives of more than 500 young men throughout our commu-nity, providing them with an opportunity to par-ticipate in Scouting’s character-building and leadership programs. Not only is Neal one of the most charitable people I know, he is also a well-respected businessman. Neal co-founded DBI Services with his brother in 1978 and grew the com-pany into an international diversified services enterprise, exceeding $250 million annually with a global network of over 50 locations and 1,800 employees. His hard work made it pos-sible for his company to spur growth in and bring quality service to Hazleton, as well as the rest of the Commonwealth. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Neal for all he has contributed to the Hazleton community and once again congratulating him on being recognized as the Greater Hazleton Area Boy Scouts’ 2017 Distinguished Citizen of the Year. f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FRANCIS R. LUDOVICI 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Francis R. Ludovici, a beloved member of the Upper Southampton, Pennsylvania community who passed away on Saturday April 29, 2017. Mr. Ludovici—Frankie to his friends—was a Combat Engineer in the U.S. Army Reserve, a builder, a business owner, and a family man. When he wasn’t renovating and flipping houses, his passion, he was selling pinball machines and poker tables, a business he took over from his father before him. Frankie loved his community in Upper Southampton and they loved him back. His presence will be greatly missed but his contributions will be felt for generations to come.

HONORING DR. MANUEL BACA 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the long career of public service pro-vided by an outstanding educator in my re-gion, Dr. Manuel Baca, who has served the students, staff, and faculty of Rio Hondo Col-lege with distinction for the past 32 years. Dr. Baca has been an invaluable resource to me and my staff, and will be truly missed at Rio Hondo College. Dr. Baca has served in many capacities as Professor of Political Science, Director, Dean, Vice President, and Interim Superintendent/President of Rio Hondo College. He also serves on the Board of Trust-ees of one of the largest community colleges in the Country, Mt. San Antonio College, and is the immediate past President of the Cali-fornia Community Colleges Board of Gov-ernors. I have been privileged to work with Dr. Baca in numerous areas that have improved edu-cational opportunities for students and the needs of our region. We have worked together on expanding transit services to the student body and staff by offering free and reduced price transit passes and buying shuttle buses for enhanced connectivity, Dr. Baca has sup-ported the growth of Rio Hondo College’s po-lice, fire and first responder training programs that have benefited the greater Los Angeles Community by providing a well-educated work-force for our public safety agencies. I am particularly thankful for the work Dr. Baca has done to increase educational oppor-tunities at Rio Hondo College for veterans. As a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, Dr. Baca understood the important role Rio Hondo College could play in helping post-9/11 veterans and all veterans receive workforce training and other services to start new ca-reers and assimilate into civilian life. In addi-tion, Dr. Baca has assisted in organizing vet-eran student summits throughout the State of California. Our nation is grateful for Dr. Baca’s service as a Marine and his continued service to the men and women of our military. Dr. Baca has been a role model and leader in opening up opportunities for Latino/a stu-dents by advocating for legislation at the state and federal level to support Hispanic-Serving Institutions. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Rio Hondo College Community and the many people he has impacted in the greater Los Angeles Re-gion, I ask my colleagues to join me in con-gratulating Dr. Manuel Baca on his retirement, and thanking him for his long career of public service to Rio Hondo College, the State of California and our nation. f

it. The organization combined with several other service-oriented groups over the years to better serve its constituency of women in need while continuing to offer low-cost, women-friendly counseling and support serv-ices. Today, the Women’s Center, based out of Ann Arbor, Michigan, builds on this legacy, offering divorce support, job coaching, per-sonal counseling, and other services through its staff of social workers, graduate interns and community volunteers. Collectively, these indi-viduals help the Women’s Center provide di-rect services to approximately 500 individuals each year, as well as referral services to over 1,000 other individuals to access additional community resources. The assistance provided by the staff and volunteers of the Women’s Center provides professional services that build confidence, strengthen connections and create positive en-ergy. Women find a network and gain access at a low affordable cost to therapists, job coaches, legal aid, divorce specialists, finan-cial advisors and other important tools they need for support and success. The Women’s Center’s unique approach and comprehensive resources have empowered countless women to address issues in a confidential and spe-cialized setting, and it is my hope that the Center continues to build on its legacy of suc-cess. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Women’s Center of South-eastern Michigan on its 17th annual Swing into Spring fundraiser. The Women’s Center offers important services and supports to women in need.

RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL ROOFING CONTRACTORS ASSO-CIATION AND NATIONAL ROOF-ING WEEK 
HON. RANDY HULTGREN 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) headquartered in Rose-mont, Illinois, and its efforts to designate the week of June 4–10, 2017 as National Roofing Week. The roof is one of the most important com-ponents of any home or business. It is the first line of defense against natural elements, such as rain, snow or wind, and yet it is often taken for granted until it falls into disrepair. National Roofing Week honors the thousands of roofing contractors and roofing-related businesses across the country and the industry’s commit-ment to public service. National Roofing Week is a valuable reminder of the significance qual-ity roofing has on every home and business in the United States. Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the na-tion’s oldest trade associations and the voice of professional roofing contractors worldwide. Today, the NRCA has more than 3,800 mem-bers located across all 50 states and rep-resents a variety of industry stakeholders, in-cluding roofing, roof deck, and water proofing contractors. Using its vast network of roofing contractors and industry-related members, NRCA is responsible for the installation of a majority of new construction and replacement roof systems on commercial and residential structures in America. Most of its members are small, privately-held businesses that pro-vide high-paying jobs for thousands of hard- working families and individuals that are the backbone of our economy. Professional roofing contractors provide vital services to their communities, both on and off the clock, in all 50 states. NRCA members will recognize National Roofing Week on June 4– 10 by supporting numerous charitable commu-nity service roofing projects throughout the na-tion. I commend the NRCA and the vital role the organization and its members play in every community and I ask all my colleagues to join me in acknowledging their contributions during National Roofing Week. f 
INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘KEEP OUR PENSION PROMISES ACT’’ 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today I reintro-duce the Keep Our Pension Promises Act to reinstate the long standing federal law and principal that prohibited cuts to private pension benefits in plans for retirees. Pensions are one of the surest means to af-ford millions of middle class families’ security in retirement. They have allowed millions of Americans to enjoy their golden years without fear that they have not saved enough. For decades, pensions guaranteed our senior citi-zens the peace of mind that a check would ar-rive every month for as long as they live: this is true retirement security. But in December 2014, Congress uprooted this security for millions of retirees. At the last minute, in a must pass funding bill, Congress included the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act (MPRA) eviscerating this protection. With little understanding of what the provisions meant, Congress changed a forty year old pension law that ensured retirees were given the highest level of pension-defense. The Em-ployee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, allowed for pension benefits in multi-employer plans to be cut only when a plan runs out of money—and even then, the retiree benefits should face cuts last. This held true because it was the right thing to do. Pensions are not handouts, they are de-ferred wages earned over a lifetime of hard work. An estimated 1.5 million participants, in-cluding retirees, are in multiemployer pension plans that are in danger of running out of money in the near future. The passage of MPRA allowed for the first time, benefits of current retirees to be cut in an attempt to ad-dress the fiscal distress confronting some of these multiemployer plans. This was wrong then, and remains a blem-ish on the Congressional record that little ac-tion has been taken to correct the undue bur-den it placed on retirees. That’s why today I introduce the ‘‘Keep Our Pension Promises Act’’ with Senator B
ERNIE SANDERS of Vermont. This Act corrects the injustices bestowed upon our most vulnerable retirees by restoring anti-cutback rules so retirees in financially troubled multiemployer pension plans are pro-tected from having their earned benefits cut. It will allow plans to partition off ‘‘orphaned’’ participants into a separate plan, giving partici-pating employers relief from shouldering the full financial burden and risk of underfunded ‘‘orphaned’’ participants—ensuring the ability for plans to become financially secure once more. This bill recognizes funding is the ultimate concern. It shores up the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp and creates a legacy fund to ensure participants in partitioned plans will continue to receive the benefits they depend upon. The costs to create this fund are cov-ered by closing tax loopholes the very wealthy use to avoid taxes on like-kind exchanges and supersized IRA accounts that hold millions, despite laws that limit accounts to much small-er tax deductible amounts. Further the bill ensures pension obligations are prioritized during bankruptcies, which will help the remaining employers in the plan by making it less likely they become responsible for underfunded orphan plans. Over the past few years the retirees facing these cuts mobilized. They organized dozens of committees to spread the message of how damaging the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act has and will be to their lives and financial security. The Keep Our Pension Promises Act recognizes shared sacrifice is the appropriate course of action to save the golden years of retirement for these retirees. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure and cor-rect the misguided action of passage of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF JAYNE HOMCO FOR HER DISTINGUISHED CA-REER AND WORK IN THE COM-MUNITY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jayne Homco for her outstanding achievements and career with Kroger Co. As president of Kroger’s Michigan division, Ms. Homco’s leadership and business expertise have helped make Kroger one of America’s premier companies. After graduating from Indiana University, Ms. Homco joined Kroger in 1978 and has served with the company in a variety of roles. She was named co-manager of an Indianap-olis store before she turned thirty, and has held management positions with five different divisions within the company across six states. Prior to being named president of Kroger Michigan, Ms. Homco served as vice president of merchandising for Kroger’s Southwest divi-sion, where she oversaw merchandising for over 200 Kroger supermarkets. In her current role, Ms. Homco leads a division of 16,000 Michigan employees across over 100 stores, which collectively account for billions of dollars in revenue each year. Ms. Homco’s pioneering career has helped her break down barriers for women in the workplace while providing outstanding leader-ship for Kroger Co. During her career, Ms. Homco became the first woman vice president at Kroger’s Dillion’s and QFC divisions. Addi-tionally, she is active in the Michigan business community, serving as a board member of the

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jayne Homco for her work with Kroger Co. and in the community. Ms. Homco has been an effective leader as President of Kroger’s Michigan Division while working on behalf of the southeast Michigan community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PAY EQUITY FOR ALL ACT OF 2017 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to intro-duce the Pay Equity for All Act of 2017, a bill that will help eliminate the gender and racial pay gap by prohibiting employers from asking job applicants for their salary history before making a job or salary offer. Representatives R
OSA DELAURO , JERROLD NADLER , and J ACKIE  S
PEIER are original cosponsors of the bill. Even though many employers may not inten-tionally discriminate against applicants or em-ployees based on gender, race or ethnicity, setting wages based on salary history can re-inforce the wage gap. Members of historically disadvantaged groups often start out their ca-reers with unfair and artificially low wages compared to their white male counterparts, and the disparities are compounded from job to job throughout their careers. Our bill will ensure that applicants’ salaries are based on their skills and merit, not on a potentially problematic salary history, by as-sessing penalties against employers who ask applicants for their salary history during the interview process or as a condition of employ-ment. It would also provide job applicants and employees with a private right of action against employers who violate these provi-sions. Although the wage gap has decreased for some women, it still persists for women and men of color with similar skill sets. There is much work to be done to address the wage gap for everyone, and our bill is just one step toward that goal. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING THE DEDICATED SERV-ICE AND SELFLESS SACRIFICE OF STAFF SERGEANT MARK R. DE ALENCAR 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is with both pro-found sadness and deep gratitude that I rise to pay tribute to a fallen decorated American hero. On April 8, 2017, Staff Sergeant Mark R. De Alencar, who was assigned to Bravo Com-pany, 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, tragically suc-cumbed to injuries received from small arms fire in support of Operation Freedom’s Sen-tinel in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. Staff Sgt. De Alencar was 37 years old, but lived a lifetime marked by and full of service. Born in a U.S. Army hospital in Nuremburg, Germany, Staff Sgt. De Alencar’s childhood followed his father’s military career. Grad-uating from Joppatowne High School, Joppa, Maryland, in 1998, he then worked odd jobs before becoming a carpenter. But it was in 2009, that he choose to follow in his father’s footsteps and joined the U.S. Army. After attending Basic Combat Training and Cannon Crewmember (13B) Advanced Indi-vidual Training (AIT) at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Staff Sgt. De Alencar was assigned to Bravo Battery, 2nd Battalion, 11th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. After arrival, he was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn. Staff Sgt. De Alencar later attended Ranger School, graduated, and re-classed as an Infantryman (11B). During his time at Schofield Barracks, he served as Fire Team Leader, Rifle Squad Leader, and attended multiple training events with partnered forces throughout the Pacific; including Australian Jungle Operations, Operation Cobra Gold in Thailand, and multiple rotations to the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California. In September 2016, Staff Sgt. De Alencar graduated from the Special Operations Quali-fication Course earning the qualification as a Weapons Sergeant (18B) and was assigned to Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Staff Sgt. De Alencar’s military education in-cludes Basic Leaders Course, Advanced Leaders Course, Jungle Operations Course, Ranger School, Airborne School, Air Assault School, Special Forces Qualification Course, and Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape School. Staff Sgt. De Alencar’s awards and decora-tions include the Army Commendation Medal with five Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Achieve-ment Medal with 6 Oak Leaf Clusters, Meri-torious Unit Citation, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal with two Campaign Stars, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Non Commissioned Officer Professional Develop-ment Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Expert Infantryman’s Badge, Special Forces Tab, Ranger Tab, B Badge, and the Drivers Badge. As exemplified by his extraordinary heroism, Staff Sgt. De Alencar’s life stands as a testa-ment that freedom is not free, and his legacy will echo in time as an example of the ultimate sacrifice made in the name of freedom On be-half of a humble and grateful Nation, I hope the De Alencar family will find solace in know-ing their support, love, and counsel helped make him the hero he became both in uniform and as a father. I pray that God will be with Mark’s wife, Natasha; sons, Rodrigo and Marcos; stepson, Deshaun; daughter, Tatiyana; stepdaughter, Octavia and all their family and friends during this time of great mourning and may God continue to bless the United States of America. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF KEN FISCHER FOR 30 YEARS OF SERVICE ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY MUSICAL SOCIETY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ken Fischer for his 30 years as President of the University of Michigan’s Uni-versity Musical Society. Under Mr. Fischer’s leadership, UMS has become one of the lead-ing performing arts organizations in the coun-try, brought some of the world’s top per-formers and artists to the University of Michi-gan, and provided unparalleled cultural and ar-tistic opportunities at the University and to the southeast Michigan community. Mr. Fischer has been the President of UMS since 1987. During these years, Mr. Fischer has helped the UMS grow and expand its ar-tistic offerings to the wider southeast Michigan community by attracting world-class per-formers to UMS, including the Royal Shake-speare Company and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. In addition, UMS has partnered with local communities to expand access to the arts. He has done extensive work with metro Detroit’s Arab American community, which launched a multiyear program to show-case art from different regions and cultures. Under Mr. Fischer’s direction, UMS has also commissioned many new works, sponsored artist residences, and organized collaborative performances with local, national and inter-national artists. Mr. Fischer’s outstanding tenure has posi-tioned UMS for success in the coming years. In addition to introducing new programs and expanding the organization’s outreach to stu-dents and new members of the southeast Michigan community, Mr. Fischer has also grown the organization’s development efforts to support these new initiatives. Since appoint-ing Mr. Fischer as President, UMS’s budget has increased fourfold, allowing it to reach new audiences. Mr. Fischer has also worked to further intercultural understanding by serv-ing as a speaker and cultural ambassador to Brazil, China, Lithuania and Mexico under the direction of the U.S. State Department. Be-cause of Mr. Fischer’s outstanding leadership for three decades, UMS was chosen as a 2014 recipient of the National Medal of the Arts, which is awarded by the President of the United States to organizations that have dem-onstrated artistic excellence. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ken Fischer for his 30 years of success as President of the University of Michigan’s University Musical Society.
