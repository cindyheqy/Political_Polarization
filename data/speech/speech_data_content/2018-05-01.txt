Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a trailblazer, changemaker and beloved leader: San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Doris Ward. Doris was a woman of extraordinary spirit and positivity who never let a closed door deter her. Throughout her 40 years of leadership—at lunch counters and on the NAACP’s Metropolitan Council, as a school administrator and a community leader—she fought fearlessly to knock down barriers to equality and justice. A former teacher herself, Doris was a passionate advocate for our schools and believed deeply in the power of education to help all Americans climb the ladders of opportunity in our nation. Doris was a pioneer, making history as the first African American to serve as President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. As a leader of our city, she both embodied and championed the San Francisco values of equality, fairness and respect for diversity. Her strong leadership to expand affordable housing, support minorityled businesses and improve oversight of the police force continues to ensure that San Francisco remain a welcoming home to all. Doris was a great friend to our most underserved neighborhoods, and a great inspiration for women, communities of color and young people across our city and country. San Franciscans have been blessed by the leadership of Doris Ward. We will deeply miss her warmth, positivity and joyous spirit. May it bring some measure of comfort to Doris’ many friends and loved ones that so many remember and celebrate Doris’ life and legacy. 
HONORING THE ARVINEDISON WATER STORAGE DISTRICT FOR 75 YEARS OF SERVICE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the ArvinEdison Water Storage District. Established in 1942 to serve the booming agricultural industry in the southeastern portion of California’s San Joaquin Valley, the ArvinEdison Water Storage District has played an essential role in making Kern County the number one agricultural producer in the United States. The District provides water to over 131,000 acres of agricultural land in Kern County, from both surface water through the Central Valley Project’s Friant Unit as well as from groundwater. The water irrigates tens of thousands of acres of almonds, carrots, citrus, grapes, potatoes, and other annual crops with a value exceeding $1 billion in 2016. And in true California fashion of never letting a drop of water go to waste, the water the District provides to irrigate these and other crops results from a true conjunctive use process—District also recharges the underground aquifer to help stabilize groundwater levels in a region that relies on well water as a primary source of irrigation. To accommodate Kern County’s everexpanding agricultural industry and variable surface water supplies, the District has had to take innovative approaches to water management and storage. For instance, when times are good and water is flowing from rain and melting snow, the District developed a network of groundwater banking programs connected by miles of canals and pipes to capture this water for use in dry years. This approach helped our communities and farmers weather the recent multiyear catastrophic drought in California, ensuring that they were able to access lifegiving water. In 1997, the District entered into a 25year agreement with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California that has empowered the District to complete capital improvement projects without increasing water costs to Kern County farmers, including expansion of the aforementioned water banks. I am proud of the work accomplished by the ArvinEdison Water Storage District, currently led by President Edwin Camp, EngineerManager Jeevan Muhar, Deputy General Manager David Nixon, Director of Water Resources Steven Collup, General Superintendent Christopher Krauter, and Directors Ronald Lehr, Jeffrey Guimarra, Derek Yurosek, Dennis Johnston, John Moore, Charles Fanucchi, Catalino Martinez, and Kevin Pascoe. They and their predecessors’ efforts have made a lasting impact on our community which will continue to play a critical role in the lives of Kern County farmers and those who enjoy the products they grow. The ArvinEdison Water Storage District’s role in shaping the face of American agriculture cannot be understated, and I wish the District another 75 years of success. f 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Michael Langberg, Senior Vice President and Chief Clinical Officer of Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. Dr. Langberg will retire from his post at Cedars in May, after having served the patients of Los Angeles and, in fact, patients around the nation, since 1981. He leaves behind a legacy of better quality care, improved health policy, and collaboration with hospitals around the country to make care safer, particularly for those of limited means or with complex medical needs. Dr. Langberg is a highly respected national leader on patient safety and health care quality. When the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services crafted the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, he led the work at the American Hospital Association to understand the proposed policy, identify potential unintended consequences—especially those potentially affecting poorer communities—and convey those issues to CMS so that the agency could refine its approach and improve the program. His work laid the foundation for the provision in the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act that directed CMS to include an adjustment to the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program to recognize the impact of sociodemographic factors on readmission rates. Dr. Langberg has testified before this body on patient safety and quality issues and before the California Senate on physician quality performance—all in an effort to help legislators craft better public policy that supports improvement in health and health care. He is a permanent member of the California Department of Public Health’s health careassociated infection advisory committee, seeking to prevent the emergence and spread of infections in my state, and he serves on the Board of Directors of the Hospital Quality Institute in California. Dr. Langberg has been an advocate for sharing both successes and failures in an effort to disseminate best practices and advance improvements in quality and safety. He has been an invited speaker at the Health Management Academy, the National Patient Safety Congress, and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. By freely speaking of both the successes and challenges encountered by this nationally esteemed hospital, Dr. Langberg has helped many other hospitals across this nation learn how to keep patients safe, improve the quality of the care they deliver, and be attentive to health risks patients may experience after they have left the hospital, particularly poorer patients and those who live in communities with relatively few health care providers. For these reasons, I am delighted to recognize Dr. Michael Langberg and offer thanks for his dedication and service. f 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of Douglas County Fair and Rodeo. Since the First Annual Fair 
in 1918, the Douglas County Fair and Rodeo has been a hallmark of our great state. With families from the Front Range and beyond, traveling to see Colorado’s agriculture and livestock on full display. The diligent work of the Douglas County Fair Foundation is what keeps this timehonored tradition going strong. With tens of thousands in attendance the achievement and hard work of the local volunteers is selfevident. The community benefits include immense support of local business, family entertainment and a focus on agricultural education for farmers and ranchers across the state. On behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Colorado, I applaud the Douglas County Fair and Rodeo that honors our rich agricultural and ranching roots. We look forward to their continued success as they keep this strong western tradition alive. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to celebrate the centennial celebration of the Douglas County Fair and Rodeo. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 300TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JONATHAN DUNHAM HOUSE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with the Trinity Episcopal Church congregation and the Woodbridge community in celebrating the 300th anniversary of the Jonathan Dunham House. This incredible milestone and the history of this site is truly deserving of this body’s recognition. One of the oldest properties in Woodbridge, New Jersey, the Jonathan Dunham House is an incredible historical marker in the township. In addition to its ownership by the Dunham family and Trinity Episcopal Church, the house was also once owned by the Barron family, another wellknown and renowned family of the township. The rectory of Trinity Episcopal Church, the Jonathan Dunham House is part of the church’s national and state historic registry listing. Built in the 1700s as a residence by Jonathan Dunham, an ancestor of former President Barack Obama, the Jonathan Dunham House became the church’s rectory in 1873. Purchased in 1872 by George Hance, Senior Warden of the church, the Jonathan Dunham House was donated to Trinity after a year of renovations that updated and enlarged the property. Begun in 2014 and recently completed, the rectory was once again renovated in order to restore the property. The site has continually served as the church’s rectory since its acquisition. Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in marking the 300th anniversary of the Jonathan Dunham House and thanking the church, congregants and community volunteers for their dedicated work to preserve this historic site. HONORING MRS. TAMMIE JO SHULTS HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Tammie Jo Shults, the pilot of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 on April 17th, whose heroic actions saved many lives. A New Mexico native, Mrs. Shults demonstrated bravery and composure as she safely guided her Boeing 737 to the ground after one of its engines exploded. While we mourn the loss of beloved Albuquerque native Jennifer Riordan, we are grateful that Mrs. Shults’ extraordinary actions under pressure helped prevent an even greater tragedy. In addition to her lifesaving actions on April 17th, Mrs. Shults was a trail blazer in the U.S. Navy. After combat exclusion laws for women were repealed, Mrs. Shults became one of the first female fighter pilots. Despite facing adversity and unequal treatment due to her gender, Mrs. Shults eventually earned the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my gratitude to Mrs. Tammie Jo Shults for her years of service to our country and her extraordinary, livesaving heroism aboard Southwest Airlines Flight 1380. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Cindy Koedoot and the lasting impact she has had on countless students at Zeeland Public Schools. Throughout her career, Cindy has worked tirelessly as a Special Education teacher, selflessly committing herself to instructing and preparing her students for the future. Over the course of her teaching career, Cindy has personally developed and designed various field trips and unique learning opportunities for her students. One of the programs Cindy designed offered students the opportunity to learn to craft rugs, blankets, and other items that would then be sold by the students at trade shows. These types of experiences taught the students not only the values of crafting and hard work, but also the entrepreneurial skills that can define success well beyond the classroom. For over 25 years, Cindy coordinated trips to Washington, D.C. for Zeeland Public School students. With her careful attention to every detail involved in these trips, including reservations for hotels and airlines, loading metro passes, and scheduling activities in and around Washington, D.C., Cindy created opportunities and lifelong memories for students from all walks of life. Mr. Speaker, Cindy Koedoot spent her life working diligently to educate and mentor the students of Zeeland, Michigan. It is thus fitting and proper that we celebrate her service and dedication here today. I extend my deepest gratitude and congratulations to Cindy for her decades of selfless service. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the ArvinEdison Water Storage District in celebration of its 75th Anniversary of providing muchneeded water to communities across the southeastern San Joaquin Valley. Organized in 1942, the ArvinEdison Water Storage District (AEWSD) entered into its first agreement with the United States Bureau of Reclamation twenty years later in 1962. Today, the Water District consists is tasked with managing, treating, acquiring, and supplying water to 131,660 acres of agricultural land in Southeast Kern County, California. Between 1964 and 1968, with support from the Bureau of Reclamation, the District constructed its primary water distribution facilities. Since then, AEWSD has continued to invest in its infrastructure to provide reliable water supply to its members. Among its various infrastructure projects, the District constructed its Tejon Spreading Basin in 1972, the North Canal Spreading Basin in 1999, and various new wells between 1996 and 1998. The ArvinEdison Water Storage District is comprised of approximately 132,000 acres of land, encompassing more than 113,000 acres of irrigated crops including vineyards, almonds, citrus, and carrots, to name a few. In 2016, the AEWSD supported over 1.1 billion dollars in agricultural products, nearly twenty percent of agricultural commandeers grown in Kern County. Today, the ArvinEdison Water Storage District is led by President Edwin Camp, Vice President Jeffrey G. Giumarra, and Secretary John C. Moore. The District’s current Board of Directors also includes Ronald R. Lehr, Howard R. Frick, Dennis B. Johnson, Charles Fanucchi, Catalino M. Martinez, and Kevin E. Pascoe. Among the District’s operations staff are EngineerManager Jeevan S. Muhar, Deputy General Manager David A. Nixon, Director of Water Resources Steven C. Collup, and General Superintendent Christopher P. Krauter.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the service of Dr. Jason Chao to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO), and I congratulate him on his retirement. Dr. Chao, Primary Advisor to the Ambassador of the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC), has been serving TECRO for the past 25 years. Throughout his esteemed career, he has been the chief congressional liaison officer and the principal escort officer for congressional delegation trips. Many Members of Congress and congressional staff have learned more about Taiwan because of Jason’s work. Dr. Chao has consistently shown wisdom, professionalism, passion, and dedication during his many years of service. He has also been instrumental in helping steer the promotion of bilateral relations and the exchange of cultural and economic growth between the ROC and the United States. We will miss Dr. Chao, but we are excited for his future endeavors and we offer him our sincere thanks for his many contributions to the U.S.Taiwan relationship. f

Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I rise to commend numerous exceptional leaders from Indiana who were honored as the Northwest Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame Class of 2018. While there were many deserving nominees, this year’s inductees include Dr. Vidya Kora, Bill Hasse, Jeff Strack, Terry McMahon, Scott Albanese, and MonoSol. For their many contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana and beyond, these honorees were recognized at the 11th Annual Induction Ceremony on Tuesday, May 1, 2018, at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. The Honorable Eric Holcomb, Governor of the State of Indiana, served as the keynote speaker for this special event. Dr. Vidya Kora is a general internist with the Franklin Clinic of Michigan City and also serves as a LaPorte County Commissioner. In addition, Dr. Kora is involved in numerous civic, charitable, and professional organizations. His numerous accomplishments are to be commended. Notably, Dr. Kora was especially influential while helping former Governor Mitch Daniels and state legislators expand Indiana’s Medicaid program through the implementation of the Healthy Indiana Plan. Dr. Kora has also worked tirelessly to improve the school system in Michigan City and has assisted with establishing a public transportation system, which connects Michigan City, La Porte, and Westville. A longtime area physician, Dr. Kora opened his Michigan City medical practice in 1986 and has maintained an outstanding reputation in his field and his community since that time. William ‘‘Bill’’ Hasse III became the third generation owner and president of Hasse Construction Company, Incorporated in 1984, after the death of his father, William A. Hasse Jr. Due to his strong leadership and devotion, Bill has been successful in growing the family business. In the 1990’s, Hasse Construction diversified and acquired public projects, including municipal and school projects, underground utility work, and projects in the healthcare industry. In addition, Mr. Hasse has continuously given back to the community through his work with the Lake County Economic Alliance, Hospice of the Calumet Area, and the Hammond YMCA, among others. 
Jeff Strack is the President and CEO of Indiana Grocery Group/Strack & Van Til. Last year, when the parent company Central Grocers filed for bankruptcy, Strack & Van Til was forced to shut down numerous stores. Jeff was not going to lose the family business that has been around for almost six decades. After he and a group of investors formed Indiana Grocery Group and put together a successful bid to buy back Strack & Van Til, Mr. Strack vowed to keep it a familyowned business. Today, under Jeff’s leadership, the grocery chain has twenty locations in communities throughout Northwest Indiana. In addition, Mr. Strack is focused on providing good jobs and assisting charitable organizations throughout the region. Terry McMahon is the owner and president of the successful accounting firm, McMahon and Associates, in Munster. Terry started his company in the 1970’s with only himself and a parttime typist. Munster was a growing community at that time, and as the town developed, the company continued to grow. Today, McMahon and Associates consists of thirty employees and three partners, serving 600 businesses and handling approximately 1,300 personal income tax returns. Terry attributes his success to the development of positive relationships with clients and his outstanding employees. In addition, Mr. McMahon is known for his generosity and gives back to the community through various charitable endeavors. In 1983, Scott Albanese, owner and CEO of the Albanese Confectionery Group, opened his first candy store in Merrillville. After years of hard work and dedication, in 2000, Scott opened his second location, which has become the successful and popular Albanese Candy Factory and Outlet Store in Hobart. Under Mr. Albanese’s direction, the company manufactures its own products, operates internationally, and continues to grow. The recipient of the Enterprise of the Year Award is Mono Sol, a division of Kuraray, a Japanese company that acquired the business in 2012. MonoSol produces a patented water soluble film used in numerous products and markets. Operating since 1953, the company has grown exponentially since the TidePod was introduced by Proctor & Gamble in 2012. Under the direction of its CEO, P. Scott Bening, MonoSol has doubled its workforce since 2012 and is currently headquartered in Merrillville. MonoSol also maintains a plant in La Porte and two manufacturing facilities currently located in Portage. The company has diversified into other areas of its market including agricultural and packaging materials, as well as synthetic marble for stone products used in home construction. MonoSol has been a tremendous asset to the community of Northwest Indiana, and Mr. Bening is focused on growing the company in the region, a community of which he is very proud to be a part. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these dedicated leaders and organizations upon their induction into the Northwest Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame. They are truly deserving of this honor, and for their exceptional leadership and commitment to the region and beyond, each of them is worthy of the highest praise. TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF JOHN DESIMONE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, John DeSimone, for his exemplary Military service during the Korean war, and his steadfast commitment to his family and his community. Born in New York City on June 3, 1931, John DeSimone lived in lower Manhattan until he moved to Astoria in 1969 with his wife, Mary Ellen Sapanaro DeSimone. They were married for 45 years until her passing in 2015. They share a daughter, Maria, who lives with her husband in a separate apartment of the same home. On November 15, 1951, John DeSimone was drafted and entered the U.S. Army. He completed Army Basic Training at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey, now known as Fort Dix, and served in the Transportation Corps of the U.S. Army in the 13th Field Artillery Regiment, Ordnance Transportation Company. Private First Class DeSimone served with honor and conducted assigned tasks above the call of duty in combat conditions. PFC DeSimone was decorated with the National Defense Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, and the Merit Unit Commendation. He was awarded three Bronze Stars with his Korean Service Medal for exceptionally meritorious service in support during the most hostile period of the Korean war. PFC DeSimone’s outstanding performance, expertise, and unwavering commitment to mission accomplishment in a hostile environment were vital to successful combat operations. His contributions and dedication to duty are in keeping with the finest traditions of the armed forces and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army. He was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army on November 4, 1953 after serving 1 year, 11 months, and 20 days. Prior to his service, John DeSimone had worked as a runner for the New York Stock Exchange and later returned to the NYSE following his honorable discharge. He worked as a runner for the NYSE for forty more years. After retiring, Mr. DeSimone continued to serve others as a school crossing guard for fifteen years and an Elder in Steinway Reformed Church, where he was involved with the Ministry as a devout Protestant. When he later developed Alzheimer’s, Mr. DeSimone began attending day programs at Sunnyside Community Service and NYU Horticultural program, where he was actively involved. Mr. Speaker, John DeSimone’s service to his family, his community, and his country is an inspiration to all of us. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring my constituent, John DeSimone, and thank him for his service. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Kevin Kremer, and his tireless devotion to educating and training students.

As a cross country and track & field coach, Kevin has inspired student athletes to reach their fullest potential while instilling in them a teamfirst attitude. For 18 years Kevin coordinated trips to Washington, D.C. for Zeeland Public School students. With his careful attention to every detail involved in these trips, including reservations for hotels and airlines, loading metro passes, and scheduling activities in and around Washington, D.C., Kevin created opportunities and lifelong memories for students from all walks of life. Mr. Speaker, Kevin Kremer dedicated his life to educating and inspiring the future leaders of this nation. It is thus fitting and proper that we celebrate and honor his service here today.

IN HONOR OF VICKIE JASMANN FOR WINNING THE 2018 WYOMING JEFFERSON AWARD 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Vickie Jasmann on winning the 2018 Wyoming Jefferson Award. She deserves to be very proud of this prestigious recognition. The Jefferson Award is the most revered award for public service in Wyoming. It was created with the goal of honoring individuals who enrich the communities and may otherwise go unnoticed. The award emphasizes the importance of serving local communities and that one person can indeed make a difference. In Wyoming, a panel of five judges independently score nominated individuals and determine four finalists, including one winner. Vickie Jasmann is a true inspiration to all who know her. She is a force for good in the Casper, Wyoming community. Her service started at a young age and only grew from there. When she was growing up, her family installed a phone line in their house for the American Cancer Society because there was no office in town. Her mother also helped start the local Relay for Life chapter. She has continued her work for the two organizations, motivated by her own battle with cancer and others she has lost along the way. Vickie also works with the American Legion Auxiliary to support her fellow veterans and serves as a foster parent. She has fostered also 200 children over 10 years, including one that she adopted. Vickie volunteers wherever she is needed, whether it be for organizations, festivals, or members of the community in need. She participates in theater productions at the Senior Center, served as a greeter at the Help the Homeless project, and was a Certified Tourist Ambassador during the Eclipse Festival. She also helps elderly members of the community with errands and picks up single mothers’ children when needed. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Vickie Jasmann for winning the 2018 Wyoming Jefferson Award and thank her for her countless contributions to her community. She deserves to be extremely proud of all her hard work and of this award. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF FIRST LADY BARBARA PIERCE BUSH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 25, 2018 Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of First Lady Barbara Pierce Bush. As our nation mourns the loss of a true patriot, an advocate for families, a treasured First Lady, a dedicated wife, mother and grandmother, we also take the time to remember the legacy Barbara Bush left behind. Barbara Bush was born in New York City in 1925 to Pauline and Marvin Pierce. She went on to marry her beloved husband, George H.W. Bush in 1945. The two recently celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary early this year. Mrs. Bush devotedly stood by her husband’s side though his military service and later supported him as he entered public service and ascended the presidency. As First Lady, moved to action by her own experience as a mother to a child with dyslexia, she used her influence to highlight the importance of family literacy. She championed this cause across our nation, helping to raise over $110 million to support family literacy programs through the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. Dedicated to her mission to end the generational cycle of illiteracy, she advocated for the passage of the National Literacy Act of 1991, which established the National Institute for Literacy and allowed libraries to serve as educational literacy center for adults. Among her big achievements was to set an example of humility and hard work for her family. In her own words, Mrs. Bush wrote, ‘‘I want to be known as a wife, a mother, a grandmother . . . that’s what I am. And I’d like to be known as someone who really cared about people . . .’’ Our nation grieves with President George H.W. Bush and the entire Bush family. Our hearts are heavy, but we are grateful that we were privileged enough to bear witness to her message of grace, civility, and patriotism. She was a true gift to our nation. I honor the incredible life and legacy of First Lady Barbara Bush. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have cosponsored H. Res. 861, urging the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. This does not mean that I would necessarily oppose an accord with North Korea that only partially achieves our objectives. f 
THE LONG ARM OF INJUSTICE: DID A U.N. COMMISSION FOUNDED TO FIGHT CORRUPTION HELP THE KREMLIN DESTROY A RUSSIAN FAMILY? 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, April 27 I chaired a hearing at the Helsinki Commission inquiring into whether a U.N. Commission founded to fight corruption worked with the Kremlin to destroy a Russian family. The Russian government regularly pursues its vendettas beyond its borders, harassing and even murdering Russian emigres abroad—people who are on the Putin circle’s target list for various reasons. The poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in England is one of the most recent examples to reach the news. The family in question is the Bitkovs, and the Kremlin’s sadistic pursuit of them is in its way just as shocking as its cruel murder of Litvinenko and the attempted murders of the Skripals. The Bitkovs are still alive today, but they have been hounded for over a decade, to the opposite end of the world, and beyond the limits of human endurance—merely for resisting Putin favorites who sought to take over their successful paper manufacturing company. More shocking, the facts of the case strongly indicate—and we will hear testimony on this today—that the United Nation’s International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, became deeply involved in the Kremlin’s persecution of the Bitkov family. Indeed that CICIG acted as the Kremlin’s operational agent in brutalizing and tormenting the Bitkov family. Congress has a special responsibility in this matter because the United States is one of the largest contributors to CICIG’s budget. There has been little congressional oversight of CICIG—it’s clearly time for that to change. In the 1990s Igor and Irina Bitkov built the Northwest Timber Company, acquiring and modernizing old factories to increase paper production. As their company grew, the Bitkovs took loans from several Russian state banks to finance further modernization. Their business prospered—grew to a value of hundreds of millions of dollars—and the family was approached by a powerful bank executive who sought to buy a majority share in the company at a significantly belowmarket rate. Other officials asked Irina to become politically involved in the President Vladimir Putin’s party. When the Bitkovs refused things got very ugly. Their 16yearold daughter, Anastasia, was kidnapped for several days, drugged, and repeatedly raped. Her parents ransomed her— paying the money to policemen, who said they were gobetweens to the kidnappers. Then the banks suddenly called in the loans, even though the Bitkovs had excellent credit. The family was threatened with imprisonment and death. Fearing for their lives, the family fled Russia. They found what they thought was legal refuge in Guatemala with the help of a Guatemalan law firm. They acquired Guatemalan passports, bought a house, learned Spanish, and gave birth to their second child, Vladimir. But the Kremlin caught up to them and VTB Bank, one of Russia’s biggest statecontrolled banks, often referred to as ‘‘Putin’s Piggy Bank,’’ filed a complaint against them in Guatemala, alleging use of false identification documents. While we don’t know exactly what transpired internally to CICIG and the Guatemalan state agencies that work with them, it appears to have been taken up by the Guatemalan state and CICIG. In any case, the Bitkov’s suddenly found themselves catapulted into what has become for them a horror without end. On January 15, 2015, Igor, Irina, Anastasia and Vladimir were awoken by an armed raid on their home—70 or so armed policemen woke them up, took them away, and spent 20 hours tearing apart their home and their office. It got much worse—the Bitkovs were put into cages for nine days. Their daughter—remember she had been kidnaped and repeatedly raped years earlier—was denied medication, now suffered a nervous breakdown. As the ordeal continued, she would later make multiple suicide attempts. Their infant son was torn away from them, not even permitted to stay with friends, and sent to an orphanage, where he sustained facial injuries, a chipped tooth, conjunctivitis, lost the ability to speak. When family friends recovered him they found that, when given food, little Vladimir immediately began hiding it under his shirt. I will not say more now about the Bitkovs harrowing ordeal—their lawyers will speak to that. Suffice it to say that Igor, Irina, and Anastasia have remained incarcerated since January 2015. In January of this year, despite an earlier appeals court ruling that the Bitkovs’ alleged offense was only administrative in nature and punishable with a fine, Igor was sentenced to 19 years in prison and Irina and Anastasia were sentenced to 14 years each. These sentences were far harsher than those given to Guatemalan officials who perpetrated the sale of passports—they are harsher than sentences given to rapists or murderers. What was CICIG’s role in all of this? What we know for a fact is this: CICIG and a special branch of the attorney general’s office worked together on the investigation and arrest of the Bitkovs—CICIG personnel participated in the raid on the Bitkovs home. Then CICIG and VTB Bank initiated and aggressively pursued the legal case against them, consistently arguing at every level of the judicial process against the Bitkovs, including against their appeal to be tried as migrants guilty of an administrative offense rather than a criminal one. CICIG—via its representative Claudia Gonzalez Orellana—defended the role of the VTB Bank in the prosecution of the Bitkovs. Oddly, CICIG never prosecuted the law firm which provided the Bitkovs with the passports that destroyed their lives. As Bill Browder testified: ‘‘Inexplicably . . . In January 2015, a criminal case against the Bitkovs was opened at the direction of CICIG. Immediately after, 70 armed police officers raided the Bitkov’s home, arrested Irina, Igor, and Anastasia and detained them in cages behind the parking garage in the main court building of Guatemala City.’’ 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor and respect that I take this time to recognize National Civil Rights Day, which was designated by the 100th United States Congress and proclaimed by President Ronald Reagan on August 12, 1987. On this historic occasion, we remember the struggle and perseverance of the brave leaders of the Civil Rights Movement who passionately fought for equal justice and opportunity under the law, while celebrating and honoring the lives of the countless individuals who tirelessly led the charge to create a better America, from President Abraham Lincoln to Susan B. Anthony to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. On this day, we also take the time to reflect on the continued efforts being made every day toward securing and protecting life and liberty for every citizen of our great nation. On August 28, 1963, Dr. King led an estimated 250,000 people in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Through his words and actions, Dr. King inspired his generation, as well as generations to come, while promoting racial equality in the United States. He was a peaceful human rights activist who denounced violence as a means to communicate. For his vision and work toward a just society, he was the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Dr. King is worthy of the highest praise and continues to be the truest example of all that is good and noble in the struggle for equality and freedom. The work of Dr. King and each individual who sought positive change during the Civil Rights Movement has strengthened the resolve of future generations. The lasting legacy of these individuals has transformed society in Northwest Indiana, throughout the United States, and beyond. At home in Northwest Indiana, our communities have, for decades, been fortunate to have outstanding leaders of all races, genders, and creeds who have led by example and dedicated themselves to the ideals inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, those of justice, equality, and freedom. Northwest Indiana is also the proud home to many community groups and individuals that have given of their time and greatest efforts to ensure that our civil rights are protected. I also congratulate the efforts of former Gary, Indiana Mayor Richard Hatcher who, in 1967, was one of two African Americans elected to serve as mayor of a large city. This marked the first time in our nation’s history that an African American would hold this office. Following his twenty years of service in this capacity, Mayor Hatcher has continued to work on many projects throughout Northwest Indiana. His proposal for the National Civil Rights Hall of Fame in Gary will honor and recognize the great contributions of those who challenged American culture and whose shoulders we currently stand on as we work to secure a truly fair, just, and tolerant society. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commemorating National Civil Rights Day. We are honored to take this time to remember those who fight so courageously for equality, and we thank them for their perseverance, sacrifice, and struggle. The significance of National Civil Rights Day will continue to hold special meaning for generations to come. f 
IN HONOR OF L EROY JOHNSON FOR BEING SELECTED AS A FINALIST FOR THE 2018 WYOMING JEFFERSON AWARD 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate LeRoy Johnson on being selected as a finalist for the 2018 Wyoming Jefferson Award. He deserves to be very proud of this prestigious recognition. The Jefferson Award is the most revered award for public service in Wyoming. It was created with the goal of honoring individuals who enrich the communities and may otherwise go unnoticed. The award emphasizes the importance of serving local communities and that one person can indeed make a difference. In Wyoming, a panel of five judges independently score nominated individuals and determine four finalists, including one winner. LeRoy Johnson has dedicated the past 27 years of his life to serving his community. After retiring in 1991, LeRoy and his wife, Inez, moved to Sheridan, Wyoming and immediately started to volunteer around the community. He first got involved in the Trinity Lutheran Church and the Sheridan Senior Center. He started as a driver for the Home Delivered Meals Program when he moved, and has been delivering meals every week since then. He also volunteers at the VA Hospital, where he connects with his fellow veterans while making coffee and visiting with them and their families. LeRoy is respected by the community and has touched the lives of many in it. Although he is 90 years old now, he has never stopped helping others. Whether he is ringing the bell for the Salvation Army at Christmas, helping his children, or promoting stewardship and agriculture education, LeRoy is always striving to improve his community. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate LeRoy Johnson for being selected as a finalist for the 2018 Wyoming Jefferson Award and thank him for his countless contributions to his community. He and his family deserve to be extremely proud of all his hard work and of this recognition. 
IN OPPOSITION TO AMENDMENT NO. 147 TO H.R. 4 FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 1, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to Amendment No. 147 to H.R. 4, the ‘‘FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018,’’ the intent of which is to direct nonstop flights from Reagan National Airport (DCA) to San Antonio, Texas. I oppose the amendment for several reasons. First, Amendment 147 would arbitrarily alter the number of flights that are permitted to go beyond the federally mandated 1,250 mile perimeter rule around Reagan National Airport (DCA) that was created by Congress in the 1980s. Second, Amendment 147 would allow four new beyond perimeter exemptions to each carrier that commits to swap an inside perimeter slot to a largehub airport to serve an airport within 25 miles of a military medical center that does not currently have service, exemptions that apply only to airports in San Antonio and San Diego. Third, Amendment 147 would politicize the slot and perimeter rules at Reagan National Airport (DCA) by earmarking slots that can only be used to serve limited destinations that are predetermined by Congress. Last, Amendment 147 sets a dangerous precedent of carving our predetermined markets for beyond perimeter exemptions, removing freemarket business decisions from the carriers and placing the decision on which routes should be served in the hands of legislators. The HighDensity (‘‘Slot’’) or Perimeter Rules governing flight operations at DCA are designed to both manage congestion at DCA and also balance traffic between DCA and IAD, the two airports in a single airport system. Although the intent of Amendment 147 may be wellmeaning, the amendment as currently drafted adversely affects communities with current service to DCA, as well as Dulles International Airport and the populations it serves. This is because changes to the HighDensity (‘‘Slot’’) or Perimeter Rules governing flight operations at DCA will lead to secondary and tertiary effects on flight operations at airports around the nation. For these reasons Amendment 147 is opposed by both International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the largest airline union in the nation; and by American Airlines, one of the largest air carriers in the world. I include in the RECORD a letter from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and urge all Members to join me in voting against Amendment 147 to H.R. 4. 
APRIL 26, 2018. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, we strongly urge you to vote ‘‘NO’’ to the Cuellar No. 147 amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act, H.R. 4 when it’s considered. As the largest Airline Union in the United States, we believe this amendment will have a negative impact on the thousands of airline workers that we proudly represent in the local metropolitan Washington D.C. area. We oppose any changes to the perimeter rules governing flight operations at National Airport (‘‘DCA’’) that could have a negative impact on our airline membership. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our position, please do not hesitate to give us a call. Sincerely, HASAN SOLOMON , National Legislative Director.
