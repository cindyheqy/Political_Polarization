Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. SHIMKUS led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, representing a rural district in which many small towns rely on just one pharmacy to access lifesaving drugs has made me a believer in the value of community pharmacists. I also believe in free markets and competition, but a healthy market requires transparency and a level playing field. Unfortunately, based upon my recent visits to community pharmacists in towns like Golconda, Rosiclare, and Carmi, pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs, are threatening the solvency of these community institutions by using complicated formularies that often result in local pharmacies being reimbursed less per prescription than their higher volume, big box peers, and direct and indirect remuneration, or DIR, fees, which create uncertainty and can impose a serious cash flow squeeze that too many times forces independent pharmacists to close their doors or sell their businesses. Drug prices are a big issue. We can help bring down costs by reducing barriers to drug development and delivery while increasing competition through transparency that allows everyone to compete on a level playing field. f 
HONORING HENRY W. COIL, JR. (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Henry W. Coil, Jr., a Riverside native and a champion of education in the arts. Henry has left an indelible legacy as a visionary and as a philanthropist who loved and supported his community. Through his generous and highly successful construction work, he helped build and restore schools and infrastructure throughout the Inland Empire in southern California. I knew Henry through his love for Riverside Community College, which he attended before moving on to UC Berkeley. At RCC, we worked to establish a new school for the arts, and it was Henry’s philanthropy that helped turn this vision into a reality. For most of his life, Henry was a successful businessman, but his dedication to his community set him apart. He served briefly on the Riverside City Council, and he was a devoted supporter of the Boy Scouts. In fact, he even went on to earn the Boy Scouts’ Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, recognizing 50 years of his continued service to the Boy Scouts. 
Above all, what made Henry special was his character. He stood up to bigotry and prejudice. I recall him saying to me how misguided he thought it was that a local politician was running a homophobic campaign. This was a bold position to take at the time, but this statement has stuck with me, throughout my life and career, as a mark of his character. While Henry may no longer be with us, the positive change he created will never be forgotten. 
MAKE SOIL, NOT SMOKE (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, every year, the Environmental Protection Agency honors students across the country for outstanding leadership and environmental achievements with the President’s Environmental Youth Awards. Among this year’s winners is Mr. Anderson’s first grade class in Okanogan, Washington. The students at Virginia Grainger Elementary School were recognized for their project titled ‘‘Make Soil Not Smoke.’’ The class created a school garden and learned about the benefits of composting leaves instead of burning them. They decided to use their project to spread awareness about the benefits of composting and the harmful effects of burning leaves. Their project is important to a community that has experienced firsthand the destruction of wildfires. As excitement for the project grew, the community joined in by donating compost materials, garden tools, and worms for vermicomposting. In one year, Mr. Anderson’s students have created over 200 cubic yards of garden compost. They use demonstrations, a parade float, and booths at State fairs and farmers markets to continue spreading awareness. Please join me in recognizing the outstanding work the Make Soil Not Smoke group is doing for their community. 
END HUNGER NOW (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I just saw a report that most minimum wage workers need 2
1⁄2fulltime jobs to afford a onebedroom apartment. Many of us can’t imagine deciding between paying rent and buying food, but that is exactly the choice that far too many Americans face. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, helps by providing a small benefit so families don’t go hungry. But the farm bill that the House Republicans have passed cuts SNAP by $23 billion. Let’s remember, most people on SNAP who can work, do work. Let’s also remember that real farmers rely on the farm bill. The longer Republicans try to use it for entitlement reform, the longer we hurt those farmers. The American people made their priorities clear at the ballot box: They want to create opportunity and possibility for all our families. Here is a radical idea: Let’s listen to them. Let’s follow the lead of Senate Republicans and Democrats who worked together on a farm bill that helps farmers and maintains SNAP. And let’s end hunger now. f 
SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, next week, we will kick off the holiday season with Thanksgiving and reflect on all that we are thankful for in our lives. It also marks the start of the very busy holiday shopping season. In an effort to support local shops that make our communities strong, Small Business Saturday takes place on the Saturday after Thanksgiving to encourage people to shop small and bring more holiday shopping to small businesses. On this day, we celebrate and support small businesses and all that they do for our local communities. There are more than 30 million small businesses in the United States that have created 8.4 million jobs in the last two decades. Mr. Speaker, small, locally owned businesses employ our neighbors and contribute to the fabric of our local communities. The Shop Small movement truly is about supporting our momandpop shops. Whether it is a cup of coffee from a local spot or a unique gift for a loved one, everyone has an opportunity to join in and support independent business owners on Small Business Saturday. 
HONORING EMILY REESE (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Emily Reese, a cherished Nevadan, a loving mother of three, and a fearless healthcare advocate who worked tirelessly to put others before herself. Emily devoted her last year of life to fighting for what she believed in: protecting access to quality, affordable healthcare for those who need it most. Her work touched many lives, including my own. Emily’s compassion and determination knew no boundaries, and it is those qualities that made her a powerful voice in our community. As we pay tribute to her life, let us never forget to find strength in her words: live life, love life, and impact others. f 
DISASTER RELIEF (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the House, the Senate, and the administration to adopt a disaster relief bill before December 7. In recent months, we have witnessed catastrophes that have struck our Nation coast to coast, from wildfires across California, flooding in the Carolinas, and the incredible loss of agriculture in my home State of Georgia from Hurricane Michael. Agriculture is the largest and oldest economic driver in the State of Georgia. The past few years, farmers have faced low commodity prices, unfair trade practices from foreign countries, labor shortages, and low crop yields that have created a strain on their businesses. They have also hurt the surrounding rural economies. Hurricane Michael made all of these past losses pale in comparison. Following the storm, the likes of which Georgia has not seen in over a century, President Trump and Vice President PENCE visited my district and heard firsthand from farmers about how they went from having the best crops to no crops in a matter of hours. This disaster has been heartbreaking, and without additional Federal assistance, it will break the back of Georgia’s rural economy. Mr. Speaker, this is not a partisan issue; this is an American issue. I call on this Chamber to act now to help these farmers and others across our great Nation who are struggling with the aftermath of these disasters. 
HONORING DOLORES M CCRACKEN (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the memory and extraordinary life of an educator in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, whose dedication of Pennsylvania’s children made her one of Pennsylvania’s most prominent voices on education advocacy, policy, and practices. Dolores McCracken, who served as president of the Pennsylvania State Education Association, passed away on November 13 following her courageous battle with cancer. Dolores spent the past two decades as a passionate activist for improved public education, working to promote PSEA initiatives on the Federal, State, and local levels. Dolores’ professional contributions to Pennsylvania education are impactful and incredibly farreaching. She worked closely with numerous statewide partners and served on the 
board of directors at the Keystone Research Center, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, and the Council Rock Education Foundation. She also served as president of the Churchville Elementary Home and School Association. For Dolores, it always came down to improving the lives of our community’s children and their families. She firmly believed that every child, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, deserves the best education in the world. A paralegal by trade, Dolores is survived by her husband, Jack Jr.; her children, Jack III and Kristin; and her grandchildren, Dylan, Reese, Paige, and Logan. May they take comfort in knowing Dolores’ life work will carry on in our students’ lives for generations. Dolores McCracken is our children’s hero. 
b0915 MANAGE OUR WOLVES ACT Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1142, I call up the bill (H.R. 6784) to provide for removal of the gray wolf in the contiguous 48 States from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife published under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Pursuant to House Resolution 1142, the bill is considered read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6784 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Manage our Wolves Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debated for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. The gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill would accomplish what multiple administrations have been attempting to do for over a decade by delisting a species the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has deemed recovered under the Endangered Species Act. It also empowers the States to take a larger role in managing the species population. The gray wolf has been protected in its original habitat in the western Great Lakes region under the Endangered Species Act since 1974. Beginning in 1994, the Federal Government began introducing species to the Western U.S. by relocating wolves from Canada and releasing them in Western States. The reintroduced wolf population in the West expanded more quickly than many had anticipated, and as a result, Western States began to work with the Fish and Wildlife Service to better manage the species. This successful State and Federal cooperation led to the Fish and Wildlife Service’s first attempt to delist the species under the Endangered Species Act in 2009. Litigation activists struck back, challenging the agency’s delisting decision and halting further agency action at that time. In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service, after noting an even greater increase in species population, attempted to once again delist the gray wolf. Just as before, litigants immediately challenged the agency’s decision. That same year, gray wolves in Wyoming and the western Great Lakes region were relisted by court order, citing inadequate State management plans. This 2014 order was appealed, and in March of last year, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the relisting decision for the gray wolf, but in Wyoming only. This underscores the extent to which the Fish and Wildlife Service has been hamstrung in implementing the objectives of the Endangered Species Act. Rather than spending its limited resources protecting vulnerable species, litigation activists have forced the agency to continuously defend every action. In this case, despite scientific evidence collected under multiple administrations from both sides of the aisle showing that the gray wolf populations have recovered and thrived, the agency remains bogged down in costly, never ending litigation. We should be celebrating this ESA victory instead of moving on to the next challenge. This bill would prevent the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from wasting further resources in responding to environmental lawfare by affirming its previous rules to delist the gray wolf and shielding these rules from further review. Finally, the bill seeks to empower the States to manage their individual gray wolf populations by directing the Secretary of the Interior to issue a rule to delist the gray wolf in each of the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia. To ensure that States are provided certainty when developing State management plans, this bill would also exempt the delisting system from judicial review. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the commonsense bill that we have here, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the bill today. In a world full of lions and tigers entertaining the masses, have you ever seen a wolf in the circus? If you love your dog, thank a wolf. There is a line of poetry that says: ‘‘A wolf eats sheep but now and then; Ten thousands are devour’d by men.’’ Wolves are historic and vital keystone predators that have been hunted to near extinction in the contiguous United States. After being formerly designated as endangered and protected under the Endangered Species Act, wolf populations began to rise. However, they still inhabit just a fraction of their historic range, and continued protection under the Endangered Species Act is necessary. Instead, H.R. 6784 strips the protections that have allowed the species to begin to recover. Prior to widespread human settlement, hundreds of thousands of gray wolves roamed North America. They could be found from the Pacific Coast to the Atlantic Coast. Today, sadly, the farthest east they can be found is in Michigan. Some of my colleagues might know that I would love to see the gray wolves in Virginia some day, but for now, it is important that we continue to protect the fewer than 6,000 that we have left in the lower 48. 
How did we get to only 6,000? As the human population grew in the 19th and 20th centuries, gray wolves were poisoned, trapped, shot, gassed—every possible way to kill them—and their population decline was exacerbated by habitat destruction. Removing Federal protection opens the doors to further baiting, hunting, and trapping of wolves. The war on wolves is based, in part, on a myth that wolves are dangerous to humans and livestock. The reality, of course, is that humans are far more dangerous to wolves than wolves are either to humans or wolves are to livestock. Wolves cause less than 1 percent of all livestock losses in the United States, which is a minor threat compared to health issues, weather, and even other predators. In fact, domestic dogs cause more cattle losses than wolves do. But no one is talking about trapping or poisoning dogs. Ironically, researchers at Washington State University have found that killing wolves leads to an increase in livestock losses caused by wolves. Wolves generally avoid people. There are only two known deaths from wolves in the entire contiguous United States in the 21st century. Far more Americans are killed by bees, dogs, or deercar collisions than by wolves. It has also been proven that State agencies cannot successfully manage these species. We have to look at what happened when they were delisted in Idaho and Montana in 2011. In just those two States, hostile State management practices have caused more than 3,200 wolves to be killed through hunting and trapping. That is half the known wolves in the lower 48. Furthermore, we know that targeting wolves is not only cruel and detrimental to the species itself, but it is also detrimental to the other species and to the ecosystems in which it belongs. Many of us have seen the video, the documentary on what has happened to Yellowstone since the reintroduction of wolves. Before, when wolves were eliminated, the explosion of other populations caused defoliation, erosion, and an unbalanced ecosystem in the park. When wolves were reintroduced in 1995, everything changed. They were the keystone predator, the linchpin, that held together this delicate balance. When the deer and elk populations were managed, vegetation regenerated, which brought back species such as birds, beavers, mice, and bears. Riverbanks stabilized as plant life thrived and erosion decreased, and the whole landscape was transformed. Delisting decisions are best kept in the hands of scientists, and we can’t allow any delisting decisions to happen because of politics, particularly not to a species so historic, majestic, integral, and charismatic to the ecosystem in which it belongs. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ), the sponsor of the bill, who actually lives in an area where the wolves live. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his support in coming down and managing our time. Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that is bipartisan in a time where I don’t think we see a lot of bipartisanship. I think the reason you see Democrats and Republicans coming together and, actually, the House and the Senate coming together on this bill is because, if you live in the northern part of the United States in the Great Lakes and West, you understand that the wolves are a huge problem. That is why you have seen Democratic Senators from this region, Democratic Congressmen from this region, and Republicans standing together to say: Hey, listen, we have to manage these wolves. If you live in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., it is not a problem. If you live in Madison, Wisconsin, it is not really a problem. You can make the argument that the pretty little puppy of the wolf, it is so pretty and beautiful and we have to protect it. Well, we did protect it. We put it on the endangered species list. Like a lot of government programs, this one worked. We have protected them and allowed them to recover. We have three times as many gray wolves as was projected to be necessary to take them off the endangered species list. We are coming to a hunting season in Wisconsin right now, so a lot of Wisconsinites put on their blaze orange and get their guns, and they go out to the woods and hunt deer. Mr. Speaker, I have never seen a picture of Barack Obama in blaze orange and with his rifle going out to hunt deer. He is not a great outdoorsman, I don’t think, but Barack Obama’s administration was the one that first took the gray wolf off the endangered species list. And Donald Trump, too, agrees. Donald Trump and Barack Obama agreeing on an issue? They do on gray wolves. You can say: I love the gray wolf. Protect it. Does anybody like Bambi? Does anyone like Little Bear? Does anyone like your little pet—dogs? cats? cattle? In our communities, here is a picture of one of our gray wolves. It is hard to tell on this picture, but that is a bear, and the bear is dead, by the way, because the wolf killed it. Here is a picture from one of my farmers that shows one of his cattle that was attacked by a gray wolf. So what we are saying here is why can’t we come together, acknowledge the success of a program, that the gray wolf has recovered, and then acknowledge that we should allow our States then to manage the gray wolf? Some States might say: I want to allow the population to continue to grow. Other States might say: We want to manage it. So if you live in California, you might say: In California, we have a small population. We are going to let that little population thrive and grow. But if you live in Wisconsin, especially northern Wisconsin, you might say: It is necessary for us to actually manage this population because it is good for the environment; it is good for the wolves; it is good for the cattle. It is actually really good for our deer population. So I think this just makes common sense. And, by the way, some have come out and said—as I talked about on the floor, I am kind of a PETA guy. I want to protect animals. Well, protecting animals is allowing our States to successfully manage the wolf population, because if you do, you not only protect the wolf, but you protect the deer; you protect the cattle, the dogs, and the bear. Everyone gets protected when you have a balance to the ecosystem. We are out of balance right now, and, frankly, I believe that our States are far more in tune in understanding the ecosystem of their State than bureaucrats in Washington. So I would far rather empower Wisconsin; and my good friend, COLLIN PETERSON from Minnesota, let Minnesota manage those populations because they understand the ecosystem better. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join Barack Obama and join Donald Trump and join a few Members of Congress from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Washington—and Senators as well—to allow us to successfully manage the gray wolf population which allows for a healthier ecosystem. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ), my colleague. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill for a number of reasons, but I would specifically like to address how the bill undermines science. Congress enacted the ESA to conserve and protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats in the U.S. and abroad. Congress also recognized that scientists, not Members of Congress—even me, ones like me with political science degrees—scientists have the necessary expertise to make decisions about species’ protection. So the ESA requires that the Fish and Wildlife Service make the decisions regarding species listing and delisting. The law entrusts the Service’s scientists to determine what is best for imperiled species, such as the gray wolf, using the best available science. The ESA is credited as being one of the most sciencebased laws on the books, but this bill completely eliminates scientists from the decisionmaking process. It mandates that all gray wolves be removed from the ESA in the lower 48. In doing so, it short circuits the law’s sciencebased process 
that determines when species have recovered and when protections are appropriately removed. b0930 Despite years of Republican efforts to ignore the science behind the ESA, we know it has been a huge success. Ninetynine percent of listed species have continued to survive, and 90 percent are on schedule to meet their recovery goals. So we should be working to make the gray wolf another one of those ESA success stories, not eliminating the protections that have helped put it on a path to recovery. When the gray wolf was listed in the early 1970s, there were only a few hundred left in the wild. Since then, scientists have shown that the reintroduction of gray wolves in the Northern Rockies has been a huge ecological and economic success. I was able to see gray wolves in Yellowstone with Mr. BEYER and Mr. D EFAZIO earlier this year and to see the ecosystem that has rebounded since their reintroduction. We are on the right track, but science shows that ESA protection is still needed. Currently, these wolves occupy only 5 percent of their historic range and only 36 percent of their suitable habitat. So while it is encouraging that the wolves are recovering and even coming into California for the first time in 90 years, a handful of these animals hardly shows that it is time for them to be delisted. Instead of enacting a new law to eliminate protections, we ought to be working with landowners, local and State agencies, and others to prevent conflicts so that we and wolves can both thrive. I would like to point out that if American citizens believe an agency does not follow the letter of the law, under the ESA, they have the right to hold the government accountable in court. It is part of the system of checks and balances that must be protected. Politically driven, speciesspecific legislation like this sets a dangerous precedent for delisting. It opens the door to future partisan attacks on vulnerable species. Legislative delisting measures like this one undermine the scientific process fundamental to the success of the Endangered Species Act. Scientists, not Congress, should make these decisions. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would just say that the Endangered Species Act delisting a species is based on science, and the science has proven that this species is recovered. Twice under the previous administration, Fish and Wildlife tried to delist the species based on the science. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETER SON), who is also a cosponsor of the bill and from wolf country. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill. I have to say, in my 28 years in this body, I have never seen so much nonsense, misinformation, and propaganda put out on a bill as is being put out on this one. We followed the Endangered Species Act. We did what was said. The scientists said that we have recovered, and they delisted the wolves. These were scientists who did it; it wasn’t any politician. The politics on this, you had a group out there, these extreme environmentalists and others who have captured our party, that went to a judge in Washington, D.C., who has no idea what is going on at all, and convinced that judge that the wolves had not recovered because they had not been reestablished all the way to Des Moines, Iowa. Do you want some wolves in Des Moines, Iowa? I don’t think so. There were never any wolves in Des Moines, Iowa, in the first place. So we followed the law. The Fish and Wildlife Service is on our side. They delisted these wolves. The DNR in Minnesota was managing the wolves and doing a good job before the court intervened politically. I don’t agree with the DNR. I have very seldom got along with the DNR in Minnesota. This is one time where they were doing the right thing. They did a good job, and the court stopped them. It was politics; it wasn’t science. So this nonsense that somehow or another that we are politically doing this is not true. We have more wolves in my district than any other district in the United States. We have twice as many wolves as was required to get the wolves delisted. But that wasn’t good enough. So I say to all you folks who think this is such a great idea: We have a lot of extra wolves. We will send them to your district. We will let them eat some of your fancy little dogs and see how long that will go before your constituents demand that you do something about it. My neighbor has had four of his cattle killed in the last 2 years. They killed his German shepherd dog and ripped it apart. Are you telling me that this is not a problem? When we had the population under control, we didn’t have these kinds of problems. So this idea that somehow or another you are on the righteous side of science and all that stuff is complete nonsense. I will have the gentleman come up to my district, and he can see what is going on. So we followed the law. We have the Federal agencies that are responsible for this that are on our side. It wasn’t us who screwed this up; it was that court in D.C., and that judge has no clue about what is going on. Mr. Speaker, I tell Members to support this bill. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO). Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have a few wolves in my district, not enough. I don’t know that I will take Mr. PETERSON ’s wolves, but we are breeding our own. OR–7 made an incredible journey from way up in northeastern Oregon all the way down to the California border. He went down to California looking for a mate. He finally found one, and those were his first progeny. Guess what? We are not having catastrophic predation on cattle in southern Oregon. We could accommodate more wolves. Now, there are reasons why cattle die. My colleague from Oregon might show up, and he has a picture—it is kind of ugly—of a calf that was killed by wolves. It was sad that that calf didn’t get to grow up and go to the slaughterhouse. Here are the real facts. Seventyfour percent of loss is due to health issues; that is, good husbandry. Eight percent almost, 7.8, is due to weather; 2.7 is due to coyotes, cougars, bear, and dogs— predators. Oh, here we are. Look, that is the problem. Wait a minute. We have new numbers, 0.2 percent—0.2 percent— is due to wolf predation. Now, I doubt that my colleagues on the other side have gone to Yellowstone to see the phenomenal recovery of the ecosystems in Yellowstone. We will hear that, oh, it is bad for hunters, elk. Well, actually, the elk population is doing very well, but they don’t browse all the way down into the streams anymore. So now fish have come back, and other species have come back, because the elk are worried about the wolves, so they stick to the forested areas where they should be. So having apex predators is incredibly important to a balanced environment. To say that we have to go out and slaughter those—Fish and Wildlife or Animal Damage Control, whatever the heck we call those jerks these days. The Federal Government has been subsidizing for years the indiscriminate slaughter of predator species, ostensibly to help out the ranchers. Now, when I was a county commissioner, we were kind of broke, and we went through a list of everything we were doing. I said, what are we doing, giving this money there? They said that is our match to the Federal Government to come and kill coyotes. I said, why? What is that about? They said, oh, sheep predation, horrible, horrible. We were broke. We cut out that. We said, no, we don’t want these people here anymore. We are not going to subsidize it. Guess what happened? Nothing. We did not have horrible sheep predation in my county. So a lot of this is based on some kind of gutlevel, historic fear or hatred of predators that has been passed down from generation to generation. We can have a healthy wolf population, and you can still do good husbandry with cattle. So they want to delist the wolf in all the lower 48. We have maybe 8, 12, 10— 
we don’t even know—in my district, which is historic habitat. In other parts of the State that have been previously occupied, there are no wolves. A couple of our wolves have wandered down to California, the first ones there since we were on this campaign to eliminate them all. The other thing is science. When you kill the apex predators, then the coyotes depredate on the cattle. Then you have overpopulation of elk, and they browse riparian. A balanced environment is good for everybody. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Oregon an additional 30 seconds. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, these people want to unbalance it and delist the entire lower 48. They want to defy good science. And, oh, by the way, what they are doing is so indefensible, but, well, we can’t go to court because, actually, we are not following the law. So this bill does a number of things that are really shortterm bad. By the way, it is going nowhere in the Senate. We are hearing messaging today that we could be doing a farm bill, and we could be doing affordable college education. There are a lot of things we could do—a budget for the United States Government. But, no, we are here on a talking point for a few idiots. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the gentleman from Oregon is so passionate about wolves, and this bill would be fantastic for him and his State. It would allow their State natural resources folks to manage their wolves. They could release some in Portland. They could let those wolf populations get as large as they want to get. But the scientists at U.S. Fish and Wildlife have said that the species is recovered, and we are talking about letting other States have the opportunity to manage those wolf populations in their States. I wish we were doing a farm bill. I wish the Senate would do a farm bill, because we have already done one out of here. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ). Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, in my home in eastern Washington, we have been living the real impact of large wolf populations for many years now. We see the impact on safety. We see the economic impact it is having on our ranchers. Each year, we are losing hundreds of livestock to wolves and costing our economy millions of dollars. The gray wolf is recovered, and it is time for it to be removed from the Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act has listed many species. This is not about a hatred or a fear of predators. This is about actually recognizing that the Endangered Species Act has done its job, and it is time for the wolf to be delisted. In the fall of 2013, the Obama administration announced that the gray wolf was recovered. President Obama’s Fish and Wildlife Director Dan Ashe has stated: The gray wolf ‘‘is no longer endangered or threatened with extinction. . . . As we propose to remove ESA protections, States like Washington and Oregon are managing expanding populations under protective State laws.’’ Unfortunately, the gray wolf was not delisted. In eastern Washington, and specifically in northeastern Washington, predation on calves has become common. I regularly hear from people who are seeing wolves around their property and from people who cannot defend themselves without it being a felony. Eastern Washington knows better how to manage our land and wildlife than someone sitting here in a cubicle in Washington, D.C. What we are proposing is that these management practices would be returned to the State level, that we would allow the people who are closest to the land and to the practices to be able to take action that would benefit endangered and native animals while protecting farmers, ranchers, and our way of life. I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill because it is important. It is important to our way of life. It is important to the people in eastern Washington. It is important to our economy. I thank Congressman DUFFY from Wisconsin for his work and leadership on this issue that impacts many communities across the country. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ). Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to H.R. 6784, the Manage our Wolves Act. Despite the claims made by our colleagues across the aisle, gray wolves play a critical role in keeping ecosystems healthy and balanced, including across Michigan and the Great Lakes region. At one time, gray wolves roamed in the hundreds of thousands. Today, there are fewer than 6,000 gray wolves in existence. Just this week, the National Park Service announced that a gray wolf died after being relocated from Minnesota to Michigan’s Isle Royale National Park. The threat to gray wolves is still real, and they must be protected. The bill before us would remove all protections for gray wolves under the Endangered Species Act, including reissuing a 2011 rule by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that delisted the gray wolf in the western Great Lakes. H.R. 6784 also seriously undermines scientific integrity, which is one of the foundations of the Endangered Species Act. It would remove scientists from the decisionmaking process to delist gray wolves. Scientists, not Congress, should be making listing or delisting decisions. b0945 As a keystone species, these iconic animals are vital to the structure of the ecological communities in which we live. Two decades ago, the lush landscape of Yellowstone National Park was not as we see it today. Instead, it was riddled with defoliation, erosion, and an unbalanced ecosystem. Due to the absence of predators, deer and elk populations were out of control. Despite efforts to manage them, they overgrazed the park’s vegetation. That all changed when gray wolves were reintroduced into the park in 1995. As a top predator in the food chain, wolves hold together that delicate balance of the ecosystem. Once wolves were brought back to the park, the natural balance of the ecosystem was restored. The regenerated forests stabilized the riverbanks, leading to less erosion and more suitable wildlife habitat. And not to mention, wolves reduce the coyote population by as much as 50 percent. The whole landscape was dramatically transformed with the reintroduction of just a few gray wolves, and their presence can similarly be felt across the Great Lakes region. Finally, gray wolves not only benefit the ecosystem, but they provide significant economic benefits as well. Just 10 years after reintroduction, wolfrelated tourism generated more than $35 million for communities in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. Mr. Speaker, we have seen what the absence of gray wolves can do to the ecosystem. We have seen how wildlife and plant populations suffer, from our national parks to the Great Lakes, without a proper predatorprey balance. Yes, good progress has been made to revive the gray wolf population, but there is more work to do. H.R. 6784 would halt and potentially reverse the progress that has been made. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ). Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will emphasize something I think that has been said before. You always try to think of something new. You can’t help but notice that the number of people who do not want the gray wolf delisted live in areas that don’t have gray wolves. The State of Wisconsin is maybe typical in this. They introduced gray wolves to northern Wisconsin. When there was controversy about it, they said, Well, that is okay. These are northern areas where very few people live. Of course, even then I had a problem with it because people did live up there. I don’t think the people near where this judge lived would want the gray wolves wandering around the Virginia and Maryland suburbs. They would not want the concern, walking around at night with the wolves, even though 
they don’t normally attack humans. They would not want the concern of the wolves out there if they have dogs or other pets around. If they had cattle, they wouldn’t want that concern. Wisconsin being very typical, I think the gray wolves that began in the northern part of the State are now all the way down to areas like Columbia County or Sheboygan County in the southern part of the State. And they will, unless somebody does something about it, continue to grow, continue to go further south, and the herds will continue to grow. I would ask people who are going to vote against this: Think how you would feel if you have a significant number of gray wolves wandering around your subdivision—or even one gray wolf wandering around your subdivision—and then have more respect for the Congressmen who are living with these gray wolves. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about letting scientists make the decision, not letting others make the decision. But right now, courts are making the decision on the delisting of this wolf. We have heard testimony that, even though it is a bipartisan bill, even though it was people in the previous administration that first suggested delisting the wolf, we have heard testimony that if you support delisting the wolf, you must be an idiot. I don’t think supporting this legislation means you are an idiot or you are trying to message something. I think it means that we want to see science implemented. I think it means that we want to let the scientists do their jobs. Mention has been made about Yellowstone National Park. I was actually in Yellowstone National Park this last summer and talked to scientists out there about the big fire in the 1980s. What many of us know about fire is that it is a natural occurring phenomena, and it mimicked a huge clear cut in Yellowstone National Park. After the fire and all this vegetation started growing back, we saw a huge increase in elk and deer herds, and the wolf population increased right along with that. As a matter of fact, the scientists at the park told me that the greatest numbers of elk that they have had happened within about 10 years after the big fire out there. The greatest population of wolves that they had happened after that. Now that the forest is growing back, that ecosystem, that forest will burn again—it burns about every 100 years—but the science is being applied here. We just want to let States make the decisions on how to manage these wolves that the scientists have said are recovered and need to be delisted. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent that the balance of my time be managed by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, this bill sets several incredibly damaging precedents, fundamentally weakening the protections of our Nation’s threatened and endangered species. The Endangered Species Act is one of the most effective and important conservation laws ever passed by Congress. The success is due, in large part, to a careful scrutiny of scientific evidence and the critical analysis of all factors when making decisions on the status of a species. The Manage Our Wolves Act would remove protections under the ESA for one of the Nation’s iconic wildlife species, without an opportunity for public participation in the rulemaking process for delisting. Even more troubling, this bill would explicitly ban any judicial review of the delisting of gray wolves in both the Great Lakes and nationwide. No judicial oversight will be allowed for the removal of the sciencebased protections established under the Endangered Species Act. A species is only listed as endangered or threatened, or delisted upon its successful recovery, after a rigorous assessment of its extinction. By eliminating judicial review of ESA delisting actions, this legislation removes the ability of the public and the scientific community to participate in the process. Access to a court of law is a cornerstone of American democracy and a fundamental part of our government. The judicial branch is also where the American people can have their voices heard and they can have a say in our system of checks and balances. Stopping our independent Federal courts from reviewing the actions of Federal agencies, or of Congress, violates this access to justice principle. It is simply undemocratic. It undermines the necessary oversight of government decisions. For years, the courts have served as an important forum for addressing disputes over ESArelated decisions. This legislation’s attempt to remove judicial review from the ESA decision has no scientific or legal basis. It is simply a politically expedient move. By prioritizing politics over conservation, this bill would cause irreparable damage to the integrity of the Endangered Species Act and sets a dangerous precedent of overriding the careful deliberations of the court. Mr. Speaker, we should not support legislatively mandating decisions about vulnerable species. We should not circumvent the established process for making ESA determinations. For this reason, I would urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Minnesota has 1 minute remaining. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I was recently in Yellowstone in the last month and a half. And, yes, there was a fire in Yellowstone. I am from Minnesota. I know all about after fires go in, and the moose munch, as we call it, around the boundary waters in the Voyageurs National Park area comes back and you can start seeing moose. They start doing better. The same thing is true of the elk. I saw elk literally right out a car window. They are doing better. But it is also very important to remember what Congressman DEFAZIO said about how, when the wolves are interactive and they are part of the regrowth and the rebirth of our forest system, the wolf, by being a predator, helps protect the stream banks and the rest from the elk and other animals from being on the stream banks and pressing them down. That has a big ripple effect on fish and other wildlife in the ecosystem, especially in Yellowstone. So I appreciate the gentleman’s remarks about Yellowstone, but it is just not one thing that is causing the elk to come back healthy. It is the wolf population, as well. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is important, I think, to note, so you get a sense of what the gray wolves have done, that 1987 was when a plan was finalized to restore them to the Northern Rockies by transplanting the wolves from Canada into central Idaho, Yellowstone National Park. In 1995 and 1996, 66 Canadian wolves were transplanted, with a goal of establishing 10 breeding pairs in each of three recovery zones in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming for three consecutive years. Well, guess what, Mr. Speaker? Those 66 Canadian wolves have done pretty well. In fact—and I think this is largely why the scientists with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with whom I have had many disagreements—but in this, these folks have come out and said: You know what? The U.S. population of 5,500 wolves have done real well since being transplanted from Canada. They are not the original U.S. wolves, but from Canada. They are bigger, more aggressive. But there are 3,800 just in the upper Great Lakes, 8,000 to 11,000 in Alaska, and now 60,000 in Canada. As their numbers increase, so do the massive problems. I appreciated the anecdotal information about seeing more elk and moose. I would suggest, based on the rapidly escalating number of attacks, that you are going to see more and more elk and moose want to come hang around the cars so they don’t get eaten by wolves. So you will have more and more tourists seeing elk and moose, but their populations are diminishing. 
In fact, it is rather dramatic. Wolves eat 20 pounds of meat a day and elk comprise 92 percent of the wolf kills during the winter. Other prey include moose, caribou, deer, beaver, hares, and livestock. In 1995, there were 19,000 elk in the northern Yellowstone herd. By 2008, there were 5,000. That is down from 19,000. The moose herd in the area also dropped from more than 1,000 to somewhere around 100 to 300. I am sure they will get to hanging out with tourists more and more just to keep from getting eaten. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ). Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague from Wisconsin, Representative SEAN DUFFY , and his bill, the Manage Our Wolves Act. This piece of legislation is critically important to my district and its farmers. You see, farming is the lifeblood of northeast Wisconsin. Not only do our agricultural products support thousands of local jobs, they also feed millions of mouths across the world. This is why so many of my constituents are concerned by the threat of the gray wolf population to our farms. Already, the gray wolf’s predatory behavior has cost Wisconsin farmers millions of dollars in damage. This is why we must pass the Manage Our Wolves Act to delist the gray wolf from the Endangered Species Act and return control of population back to the States where it belongs. By doing so, farmers will finally be able to focus on actual farming, instead of having to spend extra time and money on keeping their livestock out of danger. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation. Our farmers are depending on it. b1000 Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ), my colleague, the ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, given the fact that the Endangered Species Act is under unrelenting attacks by the Trump administration and House Republicans, it should come as no surprise that, after being out of session for more than 6 weeks, the first rules bill to go to the floor is one that continues those attacks on ESA, eliminates judicial review, takes the American people out of the public rulemaking process, and makes it easier to kill wolves. However, one must ask my Republican colleagues: Seriously? Do we not have more pressing issues to address? Children are still being separated from their families. Wildfires are blazing across California. There have been 311 mass shootings in our country this year. We have more Federal troops on the southern border than we have in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, all patiently sitting around and looking for Poncho Villa’s ghost to come around. The UN released a climate change report finding that we are in a much more dire state than we thought. In fact, today would have been a great day to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which my Republican colleagues have allowed to expire twice on their watch, a bill with 240 bipartisan cosponsors. Instead, we are talking about killing wolves, a bill introduced in September with three cosponsors. In this Congress, Republicans have introduced more than 100 bills, amendments, and policy riders to remove or block ESA protections for individual species or to weaken important provisions of a law that is not only hugely popular with the American people, but also conserves our biodiversity. The bill before us today, H.R. 6784, is a piece of legislation we have seen time and time again to undermine wolf populations in the United States, but this would deliver an even more devastating blow to the continued recovery of gray wolves across the lower 48. Congress should not be making decisions on which species to list or delist. What we need to be doing is properly funding the Fish and Wildlife Service to implement measures to strengthen ESA and protect species and their habitats from permanent extinction, given the fact that we are facing an ongoing extinction crisis. The ESA has a near perfect record of saving imperiled species. Even in the face of massive population growth, haphazard development, and pressure on ocean and coastal resources, over 99 percent of the species receiving protection are still surviving today. ESA works, and 90 percent of the American voters would agree with me. However, despite its incredible public support and impressive track record, the Trump administration and House Republicans continue to attack this historic environmental law and the species that it protects. These attacks on one of the most successful and popular conservation statutes in the history of the world are old, they are tired, and they are not fooling anyone. I can say with some confidence that these types of attacks on ESA will not be legitimized in the next Congress. Science, budget allocation, and protection and conservation will return as the prominent criteria for ESA policy—not just the resource extraction, industry’s singular agenda. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this legislation. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I really have appreciated sitting on the floor and listening to this dialogue because I think that there are some lessons here about getting things right. My friend from Virginia, my friend from Oregon have dealt with the ecological benefits of having apex predators to be able to restore ecological balance. I heard the notion of, ‘‘Well, how would you feel if you were reintroducing wolves in metropolitan areas?’’ and I just thought for a moment of listening in the past to people who are overrun with deer in Virginia suburbs, in Maryland suburbs. It is not just messing up their yards; it is killing people. We have several hundred people a year who are killed in collisions with deer. There are problems with chronic wasting disease that having an apex predator helps provide health benefits where you have healthier herds. I have watched the dynamic in Oregon, and it is complex because there are people who are ranching interests, there are people who are involved with hunting, and they want to shortcircuit it, even in a State as ecologically and animal friendly as Oregon. It is a struggle. To take a step back, weakening the endangered species protections, substituting political judgments, I think, is inappropriate. I would also note no small amount of irony that, in addition to the notion that we should be here reauthorizing the Land and Water and Conservation Fund, if we want to deal with animals in the closing hours of this session of Congress, why aren’t we dealing with a half dozen bills that Republicans have refused to allow us to vote on that are overwhelmingly supported by the public and are supported by a majority of our Members? It is, I think, doubly ironic that we are concluding where we have had Republican leadership forcing some of the worst animal welfare records. We lost two Republican incumbents with 50 years of service in Republican districts who had the worst animal records in Congress. I fought really hard to have animal welfare be a bipartisan issue. Taking issues like this, forcing people to make false choices that are bad for animals, bad for the environment—frankly, they are bad politics. I hope that we go through this charade, it goes nowhere, but deal with the underlying debate here about what we want in terms of ecological balance, animal protection, and rule of law. We will be better off if we do that; the species will be better off if we do that; and I think the politics will be cleaner and more productive. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy in allowing me to speak on this. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, I know there is a contention that gray wolves, though they have dramatically exploded from those 66 original wolves being introduced to thousands and thousands now, are not 
a threat to people; but I would suggest to you that, not only have the liberals in the U.S. Government seen a need year after year to delist the gray wolves, but a college student named Kenton Carnegie’s family members would suggest that, when Kenton was killed by gray wolves, the gray wolves were a threat to mankind; and Candice Berner, a teacher in Alaska who was killed while jogging, her surviving family members would suggest gray wolves are a threat to people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent that time be managed by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ). The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6784 as this act will block vital protection for gray wolves across the entire Nation, protections that were implemented under the Endangered Species Act. H.R. 6784 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to issue a rule removing the gray wolf from the Endangered Species Act list, which would preclude judicial review of agency decisions on wolf delisting and deny citizens the right to hold the Government accountable for its actions. There is no mystery about the negative impact that passing this legislation would have on the gray wolf, because we have already seen it. In 2011, Congress used an appropriations rider to delist wolves in Idaho and in Montana. And since 2011, over 2,500 wolves have been killed in these two States where the management practices included shooting wolves lured by bait, chasing wolves with packs of hounds, using steeljawed legholds, and using wire snare traps. Given these concerns, Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation. Endangered Species Act decisions must be made with caution. We should also be extremely bipartisan in these approaches. And if there is legitimate dispute over delisting, then delisting is premature and illadvised. That is why I oppose this legislation. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ). Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, the Endangered Species Act was passed to increase protections for and provide for the recovery of vanishing wildlife. Unfortunately, in recent years we have seen countless attacks on the ESA and sciencebased decisions, and this bill is no exception. This bill would hastily remove Endangered Species Act protections for all gray wolves in the lower 48 States without a rulemaking process or the opportunity for judicial review. Although the population of gray wolves has started to recover, it is now only 5 percent of the number that existed historically. Scientists are just beginning to understand the role of gray wolves in the larger ecosystem, and listing and delisting decisions should be based on science, not politics. Mr. Speaker, there are so many more important things we need to be doing today. Today, instead of undermining the Endangered Species Act, we should be reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund, passing the Violence Against Women Act, and the list goes on. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. Mr. SIMPSON. The gentleman from Virginia has 11⁄2minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Arkansas has 8
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as we have heard today, our colleagues say that this bill is needed to mitigate human/livestock conflict, but that claim is just simply not compelling. Across the country, wolves account for only twotenths of 1 percent of all cattle losses. Other predators, such as mountain lions, coyotes, and even stray dogs account for significantly more livestock kills. My friend from Minnesota talked about his neighbor’s German Shepherd being killed by a wolf. We have small dogs and cats killed in our densely urban area all the time by coyotes and by foxes, and no one is talking about hunting the coyotes or hunting the foxes. For example, out of the 3.9 million cattle deaths in 2015, coyotes and dogs combined killed more than 164,000 livestock, compared to the 10,000 killed by wolves. That is 16 times as many. Not to mention that 93 percent of all cattle losses are due to disease or other natural causes. In the northern Rockies alone, which is where we have been talking about today mostly, wolf depredations account for less than 1 percent of all livestock losses: 256 sheep and 41 cattle over an 8year period of time. The numbers don’t lie. The claims that wolves are responsible for a massive slaughter of livestock is simply a myth used to justify lethal control of these animals. Instead of the shootfirstaskquestionslater mentality, there are lots of great farmers promoting nonlethal methods that have been scientifically proven to mitigate human/wolf conflicts: livestock guardian dogs, fencing, and reducing attractants. There are solutions to this problem that don’t involve the unnecessary killing of one of the most iconic and charismatic animals, not just in North America, but in human imagination. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as we consider this bill and we talk about the science behind it, again, we are basing this legislation on science, on letting the scientists do their jobs. This bipartisan bill is exactly, exactly the type of legislation that will save the Endangered Species Act. The ESA aspires to recover imperiled plant and animal species. The act was never meant to serve as a longterm management tool. What my colleagues across the aisle should be celebrating is this ESA success story. Not just once, but multiple times, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined the gray wolf recovered and attempted to delist the species. b1015 We know this wasn’t a partisan decision because we saw these attempts span multiple administrations from both sides of the aisle. Our experts, our very own scientists, at Fish and Wildlife Service have expressed to us again and again that the gray wolf is recovered and ready to be delisted. Unfortunately, instead of allowing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to focus its resources on other endangered species, litigation activists continue to force the agency to defend this scientificallydriven decision and delay the delisting. We are nearly a decade past the agency’s first attempt to delist the recovered gray wolf species. To continue to list a species our own experts have determined is recovered sends the message that the Endangered Species Act doesn’t work. I appreciate the bipartisan support this bill enjoys, and I hope more of my colleagues across the aisle will join us in helping strengthen the Endangered Species Act in the long run by supporting this legislation. With that, I urge adoption of this commonsense bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bipartisan legislation. The Endangered Species Act helps species recover, and let me tell you, it works. In 1980, there were 25 wolves in Wisconsin. Recently, that number grew to 232 wolf packs—roughly 900 wolves. Now that the wolf population is recovered, states must be allowed to take over management. The rising wolf population means livestock and hunting dogs fall prey to attacks, and as long as federal protections remain in place, Wisconsinites cannot protect their property. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 6784 because, outside of dire circumstances, states are the most effective managers of wildlife and the policies affecting state residents. This legislation restores power to states, and I hope all my colleagues join me in voting for it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed a bill of the following title in which the concurrence of the House is requested: 
S. 3554. An act to extend the effective date for the sunset for collateral requirements for Small Business Administration disaster loans. 
The message also announced that the Senate agrees to the amendment of the House to the bill (S. 140) ‘‘An Act to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts in the WMAT Settlement Fund.’’, with an amendment.

THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the question on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, which the Chair will put de novo. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. EXTENSION OF SUNSET FOR COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SBA DISASTER LOANS Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (S. 3554) to extend the effective date for the sunset for collateral requirements for Small Business Administration disaster loans, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TAYLOR ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3554 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF SUNSET FOR COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SBA DISASTER LOANS. 
The bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2018, TO TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, November 20, 2018. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. 
THE EISENHOWER VETERAN CARE TRANSITION CENTER (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, my district, the 10th Congressional District of Michigan, is the proud home to Selfridge Air National Guard Base, one of our Nation’s premier National Guard bases, home to more than 40 national defense and homeland security tenants, including all branches of the military, the Coast Guard, and Customs and Border Protection. I rise today to commemorate the groundbreaking ceremony for Selfridge’s newest tenant organization, the Eisenhower Veteran Care Transition Center. When completed, the facility will provide residential rehabilitation and reintegration programs for up to 42 veterans at a time who are suffering from servicerelated conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and more. This new veteran care transition center ensures that our wounded warriors 
receive the essential care they earned, allowing them to continue to live independently in our community. I am thankful to the leadership of Selfridge, including General John Slocum, the 127th Wing and Selfridge Air National Guard Base commander, for working hard to bring this resource to southeast Michigan and Selfridge, and ensuring that veterans in this area get the best possible care. 
EXTEND THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (Mr. CRIST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today urging action to extend the National Flood Insurance Program. If Congress fails to reauthorize the NFIP by November 30, millions of homeowners will be unable to obtain or renew their flood coverage; housing markets will grind to a halt; and families will be left at risk of financial ruin should a flood occur. Congress must put this uncertainty to rest. Policyholders need stability. Our housing markets need stability. American families also need stability. I urge my colleagues to bring to the floor, and to pass, the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program as soon as possible. 
HONORING JAMES V. HANSEN (Mr. BISHOP of Utah asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, this week, my State lost a friend and a statesman. James V. Hansen, Utah’s longest serving Member of this body, passed away on Wednesday. My condolences go out to his wife, Ann, as well as the rest of the Hansen family. During his 22 years of service in the House, Jim became the first Utahn in history to assume the responsibilities of a full committee chairman. In 1997, Jim was chosen to be chair of the infamous Ethics Committee, where former Leader Armey said: ‘‘It is one of the most extraordinary trusts that a body could put in another person.’’ In 2001, Jim was named chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. He was a trailblazer, not just for Utah, but for me. I followed him into the State legislature; as Speaker of the House in Utah; as a Member of this body; also as a chairman of the Western Caucus, which Jim founded; and, finally, as chairman of the Resources Committee. I will be forever grateful for the time he took to mentor me in each and every one of these roles. His impact on my life and many others cannot be overstated. As chairman of the Resources Committee, Jim prioritized wise use of public lands while developing sound energy policies and passing numerous conservation bills. As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, he defended Hill Air Force Base, as well as the importance of U.S. military needs. Jim accomplished much without ever succumbing to arrogance. He was a good man, a fine leader, and a cherished man. He will be missed. f 
b1115 RESPECT WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, today the court has affirmed the value of the First Amendment and provided the credentials back to CNN reporter Jim Acosta. It is unfortunate that since taking office, the President has treated members of the press differently than did his predecessors. The President constantly disparages the fourth estate as fake news, derides the press as the enemy of the people, and routinely singles out individual members of the press. It is fortunate that no injury has yet come, because last month the Trump zealot in Florida, inspired by his devotion to the President, took it upon himself to mail pipe bombs to perceived enemies of the President, including two former Presidents, the news desk of the Cable News Network, Secretaries of State, Attorneys General, and Congresspeople. The President seems to reserve his most special and pointed derision for AfricanAmerican women members of the media. In particular, April Ryan of the American Urban Radio Networks and CNN; Abby Phillip of The Washington Post; and Yamiche Alcindor of the Public Broadcasting System. Instead, the President derided April Ryan as a loser; called Abby Phillip stupid; and accused Yamiche Alcindor of racism when she asked him about his claim to be a nationalist. Let us be very clear. The questions asked of the President were pointed, timely, and relevant. They were not dumb, racist, or stupid. They were protected by the First Amendment, and I ask the President to stand for the First Amendment and stand against racism. Since taking office, the President has treated members of the press differently than did his predecessors. The President constantly disparages the Fourth Estate as ‘‘fake news,’’ derides the press as the ‘enemy of the people,’ and routinely singles out for verbal abuse individual members of the press. Although this conduct by the President is rude, childish, and unbecoming of the leader of a great nation, we are fortunate that it has not yet resulted in physical injury or harm to any member of the press. I say fortunate because last month, a Trump zealot in Florida, inspired by his devotion to the President, took it upon himself to mail pipes bombs to perceived enemies of the President, including two former Presidents and the news desk of the Cable News Network (CNN). Mr. Speaker, the current President of the United States has disgraced his office on numerous occasions, most recently this past weekend when he refused to visit a cemetery in France where Americans gave their lives to defend freedom in World War I because he did not want to get wet in the rain. But it is beneath the dignity of his office for the President to deride the free and independent press, which the Framers knew was indispensable for a functioning democracy and enshrined its protection in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a protection that every President takes and oath to preserve, protect, and defend. The President reserves his most special and pointed derision for African American women members of the media who do their jobs and have the temerity to ask him questions regarding his actions or the policies of his administration. So it came as no surprise that in the aftermath of the 2018 midterm elections, in which his party was routed and lost control of the House of Representatives, the President refused to answer questions put to him by three great and highly respected African American woman reporters: April Ryan of the Urban American Urban Radio Networks and CNN; Abby Phillip of the Washington Post; and Yamiche Alcindor of the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). Instead, the President derided April Ryan as a ‘‘loser,’’ called Abby Phillip ‘‘stupid,’’ and accused Yamiche Alcindor of racism when she asked him about his claim to be a ‘‘nationalist.’’ Let us be very clear: the questions asked of the President were pointed, timely, and relevant; they were not dumb, racist or stupid. They may have made the President uncomfortable but it is not the role of the media to make public officials feel comfortable, especially one who lashes out because he clearly feels the legal, ethical and political walls closing in on him. The President’s misconduct conduct is consistent with his pattern and practice of routinely disparaging African American criticism— especially from females. The American people see the President’s unmistakable pattern of disrespectful and abusive treatment of African American women members of the White House Press Corps; they do not like it, they see through it, and they know that these flailing attacks say more about this President than it does about the three very able, highly respected, and fearless African American women journalists. I call upon the President to cease and desist his disrespectful treatment of all journalists in general, and of African American women journalists in particular. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER JARED WILLIAM FRANKS (Mr. WALKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, it has been said, ‘‘The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of 
what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it.’’ These words embodied the life of Officer Jared William Franks of the Greensboro Police Department. Officer Franks was killed in the line of duty after bravely engaging in the pursuit of a suspect. Only 24 years old, Officer Franks dedicated his life to public service and creating a safer community for us all. He is the first Greensboro officer to die in the line of duty in 17 years, reminding us of the bravery and strength members of law enforcement show our communities every single day. We must never forget and always be thankful for their courage and dedication. Please keep his family; his dad, Officer Captain Franks; and fellow officers in your prayers as we remember Officer Franks’ life and legacy. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF ALAINA HOUSLEY (Mr. THOMPSON of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember Alaina Housley, a wonderful young woman from my district who was murdered in the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks. Alaina was a bright, dedicated, and inspiring student who was so excited to have voted for the first time this year. She was in her freshman year at Pepperdine and had so much of her life ahead of her. She was deeply loved by family and friends, and her death is a huge loss for our entire community. Over the last week, vigils and marches have been held in her honor in her hometown of Napa. She will never be forgotten. Mr. Speaker, I have committed to her parents that I will do everything I can to address violence in our communities. We will honor her senseless death with action. May she rest in peace. 
RECOGNIZING ORAN YEARGAN (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Oran Yeargan, a student at Glynn County Middle School in Brunswick, Georgia. A student with a disability, Oran has been the water boy for the Hurricane’s football team for the past 3 years. This October, the coach called him off the bench and Oran ran the ball for the last touchdown of the game against Needwood Middle School. He stood by the team with utmost dedication all year, and this touchdown was not only really deserved, but an important lesson to us all about commitment and overcoming life’s obstacles. Oran, we are proud of you. Congratulations. HONORING DISTRICT ATTORNEY DEAN FLIPPO (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Monterey County District Attorney Dean Flippo. At the end of this year, Dean will retire after 40 years of service to our home on the central coast of California. DA Flippo is the longestserving DA in Monterey County history, and the longest current serving DA in California. During his tenure, he presided over pivotal cases. He fought the rise and he led the fall of our gang problem in our community. He enforced environmental policy. He established the consumer fraud unit. He created an early intervention antitruancy program to keep kids in school and off the streets by getting their families involved. And he was a master at keeping a balanced budget. I will always be grateful to Dean for giving me a chance and a job as a prosecutor when I moved back home to Monterey County. During that time, I was able to learn from him as I served under him. Now I count myself lucky to have continued to work with him over these last 2 years on criminal justice issues. I hope Dean enjoys his retirement watching PG High School football games, except when they are playing Carmel High, of course. As we know, Dean leaves big shoes to fill, but he has left a long legacy of public service and safety in our community. We honor him. We congratulate him. And I thank Dean Flippo for his service. f 
THANKING VETERANS (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express a heartfelt thank you to all the veterans across Kansas and throughout the United States. This week we celebrate Veterans Day and we recognize and honor the service and sacrifice each and every veteran has made to ensure the preservation of the freedom and liberty we take for granted every day. One of my greatest responsibilities in Congress has been to support the men and women of our military and fulfill the promise that we make to them in exchange for their service. Over the last 2 years, Congress has worked with this administration to provide a record amount of funding for health programs at the VA, and we have increased accountability measures to make sure no one falls through the cracks. We have paid special attention to improving the mental health services and opioid abuse prevention among our veterans. We owe these veterans a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay, but the best way to try to do that is to ensure they are cared for as promised when they come home. Mr. Speaker, may we continue to honor our veterans this week and always. f 
HONORING OUR VETERANS (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend our country reflected on the bravery and sacrifice of veterans who answered the call to defend our Nation. New York’s 22nd District is home to more than 55,000 veterans, and it is a true honor to serve each and every one of them in Congress. Whether part of the Marine Corps, Navy, Army, Air Force, or Coast Guard, our men and women in uniform have served and sacrificed greatly to secure the freedoms we enjoy at home. When our veterans come home from serving our Nation, it is our responsibility to ensure they receive quality healthcare, provide them with the tools to start their own business, and find educational opportunities for them following their great service. They stood for us, and now we must stand for them. To all of our veterans: Thank you for everything you have sacrificed for our freedom. You truly represent the best in America. Mr. Speaker, I also have a special thank you to every veteran who has continued to serve in this great body on both sides of the aisle, and with a special thank you to our presiding Speaker today, who has also served in our military honorably. A final thank you to all of my friends in the Marine Corps for a happy 243rd birthday, and especially to my dear son, Captain Trey Cleary, who is also a U.S. Naval Academy graduate. Thank you so much to all of you who serve. We are indebted to you and grateful to you for your service to keep our freedoms and to continue making this a great Nation. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to highlight a couple of things. First of all, I will comment on a really important issue in my region. Upstate New York communities have suffered tremendously from the opioid crisis ravaging our Nation. In 2016, opioid overdoses rose by 121 percent in New York State and opioid deaths doubled in Broome County, 
which is part of New York’s 22nd District, during the very same time. During the most recent district work period, the President signed into law the Substance UseDisorder Prevention Act that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment—SUPPORT—for Patients and Communities Act, which included the Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act, which I coauthored. This bipartisan legislation directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, to issue a report regarding perverse incentives that lead to overprescription of opioidaddictive drugs. This legislation is important in my district because studies have shown that 29 percent of patients prescribed an opioid for pain, go on to misuse the drug. The Federal Government should be doing all it can to prevent overprescribing. Enacting this important bill is a critical first step in this process. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to recognize a very important industry in my region, and it is a great honor for me to be able to represent a place called Revere Copper Company in Rome, New York. Yes, Revere was actually founded by none other than the great Paul Revere of our great history in this country. This great company was North America’s first copper rolling mill and it was founded, again, by our great patriot, Paul Revere, in Rome, New York. It still resides in Rome, New York over 200 years later. Small businesses like this are the backbone of employment in New York’s 22nd District, accounting for 98 percent of jobs created in our private sector. While everyone thinks all jobs are created by big companies, in fact, our small business community has 98 percent of those jobs created. In Congress, we need to make sure that we keep empowering our small businesses, creating a fair tax and regulatory environment that allows them to grow, to hire more workers, and to reinvest in our communities. Too many of our local businesses are held back by skyrocketing healthcare costs which cut into their bottom line, and our regulatory code, which requires a team of lawyers to decode, just to comply with the endless amounts of bureaucracy— something that I have experienced personally as the owner of a small manufacturing business in upstate New York. The time for debate and verbal platitudes need to end when it comes to our small business community, our employers need solutions. We must work to make the middle class and small business tax cuts permanent. I am very proud to be a person who voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which tremendously helped our community. We have seen an unprecedented amount of gains in our economy locally; a glimmer of hope in an area where we have seen very little progress over the decades because of some of the policies that have been enacted that really have hurt our small business community and have caused New York to have the highest outmigration of people in the entire Nation. Over 1 million New Yorkers have left New York State because of these policies just since 2010. We must fight to continue to contain healthcare costs, to provide for a public healthcare system, but also an affordable care system for people who are just simply not able to see their doctors. We must stand for a country that represents everyone and not just the powerful. That is something I have done as a corruption fighter. As a person who stood up to the leaders in both parties, to the most powerful and wealthiest people in our community, I stood up to them and fought for the middle class, and fought for the average worker, people across our Nation. To our small businesses, I just want to say thank you so much for all you do every day. As a small business owner, I know how difficult the fight is, how difficult the struggle is. You are the American Dream in our communities. You provide the hope for our future, and you provide the most jobs that we are going to see as we grow into the coming years, and hope that we can keep our economy moving. To my small business community, I just want to say thank you so much for all that you have done in adding jobs, in providing responsible employment for our communities, for individuals, for giving hope, for giving people first starts, for everything you have done in our community. It has been an amazing opportunity for me to represent a community that really cares. My community is well known for its generosity. I find that in our small business community, much like the business I own, we do so much for our communities that doesn’t get recognized. We don’t have big profits. Many of us operate at less than profit. But what we do is we give dearly to our communities. We provide for the Little League teams, and for the people who are struggling from diseases that cannot be cured. b1130 We provide in greater numbers. While, yes, big companies can provide a large check, our smallbusiness community does what it can on a scale that is much greater by proportion. So I am really grateful to all the people I have served in my community who do so much to help all of us. I want to make sure that our smallbusiness community is recognized. Often in government, we hear an awful lot about the big businesses. But it is really the small businesses that are the backbone of our community. They are the heart of entrepreneurship. I just want to say that, as a small business owner, I am deeply grateful for all the work that you do, the late nights, the hard work of your employees to put out a beautiful product. It is something that you are helping your local and fellow citizens, even across the country. I am just really grateful. RECOGNIZING JASON GRAY  
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, on another issue, I would like to make sure we recognize a man named Jason Gray. He is a paramedic from Norwich, New York. Last month, when Hurricane Michael left Florida’s homes, beaches, and businesses in ruins, Jason Gray uprooted his life in Norwich to assist in medical relief efforts. What Jason Gray and his team at the National Disaster Medical System did to help the most vulnerable Florida residents is simply incredible. He provided ontheground medical help to hundreds of victims devastated by Hurricane Michael. Our community is really lucky to have a selfless person like Jason Gray and so many others. I would like to give him special recognition for his willingness to go help others in need outside of our own State and to really use his skills and his talent to bring relief and some sense of sanity to people who are really suffering in the panhandle, in the tough parts of Florida. I want to say thank you again to Jason for what he does for our communities and what he has done for Florida. It is a tremendous honor to represent him, and it is my distinct honor to represent him here on the floor of the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
THE RULING CLASS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we are living in interesting times. As Dickens said, it is the best of times and the worst of times. There has never been a country in the history of the world with the amount of opportunity and freedom for individuals that has been found in the United States. Even in Solomon’s Israel—great wealth there—there was not the opportunity and the individual assets that we have here in the United States of America. It is incredible that even for the Nation’s poor, obesity is a major health issue. That is just unheard of in world history. It is deeply grieving to hear that so many of our Nation’s college students and college graduates have been indoctrinated with the notion that socialism is so much better. Communism, really, is what we are talking about. They call it progressivism and socialism, what they are proposing, that that would be a superior form of government to what we have. What those students have not been taught—and it is an enormous gap 
in education; it is an enormous area of ignorance for those students—is that you can’t have socialism or communism without giving up a tremendous amount freedom. That was one of the things that scared some people in the Soviet Union, when the Soviet Union came to exist no more. They had given up so much liberty, the idea that they were now free to find whatever job they wanted, and they didn’t have to just take what the government told them to take. They could find whatever job they wanted. They could be entrepreneurs. I talked to some. They were scared because with liberty and with freedom comes uncertainty. But the Founders felt that government had always been a threat to people’s freedom, to their liberty. They felt liberty, freedom, was far superior to security. It is often attributed to Franklin that those who would give up liberty for security or safety deserve neither. When you really break down a socialist, communist system, you don’t have a middle class. You have a ruling class, and you have a ruled class. That is what we are headed for. I believe we saw the beginnings of that in this last election when billionaires poured hundreds of millions of dollars into this election like never before, because unlike many of our college students now, they know what happens in a socialist, communist system. You have the ruling class, and you have the ruled class. Yes, it is true. It is so wonderful that the ruled class basically has the same amount of money. They get paid similar amounts. But I kind of like the idea of physicians being paid more than most people, because that means you draw the best and brightest into that profession. I found that not to be the case as an exchange student in the Soviet Union back when it was the Soviet Union. I got a glimpse of their socialized medicine, and thanked God, literally, that I lived in the United States and didn’t have to be part of a socialized medicine system where the doctors were paid the same amount whether they saw one or two people or they saw the 40, 50 people who were waiting to see them. They didn’t care. They were going to make the same amount every day. Exactly that was what the farmers said at a collective farm when I asked in the middle of the morning when they worked out in the field, because it was midmorning. I have worked on farms and ranches. In the middle of July, like this was, you would normally start at sunup, so you could finish by midafternoon before the sun got too hot. Here these farmers were sitting in the shade. I couldn’t tell what was cultivated. There were thousands and thousands of acres out there. I couldn’t tell what was cultivated and what wasn’t. I tried to use my best Russian to ask: When do you work out in the field? I pointed. They laughed. I thought maybe I had said it wrong, but one of the farmers said: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the sun as I do here in the shade, so I am here in the shade. That basically explains why the Soviet Union could never come anywhere close to being as productive with wheat and with crops as we were in the United States. People, going back to the Pilgrims after the first winter, loved the idea of bringing all into the common storehouse. Everybody was sharing and sharing alike until after that first winter when so many Pilgrims died. They found that the idea of private property where people could keep what they produced was just fantastic. They were so much more productive. They worked harder, and it was better for the overall community. But we seem to be slipping into a time when the concept of freedom will be forsaken for bigger and bigger government, and more and more government intrusion. You have to have, though, a totalitarian government for socialism or communism, either one, to succeed. That is how you eliminate the middle class. You have the ruled class, and you have the rich class and the powerful class. Sometimes they may not have as much money as they do power, but I think the reason we see billionaires pushing us in the direction of socialism is because they see themselves in the ruling class and see themselves as being so much wiser, and they see what they perceive should be the ruled class as not being nearly as smart and as inventive as they are. So things will be just paradise. It will be utopian, once you have the billionaires—and I think some people who want to push us in that direction who are not billionaires still have to consider they know so much better than individuals across the country, and we would profit so much more from having this intelligentsia be the ruling class and all the rest of us be minions and do what we are told. We never have to decide what job we have. We have been moving in that direction. That is why I think you saw under the Obama administration the takeover of student loans. Then you will see, I think, in the next couple years a move toward more and more control over college students. You will see an effort to say: Look, there is so much student debt, why don’t we tell these students that if you go to the location we tell you, if you go take the job we tell you, then we will start forgiving your debt, as long as you do what we tell you? There again, we are on the road to giving up a middle class and to giving up our liberty and freedom, letting there be a ruling class that we will call the government. When I was studying history at Texas A&M, I did a research paper on the Soviet government. I was intrigued that Khrushchev, as Premier of the Soviet Union, understood that true communism theoretically did not have a government in existence. True communism means from those according to their ability, to those according to their need. People shared and shared alike. Regardless of how hard they worked, everybody shared equally. But in true communism, there is no government. The Premier, Khrushchev, set up a commission to come up—they loved their 5year plan for their economy— with a plan of how they could move to ultimate communism when there was no government. There would just be the people existing—loving, living together, and sharing together—without a government. It didn’t take too long—I can’t remember, a year or 2—until the commission and Khrushchev realized that, in this world, you can never have communism or socialism without a totalitarian government. He disbanded the commission. They never achieved their plan of how they could move into ultimate communism with no government, and so they moved forward with a totalitarian government. Of course, those who actually study real history know that no truly socialist or communist government has ever succeeded. They always fail. Margaret Thatcher said that they fail when they run out of other people’s money to spend. But we seem to be moving there. It wasn’t lost on some that, during the Obama administration, we had millions more added to poverty and in need of government assistance. We had so many moved out of the middle class into poverty. At the same time, President Obama himself admitted—it is on video, and it is the only time it has ever happened in the history of the United States of America. Under President Obama’s administration, for the first time in American history, 95 percent of the American income went to the top 1 percent income earners. b1145 It had never happened before. I hope and pray it doesn’t happen again. It has been fantastic in the last 2 years, or since President Trump has taken office, that we have seen the economy surge. We heard from President Obama that it is unlikely we would ever hit 3 percent growth again and that those days were behind us. So the middle class shrunk. The ruling class got more and more power. People were standing in line saying: Oh, please, master government, give me more of this, give me more of that. And it has been so refreshing to see millions no longer needing government assistance in different areas and that they are getting better jobs. But that shouldn’t have been a revelation, because if you look at single mom income when adjusted for inflation from 1965, when welfare began, to 1995, when a work requirement was 
added by the brandnew Republican majority under Speaker Newt Gingrich, that singlemom income adjusted for inflation for those 30 years flatlined. Single moms had no increase in income adjusted for inflation for 30 years. When the Republican majority in 1995 added a work requirement that you couldn’t get welfare unless you worked, if you were able to work, for the first time singlemom income, when adjusted for inflation, started taking off. I saw a graph by a dean at Harvard when I was there for a seminar. I was amazed, for one thing, that they would show that, reveal that at Harvard. But it was amazing. So, on the one hand, you had people that say: We care more about single moms, so we are going to give them more money for every child they can have out of wedlock. What it did was pull them into a rut they could not get out of. When I was a felony judge in Texas, one of the things that really began to deeply trouble me is seeing more women coming before me—single moms—for welfare fraud as a felony. I never sent any of those women to prison. I always gave them probation. But the stories were normally very, very similar. There were a number of different races. That wasn’t the issue. But the big point that seemed to be repeated over and over was often they were bored in high school. Someone would say: If you have a baby, you don’t have to finish high school. The government will start sending you a check. And then they would have a baby out of wedlock. The government would send them a check, and then they find out you can’t live very well like that. So the ones that came before me—I know it is not a blanket case—but the ones that came before me, most of them would have another child, thinking maybe if I can get another check, I can get out of this hole. And they would get in a deeper and longer rut they could not extricate themselves from. I have had great conversations with Star Parker, who can testify about the trouble with that. I have spoken to sociology classes at Texas college, a traditionally Black college, as well as Wiley College and Jarvis College in my district. They have done an amazing job of educating, so often it is the first person in a family to have ever gone to college. What is amazing is that once that first child gets to college, then their children end up going to major universities. It is just a wonderful, great step to help pull people out of poverty. I heard from students—the most vocal were single moms in their late twenties, some in their thirties—who realized that I am not going to have a good life if I stay in poverty. They set about to improve themselves through education. It was amazing to hear some of them, just adamant, you have got to have a mandatory work requirement, and another saying you have got to drug test people who are on welfare. These are all African American single moms. One of them was saying: Nobody ever drugtested me, so I can take government money and spend it on drugs. They were asserting that we should do things that this Congress has never ventured out to do. But they were adamant, because they have been lulled into, enticed into a hole, a rut that they were almost not able to get out of. A government should not be about luring people into holes or ruts from which they cannot extricate themselves. We ought to be about pushing, encouraging people to reach their greatest potential. That can not, will not, does not, has not ever happened in a socialist or communist system. If you get rid of the middle class, you have a ruling class, and you have a ruled class. If you wanted to call it sort of a middle class in the Soviet Union, they didn’t make more money than the rest in the ruled class, but if people had a little bit of power or a lot, then people that were part of the ruled class that had a shoe store or a grocery store or some other kind of place where goods or services could be purchased—but especially goods—the storekeeper would reserve things in the back to give to people that might have a little power that could help them. But I will never forget when, one morning, in a youth hostel in Moscow, a Ukrainian friend was staying in our room with me and two others—there were 8 Americans in the Soviet Union that summer—and a cleaning lady came in and she saw the Ukrainian and screamed and ran out of the room. I said: Why did she scream? Why is she going? He said: In your country, you are able to elevate yourself by working harder, making more money. You can elevate yourself. In my country, the only way you can elevate yourself is to step on other people. So she is going to run down and tell people I shouldn’t be here. She will step on me. It will elevate her a little bit. That is what we do in our country to get ahead. We step on each other, trying to get ahead. I said: That makes no sense. What has she got to gain by running down and saying that you are here? He said: She will be elevated for ratting me out. We are looking at major changes in this country. We are looking at a couple of years where there will be some socialist notions that will be brought here to the floor. But as we saw during the Obama administration, the economy doesn’t do well, people don’t do well, people don’t see right. We were moving dramatically in a socialist direction. ObamaCare was the first step toward total socialized medicine. But as I have told some of the Big Pharma lobbyists back when it passed and some of the big insurance people and AARP, who sold their souls to endorse the program, yes, you are going to make more money than you ever made in the short term. But by endorsing this program, you may well have signed your own death warrant. Down the road, maybe it is 15 years, but at some point you will cease to exist or you will be making next to nothing. But unfortunately, some of the big rich folks and some of the top corporate positions knew that if they made extra billions for their industry in the short term, they would have a golden parachute and they would be gone before their industry was destroyed by socialized medicine. And they didn’t seem to care. Of course, AARP sold out to seniors, because ObamaCare had a $716 billion cut to Medicare and the seniors are feeling it now. But we had a new group of voters come out. They don’t understand what happens in either socialized medicine or in a socialized system and they think it is going to be wonderful. Well, if you like less freedom, less assets, less opportunity, then socialism, progressivism, communism, whatever phase you want to call it, you will love a socialistic system. We have seen also the courts moving us in that direction. They have taken over more and more. Though the Founders saw the judiciary as being the least threat to liberty of the three branches, we have allowed the judiciary to basically become oligarchs and run America. Presidents are no longer allowed to make decisions as the Constitution and the Congress both have directed, when it comes to immigration, refugees. So, it is not just voters. We have seen the courts do their share in moving us toward a socialized system. But here again, like the billionaires, some of these judges—not all; I have been there, I have been a judge, been a chief justice—but some of these Federal judges see themselves one day alongside the billionaires as being part of the ruling class as we get rid of the middle class and have the ruling class and the ruled class. My hope, my prayer, the reason I am still here in Congress—I ran again—is to try to get us off this track. I deeply regret that we wasted September, haven’t done a whole lot this week, but I think the best Christmas present that this Congress, this current Republican majority could give America is—obviously, we are out now today until Thanksgiving—but stay in session through Christmas Day if we have to, through January 1, if we have to, and work out some of these issues, including money to build a wall where it is needed. That is not only good for America. It will help reduce the 70,000plus Americans who are killed from drug poisons coming from Mexico drug cartels, but it also would be the best thing we could ever do for our neighbors in Mexico. They ought to be a top 10 economy in 
the world. The only reason they are not is because of corruption from the drug cartels. Look historically at what they have got. They have got more natural resources than most countries in the world. They have got a better location than even the United States. They are between two continents, between two oceans. They have got it all going on. And they have some of the hardest working people in the whole world. Why are they not a top 10 economy? Because of the drug cartel’s corruption, the control they have over government. b1200 We cut anywhere from 80 billion— some estimates say they made that much last year on drugs sent into the U.S. Some say they may be making as much from human trafficking, getting people into the United States. Heck, they have people pay them to get them into the United States so they can be sent by DHS to a city where the drug cartels need them to sell drugs or be engaged in sex trafficking, human trafficking, and that is what has been going on all through the Obama years. That is why Border Patrol said the drug cartels call us, the DHS, their logistics. They get them into our country illegally, and then we ship them wherever the drug cartels want them to go. They give them the address; our people would send them there. That is being changed under this President, but it may not change for long with the new Congress. We will see. We owe America better than we gave them the last almost 2 years, and I hope and pray we are going to come back and not just snap the ball and fall on it, but do some good that we should have done long before now in the next couple of months. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
