Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Jo Lawson, the oldest living female veteran of Mercer County, Illinois. Mrs. Lawson has lived a life of service to her community and her country. Mrs. Lawson grew up on a farm in Aledo. After graduating from Aledo High School, she attended the University of Iowa, where she majored in elementary education. In 1944, at twentythree years old, Mrs. Lawson joined the United States Coast Guard. She attended basic training in West Palm Beach, Florida. Following basic training, Mrs. Lawson attended six months of radioman training in Atlantic City, New Jersey. After radioman training, she was stationed in San Pedro, California. Her primary duty there was to receive messages over teletype, which often included receiving coordinates for ships and fallen aircraft. In 1946, Mrs. Lawson was discharged with a rank of 3rd Class Radioman. In 1950, she married Colonel Dave Lawson. They were classmates in high school and stayed in contact throughout the years following their graduation They were later reunited in California. Colonel and Mrs. Lawson were married sixtythree years, until Colonel Lawson passed away in September of 2015. They had five children together, losing one to prematurity, and were also blessed with four grandchildren. In Mercer County, Mrs. Lawson taught one year at Perryton and taught seventh grade social studies at Northside Junior High. Along with serving her community through teaching, Mrs. Lawson was involved with and cofounded many local organizations, including the 708 Mental Health Board and Mercer County Recycling. Additionally, she was a planning board representative at her church, where she helped start the Churches of Mercer County Food Pantry. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again honor Jo Lawson for her extraordinary service to both her country and her community. f 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated, driven and hardworking young man from the Second Congressional District of Pennsylvania, Zachary Goldberg, the winner of this year’s Congressional App Challenge in my District. Zachary Goldberg is a Chestnut Hill resident and a senior at Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia. For this year’s Congressional App Challenge Zachary created an app called the Pennsylvania Legislation Tracker. In his words: ‘‘I developed the Pennsylvania Legislation Tracker to make information about the Pennsylvania General Assembly more readily available, enabling people to keep up to date on which legislation is currently being considered and supported by their state legislators.’’ Our students are our next generation of leaders. I was so impressed by Zachary’s attention to detail and keen awareness to help our community by developing such a thoughtful app that aims to keep Philadelphians and Pennsylvanians more informed in the political process. It is great to see such a passion for politics and helping others at a young age. The 2nd Congressional District of Pennsylvania is very proud of this great accomplishment and extends gratitude to Zachary Goldberg for his efforts to fight for a stronger tomorrow and dedicated support to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mashpee High School’s third consecutive Super Bowl victory. On December 2nd the Mashpee Falcons faced off against the Blackstone Valley Tech Beavers in the Division 7 Super Bowl. The Falcons were up by six points with three minutes left in the game and a last minute interception sealed this 22–16 victory. Fans erupted in ‘‘threepeat’’ cheers at Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots. This is the third consecutive and fourth overall state championship for Mashpee High School Football. They left it all on the field last weekend and, as Coach Belichick would say, ‘‘did their job.’’ The dedication and support of every player, every cheerleader, their families, the coaches, and other faculty members set the foundation for the Falcons’ undefeated season. With over twenty straight wins under their belt, I have no doubt that the Falcons will continue to make our community proud. I look forward to following their season next year and wish all of our graduating seniors continued success in the future. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the third consecutive Super Bowl victory for Mashpee High School. I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating them and wishing them all the best in the many seasons to come. f 
Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I was absent for the vote on the Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass H.R. 1730 (Roll Call No. 673). Had I been present, I would have voted yea. 
RECOGNIZING HANNA GRADE SCHOOL FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Hanna Grade School in Orion, Illinois, on being recognized by Nature and Culture International for its commitment to protecting the environment. Hanna Grade School has raised money for Nature and Culture International every year since 1999. Each year, their donation goes to a different part of the world in order to support an environmental cause. This year’s donation went to protecting jaguars in Mexico. Nature and Culture International is a nonprofit organization that works to protect biologically diverse environments in Latin America. Hanna Grade School was the only school mentioned in this year’s Nature and Culture International brochure, the first time this has been produced. 
Since 1999, Hanna Grade School has raised more than $6,000. That amount is enough to save more than 120 acres of rainforest. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to recognize Hanna Grade School for its outstanding hard work and dedication to protecting the environment, and thank its former and current students, parents, and faculty for their devotion to making the world a better place. 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Lori Liu who is leaving public service after four years on the Brisbane City Council, the last year as Mayor of this storied town near San Francisco Bay. Lori’s deep commitment to public service is evident from her accomplishments and contributions to her community. She is a champion of education, children, the arts, recreation, economic development and the environment. Lori was first elected to the council in 2013. While on the council, she served on, or as representative to, a number of organizations, including the Association of Bay Area Governments, the Peninsula Clean Energy Board of Directors, the County Library JPA, the council’s Economic Development Subcommittee, the Health and Safety Subcommittee, the League of California Cities, the liaison to the Parks and Recreation Commission, the Airport Community Roundtable, the Planning Commission, the liaison to the Open Space and Ecology Committee, the Community Choice Energy Advisory Committee and many others. You may justifiably surmise from this lengthy list that Lori is wellversed in a variety of issues affecting the residents of Brisbane and the region. Her leadership is notable as she tackled one of the most longstanding opportunities and challenges in the community: the Baylands Project. Lori was indefatigable as she conducted council meetings and listened closely to the community through hours of discussions involving possible offices, open space, housing, environmental cleanup and restoration, and the overall concept of a sustainable community. She carefully weighed the impacts of this project on Brisbane and our region. She was instrumental in laying the groundwork to build a new library which will be constructed starting next year. Libraries are community spaces that connect generations and nurture lifelong learning. The Brisbane Library will include a Maker’s Space to spark the creativity of the next generation of innovators, spaces for children and teens, a quiet study area, an outdoor garden, a community center, and the first public arts project triggered by a city ordinance. Lori has a long track record of working on environmental issues. In fact, when she moved to Brisbane in 2004, her very first volunteer activity was to attend an Earth Day clean up event. While on the council, she helped to secure a grant to renovate Crocker Park Trail. This funding will make the trail more usable for bicyclists, joggers and parents with strollers. It will also establish a safe pedestrian and bikefriendly connection between residential development at the Ridge and Lipman Middle School. Due in part to Lori’s outstanding work, Brisbane received the Platinum level Spotlight Award from the Institute for Local Government for environmental leadership and best practices. With her support, the city signed up to have all municipal electric accounts serviced by 100 percent renewable energy. Lori understands that a high quality of life for residents depends on a healthy balance of physical and financial security, education, functioning infrastructure, clean air and clean water, and recreation and entertainment. Life without music and fun would not be complete, so Lori supported the launch of two spectacular, familyfriendly community events, the Marina Kite Festival and the Star City Music Festival. The kite festival celebrated its first anniversary this June and the music festival will have its premier in July next year. Lori holds a B.A. from Tufts University and a J.D. from Northwestern University School of Law. She and her husband Raymond Liu live in Brisbane with their two young children, Samantha and Noah. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor Lori Liu for her exemplary service on the Brisbane City Council. Her public service made Brisbane a better place to live, work and visit. I personally regret that she is leaving office and hope she will return to offer Brisbane her skills and talents in addressing the issues facing her beloved city. I have no doubt that Lori will continue to make enormous contributions to any effort she undertakes. 
CONGRATULATING GALESBURG, ILLINOIS FOR BEING NAMED A PROJECT WINNER FOR THE 2017 GOVERNOR’S HOMETOWN AWARD 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Galesburg, Illinois for being named a project winner for the 2017 Governor’s Hometown Award due to its outstanding Galesburg Heart & Soul program. The Galesburg Heart & Soul project is a community revitalization and development effort, based on broad and vigorous resident participation. The project’s goal is to allow residents to voice what they value most about their town and encourage them to actively participate in community development. The project did this by collecting the input of Galesburg Residents from all walks of life through hosting multiple focus groups. Based on their voices, an action plan was built in order to guide all stakeholders to develop a stronger, healthier, and more economically dynamic community for all. The hard work and community collaboration visible through the Galesburg Heart & Soul project makes me especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Galesburg, Illinois for being named a project winner for the 2017 Governor’s Hometown Award. HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLES GILBERT SLEPIAN HON. JAMES B. RENACCI 
Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Charles Gilbert Slepian. A veteran of the United States Army, Charles dedicated his life to protecting and serving his country. Charles ‘‘Chic’’ Slepian was born and raised in the South Bronx in New York, New York. Charles was a loving husband to his wife Patricia Murray, dedicated father to his children Jon and Keri from his marriage with Nita Koval, and to Jenny and James from his marriage to Jeanette Slepian. He was a caring grandfather to his many grandchildren and proud uncle to Michael and Mark Slepian, and Lori Mulick. A graduate of the City College of New York and Fordham Law School, Charles had a rich career as an educator and attorney. He served as Deputy Commissioner to New York City Mayor John Lindsay. Additionally, he founded the Foreseeable Risk Analysis Center to consult on various security protocols. As a security consultant, Slepian was frequently called upon by national media outlets to offer his expert analysis on the improvement of security practices. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize a life so fully lived. Charles shared his energy with those whom he worked and instilled his values of sacrifice and service in his loved ones. His son, James Slepian, served not only as my chief of staff, but my confidant and friend. I am grateful for the Slepian family’s service to our country and ask my colleagues in the House to join me in paying tribute to a valued soldier and citizen, Charles Gilbert Slepian. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the men and women of the National Guard for their 381 years of dedicated service and sacrifice to the defense of our nation. On December 13, 1636, the first militia regiments in North America were organized in Massachusetts. From deploying overseas in theaters of war, to being activated by our nation’s governors in times of natural disaster, the Guard has been a critical component of our national security strategy, and an integral part of America’s military supremacy. I extend my thanks to Arkansas’s Adjutant General, Mark Berry, for his dedication and leadership of Arkansas’s Guard. Thank you to those Guardsmen who are currently deployed overseas, including the Arkansas Guardsmen currently deployed around the world in Kosovo and Kuwait. But most of all, thank you to those National Guardsmen who have given the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation. 
CONGRATULATING FULTON COUNTY, ILLINOIS FOR BEING NAMED A PROJECT WINNER FOR THE 2017 GOVERNOR’S HOMETOWN AWARD 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Fulton County, Illinois for being named a project winner for the 2017 Governor’s Hometown Award due to its exceptional recovery efforts following the event of the Canton Gas Explosion. On November 16, 2016, the town of Canton and County of Fulton were impacted by a natural gas explosion. This tragic incident destroyed one building, damaged 66 buildings, left 12 people injured, and left one person dead. The explosion was felt as far away as one mile. The explosion occurred in downtown Canton and affected many major businesses. However, instead of faltering, the community chose to come together and show what it means to be Canton Strong. In addition to public safety agencies, many volunteer agencies and volunteers themselves helped move Canton toward recovery. The Canton Chamber of Commerce also kept businesses informed and helped them get up and running again. This community’s response minimized the number of residents affected, job loss, and tax revenue loss. The hard work, perseverance, and community collaboration visible through Fulton County’s recovery efforts makes me especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Fulton County, Illinois for being named a project winner for the 2017 Governor’s Hometown Award.
