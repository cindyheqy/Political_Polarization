Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Sergeant Almon Wil-liam Martin, father of William Martin, Craig Martin, and Leslie Lederer and husband of Au-drey June Martin. Sergeant Martin dedicated his life to serving his community and our Na-tion, serving in World War II as a tech ser-geant in Europe and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery upon his passing in 2008. Before serving in the United States Army, Sergeant Martin studied at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio and completed his B.A. in Business Administration shortly after the conclusion of WWII. He then worked for the Gleasner Corporation/Ingersoll Rand in Buffalo, New York where he advanced to the position of vice president and divisional man-ager for the state of New York and Northern Pennsylvania. Sergeant Martin stayed with the company until his retirement in 1985. Through-out his retirement, Sergeant Martin also served as a mentor to upcoming businessmen through the Small Business Administration Volunteer program and used his business ex-perience to help small businesses in the Fort Myers area start up, organize, and expand. Sergeant Martin was an active member of his community, serving in organizations like Amigos, Central Park Men’s Club, Chi Phi Fra-ternity, Lions Club, Kenmore Rotary Club, and the Buffalo Kiwanis Club. Martin also served in the Construction Industry Association and was the vice president of the University Club of Buffalo, New York. An engaged citizen, Martin was active in politics and encouraged his neighbors to engage in politics at the local level. He coached little league baseball and football and was an active member of the Kenmore United Methodist Church. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize a life so fully lived. Almon Martin instilled the values of service, hard work, integrity, and service into his children, employees, and mentees, values that we should all strive to uphold in our daily lives. I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in paying tribute to a valued soldier and citizen, Sergeant Almon William Martin.

HONORING GONZALES CHIEF OF POLICE PAUL D. MILLER 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gonzales Chief of Police Paul D. Miller on the occasion of his retirement after thirty-four years of distinguished service to the community of Gonzales. Chief Miller has dedicated his entire career to the people of Gonzales, and our commu-nities on the central coast of California. His career began in the Monterey County Sherriff’s Explorer Program in 1978 where Chief Miller achieved the rank of Captain, the highest rank in that program. After completing the Explorer Program, Chief Miller joined the Gonzales Police Department (GPD), first as a reserve officer, and then a full-time officer in 1985. After being recognized as the Depart-ment Officer of the Year in 1987 and 1991, Chief Miller was promoted to the rank of Ser-geant in 1992. He was recognized a third time as Officer of the Year in 1995, and as Depart-ment Supervisor of the Year in 2006 and 2007. In 2010, he was appointed as Chief of Police for the City of Gonzales, where he served with distinction for seven years. A champion of proactive community polic-ing, Chief Miller provided important leadership that helped the GPD make important strides in reducing gang violence and maintaining Gonzales as one of the safest cities on the Central Coast. Under the leadership of Chief Miller, the GPD weathered one of the toughest recessions in history, coordinated the con-struction of a new 10,000 square-foot police station, and took a leadership role in securing key grants for the police departments of South Monterey County. Chief Miller also guided the department as the lead South County police agency in securing several important grants that helped provide important tools to help break the cycle of gang violence that con-tinues to plague our communities on the cen-tral coast. One of these key grants included $500,000 in funding for the city of Gonzales through the California Gang Reduction Inter-vention and Prevention (CalGRIP) Program. Mr. Speaker, as a former prosecutor who has worked closely with local police to pros-ecute violent criminal gang members, I know from experience that the work of taking and keeping these and other dangerous people off the streets of our communities is not easy. It requires dedication, perseverance, and the selfless willingness to put oneself in harm’s way in service to others. Chief Paul Miller cer-tainly embodies these qualities, and I whole- heartedly thank him for this service, and con-gratulate him on his well-deserved retirement. There is no doubt that his commitment to jus-tice, security, and prosperity for his community will be missed. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF SAINT LAURENCE PARISH 
HON. PATRICK MEEHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Saint Laurence Parish in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania as it celebrates its 100th anniversary on June 10, 2017. In 1917, Reverend Maurice C. Cowl became the first pastor of the Saint Laurence Parish. As Delaware County grew, the parish school opened its doors in 1919 and soon served many families. The Saint Laurence School is still an award- winning institution in the community, com-mitted to academic excellence. The parish school seeks to integrate Catholic values of service and respect. With the dedication and devotion of nearly ten pastors in the last hun-dred years, the Saint Laurence Parish is proud to serve nearly two thousand registered households in the Upper Darby and Havertown areas today. Mr. Speaker, we are grateful for the work of the Saint Laurence Parish, its parishioners, and Reverend Sean F. O’Neill and I hope the church will continue to grow and thrive. f 
RETIREMENT OF PATRICIA BROUGHTON 
HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGA´N 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Patricia Broughton, a dedicated public servant who is retiring after serving five members of Congress in the Los Angeles Har-bor Region. This week is Patricia’s last week as my San Pedro caseworker. I like to call her a miracle worker. Patricia is retiring after a 29 year long distin-guished career advocating for the interests of constituents and our community. I extend my sincerest appreciation to her for her decades of dedicated service to the Los Angeles Har-bor Region and our nation. Patricia was born in Uniontown, Pennsyl-vania. She spent her formative years in Japan and returned to the United States in 1963. After her studies, she moved to Long Beach, California, and began her congressional ca-reer in 1989. Over the years, Patricia has developed a reputation in the Los Angeles Harbor Region as a champion for constituents. My prede-cessors—including former Representatives Janice Hahn, Jane Harman, the late Steve Horn, and the late Glen Anderson—and I have received countless letters of appreciation from those whose lives were positively impacted by Patricia, and in 2011 the Wilmington Coordi-nating Council awarded her their ‘‘Outstanding Civil Servant’’ award. As I mentioned, Patricia is a miracle-worker, and has handled virtually every type of case that is referred to a congressional office. She has solved complex Social Security and Medi-care claims for seniors, helped disabled vet-erans who were not receiving their earned dis-ability checks, and assisted those who had trouble with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Internal Revenue Service. Patricia has been a voice for those in need and a source of comfort for those trapped in the bureaucratic maze that is the federal gov-ernment. For example, Patricia successfully

helped a Vietnam veteran get compensation with the Department of Veterans Affairs for a $200,000 claim. Among her many other responsibilities and accomplishments include organizing work-shops for Deferred Action for Childhood Arriv-als beneficiaries, and resolving thousands of casework files. Patricia is also devoted to the humane treat-ment of animals. She heroically rescued a dog that was hit by a car and abandoned in front of my predecessor’s district office, taking the injured dog home and making it a part of her family. Her coworkers and I have enjoyed working with her and will miss her warm heart and sig-nature elegance. Her compassion, persist-ence, and dedication have left a lasting mark on thousands of residents in my district and the Los Angeles Harbor Region. I am sure that I speak for the dozens of people who have worked with Patricia throughout her career in congratulating her upon her retirement and extending our heart-felt gratitude for her remarkable dedication to public service.

CONGRATULATIONS ON THE RE-TIREMENT OF COMMAND SER-GEANT MAJOR SHANE LAKE 
HON. KURT SCHRADER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Command Ser-geant Major Shane Lake on his retirement from the Oregon Army National Guard. Born in Farmington, New Mexico Command Sergeant Major Lake enlisted in the United States Army in 1990. Currently, he serves as the State Command Sergeant Major for the Oregon Army National Guard. While serving his country, Command Sergeant Major Lake also worked to earn a Bachelor of Science in Social Science with a minor in Psychology from Portland State University, and works as a Field Sales Engineer in the electronics in-dustry. Among his countless assignments through-out his exemplary military career, Command Sergeant Major Lake spent multiple overseas deployments to the Middle East and com-pleted a number of humanitarian missions throughout the world. A highly decorated vet-eran, just some of his service awards include the Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Ter-rorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the Army Commendation Medal to name a few. Command Sergeant Major Lake represents our very best that the great state of Oregon and our country have to offer. The State of Or-egon, the Oregon National Guard, and his sol-diers will miss the experience and leadership he brought to every mission. I humbly thank Command Sergeant Major Lake for his many years of service to the State of Oregon as well as to our country. May his deserved retirement treat him well. IN RECOGNITION OF THE 2ND ANNUAL BARN BLAST HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-ored to use this time to recognize the 2nd An-nual Barn Blast, a local fundraising event in Leesburg, Virginia, for the INMED Family & Youth Opportunity Center. The INMED Oppor-tunity Center is a program aimed to liberate children from the irreparable damages of hun-ger, abuse, and insecurity. They strive to equip struggling children with the skills and vi-sion they need to build a future filled with op-portunity and hope, and I am grateful for their service to our youth, the next generation of leaders. INMED Opportunity Center, located in Ster-ling, Virginia, is a part of a program of INMED Partnerships for Children, an international hu-manitarian organization, established in 1986. The INMED Partnerships for Children was founded with the goal of tackling the pressing needs of children in the developed and devel-oping world. The Opportunity Center serves as a crucial part of this larger organization as it offers a plethora of programs to support fami-lies in need in Loudoun County. Some exam-ples include after-school academic and enrich-ment programs, summer camps, family edu-cation and support, career skills training, homelessness support, and mentoring. This second annual fundraiser is an event that has garnered a great deal of popularity and community involvement. Located at the Murray Hill Estate in Leesburg, the event fea-tures live music, barbecue, dancing, and live and silent auctions. It is entertaining, commu-nity events, like the 2nd Annual Barn Blast event, that have helped this organization thrive and build its essential presence in our commu-nity. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in rec-ognizing the 3rd Annual Barn Blast and the INMED Family & Youth Opportunity Center and in thanking them for their commitment and service to our community. The efforts and con-tributions from the staff, volunteers, corporate sponsors, and our community are truly exem-plary, and I wish them all the best in their fu-ture endeavors.

TOWN OF MILAN, MAY 28, 2017 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD a speech I delivered in Milan on May 28, 2017. 
Memorial Day. A day of remembrance to our fallen soldiers. A day when all Ameri-cans are reminded of those who gave their lives to defend our freedoms. This day is per-haps best honored by the phrase uttered by Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg. They gave to the cause of liberty, he said, ‘‘their last full measure of devotion.’’ Memorial Day is significant in that it is an enduring reminder of those who gave their lives for our nation. We live in a time when only a small percentage of American fami-lies have someone who is serving on either active duty or in the reserves. As such, it is all the more important that we gather to-gether on this solemn day to honor their sac-rifice. So on this day, our obligation is not just to remember. It is also to teach our children and grandchildren that our liberty is more than just the words of the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution and its Bill of Rights. Those documents are the foundation stones of our system of govern-ment and the truth that governments derive their powers from the people and not the other way around. And further that the in-alienable rights we enjoy as a free people come from God and not from government. But none of this would be possible without the sacrifice of those we remember today. In-scribed on statuary at the National Archives Building in Washington is the phrase ‘‘Eter-nal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty.’’ We need to constantly remind ourselves that freedom is not free. Our liberties are guaran-teed us by our Constitution and Bill of Rights; but they were also made possible by the determination of multiple generations of Americans who answered their nation’s call and who defended our liberties to the last breath on the fields of battle. We stand on the shoulders of the fallen today. We owe them our eternal gratitude; our respect; and that their collective sac-rifice is forever etched onto our collective memories. I recently read a quote attributed to the son of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan. He said of his father: ‘‘his life was not taken: it was given to his country.’’ His life was not taken: it was given to his country. He gave his life to defend our na-tion, so that others of us can live in freedom and liberty. That truly sums up what we should always remember about those we honor on Memorial Day. May God Bless our fallen soldiers; may God Bless our Veterans; and may God Bless the United States of America. f HONORING NATHAN RILEY 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Nathan Riley. Na-than is a very special young man who has ex-emplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1376, and earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Nathan has been very active with his troop, participating in many scout activities. Over the many years Nathan has been involved with scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Na-than has served his troop as the Senior Patrol Leader, become a Brotherhood member of the Order of the Arrow, and earned the rank of Warrior in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say. Nathan has also contributed to his community through his Eagle Scout project. Nathan led a team in constructing a 52-foot free span truss bridge, first by removing the old, deteriorated wooden bridge, then designing and constructing two concrete revetments, assembling 2,800 pounds of steel trusses, decking the bridge, and having it all laid into place by a 90-ton crane.

LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH AND HOUSTON PRIDE WEEK 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate LGBTQ Pride Month and the remarkable progress that has been made in making our country more diverse and tolerant and embracing of differences in the 17 years since the cruel murder of Matthew Shepherd, a college student from Laramie, Wyoming. As a country, America has made and con-tinues to make great progress in the area of social equality, as evidenced most dramati-cally by the seismic shift in public support for marriage equality over the past decade. Today, supporters of marriage equality dra-matically outnumber opponents by 61–35 per-cent; a near total reversal from 2004, when opponents outnumbered supporters 58–39 percent. Our country made progress in bringing our LGBTQ brothers and sisters, mothers and fa-thers out of the shadows with the repeal of ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’’ which I was proud to support. Our nation is now stronger and our people are safer thanks to the sacrifices made by these brave Americans, who no longer need to choose between service and silence. There have been other changes for the bet-ter. In April 2015, President Obama issued a landmark Executive Order prohibiting discrimi-nation against LGBTQ persons in the work-place. This civil rights victory ensures the tax dol-lars used to pay government contractors sup-port contractors that are committed to equal employment opportunity for all persons regard-less of sexual orientation. This legislation marks a major shift from a time when the U.S. Civil Service Commission prohibited the hiring of LGBTQ persons to a time when the Secretary of Defense has se-lected an openly gay man as his chief of staff. And we are making progress in realizing the goal of making the H.R. 2282, the ‘‘Equality Act of 2017,’’ the law of the land so LGBTQ people will finally be guaranteed explicit, per-manent protection under the nation’s existing civil rights laws against discrimination in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury serv-ice, and federally-funded programs. It is unacceptable that in 31 states LGBTQ people can get married on Sunday and remain at risk of being fired or evicted on Monday simply because of who they are. Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 48th Anni-versary of the LGBTQ Civil Rights Movement, where activists such as Frank Kamney led the struggle for the voices of the LGBTQ commu-nity to be heard. Frank Kamney’s courageous demonstrations inspired others to resist mistreatment and we witnessed in 1969 what happens when a com-munity says enough is enough. Our country has made progress since the Stonewall uprising of 1969, and with the sup-port of equal rights for all communities by leaders such as President Barack Obama, more and more voices are being heard. Mr. Speaker, although more remains to be done to realize the full promise of America that all are equally treated and protected by the law, it is undeniable that America is closer to realizing that promise than it was during the dark days of Stonewall. So there is much reason for joy and opti-mism when my home city of Houston hosts ‘‘Wonderland,’’ Houston’s Pride Week celebra-tion later this month, from June 18 to 25, 2017. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the 16th largest LGBTQ community in the nation is located in the Houston metropolitan area, which I am privileged to represent. The Houston LGBTQ community is culturally diverse, economically dynamic, and artistically vibrant. Houston Pride Week has been an annual event for the last 38 years, since 1979, and promotes the individuality of Houston’s ever- growing LGBTQ community. The Pride Festival and Parade are at the center of a celebration annually attended by more than 600,000 people from Houston and around the world. Mr. Speaker, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. reminded us, ‘‘Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate can-not drive out hate; only love can do that.’’ All Americans should be deeply concerned over the increase in violence and acts of hate perpetrated against members of the LGBTQ community we have witnessed in recent months. Especially troubling is the rise in bigotry and violent crimes against transgender people, particularly transgender women of color. According to statistics compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, at least 22 transgender people in the United States lost their lives due to fatal violence, the most ever recorded. Sadly, we are on pace to break this record in 2017, as 11 transgender persons have been killed in the first five months. Mr. Speaker, I invite all Americans to visit Houston during Houston Pride Week to ob-serve how we live out our conviction that ‘‘Love Will Conquer Hate.’’ Progress is made through the efforts of cou-rageous men and women who actively engage their communities and face adversity to ensure that the rights of all are clearly recognized and protected. People like the legendary Bayard Rustin, who organized the 1947 Journey of Reconcili-ation which inspired the Freedom Rides of the 1960s and helped Dr. King organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and who was the driving force behind the his-toric 1963 March on Washington. Texas natives such as Sheryl Swoopes, a 3-time WNBA Most Valuable Player and champion for the Houston Comets, and former Houston Mayor Annise Parker. These leaders have set an example of what can happen when we lift the limits of inequality and support our fellow Americans in their pur-suits of their inalienable rights. Other members of the LGBTQ community whose contributions have enriched American culture and made our country better include the great poet Langston Hughes; Mandy Car-ter, 2008 national co-chair of Obama Pride and lifelong activist; Billy Strayhorn the musi-cian and gifted composer whose 30-year col-laboration with Duke Ellington gave the world some of the greatest jazz music ever; Tom Waddell, army medical doctor and Olympic athlete; and James Baldwin, one of the tow-ering figures in the history of American lit-erature. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to acknowledge the achievements of just a few of the count-less number of Americans who overcame prej-udice and discrimination to make America a more welcoming place for succeeding genera-tions of LGBTQ community members.

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN WILLIAM PERLSTEIN 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of a uniquely distinguished community leader, Captain William Perlstein, who has served the State of California as a Commander for the Highway Patrol. Bill began his career as a traf-fic officer in Hayward. He soon combined his career in law enforcement with his love of aviation, and trained to become a flight officer/ paramedic, working on a CHP helicopter out of the Golden Gate Division. Subsequently, he became an instructor with the California High-way Patrol Academy and trained individuals on emergency medical procedures. As an in-structor, he developed new emergency med-ical response programs, which helped to save lives across California. Bill also encouraged transparency in polic-ing and was promoted to work in the California Highway Patrol’s legislative affairs, working to develop cooperation with traffic and law en-forcement advisory groups. Bill eventually was promoted to provide technical advice to the California State Legislature and advocate for the California Highway Patrol at the Capitol. In this role, he was able to protect California po-lice officers and ensure equal protection under the law. Bill also managed finances for the California Highway Patrol and provided leader-ship, guidance, and supervision to area per-sonnel. Most recently, Bill became Commander for the California Highway Patrol’s Monterey Area. In this role he was able to establish goals, and develop strategies and tactics to keep the Monterey Bay area safe. Bill supervised em-ployees and provided training and area man-agement. He also ingrained himself within the community by joining the several organiza-tions, including becoming a member of the steering committee for the Monterey County Gang Task Force; serving as treasurer of the Monterey County Chief Law Enforcement Offi-cers Association; joining the Board of Direc-tors of the Monterey Rape Crisis Center; and participating in the esteemed Leadership Mon-terey, a program aimed at providing the con-tinuity of community stewardship. Throughout his entire career, Bill has been dedicated to the safety and welfare of Cali-fornia citizens, including his own family: three wonderful children, Stephen, Matthew and Ju-liet, and his wife of twenty-four years, Steph-anie.

RECOGNIZING THE 15TH INTER-NATIONAL FESTIVAL OF LAN-GUAGE AND CULTURE 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 15th International Festival of Language and Culture (IFLC). For the past 14 years, the IFLC has been showcasing both the diversity of our world and the talent of our youth. The IFLC draws par-ticipants from over 160 countries, with over 1,000 student performers each year at numer-ous regional events across the globe. This year the IFLC will be hosting 100 students and their teachers from 20 different countries in our nation’s capital. In its 15th year, Washington, D.C. will be one of many world capitals co-hosting this international event. In honor of this year’s theme, ‘‘Universal Compassion,’’ students will exhibit their culture and traditions through po-etry, songs, and dances as an expression of friendship, optimism, and hope. In a world of conflict and despair, this special event shows that celebrating diversity and peaceful coexist-ence is possible, and that we can come to-gether around our shared humanity. I want to congratulate the students, parents, teachers, and volunteers of IFLC for their ef-forts. This event will continue to show the world that we can live and work together for a better future. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the op-portunity to recognize the 15th IFLC.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MS. DYAN HAMILTON FRENCH COLE 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Ms. Dyan Hamilton French Cole, a New Orleans native and well known community and civil rights activist. Ms. Cole, affectionately known as ‘‘Mama D,’’ passed away on May 20, 2017, at the age of 72. Ms. Cole was a lifelong New Orleanian, and graduated from Joseph S. Clark High School. She was a relentless community activist, who would frequently attend city council meetings or other places where elected leaders were gathered to advocate for quality housing, recreation, and justice. Nearly every day, she headed to Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to advocate for young black men who were appearing in court that day. Ms. Cole is best known for her support of the Stalling Gentilly Playground and serving as the first female President of the New Orleans Chapter of the NAACP in January 1975. After Hurricane Katrina, when Ms. Cole re-fused to evacuate, she organized crews she called the ‘‘Soul Patrol,’’ to go through her na-tive 7th Ward and other neighborhoods, sav-ing people, feeding them and finding them clothes, assistance and other relief. Ms. Cole housed numerous people at her home on North Dorgenois Street that some people re-ferred to it as Recovery Camp Dorgenois. On December 6, 2005, Ms. Cole was one of the representatives from New Orleans invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Hurricane Katrina. Ms. Cole spoke passion-ately of the disgraceful lack of assistance in the aftermath of the storm and the racial dis-crimination that flowed in the city. Ms. Cole loved the city and the people of New Orleans. Her legacy will forever be a part of the city and her dedication to community embodies the spirit of New Orleans. Ms. Cole’s survivors include a son, Byron Cole; a sister, Audrey Jackson; six grandchildren; and two great grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the life and legacy of Ms. Dyan Hamilton French Cole, a beloved mother, sister, grandmother, great-grand-mother, and example to aspiring community activists everywhere. f 
HONORING JOHN REED FOR 75 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE DAVENPORT HOTEL 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. John Reed of Spokane, WA for his 75 years of service to the historic Davenport Hotel. John has been putting smiles on faces of those who come in and out of the Davenport Hotel for generations. He started working at the Davenport Hotel in 1943, at the age of 13, as a busboy in the Italian Gardens. Louis Dav-enport, the owner, taught him how to set up a table. His hard work and commitment provided him with an opportunity to become the door-man for the hotel, a position which he still holds at the age of 87. When asked if he plans to retire his response is ‘‘not any time soon.’’ Both local residents and guests of the Dav-enport can’t help but smile when they are greeted by John, who wears a three piece suit, complete with a long red coat and black top hat to work. He has greeted John F. Ken-nedy, Bobby Kennedy, and George H.W. Bush in his time with the hotel and has said, ‘‘I enjoy being a doorman here and meeting and greeting people, and I’m proud to be a part of the Davenport.’’ Today, the Davenport will honor John with a board room in his name. His legacy and com-mitment to service will live on through this naming and his smile will always be remem-bered. IN RECOGNITION OF CORLISS UDOEMA HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my constituent, Corliss Udoema, who is a successful entrepreneur and holds the unique distinction of being selected as the 2017 Virginia Small Business Person of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administra-tion (SBA). Corliss began her career in the federal gov-ernment, where she worked with the U.S. Ma-rine Corps, Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Army. Then after a suc-cessful 32-year career with the federal govern-ment, Corliss started Contract Solutions, Inc. (CSI) in 2006. CSI is a small business whose mission is to assist federal, state and local governments, private for-profit and non-profit clients, by offering professional staffing and management support services. Since its incep-tion, CSI has thrived, as it has evolved from a one-person company to a multi-million-dollar business. CSI has proven to be a model for other businesses to emulate, which is why in 2013 it was chosen to participate in the U.S. Small Business Administration’s esteemed Mentor-Prote´ge´Program, designed to enable successful companies to develop strong prote´ge´firms by providing newer firms still in their nascent with various forms of business development assistance. I am impressed by Corliss’s dedication and how in just a mere decade she has trans-formed CSI from a small startup business into a tremendous success and engine of eco-nomic growth. Starting and operating any small business, let alone one as successful as CSI, is an incredibly arduous process, as small business owners face many challenges and obstacles. The success of CSI is a testi-mony to Corliss’s hard work, commitment, and innovative ideas. In addition to her extensive and distinguished career in the federal govern-ment and private sector, Corliss has always found time to serve her community.

TRIBUTE TO GAIL BAXTER 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the lifelong service and success of Gail Baxter, the Superintendent of South Whit-tier School District, in my Congressional Dis-trict in California. The description of Mrs. Baxter you’d hear from those who know her best is that of a humble visionary whose inspirational leader-ship has empowered the students she serves to achieve beyond their dreams. She has been the catalyst for a 21st century trans-formation for South Whittier. Throughout her twenty-seven year career serving as an ele-mentary school principal, Director of Special Education Programs, Associate Super-intendent of Educational Services, and eventu-ally Superintendent, Mrs. Baxter led the effort to incorporate new technologies into every dis-trict classroom to prepare students for the fu-ture they face. Always pushing the envelope, Mrs. Baxter intertwined a core curriculum with the changing technologies of the day. Mrs. Baxter is the type of public servant we need in education, someone who promotes strong collaboration between educators and parents to inspire students to achieve. It is in that spirit that, on behalf of all the families who’ve benefitted from her service, I wish Gail a happy retirement and thank her for inspiring generations of students in the South Whittier School District.

IN RECOGNITION OF SUBSTITOOTH FAIRY 
HON. PATRICK MEEHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Substitooth Fairy in Delaware County, Pennsylvania for earning a Chester and Delaware County SCORE 2017 Small Business Award. SCORE is a non-profit organization that helps small businesses by providing them with mentorship and educational workshops. The small businesses that earn the SCORE Small Business Award ‘‘have demonstrated unique vision, innovation and achievement in support of America’s economy and small business community.’’ Substitooth Fairy deserves this designation. When dental practices are short-staffed, they provide them with supplementary dental pro-fessionals. This allows those practices to maintain an efficient office, keep patients happy, and also creates new employment op-portunities for dental professionals. I congratulate Substitooth Fairy on their award. I am proud to serve them and the other small businesses in Pennsylvania’s 7th District. f

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the D.C. students who sub-mitted artwork for the annual D.C. Congres-sional Art Competition. I also seek recognition for the members of the committee who volun-teered to make this event a success, as well as the competition jurors—members of the community who judged the students’ artwork. The competition will take place tomorrow, Sat-urday, June 3, 2017 at the Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars. The Congressional Art Competition has taken place in all Congressional districts since 1982 to encourage students interested in par-ticipating in the arts. This year, my office re-ceived 120 submissions from students in grades 8–12 from public, charter, and private schools across the District. The members of the D.C. Congressional Art Competition committee are from a variety of backgrounds in the community—academia, small business and local government. I am happy to recognize the following committee members for their tireless work in putting to-gether this year’s Congressional Art Competi-tion: Thomas Atkins, is a former member of my staff who has continued to serve as an advisor each year for this competition. We depend on Mr. Atkins because of his background and know-how in supervising our art competition when he was on our staff. Yaida Ford, an attorney for Ford Law Pros P.C., has been a valued presence in our art competition in the past, and has come through yet again this year. She ensures that her firm can purchase valuable and useful gifts for the winners. Tiffani Gomez, of Blick Art Materials, helps run art drives for the competition and gets the word out to students who may not have heard about the competition from our office. She was particularly helpful in getting out the word on social media. Jennifer Littrell, Program Lead at Children’s National Health System, is particularly helpful in getting the word out for the competition via creative flyers and other publications. Patricia O. Mitchell is a Senior Systems De-veloper for Amtrak. I have known Patricia for many years and she has done essential work for the committee. Ms. Mitchell helps the com-mittee reach out to food vendors for the recep-tion.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAURICE EL- AMIN FOR HIS DISTINGUISHED CAREER WITH THE SOCIAL SECU-RITY ADMINISTRATION 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Maurice El-Amin for his out-standing career with the Social Security Ad-ministration. Mr. El-Amin has served the SSA with distinction during his career with the agency. Mr. El-Amin has compiled an outstanding record of public service during his 33-year ca-reer with the SSA. He began his career with the agency as a Claims Representative in Dearborn, Michigan, where he helped resi-dents access the Social Security benefits that they earned. Mr. El-Amin excelled in this posi-tion and has served in a variety of key posi-tions in the Midwest, including as Operations Supervisor and District Manager in the SSA’s Chicago office. Since 2012, Mr. El-Amin has worked as Area Director for Metro Detroit, where he oversees the operation of 22 offices in Southeast Michigan and in the greater To-ledo area. During this time, he has overseen a modernization of many of the SSA’s serv-ices, including promoting increased use of on-line filing and eServices to facilitate improved service for Metro Detroit and its residents. Mr. El-Amin’s work has been key to ensur-ing that the SSA is able to meet the increased demands of the Midwest region. As Area Di-rector, Mr. El-Amin oversaw the work of over 450 employees whose tireless efforts played a crucial role in the evolution of the SSA. He has also been actively involved in the agen-cy’s recruitment efforts and mentorship pro-grams, which have been critical to attracting a new generation of talented public officials. Ad-ditionally, Mr. El-Amin has served as the Ex-ecutive Liaison for the SSA Chicago Region’s Black Advisory Affairs Council, which advises the Commissioner of Social Security on issues important to the SSA’s African American em-ployees. Mr. El-Amin’s experience and per-spective will be missed as he retires from the SSA after a long and distinguished career. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Maurice El-Amin for his work on behalf of the Social Security Administration. Mr. El-Amin’s public service has played a sig-nificant role in helping the SSA effectively serve Americans throughout the country. f 
TRIBUTE TO MR. SCOTT GLABB 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to take a few moments today to honor one of my con-stituents, Mr. Scott Glabb, for his contributions to Orange County youth over the last twenty years. Mr. Glabb has been an important figure as a teacher and wrestling coach at Santa Ana High School. After wrestling in college for Pa-cific University and Eastern Washington Uni-versity, Mr. Glabb took his talents to Santa Ana High School in 1990, where he became a teacher and head wrestling coach. Leading by example, Mr. Glabb’s dedication has led Santa Ana High School to the Cali-fornia Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Cham-pionships year after year. Mr. Glabb also coached two individual National High School Champions: Tony Perez in 1998, and Jose Leon in 1999. He had similar success through coaching two female Wrestling State Cham-pions: Lizette Tenorio in 2009, and Berenice Blanco in 2012. Mr. Glabb focused on more than winning, and has always made an effort to better his students. He has taken kids from a chal-lenging neighborhood and made them leaders. Because of his guidance, many have gone on to pursue higher education. Recently, Mr. Glabb was inducted into both the California’s Chapter National Wrestling Hall of Fame and the California State Wres-tling Hall of Fame. Mr. Glabb’s tremendous ef-forts are not left unnoticed and his accolades are well-deserved. More important than his awards is his impact, which made our commu-nity a better place. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Mr. Glabb and the positive impact he has made on the Santa Ana community. f 
HONORING THE VIETNAM VET-ERANS OF AMERICA CHAPTER 400 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary men and women from Oak-land who gave their lives serving our country in the Vietnam War. I recognize their invalu-able sacrifice and offer my gratitude for their bravery during a contentious time in American history. Unfortunately, Vietnam veterans have not received the proper recognition for their serv-ice. Prejudice overshadowed praise, as many of the stigmas associated with the war wrong-fully biased the public against the soldiers. Veterans have endured decades of misplaced criticism, blame and ignorance—this must be corrected. It is time that we, as Americans, give these brave veterans the commendation they de-serve. We must honor those who made the ul-timate sacrifice to preserve our freedom and that of our country. It is critical that we ac-knowledge the important servicemen and women, as they are fundamental to the pres-ervation of our democracy. Since 1979, the Vietnam Veterans of Amer-ica has served to support and advocate on be-half of this generation of Veterans. The organi-zation has worked tenaciously to promote greater public awareness of the issues sur-rounding Vietnam-era veterans in attempts to reform the public’s general perceptions. The VVA has given veterans a voice in our govern-ment, advocating on behalf of the injured, ill, and all others in need. By holding government agencies accountable, the VVA ensures equi-table and beneficial policies for this generation and those past. As someone whose father served in the Army, organizations like the VVA are incred-ibly important to me. I personally understand the sacrifices that these men and women make on a daily basis and believe they de-serve my utmost respect. I commend the Vietnam Veterans of Amer-ica for installing the Vietnam War memorial honoring the 100 men from Oakland who were killed in action. This monument will serve as an important reminder of the sacrifices made to assure our freedom and the freedom of oth-ers. The memorial will help properly com-memorate not only Vietnam Veterans, but all who dedicate their lives to serve and protect us on a daily basis. On behalf of the 13th District, I thank the Vietnam Veterans of America for its dedication to aiding and bettering the lives of well-deserv-ing Veterans in America.

IN RECOGNITION OF KATIE SIMMONS HICKEY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to acknowledge one of my constituents, Kate Simmons Hickey, for her exemplary leadership and steadfast commit-ment in her efforts to raise awareness for Leu-kemia and Lymphoma. She got involved with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in 2015 when she learned bout the Man and Woman of the Year campaign. That year she was named the LLS Woman of the Year for the National Capital Area and the First National Runner Up. Ms. Hickey, a lifelong resident of Great Falls and Langley High School graduate, was in-spired to work with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society after her father-in-law, Marty, passed away and her best friend went into remission from Lymphoma. She became involved in the Man and Woman of the Year campaign, which is a national 10-week fund-raising competition, and two years ago, Ms. Hickey raised $280,000 within that time frame, making her the second highest fundraiser in the nation and the strongest fundraiser in our region. Today, she has assumed a leadership role at the LLS and is responsible for picking Woman and Man of the Year candidates. Each year she aims to raise $2.5 million in the 10-week period, and I commend her for her leadership and dedication to the LLS. Along with her efforts with the LLS, Ms. Hickey is also heavily involved in her local community. She currently serves on the Cele-brate Great Falls Board of Directors, an orga-nization which for nearly 20 years has been responsible for planning community events and preserving many long time traditions in Great Falls. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in extending our sincerest congratulations to Ms. Hickey for all the work she has done for LLS and the Great Falls community. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.

OBERT C. ‘‘B OBBY ’’ SCOTT . It is our honor to rise today to join the many family, friends, and colleagues in extending our deepest thanks and appreciation to Thea Mei Lee, as she marks her retirement as Deputy Chief of Staff at the AFL–CIO. Over the past twenty years, Thea has made an indelible impact on the AFL–CIO, fighting for trade and economic policies for working families that would promote shared prosperity and sustainable growth. Thea began working for the AFL–CIO in March 1997 as the Assist-ant Director for the Trade Task Force, and was subsequently promoted to the positions of Director of Public Policy, Chief International Economist and Deputy Chief of Staff. Thea led the fight against harmful trade agreements and policies negotiated in a man-ner damaging to working people’s interests, in-cluding the North American Free Trade agree-ment, the Central American Free Trade Agree-ment, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, the World Trade Organization; the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.- China BIT, and many others. Her work was instrumental to the defeat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, and the Multilat-eral Investment Agreement—harmful trade agreements that would have advanced profits over people and the planet. She has testified on behalf of America’s working people before both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. And, she has contributed valued work to the con-versation around fair trade, including co-au-thoring A Field Guide the Global Economy. She has often made the case for a fair and inclusive economy—eloquently and passion-ately on the PBS News Hour, CNN, Good Morning America, and NPR’s All Things Con-sidered among others. In 2013, she was named a ‘‘Top Lobbyist’’ by The Hill. Thea has fought to ensure that all workers around the globe are treated with dignity and afforded fundamental labor rights as recog-nized by the International Labor Organization. And, she has mobilized workers, helping turn out thousands of working people to protest un-just WTO polices at ‘‘The Battle in Seattle.’’ The AFL–CIO sets a national standard in the fight for working Americans, in large part because of Thea’s work. She has left her mark on this outstanding organization and a legacy that will continue to inspire others to ensure that fair trade benefits working Ameri-cans. Her career should encourage all elected officials to continue to focus on building a bet-ter, stronger, more inclusive economy for all the people of the United States. We are honored to stand today to extend our heartfelt thanks and congratulations to Thea Lee for her outstanding leadership and good work as well as our very best wishes for many more years of health and happiness as she enjoys her retirement. f

HONORING MAUDY SIMPSON- WRIGHT 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a remarkable hero, Maudy Simpson-Wright. Maudy Simpson-Wright as born September 22, 1954 to the late Leroy and Annie Bell Simpson in Sumner, MS. She was the first born of twelve children. She faced many chal-lenges in her up-rearing, but thanks to God she had a praying mother and grandparents (Clarence & Maudy Roby) of Minter City, MS. In 1960, she moved to Falcon, MS and lived with her uncle. Later that year, Maudy’s moth-er met an married Lonzo Smith and moved into a new home. Maudy graduated in 1968 from Falcon Elementary School and graduated in 1972 from Quitman County High School. She attended Miller-Hawkins-Business Col-lege, Memphis, TN from August 1972–July 1973. Her mother became sick and she came back home to take care of her. Sadly she passed away in December of 1983; this was heart-breaking for all twelve children left with-out a mother, but Maudy’s grandmother stepped up to the plate. In August 1973, she was blessed with a job as a secretary at Falcon Elementary School where she remained for 22 years until the school closed. The school then moved to Southside Elementary where she worked five more years and retired. Maud would later hold positions at the Grand Casino, Coahoma Community College, QCDO Daycare, and the Quitman County Sheriff Department. Currently, she is a Parent Coordinator at Quitman Coun-ty Middle School. She is a graduate of Coahoma Community College and Mississippi Valley State Univer-sity. She has also completed coursework at Tougaloo College. She met and married Mr. Booker Wright, Jr. in 2004. She has one son, Daryel Levon Toles, and one granddaughter, Desiree Or-ange, whom she loves very much. Together, they have many grandchildren, nieces, neph-ews, cousins and other parent’s children. She is a member of New St. John MB Church, Darling, MS under the leadership of Pastor Jimmy Jones. Maudy loves Psalms 23, because of what it states: ‘‘The Lord is my Shepherd and I shall not want.’’

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Elite Pureed Meals of Broomall, Pennsylvania for earning a Chester and Dela-ware County SCORE 2017 Small Business Award. SCORE is a non-profit organization that helps small businesses by providing them with mentorship and educational workshops. Small businesses that earn a SCORE award ‘‘have demonstrated unique vision, innovation and achievement in support of America’s economy and small business community.’’ Elite Pureed Meals deserves this designa-tion. Colleen McCloskey was inspired to cre-ate Elite Pureed Meals while she operated an in-home care service. She witnessed a client lose a dangerous amount of weight due to swallowing difficulties and the unappealing food prepared for someone with that symptom. Colleen knew how important it was for him to have access to nutritious and appealing meals. She dedicated her small business to securing that access. Elite Pureed Meals pre-pares and delivers frozen pureed meals to those with swallowing disorders, helping them maintain a balanced diet and stay healthy. I congratulate Elite Pureed Meals on their award. I am proud to serve them and the other small businesses in Pennsylvania’s 7th District.

SULLIVAN COUNTY VETERANS CEMETERY 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD a speech I delivered at the Sullivan County Veterans Cemetery on May 29, 2017. 
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished hosts, our Gold Star Mothers, and all honored guests: Thank you for gathering here with us on this observance of Memorial Day. It is my great privilege and distinct honor to speak to you today. Memorial Day. A day of remembrance to our fallen soldiers. A day when all Ameri-cans are reminded of those who gave their lives to defend our freedoms. This is perhaps best honored by the phrase uttered by Abra-ham Lincoln at Gettysburg. They gave to the cause of liberty, he said, ‘‘their last full measure of devotion.’’ Here in the 19th Congressional District, the history of our Sullivan County neighbors has made an everlasting contribution to the priciples of self-sacrifice, patriotism and freedom we commemorate each Memorial Day. Sullivan County is the namesake of Major General John Sullivan, an officer of the Rev-olutionary War. Sullivan was a lawyer, poli-tician, prisoner of war and military tactician who was selected by George Washington to carry out a difficult campaign against Brit-ish forces and Loyalists in what was then the borderlands of New York and Pennsylvania. Sullivan was a towering figure who believed in the American experiment and rejected the entreaties of the British to lure him to their side. He had his feet planted firmly in the soil of this continent. During the Civil War, New York provided more men and munitions to the Union cause than any other state. But it was Sullivan County that let the men march. Over 80 per-cent of all the leather goods used by the Union side where conditioned in the tanning vats of Sullivan County, including Monti-cello’s 143rd Infantry Regiment. It has been said with justification that ‘‘the Civil War was won with boots tanned in Sullivan Coun-ty.’’ Each step of the journey to preserve the Union and destroy the evil of slavery began here. Here at the Veterans Cemetery, we have a visual reminder in the form of Sgt. Kenneth Von Ronn’s M60A3 tank. Sgt. Von Ronn was killed in action in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was laid to rest in this place, downhill from his tank, fittingly inscribed on the marker as a ‘‘trooper and his mount.’’ The vehicle today stands guard for all those here, opposing America’s enemies for all eternity. At Arlington National Cemetery, the 3rd US Infantry, the Old Guard, adorns thou-sands upon thousands of rows of headstones with American flags each Memorial Day. Each austere monument stands in perfect symmetry with the next. This is an act of gratitude to each individual warrior and the nation as a whole. Memorial Day is an enduring reminder of those who gave their lives for our nation. We live in a time when only a small percentage of American families have someone who is serving on either active duty or in the re-serves. As such, it is all the more important that we gather together on this solemn day to honor their sacrifice So too on this day, our obligation is not just to remember. It is also to teach our chil-dren and grandchildren that our liberty is more than just the words of the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution and its Bill of Rights. Those documents are the foundation stones of our system of govern-ment and the truth that governments derive their powers from the people and not the other way around. And further that the in-alienable rights we enjoy as a free people come from God and not from government. But none of this would be possible without the sacrifice of those we remember today. In-scribed on statuary at the National Archives building in Washington is the phrase ‘‘Eter-nal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty.’’ We need to constantly remind ourselves that freedom is not free. Our liberties are guaran-teed us by our Constitution and Bill of Rights; but they were also made possible by the determination of miltiple generations of Americans who answered their nation’s call and who defended our liberties to the last breath on the fields of battle. We stand on the shoulders of the fallen today. We owe them our eternal gratitude; our respect; and that their collective sac-rifice is forever etched onto our collective memories. I recently read a quote attributed to the son of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan. He said of his father: ‘‘His life was not taken: It was given, to his country.’’ His life was not taken: it was given, so that others can live in freedom and liberty. That truly sums up what we should always re-member about those we honor on Memorial Day. May God bless our fallen soldiers and may God bless the United States of America. HONORING JACK SCHLEETER 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Jack Schleeter. Jack is a very special young man who has ex-emplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1376, and earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Jack has been very active with his troop, participating in many scout activities. Over the many years Jack has been involved with scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Jack has served his troop as an Assistant Senior Patrol Leader, become a member of the Order of the Arrow, and earned the rank of Warrior in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say. Jack has also con-tributed to his community through his Eagle Scout project. Jack constructed two 8 x 12 foot planters outside St. Stephen Lutheran Church in Liberty, Missouri, filling the planters with 6 bushes and 24 perennials. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Jack Schleeter for his accom-plishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for is efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

TRIBUTE TO MRS. CECILIA LAIDEMITT 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mrs. Cecilia Laidemitt, the Associate Superintendent of Personnel and Administra-tive Services for the South Whittier School District. After a dedicated and impactful 52 years with the district, Mrs. Laidemitt is retiring at the end of this school year. Mrs. Laidemitt is appreciated and admired by many in this community, and has set a high bar for those to follow her. From a young age, Mrs. Laidemitt knew teaching was her dream. She attended Whittier College, and later re-ceived her teaching credentials and began her career at Los Altos Elementary School. Over the years she has served in a number of roles including teacher, principal, and Direc-tor of Curriculum. In each position she has brought her inspiring attitude and passion for learning. Mrs. Laidemitt often stated how she ‘‘loved seeing the light go on for students.’’ And it’s this passion that has made her suc-cessful and cherished. Her dedication and hard work has not gone unnoticed in the community; she is beloved by all she encounters. A truly admirable public servant, I wish Mrs. Laidemitt a happy and well-deserved retirement. You are an inspira-tion to us all, and your wisdom and kindness will be greatly missed.

IN RECOGNITION OF KRISTIN WEAVER 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an extraordinary Veterans Service Officer (VSO) in Northern Virginia, Kristin Weaver, for the incredible impact she has had on individuals, families, and communities in Virginia’s 10th District and beyond. Ms. Weaver is currently an American Legion Veterans Service Officer, representing the 16th District in Virginia, which includes the Cit-ies of Manassas and Manassas Park and the counties of Culpeper, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, Rappahannock and Stafford. In this role for the past 5 years, she has assisted 20 to 30 veterans per month on a variety of issues, including helping with disability claims, assisting with health and/or financial issues, and more. It is also important to note that in addition to the excellent services Ms. Weaver provides to veterans on a daily basis, she also places an importance on training other VSOs. In fact, over the last five years she has trained ap-proximately 350 VSOs in course work cov-ering all types of veterans’ benefits. Addition-ally in that time, Ms. Weaver has gone above and beyond in her role, often opening her home on Saturdays to help as many veterans as possible. It is important that we recognize and help our service members, military retir-ees, and their families who have all made sac-rifices for our great country, and I am very thankful for Ms. Weaver’s hard work. Her dedication to improving the lives of vet-erans in Northern Virginia is evident through her years of service. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking Ms. Kristen Weaver for all she has done. I wish her the best as she continues her work helping vet-erans and with all of her future endeavors.

DISAPPROVING PRESIDENT’S DECI-SION TO WITHDRAW FROM PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 2, 2017 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong opposition to the Presi-dent’s misguided, short-sighted, and disas-trous decision to withdraw the United States from participation in the Paris Climate Agree-ment. Since the end of World War II, the United States has proudly carried the mantle of global leader off the international community. American leadership brought us the United Nations, the World Bank, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Marshall Plan, which helped rebuild a continent decimated by war and secure a peace that has lasted for more than 70 years. As a senior member of Congress, a mem-ber of the Helsinki Commission, and member of the American delegation to the 80th Inter- Parliamentary Meeting of European Union and United States Legislators, one of my respon-sibilities is to work with the delegation’s Euro-pean counterparts on cooperative efforts to address and resolve issues of mutual concern. This is becoming increasingly difficult be-cause in less than 150 days, President Trump has done more to damage relations with our allies and the standing of the United States in the world than all of his predecessors com-bined. On his maiden trip abroad as the leader of the United States, Trump embarrassed our country and alienated our allies by failing to affirm our commitment to Article 5 of the NATO charter which regards an attack on any NATO member as an attack on all of them. Driving a wedge between the United States and its European allies has been the long sought strategic objective of the Russians since the formation of NATO in 1949. Compounding his disastrous performance at the NATO summit, the President has now re-nounced America’s commitment to the land-mark Paris Climate Agreement, which encour-ages all nations to set and reach national cli-mate goals every five years. The U.S. played the pivotal role in drafting the agreement, forging consensus, and secur-ing the assent of 195 nations. In withdrawing from the agreement, Trump has elected to place the United States in the company of Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries not to accept by the Paris Agree-ment. As U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham stated, by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, Trump is affirming that ‘‘he believes climate change is a hoax.’’ Mr. Speaker, climate change is not a hoax invented by the Chinese, and the Paris Agree-ment is an example of America’s indispen-sable global leadership. Almost every credible scientific voice tells us human activity has and continues to have a dramatic impact on climate change. Moreover, scientists have warned that inac-tion by the major industrialized nations of the world could lead to global catastrophe. According to NASA researchers, 16 of the 17 warmest years in the last 13 and a half decades have occurred since 2001. Evaporation patterns have shifted producing more frequent and powerful storms. The United States is the world’s second largest contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. Experts say the resulting polluted runoff is degrading water quality. As the founder of the Congressional Chil-dren’s Caucus, I believe we have a duty to leave the planet we inherited in better shape for the generations that follow. According to the American Academy of Pe-diatrics (AAP), changing weather conditions is cited as one of the main causes of trauma to children. According to the AAP, between 2000 and 2009, there have been three times as many extreme weather events as occurred between 1980 and 1989 and that following climate-re-lated natural disasters, high numbers of chil-dren are found to exhibit symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder. Children under one year of age are espe-cially vulnerable to heat-related climate change and there is more than a 90 percent chance that by the end of the 21st century av-erage summer temperature will exceed the highest temperatures yet recorded in many re-gions. According to the World Health Organization, more than 88 percent of diseases attributable to climate change occur in children younger than five. By 2030, climate change is expected to lead to 48,000 more children under the age of 15 dying from diarrheal disease in 2030, primarily in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. And in the world’s poorest regions, where the disease burden is disproportionately high, children will be the most affected by climate change influenced infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, West Nile virus, chikungunya, Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, diarrheal illness, amebic meningoencephalitis and coccidioidomycosis. The President has often questioned the value of the Paris Agreement but has yet to provide any scientific or empirical basis to re-ject the consensus of experts that human ac-tivity is a leading contributor to climate change. Indeed, if the President had any legitimate concerns regarding the efficacy of the Paris Agreement, he could and should work with America’s partners to address and resolve them. He has made no attempt to do so. According to a recent Gallup poll, 54 per-cent of Americans believe that climate change is a serious problem. As a Member of Congress, I have always acted on the basis of facts and promoted poli-cies that are both aspirational and grounded in reality. I have endeavored to always seek the truth by discerning what is real from what is fake. And when it comes to the issue of climate change, I have listened to the scientists. The President’s isolated and short-sighted view threatens to quash years of deliberation and work by corporate leaders, scientists, edu-cators, social actors and others who work tire-lessly to protect the planet. Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would be disastrous, not only because it jeop-ardizes America’s status as a world leader, but also because such action will undermine our competitiveness in the emerging clean-en-vironment global economy. According to studies, China is the world leader in renewable energy investment, pour-ing more than $78 billion into renewable en-ergy projects last year alone. In contrast, the United States invested less than $24 billion last year. Many jobs are at stake, and that means non-participation in the Paris Agreement could undermine American economic interests. We cannot afford to be left behind as the rest of the world moves toward a clean econ-omy future. A resounding bipartisan chorus has called for continued American observance of the Paris Agreement. From Republican and Democratic Gov-ernors to Members of Congress to our NATO allies, the chorus of voices counseling against withdrawal continues to grow. Americans want their country to lead the battle against climate change and for a healthy planet. The President needs to recognize that he represents the entire country; not just the Trump Organization. Trump needs to remember that he is the President of the United States of America.
