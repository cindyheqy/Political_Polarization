Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Representative Ray Rogers of Pearl, Mississippi. On November 17, 2018, Ray completed his 55th and final season of service as the Pearl High School Voice of the Pirates. For 55 years, Ray volunteered his time and energy as the public address announcer for the Pearl Pirate football games and was so committed that, in 55 years, he missed just onehalf of one game in 55 seasons. Now, the reason Ray missed the first half of that game was so that he could attend his daughter’s wedding rehearsal dinner. After listening to the game on the radio during much of the dinner, Ray left as soon as the dinner was ended so he could announce the second half of the game. Ray’s commitment to the Pearl community was recognized several years ago when leaders of the Pearl Public School District decided to name the football stadium Ray Rogers Stadium. Ray was one of the first students to attend Pearl High School when it opened in 1948 and was the first quarterback for the first football team in 1949. Ray has been a public servant and leader for Pearl and Rankin County in many other ways. In 1983, he was elected to serve District 61 in the Mississippi House of Representatives and has been reelected every 4 years since, most recently in 2015. Ray has spent 35 years in the State legislature working to improve our schools and infrastructure. As chairman of the Military Affairs Committee, he has been a tireless supporter of our National Guard and veterans and was instrumental in the effort to build three veterans homes in Mississippi with the help of thenCongressman Sonny Montgomery, who served the Third District of Mississippi. Ray has been a longtime member of the Management and PEER Committees—a testament to the respect and trust that his fellow legislators have for him. He has served as a mentor and role model for many incoming representatives over the years, and Ray’s example has been invaluable to me. He has taught me by the way he lives, by what he does, and by how he treats everyone with respect. Ray Rogers has lived a life of service to others, and I know that he believes his most important service has been to God and his family. An active member of McLaurin Heights United Methodist Church in Pearl, Mississippi, Ray is the father of three daughters, four grandchildren, and two greatgrandchildren. While he is proud to be known as the representative and the Voice of the Pearl Pirates, he is proudest to be known as Daddy and Pop. Ray’s wife, Shirley, has shared his passion for serving others. Shirley served for two decades as the first city clerk for the city of Pearl and after that was a director of personnel for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Like Ray, Shirley is an active member of their church, and she is a loving and supportive wife, mother, and grandmother. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity today to honor Ray Rogers—my State representative, the Voice of the Pirates, proud father and grandfather—and to congratulate him on his impressive record of public service. Thank you, Ray, for your friendship and for setting an incredible example for all to follow. f 
FORGING A BETTER NATION The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky). The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) for 5 minutes. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the last time as a Member of Congress. For the past 6 years, it has been an extraordinary honor to serve the residents of central and northwest Connecticut as their Representative in the House. The title for this job is a humble one: Representative—not emperor, not knower of all things, but Representative. Congress was not my dream, but making a difference was. In 2005, my then 15yearold daughter challenged me to either run for the local town council or stop complaining. I ran. I 
found that I could get things done, first on the town council and then as a State representative. I came to Congress with a desire to make a difference for people, to help solve their problems, fight for affordable quality healthcare, ensure education that addresses the needs of every child, work across the aisle for better jobs and better pay for Americans, and keep us all safe and free. Yet I arrived in Congress in the aftermath of the terrible shootings of 20 6 and 7yearold children and six educators in the town of Newtown in my district, 6 years ago this coming Friday. My task immediately became how to truly care for and represent those families and be an effective voice for taking action to prevent gun violence. At the time, I did not even know how to find the elevator to get to my attic office in the Cannon House Office Building. John Dingell, the longest serving Member of Congress, took me under his wing and helped me navigate these Halls. He gave me invaluable advice. He said: 
Elizabeth, always remember this: What you do is very important. But you are not important. 
It is your job to know your district and vote your district. 
How right he was. I learned my district. My team and I worked with others to get lots of legislation passed to help veterans and their families, to support STEM education for women, girls, and children of color; to modernize and upgrade our infrastructure; and to fight the scourge of opioid addiction. We helped thousands of individuals at home cut through red tape and get muchneeded support. By working with people, we were able to help government work for people. Here are some things that I have learned: The American people are good, great, and eager to see our democracy work better; Sharing credit is not only the right thing to do, but it works; If you listen to others, if you look for and build on common ground, you can get things done even with people with whom you disagree on many issues. The first step is often the hardest. In politics, Mr. Speaker, you need to earn support. You are not entitled to it. You will fail sometimes. You will not meet your own high expectations. You will disappoint people. You will lose an election, but you get up the next day and you try harder. If there is nothing you would be willing to lose an election over, you shouldn’t run for office. Democracy needs people who are prepared to lose their job to make a difference. Democracy is not about perfection. Democracy is about doing your best every day and bringing out the best in others; and when we fail—which we will—we should not give up. We should get right back to work. Mr. Speaker, you shouldn’t run because you know you will win; you should run because there are things worth fighting for. If we remember our common values rather than call into question each other’s integrity, there is much we can do together. Democracy is something we do; it is not something we tweet about. Democracy is hard. It is not a spectator sport. You don’t need permission in this great country. Democracy gives us—each and every one of us—the opportunity and the right to run, to serve, and to make a difference. American democracy is a great thing, but it requires us to pitch in and to do our part. We have the opportunity— and in these challenging times for our Nation and the world, I believe we have an obligation—to get involved. I want to thank my amazing family for their love, their support, and their sacrifices over more than a dozen years of elected office. I thank the voters who entrusted me to work on their behalf. I thank my excellent staff who have worked so hard and ably. I thank the many colleagues who generously guided me and worked with me on issues of common concern for the American people. In closing, John Dingell’s words return to me: If you ever look up at the Capitol Dome at night and it doesn’t send shivers down your spine, you don’t deserve to be here because you aren’t sufficiently in awe of American democracy. 
I can say without hesitation that the white of the Capitol Dome gleaming in the night still sends shivers down my spine. It always will, for we are fortunate enough to live in this amazing country where we have the right to choose our leaders, to raise our voices, and, together, to forge a better nation and a better future for all our children. 
FARM BILL CONFERENCE REPORT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I proudly signed the farm bill conference committee report because, after years of hard work, we are set to deliver a win for rural America. Quite frankly, it is a win for all Americans who count daily on access to affordable, highquality, safe food. We know that farm country is hurting. USDA recently announced that net farm income for this year is dropping by 12 percent to levels we have not seen since 2002. There is hope though. By passing the farm bill conference report, we can give producers and their lenders certainty. They will know what farm policy will be in place for the next 5 years. We also made modest adjustments to the Marketing Assistance Loan program to help with cash flow after harvest and to providing marketing for U.S. commodities. There are also important enhancements to dairy policy included in the conference report. Building upon investments made to the dairy safety net as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, we are offering new coverage levels for the first 5 million pounds of production, which drastically reduces premiums on certain levels for larger producers. These are just some of the many updates in the 2018 farm bill that will set our American farmers on a better path for the next 5 years. The 2018 farm bill strengthens the farm safety net, protects crop insurance, maintains and preserves conservation funding, improves SNAP program integrity and incentivizes work, and, importantly, provides certainty to rural America. This agreement reached between the House and the Senate strengthens and maintains important programs like the Price Loss Coverage, the Agriculture Risk Coverage, marketing loans, dairy margin coverage, livestock disaster programs, and crop insurance. As vice chairman of the committee, I know that a lot of work went into building and negotiating a great bill for our farm families. I would like to thank Chairman MIKECONAWAY and Ranking Member COLLIN PETERSON for their commitment to passing this bill in 2018. This Congress, I proudly chaired the Nutrition Subcommittee. The House bill included provisions to give many Americans the skills needed to obtain a familysustaining job. While this conference report is a compromise, it does include significant incremental victories that will improve the integrity of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, so it will be more effective for those who truly need it. The Nutrition Subcommittee hosted 21 hearings on SNAP and heard from more than 80 witnesses on how to improve the program and work toward the ultimate goal of ending hunger in America. Mr. Speaker, make no mistake. The 2018 farm bill makes real improvements to our Nation’s largest antihunger program. These provisions will only further enhance the program so it will be there for the most vulnerable among us, the truly needy. Now, I am hopeful that we can continue this conversation and soon revisit numerous provisions from the House farm bill’s nutrition title. Specifically, there is so much more that can be done through SNAP to help more Americans find goodpaying, familysustaining jobs—an ultimate food security. That is the American way. The farm bill conference report also helps improve our response to natural disasters, including catastrophic wildfires that have ravaged parts of the Nation. To help encourage new markets for domestic forest products, the conference report invests in research 
and development specifically for these new woodbased materials. b1015 We put emphasis on connecting rural America through significant improvements to broadband delivery. We are dedicating funding to rural health projects to help Americans struggling with opioid addictions and other substance abuse disorders. This is just some of what is included in the conference report. There is much more policy included that provides key wins for producers, rural communities, and American consumers. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this conference report and deliver muchneeded certainty to rural America and all Americans who are in need of affordable, highquality, and safe food. 
ABOLISHING BIGOTRY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, once again, I rise to stand in the well of the House of Representatives. As a proud American, it is always an honor to stand in the well of the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak truth to power as well as speak truth about power. The power that I desire to speak truth to is the Speaker of the House, and I want to say something about the Speaker of the House. Today, I acknowledge the Speaker’s righteousness when he made a decision—I am not sure that it is one that he contemplated with any degree of time—but at some point, there was a decision made to allow Articles of Impeachment that I filed to move forward, such that there could at least be a vote to table it or not. He did not interfere with the process. He did not try to change the rules so that there would be no opportunity for a Member to move impeachment forward, to the extent that we did. I am proud of Speaker RYANfor doing this because, as a result, I hold in my hand what I call the historic 58. Fifty eight Members of Congress, some of whom were ranking members of full committees, voted to allow this process to move forward. On a second occasion, 66 Members, the historic 66, voted to allow the process to move forward. Mr. Speaker, Mr. RYANdid not try to circumvent the process. For this, I say that I am grateful. I respect him for not trying to circumvent the process. Mr. Speaker, had he tried to circumvent it, I probably would be standing here saying some words that would not be similar in any way to what I am saying currently. I am mentioning this because there is a question that has been put to me by many members of the press as to whether or not we will move forward again with impeachment. I am here to say without question, reservation, or hesitation that we should not allow ourselves to get back to bigotry as usual. There seems to be a desire to avoid the question of bigotry emanating from the Presidency. There seems to be a desire to move on to something else; let’s find another way to deal with the problem. But that is not what the people who suffer from the bigotry have to endure, just the conversations. They have to deal with the actual bigotry, the actual ugliness that is being fostered across the length and breadth of this country as a result of the bigotry. There are people who are suffering. The culture is changing. Bigotry is real, and people have to deal with it. Because they do, I don’t think we should allow bigotry to go unnoticed as it emanates from the Presidency. Because I don’t think so, I will make an announcement sometime next week, more than likely, as to whether or not we will have additional Articles of Impeachment brought before the House. I have never interfered with the Mueller investigation; I don’t intend to interfere with it. But I just believe that we ought not allow bigotry to go unnoticed. We ought not try to get to a point in this country where we will allow bigotry to be nothing more than a talking point. It ought to be an action item. The greatest place to ascertain whether it is an action item is how we as Members of Congress not only talk about it, but how we vote when the issue is given an opportunity to be voted upon. Mr. Speaker, I assure you that I will make an announcement sometime in the near future as to whether or not there will be another vote on bigotry emanating from the Presidency. I also, again, thank you for not circumventing the process. Republicans had a majority, and you could have done it without a single Democratic vote. You respected the right of individual Members. It is the right of the individual that you have protected under your leadership. I pray that protection will continue. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f 
HONORING CORY FRITZ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dedicated public servant and member of my senior staff, Cory Fritz. The Foreign Affairs Committee has benefited greatly from his sound judgment, skill, and passion for the values, including a free press, that have made America strong. Cory got his start on the Hill writing speeches, advocating stronger U.S. relations with the former captive nations in Europe, for the late Senator Voinovich of Ohio. He later joined the congressional office of thenMinority Leader John Boehner of Ohio. Working for John throughout his speakership, Cory played an important role on a number of foreign policy issues, including efforts to force the administration to step up the fight against ISIS. Upon John’s retirement, it was only fitting that Cory move to the Foreign Affairs Committee. As deputy staff director, Cory has elevated the committee’s communications operations and played a key role in shaping strategy and policy. Cory is one of my most trusted advisers. His counsel helped pave the way for a number of important accomplishments, including the landmark Russia, Iran, and North Korea sanctions enacted in 2017. Also, I am proud to have inspired him to take special interest in conservation policy, which has long been a priority of mine. With Cory’s assistance, I have advanced legislation to combat wildlife trafficking and poaching. We have also advanced legislation to preserve southern Africa’s vital Okavango River Basin. As I leave the House, I thank Cory for his 11 years of service to his home State of Ohio, to this Republic, and also to the Congress. I wish him and his wife, Sarah, all the best as they prepare to welcome their first child in the spring. f 
PROTECT GOOD FRIDAY PEACE ACCORDS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, one of the dominant news stories on both sides of the Atlantic was the announcement by British Prime Minister Theresa May that she was postponing a muchanticipated vote on accepting a preliminary Brexit package that had been negotiated with the European Union. Her decision, unfortunately, continues the turmoil in her own party and Parliament at large about how to implement a referendum that was narrowly passed instructing her government to leave the European Union that the United Kingdom joined 45 years ago, in 1973. As a Member of the U.S. Congress that is also divided and struggling with its own ability to execute basic functions, I have a great deal of empathy, as I am sure many of my colleagues do, with the frustration that members of Parliament and the British public are feeling today. Fundamentally, of course, this is a domestic question for Parliament, and it would be presumptuous for elected officials from the outside to weigh in on the agreement’s proposals regarding residency, immigration, visa requirements, and how healthcare coverage will be coordinated if and when the U.K. exits the European Union. However, there is one issue, in which myself and many of my colleagues from 
the U.S. have a very keen interest, and I raise it today in a friendly but firm voice. That is, namely, the status of Northern Ireland under the Good Friday peace accords. Unfortunately, Mrs. May, in her announcement yesterday, indicated that that was the one issue, that her efforts to protect the Good Friday peace accords were going to be renegotiated and possibly dismantled. Mr. Speaker, I wish to remind the House that the Good Friday peace accords, which were signed 20 years ago last April 10, have the active and supportive involvement of the U.S. Government and the U.S. Congress. The Clinton administration in the 1990s, at the invitation of the Irish and British Governments, named former U.S. Senator George Mitchell as Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, and he chaired the allparty peace negotiation over a number of years, which led to the Good Friday peace accords. His work, along with his successor, Richard Haass, was crucial to the success of the talks and the execution of the agreement. In the U.S. Congress, members of a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including our colleague RICHARD NEAL of Springfield, Massachusetts, were frequent visitors and participants during the negotiations. To this day, Mr. NEALand bipartisan members of the Friends of Ireland Caucus, of which I am a member, continue to monitor the progress and success of the Good Friday peace accords and are deeply, deeply concerned that Brexit, if it reinstates a hard border on the island of Ireland, will undo one of the great diplomatic successes of our time. Mr. Speaker, the successful results of the peace agreement cannot be denied. During The Troubles, which preceded the accords, more than 3,600 residents of the six counties of the North lost their lives due to sectarian violence and 763 servicemembers of the British Government and the Northern Irish Government lost their lives. To put that in perspective, 464 U.K. troops have lost their lives in the long war in Afghanistan. The economic results have also been undeniable. Mr. Speaker, I have a little bit of experience because in 1973 and 1974, I was a student in England and spent the Christmas break in Northern Ireland visiting a fellow student in the town of Enniskillen. I took the train from Dublin to Belfast. In the border town of Dundalk, where I was asleep, I was awoken by a British soldier heavily armed, poking me to look at my backpack. While we visited in Enniskillen, there was a bombing in the village. Looking around, it was clearly a depressed economy because of the hard borders and because of the isolation of Northern Ireland. Fast forward, I took a trade mission from the State of Connecticut to Belfast 2 years ago, and it is a transformed city. It is thriving. It is healthy. Clearly, allowing the Northern Irish economy to participate both in the full island as well as Europe has had beneficial effects. That is why the people of Northern Ireland actually voted ‘‘no’’ on Brexit. Mr. Speaker, we are at a point today where the British Government clearly has to make a decision about whether to preserve one of the great diplomatic successes, which provides a roadmap for sectarian violence all across the world. Diplomacy succeeded in Northern Ireland. It is imperative that those in charge there protect the hardfought work and remember that there are stakeholders outside of England and Great Britain, including the United States Government and the United States Congress, which have skin in the game and have investment in terms of the great success over the last 20 years. Protect the Good Friday peace accords. Protect the peace that has flowed from it. Protect the prosperity that has improved the lives of the people of Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic, and the world at large. f 
DEMOCRACY REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Speakerdesignate PELOSI , Whip H OYER , and Representative SARBANES for honoring the will of the American people and pledging to make democracy reform a top priority for the 116th Congress. One of the greatest promises of our democracy is that our government is of, by, and for the people. Our democracy has always been a messy experiment. It is not perfect. It is not a spectator sport. But it is our greatest hope. At this point in time, unfortunately, many of our democratic structures are under attack. In my home, Pennsylvania, over the past decade, we have seen the impact of antidemocratic policies. The cards have been stacked against the voices of Pennsylvanians through unconstitutional gerrymandering, repressive voter ID laws, and restrictive absentee ballot deadlines. These tactics have been used to muzzle the voices of our constituents, as well as voters in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia, and other citizens across the country. b1030 The H.R. 1 package being advanced by Representative SARBANES and the Democracy Reform Task Force is a onceinageneration opportunity to restore the American people’s faith in our institutions. History has shown us that our American experiment is at its best when we face complex challenges headon and we are better for taking them up. H.R. 1 is our path forward to a more perfect democracy. Our elections are the bedrock of this Nation, and the sanctity of those elections must be protected from threats, both foreign and domestic. We can make it easier, not harder, for eligible Americans to vote. We can end the dominance of Big Money in our politics. We can ensure that public officials, from the White House to Members of Congress, put the interests of the American people first. We can do all of those things, and we must. Public opinion polls show that the American people’s distrust of our governmental institutions is at staggering levels. We must work together, Democrats and Republicans, to change course and restore the people’s faith. We have real work to do, and Members of the incoming class are ready to roll up our sleeves. The voters have charged us to restore the balance of our political institutions and make sure that everyday Americans have a seat at the table. When we listen to people instead of special interests, we can raise the minimum wage and create goodpaying jobs; we can lower prescription drug prices and give people better access to healthcare; we can make real investments in our infrastructure; we can reduce gun violence; and we can increase funding for job training programs and public education. Mr. Speaker, we owe it to the generations before us who worked to establish this democracy and we owe it to the generations that follow to ensure that we have a Government that is truly by and for the people. We can work on this together. It is up to us to get it done, and this work starts now. f 
THANKING FIRST RESPONDERS TO THE CRANSTON FIRE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the communities affected by the Cranston fire, one of the largest wildfires my congressional district and eastern Riverside County has ever seen. While the Cranston fire was contained in August, many of my constituents are continuing to piece their lives back together, and anytime severe rain is forecasted, they once again go into high alert for mudslides from the burn scar. The Cranston fire started on July 25, 2018, and within a matter of a few hours residents of Idyllwild and the mountain communities were immediately forced to evacuate from their homes. Without hesitation, first responders from the Idyllwild Fire Department, the Idyllwild Volunteer Fire Company, CAL FIRE, the California Highway Patrol, the U.S. Forest Service, and countless others from all over the Nation sprang into action. Thanks to their efforts, no lives were lost and the fire was fully contained by August 10, having burned more than 
13,000 acres. Months later, I am left with the image of police officers walking through smoldering neighborhoods with megaphones, making sure no one was left behind. Today, Idyllwild continues to embody that spirit of community and togetherness. They are rebuilding homes, clearing debris, and preparing for the next wildfire that threatens our communities. Friends and neighbors continue to support one another, and I continue to be inspired by their compassion and determination. Throughout this rebuilding, our communities have expressed something profound: gratitude. Rarely have I seen such an outpouring of support for our first responders. I have seen fences papered with handwritten signs thanking the firefighters and countless tributes to their courage and sacrifice at local festivals and benefits. The affected communities could not have made it this far without the support of religious groups, nonprofits, local businesses, and generous neighbors. During the fire, volunteers with the American Red Cross and the FIND Food Bank delivered food to evacuation centers. So did local restaurants, including Idyllwild Bake Shop & Brew, Cafe Aroma, Coyote Red’s, the Mile High Cafe, and many others. The Ace Hotel, V Palm Springs Hotel, and Grand Idyllwild Lodge were just a few of the businesses that generously opened their doors to displaced residents. That generosity extended to our four legged friends, too. I visited the San Jacinto Valley Animal Campus, where staff provided shelter for more than 160 local pets. Their legacy of compassion lives on through community organizations like Young Idyllwild, who hosted a music festival and benefit to raise money for neighbors still struggling to piece their lives together. I was particularly moved by the generosity of local musician Ernesto Ale and his family, who lost their home in the fire. In the midst of this hardship, Ernesto found the strength to perform, bringing music to his community and raising money for neighbors who, like him, lost so much in the fire. Ernesto is proof of the kindness and strength exhibited by every neighbor, firefighter, police officer, and business owner who pitched in after the Cranston fire. Government should follow the example of communities it serves, pulling together in times of crisis and lending a hand to those in need. 
ADDRESSING THE HOUSE FOR THE FINAL TIME The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN  GRISHAM ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise for what will likely be the last time I address the House. First, I thank the people of New Mexico for entrusting me to represent you in Washington, holding me accountable, and giving me direction. From my first day in Congress to my last, every constituent or stakeholder who stopped me on the street or walked into my office, your office, to tell me about their issues and priorities was my boss. It has been the honor of a lifetime to work with you. Thank you to our team of brilliant, passionate staff who worked early mornings, late nights, and weekends because they knew just how important our work was to the people we served. Our team secured hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal investments in our State’s economy and returned almost $5 million in earned benefits to New Mexico veterans, seniors, and taxpayers. Your dedication to New Mexico changed lives. Lastly, thank you to all the Members with whom I had the pleasure of serving who helped ensure that my time here was a success. Whether it was Congressman MEADOWS helping me launch an investigation into SNAP mismanagement in New Mexico, Congressman COLE for helping pass Care Corps grants to assist caregivers, or Congressman O’HALLERAN for working with me to pass the firstever economic development broadband grant program in the farm bill, I have worked with and learned from Members on every part of the political spectrum. And regardless of our differences, I have found a universal passion for solving problems and public service. Every Member here understands the privilege and responsibility of working in the most powerful institution in the world and the immeasurable potential of this body to address the problems that we were elected to solve. Our shared values and commitment to each other is always and has been this institution’s greatest strength. To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson: Let us never forget that the differences of opinion are not differences of the fundamental principles that unite us as Americans. We are all Democrats. We are all Republicans. I believe that we can embrace our differences of opinion in a shared effort to form a more perfect union while never allowing polarization, politics, and shortterm political expediency to undermine our obligation to make a difference in the lives of those who sent us here. Always remember that power is short lived, politics is cyclical, and one day someone else will fill our shoes. As Congressman CUMMINGS used to say when I served with him on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee: We only hold these positions of power, leadership, and trust for a short period of time. What better way to honor the great leaders who came before us and the people who entrusted us to serve in their footsteps than by seizing every opportunity we have to work together and to pass the reins of our Nation to future leaders better than we found it. To all the new Members: Stand tall, no matter how tall you are; be courageous; don’t take ‘‘no’’ for an answer; and never stop working to tear down the roadblocks that stand in the way of advocating for your constituents who count on you every day. And to the people of New Mexico, thank you for the honor of representing the First Congressional District, and thank you for entrusting me to revolutionize our education system, lead the Nation in clean energy development, and create an economy that prioritizes hardworking families as your next Governor. I look forward to continuing to work for you in your Roundhouse next year. Mr. Speaker, although I yield back for the final time, I have never been more hopeful about our future and the next generation of Members who will stand here, address this Chamber, and commit to the shared values that form the foundation of progress after I am gone. f 
VOTER SUPPRESSION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about a troubling development, which is called voter suppression, and its use as a tool in political combat today. President Trump wrote the playbook on sham claims of voter fraud, and now, sadly, my friends on the other side of the aisle are putting that playbook to use. During the 2016 Presidential election, then candidate Trump warned that the election would be rigged. Once in office, the President then made unsubstantiated assertions that there were more than 3 million illegal votes cast in the United States, just coincidentally the margin of popular advantage his opponent, Hillary Clinton, had over him. The President then established a so called election integrity commission that alleged substantial evidence of voter fraud, found none, and had to be disbanded. That purportedly independent commission was headed, by the way, by Kansas Secretary of State at the time Kris Kobach, a known proponent of voter fraud conspiracy theories that then justified voter suppression on a large scale. The President used his bully pulpit to claim that midterm ballots were massively infected and called for a halt to vote counts in legally mandated recounts in Georgia and Florida. Here is what is really going on. When an election is too close to call, rather than encourage the democratic process to play out by counting every vote, Republicans are flipping through Trump’s voter fraud playbook to sow distrust in democratic processes. 
In Florida, for example, Republican Governor Rick Scott, now Senator elect, undermined confidence in the State’s own recount process by making his own unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud and filed lawsuits against and called for investigations into certain Democraticleaning counties. In Georgia, Secretary of State Brian Kemp refused to step down from his role overseeing his own election to be Governor of the State. Under his management, more than a half a million people were purged from voting rolls in July of 2017. That election was decided by just tens of thousands of votes. It makes a difference. In North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District today, the State Elections Board is investigating whether a local GOP operative illegally collected absentee ballots and altered votes or never submitted them. It may yet lead to, frankly, the decertification of that election and a new special election to be called. In Wisconsin and Michigan, the GOP controlled, lame duck State legislatures have pushed through a series of measures that would strip the incoming Democratic Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State of key authorities and restrict access to early voting. We have seen this before. It is part of a pattern, unfortunately, of voter suppression: purging voter rolls; difficult voter I.D. restrictions; eliminating early voting; outdated and insufficient voting machines; and long lines, especially in minority precincts. In 2016, North Carolina closed early voting stations and, just coincidentally, reduced African American voting by 8.5 percent, clearly a dispositive difference. Republican governors like Governor Scott of Florida have exercised their discretion to restore felon voting rights in as restrictive a manner as possible. His predecessor, Governor CHARLIE CRIST, now our colleague, restored voting rights to 155,000 individuals in Florida in 4 years. Governor Scott averaged just 400 per year. In Wisconsin, a strict voter I.D. law has been credited with suppressing the vote of more than 200,000 Wisconsin voters who were otherwise eligible to cast a ballot in 2016. Could that have made a difference in the electoral vote of the State of Wisconsin? b1045 These tactics undermine democracy. They are not worthy of the party of Lincoln, and they further erode America’s trust in government. I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle: Let’s win fair or square. Let’s make sure every American’s vote is counted and is treated as sacred. America will be the stronger for it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President of the United States. f 
HONORING DONEGAL INDIANS FIELD HOCKEY TEAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and to honor the young women of the Donegal Indians field hockey team, who won the PIAA State championship this year, their second in 3 years. The Donegal Indians held an impressive 28–1 season record, with 235 points scored and only 19 points scored against them. They can be described in one word: dominating. They finally met their match in the State championship game, where they were scoreless through regulation. When the team needed to score, they turned to one player, Captain Mackenzie Allessie, who holds the national record for scoring in girls high school field hockey. Mackenzie racked up an impressive 351 goals during her tenure at Donegal. The last goal that Mackenzie scored lifted the Indians to their second championship. The team members’ drive is a trait that will serve them well in the future. I congratulate them, their coaches, and the community for their victory. I wish them all continued success. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the amazing accomplishments of Ms. Casey Kaufhold, a 14 yearold freshman at Conestoga Valley High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Casey is a winner and a world record holder. Last month, she competed with Olympicclass archers from around the world at the World Archery Indoor Series GT Open in Luxembourg. She earned 589 out of 600 possible points to win the gold medal for this event and set a world record for the highest score earned by an archer under the age of 17 during competition. We are all incredibly proud of Casey’s achievements, and we are looking forward to all that is in store for her in the future, which I believe will be as a future Olympian. And if she does so, she will represent our Nation well. We wish her continued success in all of her endeavors. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a man synonymous with railroading in Lancaster County: Mr. Linn Moedinger. After 51 years—51 years—working for the Strasburg Rail Road, Linn is retiring as president of the Strasburg Rail Road Company. Strasburg Rail Road was founded in 1832. It is the oldest continuously operating railroad in the Western Hemisphere. After 125 years of declining revenue, 24 individuals, including Linn’s parents, decided to buy the railroad. Today, it is a top tourist destination in the district that I represent. They brought new life to Strasburg Rail Road, turning it into a tourist railroad and helping educate and entertain thousands of visitors in our community each year. Linn took his first paying job at the Strasburg Rail Road when he was 17. He cleaned the restrooms. Year after year, his responsibilities increased and so did his love for the railroad. Linn was named president in 2000 and has overseen great expansion of the Strasburg Rail Road, and it is a historical marker in the State of Pennsylvania. Thank you to Linn for his many years of service, and I wish him all the best in his retirement. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving and gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We ask today that You bless the Members of the people’s House to be the best and most faithful servants of the people they serve. May they be filled with gratitude at the opportunity they have to serve in this place. We thank You for the abilities they have been given to do their work to contribute to the common good. As this second session of the 115th Congress draws near its end and legislative business once again weighs heavily on this Hill, withhold not Your spirit of wisdom and truth from this assembly. Give each Member clarity of thought and purity of motive so that they may render their service as their best selves. May all that is done this day in the people’s House be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I recently asked my constituents about their priorities, and we received more than 2,400 responses. Their top issues? Healthcare, gun safety, and the environment. It is worth noting that on each of these issues this Congress has not only not made progress, we have moved backwards. On healthcare, this Congress spent months fighting a failed fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and now the administration continues to cynically sabotage the law to weaken protections for preexisting conditions and increase premiums. On gun safety, this Congress sits idly by as senseless gun violence and mass shootings claim lives across the country. In fact, the only gun legislation we passed this year, concealed carry reciprocity, actually weakened our gun laws. On climate, this Congress has not only not listened to the science that tells us to reduce emissions, and instead the administration, President Trump, recklessly withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord. It is time Congress put the interests of the American people first. In the coming new Congress, we have a new opportunity for progress. Let’s listen and prioritize the issues that matter most to our constituents and our country: affordable healthcare, the safety of their children, and a sustainable planet. f 
ADK FORTYSIXERS CELEBRATE 100TH ANNIVERSARY (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the Adirondack Forty Sixers, an organization in my district whose 10,000plus members have climbed all 46 peaks of the Adirondack Mountains. Since their founding by brothers Bob and George Marshall, the FortySixers have been central to promoting environmental stewardship, protecting our natural resources, and encouraging younger generations to enjoy the great outdoors. The Adirondacks are an essential component of our tourism economy. The FortySixers have done important work giving back to the mountains they love and making the peaks more accessible. They have also prioritized community outreach and volunteerism. Their allvolunteer trail maintenance program is critical to keeping trails available to hikers from across the world and, in turn, protecting our environment. For the past century, young hikers have been mentored and trained by this dedicated group of environmental stewards, and I know that over the next 100 years, many more will be inspired to experience the Adirondack Mountains. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Adirondack Forty Sixers on this incredible milestone. 
MEANINGFUL GUN SAFETY LAWS NOW (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, this Friday marks the sixth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. On December 14, 2012, from 9:30 to 9:40 a.m., a lone gunman armed with an assault weapon killed 27 people, including 20 kids between the ages of 6 and 7 years old. Five minutes, one shooter, 27 people dead. Many of the kids had several bullet wounds in their bodies when they were recovered. In the years since that tragedy, we have seen highpowered assault weapon attacks on schools, synagogues, nightclubs, churches, concerts, and in our neighborhoods. With each horrific attack, Congress responds with a moment of silence. We have had 50 moments of silence since Sandy Hook. Silence is not a response. We need rational voices, congressional hearings, and meaningful gun safety laws now. f 
TRIBUTE FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, an extraordinary tribute for President George H.W. Bush was published by Krishnadev Calamur in The Atlantic: ‘‘Had George Herbert Walker Bush never become the 41st President of the United States, he would still be remembered as one of the great Americans of the 20th century. . . . ‘‘But it was his oneterm presidency, from 1989 to 1993, that had a monumental impact on the world. Ronald Reagan, his predecessor, uttered the famous words: ‘Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,’ yet it was Bush who presided over its orderly dismantling. ‘‘Bush oversaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War, the birth of the postSoviet republics, and the West’s outreach to former members of the Warsaw Pact.’’ In my service in Congress, I have seen firsthand the expansion of freedom and democracy. Today the largest number of nations in world history are free and democratic, from Bulgaria to Lithuania, inspired by President George H.W. Bush. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
OPEN ENROLLMENT (Ms. WILD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, with only 4 days until open enrollment closes for next year, I want to call on people in my community, across Pennsylvania, and in every part of our country to sign up for coverage on healthcare.gov. Because Pennsylvania chose to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, lowincome individuals and 
families in every corner of our district and State can obtain coverage, and nearly 700,000 Pennsylvanians are now covered. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Americans of every background can choose from a range of plans to find one that works for them and their family free from discrimination over gender, sexual orientation, race, or preexisting conditions. However, there is still work to be done. Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. While the Affordable Care Act has brought us closer to universal coverage, we must build on this progress. In the coming months I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to make clear that we need to move away from our profitdriven healthcare system toward a society where affordable, high quality care is the birthright of every single child, woman, and man in this country. 
CONGRATULATING THE M CCOMB HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM (Mr. LATTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the McComb High School football team for winning the Ohio State Division VII Championship. The Panthers won their second title in school history with a 28–3 victory over Glouster Trimble. McComb showed great fortitude in reeling off eight straight wins on their way to the title. Including freshmen, the Panthers dressed 27 players, about half the number of most of their opponents. The Panthers’ success can be tied to their stout defense which didn’t surrender a single touchdown in the championship game. These student athletes gave it their all and had the backing of the entire school district. They exemplified the best of Ohio smalltown football. I know what the title means to McComb, as my dad played for McComb in the late 1930s. It is great to see the fans rally around these players. Once again, congratulations to Coach Kris Alge and the rest of the McComb High School football team on a job well done. 
RECOGNIZING SPECIAL OLYMPICS HAWAII (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, today I am rising to recognize Special Olympics Hawaii celebrating 50 years of service to our community. Since its founding in 1968, Special Olympics has changed lives and served as an indispensable source of strength and empowerment for so many people. Across our State today, it is serving 4,700 participants with the support of nearly 12,000 coaches and volunteers delivering 10 Olympictype sports and more than 50 competitions throughout the year. They have taken on issues like inactivity, injustice, intolerance, and social isolation by encouraging and empowering people with intellectual disabilities. They have had an impact on our entire community and our State. They are combating negative stereotypes, bringing joy and a sense of achievement and creating a culture of respect and inclusion. Mahalo to Special Olympics Hawaii and congratulations on reaching this 50th anniversary year. f 
A TRIBUTE TO SCOTTY BYRNE (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of longtime Brewton, Alabama, resident and my cousin, G.S. ‘‘Scotty’’ Byrne Jr., who passed away on November 18 at the age of 92. Scotty was a veteran of World War II having served in the 351st Infantry Division under General Mark Clark and later went on to serve as sheriff of Escambia County for 24 years. In college at the University of Southern Mississippi, Scotty was a premier twosport athlete excelling in both baseball and golf. He was the first athlete to be inducted into the USM Sports Hall of Fame for two sports. Throughout his life, he was one of the most able golfers in our part of the State. During his tenure as sheriff, he was a vocal supporter of the Alabama Sheriff’s Boys Ranch, providing resources for children in need throughout our State. Without a doubt, Scotty was one of the most memorable citizens in Escambia County’s long history. So on behalf of Alabama’s First Congressional District, I want to share our condolences with Scotty’s family. He will be sorely missed. 
2018 FARM BILL (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, after months of negotiation and conference, I am proud to come to the floor today to say the 2018 farm bill is now a strong, bipartisan bill which works for families, farmers, and communities. The bill now avoids disastrous cuts to SNAP, a program which helps put food on the table for 44,000 people in Mecklenburg County alone. It also provides $10 million in funding for urban agriculture research and mandatory funding for programs that support local food systems. As cofounder and cochair of the bipartisan HBCU Caucus, I am particularly proud to have helped secure key resources for 1890 landgrant universities in the bill. It authorizes $50 million to create three centers of excellence at 1890s and ensures equity between landgrants by removing provisions that strip away unspent extension funds for 1890s, and it mandates a report that outlines research and extension funds for all landgrant schools. I thank my colleagues on the conference committee, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill when it comes to the floor. f 
b1215 HONORING THE LIFE OF JACK MACKENZIE (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life of Quincy University soccer coach Jack Mackenzie of Quincy, Illinois. Hired in 1969, Jack built Quincy University into a college soccer dynasty, guiding his program at all levels of college soccer, from the NAIA division through the NCAA’s division II status, and even excelling at the NCAA’s division I level. For 43 years, Jack was at the helm of the Quincy soccer program. He was a pioneer and a legend, leading the team to nine national championships between 1970 and 1982, and amassing 516 victories, putting him 10th on the all time wins list across all NCAA division levels. Upon retirement in 2012, Jack remained involved in the Quincy University community and could still be found in the stands at every home game the Hawks played. As the Quincy University community continues to mourn the loss of Coach Jack Mackenzie, may we never forget the positive impact he had on so many lives, the sport of soccer, and his tireless spirit in pursuit of excellence. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING THE LIFE OF DON KRZYSIAK (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life of Don Krzysiak. Don and his family are longtime members of the Bay City community. Sadly, he passed away on Friday, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He is survived by his wife, Lois, and their children, Tom, Donnie, and Melanie. Don founded Krzysiak’s House Restaurant in 1979, with just a handful of employees, and grew it into the successful Bay City business that it is today. In fact, the very first event after I announced I was running for Congress was at Krzysiak’s. He welcomed me with open arms and made me feel welcome in the neighborhood. I remember always buying paczkis from Don on Fat Tuesday. Every year, 
all the money he made from those sales was donated to the Salvation Army. Don was not just a smallbusiness owner, but also an important part of our community. He helped people struggling to find employment and supported people coming out of jail trying to start a new life. Everyone who knew him at the family restaurant described him as more than a boss, but everybody’s friend. He loved to spend time with his family and in his neighborhood, and he loved to listen to polka music. Before opening the restaurant, he served in the U.S. Army. His commitment to our country will always be remembered. MidMichigan lost a great friend and a bright spirit this week. The entire State of Michigan, the Bay City community, and I, personally, will miss him. Thank you, Don, for everything you have done. Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House join me in a brief moment of silence in Don’s memory. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of S. 943, the JohnsonO’Malley Supplemental Indian Education Program Modernization Act. The abysmal conditions and status of education attainment and achievement of American Indian children and students continues. This educational gap for American Indian students continues to lag behind all other students in this country. This bill would require the Department of the Interior to annually update the count of American Indian and Alaska Native students so the Department can more accurately distribute JohnsonO’Malley funds which supplement Indian education. The bill would also require grantees to report how funds are being used, helping to ensure Federal dollars support Native students’ education. The Federal Government has a responsibility to provide parity in resources to Native education. Currently, the Department is prevented from updating the count because of an effort, from over 20 years ago, to cut spending through the use of block grants. Congress, at the time, determined one way to reduce funding for Indian education was to freeze efforts to count the number of Native students. As a result, the Department of the Interior continues to use the 1994 number of 272,000 Native students, even though it is estimated, based on Census reports, that there are now more than 750,000 Native students. This policy is just another in a long list of the secondclass treatment of American Indians by our government. I want to thank my colleague, BETTY  MCCOLLUM , for introducing this version of the legislation and my Republican colleagues, TOMCOLEand D ONYOUNG , for providing bipartisan support. My hope is that the passage of this bill is a first step, however small it may be, to righting a wrong to American Indian students. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 943, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, the last official count of eligible students was conducted in 1995, which determined that there were nearly 272,000 American Indian students who were qualified for the JohnsonO’Malley Program. However, in 2017, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that there were an additional 80,000 students who would qualify. Clearly, this bill is needed and overdue. Currently, the program receives $14.9 million, annually, in funding. Modernization of this act will cost an estimated $13 million over the next 4 years. This is an important investment in the future of our country, and those students deserve our support. This legislation improves and strengthens the JohnsonO’Malley Program, and I urge my colleagues to support S. 943. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 943, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ADVANCED NUCLEAR FUEL AVAILABILITY ACT Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6140) to require the Secretary of Energy to establish and carry out a program to support the availability of HALEU for domestic commercial use, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6140 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLORES ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLORES ). 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, nuclear power is a clean and efficient source of zeroemissions energy. Today, it generates approximately 20 percent of our country’s ‘‘alwayson, baseload’’ electricity for our homes and businesses. Most nuclear reactors currently in use are very similar in nature and operate on a fuel that is generally enriched below 5 percent. The next generation of advanced reactors under development, however, vary in size and operation, and they will require flexibility and efficiencies from an advanced fuel. This fuel, known as high assay, lowenriched uranium, or HA– LEU, is enriched at higher levels than what is available in the current commercial market. The bipartisan Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act, which I introduced with my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ), establishes a publicprivate partnership through the Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy to support the availability of HA–LEU for domestic commercial use. b1230 A March 2017 survey of 18 advanced reactor developers based in the United States found that the lack of availability of advanced fuels is the foremost factor that would impede the development and deployment of advanced reactor technologies. Simply put, this bill would ensure that there is a supply of advanced fuel available for domestic commercial industry purchase for the advanced reactors of tomorrow. Global energy demand will continue to increase, and emissionsfree nuclear power is the ultimate source to meet those needs for the next generation of electricity. It is important to pass this bill to give American innovators a competitive edge in designing and deploying the reactors of tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. MCNERNEY for working with me on this issue, as well as committee leadership and staff for their assistance in bringing this legislation forward. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6140. This bill is an effort to accelerate the availability of highassay lowenriched uranium, the fuel needed for most advanced nuclear designs. There is no existing commercial market for this fuel, so in order to ensure that the fuel is available for advanced reactors once they are licensed and ready to begin producing electricity, the Federal Government will need to coordinate efforts among agencies, and with the commercial nuclear sector, to ensure that highassay lowenriched uranium can be licensed and safely transported. You wouldn’t buy a lawnmower if you couldn’t buy gas to run it. Similarly, we need to develop a domestic market for fuel needed to power these advanced nuclear reactor projects that are coming onto the market in the next decade. I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, both Representative FLORES and Representative MCNERNEY , for developing this thoughtful proposal. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time until my other colleagues arrive. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ), one of the cosponsors of the bill. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. GREEN . I have had the pleasure of serving with Mr. GREEN for about 12 years now, and he has been an incredible colleague. One thing I can say about Mr. GREEN : He is good for his word. When he says he is going to provide something and produce something, he does. So I appreciate the gentleman’s friendship and collegiality. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 6140, the Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act. Every day, we are seeing the devastating effects of climate change, like the deadly wildfires we just had in California; severe flooding around the world; and our Nation’s persistent asthma rates, which continue to threaten public health. The Federal Government has the responsibility to address climate change by investing in proactive measures to combat this prevailing threat. We need a diverse—and I repeat, diverse—energy mix, including nuclear power, which already generates 60 percent of our Nation’s zeroemissions electricity. H.R. 6140 is the future of nuclear technology. It creates a pathway for tomorrow’s nuclear reactors so that we will be able to confront the realities of climate change. This bill directs the Department of Energy to conduct studies, authorizes the Department of Energy to acquire materials, and requires the DOE to develop a schedule to recover these costs. The availability of highassay low enriched uranium is critical to these efforts. Federal investments and protocols regarding the transportation, fuel fabrication, and enrichment to effectively bring this fuel to market are encouraging. This bill updates the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s policies and addresses the development of a robust regulatory regime, the options for requiring this type of uranium, and the preparation of the infrastructure required for this fuel. As we look to the future, small modular reactors, or SMRs, as they are referred to, will be useful in a variety of settings, from microgrids to rural areas. And this type of fuel needs to be available by the time SMRs come to the market. 
The consortium that is formed here is the type of partnership that will be useful in kickstarting this technology and then turning it over to let industry take the reins. I thank my partners on this bill—Mr. FLORES , Mr. U PTON , Mr. W ALDEN , and Mr. Pallone—for their leadership on this issue, and I thank our staffs for their work on this critical legislation. Mr. Speaker, finally, I thank my friend and colleague Mr. GREEN , again, who is retiring this year. He has been a champion for bipartisanship and compromise, and an advocate for sound policy in this Chamber. He will be missed. I will also miss the Speaker who is sitting in the Chair right now. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6140. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, it is simple. H.R. 6140 will set the stage for powering electricity in the future in a green manner by allowing for the development of those newgeneration reactors, but we have to have the fuel to do it. This bill, by working with my good friend Mr. MCNERNEY from California, does that. This bill passed the subcommittee in the Committee on Energy and Commerce by a unanimous voice vote. It also passed the full committee by a voice vote. It is a bipartisan solution to address a real need to generate electricity, alwayson, baseload electricity, in a zeroemissions manner. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6140, the ‘‘Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act,’’ is a bipartisan bill sponsored by my Energy and Commerce colleagues, BILLFLORES of Texas, along with JERRY MCNERNEY of California. We considered this bill through regular order in Committee and the Full Committee reported the bill favorably, as amended, by a voice vote. Imagine designing a new car that is safer, less expensive, and gets triple the mileage than anything we see on the road today. But when the vehicle is ready to hit the road, there is no gas to fill up the tank. Nuclear innovators face a similar—and very critical—challenge as they work to bring several promising advanced nuclear technologies to the market. These new designs require fuels that have different attributes than what is used in today’s fleet of nuclear reactors, but the fuels are not commercially available. H.R. 6140 addresses this challenge by ensuring nuclear innovators will have the advanced fuels needed to develop and demonstrate their products commercially. The bill provides a direct path to align advanced nuclear fuel supply with initial demand for the deployment of next generation nuclear technologies. It provides for the development of the technical information necessary to assist the creation of the regulatory and licensing framework for these fuels. The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a temporary program, operating to support a publicprivate partnership, that will make what is known as highassay lowenriched uranium available for use in the firstof akind advanced nuclear reactor designs. It provides for the surveys and information necessary to inform the new market development and cost recovery for initial federal investments. In short, the Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act takes practical, targeted steps to ensure the infrastructure will be in place in time to enable the development and deployment of a new generation of nuclear technologies in the United States. This is an important bill for ensuring the nation’s international leadership on nuclear technology, for ensuring our energy security, and achieving our clean energy goals. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6140. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLORES) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6140, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
IMPROVING MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES ACT Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7217) to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide States with the option of providing coordinated care for children with complex medical conditions through a health home, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7217 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Medicaid Programs and Opportunities for Eligible Beneficiaries Act’’ or the ‘‘IMPROVE Act’’. TITLE I—ACE KIDS 
Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 1945 the following new section: 
Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we are here today, the culmination of a 6year journey. The IMPROVE Act is a combination of three bills. One bill is a bill that allows Medicare to follow the patient; another bill is a bill for spousal impoverishment, to prevent that; and the third bill, and the primary bill in this package, is a bill that we call the ACE Kids Act. Mr. Speaker, there are, luckily, not a large number, about 2 million children in this country, who have multiple complex medical conditions that are lifethreatening. These are the sickest of the sick of our young population. About 500,000 of these children are Medicaid eligible. In other words, their families qualify for lowincome health insurance called Medicaid. Mr. Speaker, under current law, the parents of these children have to create the healthcare network on a caseby case basis for their child. They also cannot seek healthcare across State lines that is covered by Medicaid. So current law makes it very difficult on these sickestofthesick children. The ACE Kids Act changes that, Mr. Speaker. It allows the creation of a medical home that can cross State lines, that can coordinate care. It is optional. The States do not have to participate in this program. The parents of the child do not have to participate in this program. But if they do wish to participate, you create a health home for the child wherein everything is coordinated. In the pilot programs that have been run using this model, you get better quality healthcare at lower cost. We think the pilot programs show that, over time, if we adopt this model and if the States adopt it and the families adopt it, we get a lot better healthcare at a lower cost. So this is a winwin, Mr. Speaker. As I said, we have worked on this for 6 years. It is a bipartisan bill. In the last Congress, we had a majority of the Congress that sponsored the bill. In this Congress, we have more than 130 cosponsors on a bipartisan basis. We have had a hearing in the committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Energy and Commerce. We have had a markup in subcommittee. We have had a markup in full committee. Now, Mr. Speaker, we are bringing it to the floor. We hope the House, later today, will vote affirmatively to pass this on suspension and send it to the Senate. We have preconferenced it with the Senate, and we have every reason to believe, if the House passes it today, the Senate will take it up expeditiously and pass it, and this is a bill that will become law. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7217, the IMPROVE Act. This legislation contains several important policies related to Medicaid and Medicare. First, I am a proud original cosponsor of the ACE Kids Act, and I am happy to see it included in H.R. 7217. The ACE Kids Act aims to improve care coordination for children with complex medical conditions served by Medicaid. The legislation creates a Medicaid health home, State optional, specifically targeted for this population of children. It also requires the Secretary to issue best practices on coordinating outofState care for children with complex medical conditions. Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors of the ACE Kids Act, Representative CASTOR and Congressman B ARTON , both members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, for championing this issue for so many years. The IMPROVE Act also provides new funding for the Money Follows the Person, the MFP, program. The MFP program helps individuals transition from institutional care to care in their community, where they can live more independent lives. MFP also helps support States’ home and communitybased services infrastructure. Without this extension funding, we would start to see many of these MFP programs end in short order. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the program, which provides thousands of Americans with the choice to receive services in their home or community rather than in an institution. b1245 The committee will continue to work on providing longterm funding to the MFP program in the next Congress. I also voice my support for the extension of spousal impoverishment protections until April 2019. These protections will help ensure that a person can maintain enough income and assets to meet their basic living expenses while still allowing for their spouse to receive longterm care in their home or community under Medicaid. The expiration of this policy would lead to people losing their longterm care services and the unnecessary institutionalization of people currently 
receiving services in their homes or communities. The committee will continue to work on a longterm solution in the next Congress. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 7217, the IMPROVE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), who is the current chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. BARTON for his great leadership on the ACE Kids Act. I know this has been something he has been dedicated to for many years, and I am glad we could get this worked out and to the floor today. In fact, Mr. Speaker, these bills add to the 129 that the Energy and Commerce Committee has passed across this House floor. Mr. Speaker, 92 percent of those bills have been bipartisan. I don’t think the American people know that, because when we get along and do things, it doesn’t get much coverage. But most of our work, 92 percent of our bills have been bipartisan, plus these today. 28 of those measures have become law. I rise in strong support of this bipartisan H.R. 7217, which includes a number of different policies to improve and bolster the Medicaid and Medicare programs for vulnerable patients across our country, Mr. Speaker. I recognize JOEBARTON and our colleague, KATHY CASTOR from Florida, who I know is going to speak in a moment. They have just worked relentlessly on the ACE Kids Act. This is an important bill, and it is included in this package and one I am proud the House will advance forward today. They both should be commended for their work because, you see, Mr. Speaker, the ACE Kids Act is bipartisan. It is costeffective legislation. It provides children and their families the treatment and coordinated care they so desperately need and deserve. Representative BARTON , former chairman of the committee, has long been a champion on this issue, and, again, I thank him for his tireless efforts to advocate for improving care for our Nation’s sickest children. This bill also extends two key Medicaid programs: the Money Follows the Person Demonstration Program and the spousal impoverishment rules in Medicaid, both of which were due to expire or be out of money by the end of the year. I am disappointed we weren’t able to secure a longer term extension of these programs. I know many of my colleagues share that disappointment. Both sides negotiated in good faith, though, on how to pay for an extension, and I hope that the bipartisan work on the longterm bill will continue early in the new Congress. Today, we are moving forward with a 3month extension to prevent these programs from expiring. Finally, this package includes a small but critically important Medicare fix to ensure disabled seniors have access to necessary mobility devices, and that is fully offset and paid for. Further boosting our efforts to advance public health, we have four other bills before us today. Collectively, these bills reauthorize several important programs, promote safe motherhood, and improve patient care. Lastly, we will consider H.R. 6140. That is the Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act. This bill, as you already know, Mr. Speaker, directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to make highassay, lowenriched uranium available for use in the first ofakind advanced nuclear reactor designs. This fuel will enable the development and deployment of a new generation of innovative nuclear technologies. Nuclear energy is the largest source of emissionsfree electricity in the United States, so a strong U.S. nuclear energy policy can ensure a reliable, clean U.S. energy sector for years to come and provide American families and businesses with affordable energy. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member PALLONE , Mr. G REEN , and the other members of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I urge my colleagues to support passage of all of these bills, especially H.R. 7217, on behalf of patients in Oregon and all across our country. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ), a cosponsor of the ACE Kids Act and a great member of our Energy and Commerce Committee. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman GREEN for being an outspoken advocate for his constituents, but especially for affordable healthcare for all Americans, especially children. It has been a privilege serving with him. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the families with children with complex medical needs all across America, I rise to urge approval of the IMPROVE Act, which includes a bill that I have been working on for a number of years with Representative JOEBARTON called the ACE Kids Act. We drafted the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act a few years ago with the simple but important goal of putting families and children first. The bill authorizes the creation of costsaving and timesaving health homes where specialized care is coordinated in a highquality setting. Mr. Speaker, the children with complex medical conditions and their families are heroic. Caroline West in Tampa, Florida, has a rare genetic condition, also cerebral palsy and a seizure disorder. She can’t walk. It is very difficult for her to speak, but she is able to attend school parttime and enjoys the life of a typical teenager, in many respects. Lucy Ferlita is the only living person in the United States with early onset myopathy with areflexia, respiratory distress, and dysphagia. Very little is known about this disease, but what we know is that it is very difficult for her to eat. She has to have a feeding tube, a ventilator to breath, and nursing care 24 hours a day, and yet she is a bright and social 6yearold. Jaden Velasquez has a congenital heart defect. He was born with it. The left side of his heart is severely underdeveloped. He has undergone numerous surgeries, yet he is a loving and happy 10yearold, loves swimming, and is enjoying life. Lakota Lockhart, with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, a central nervous system disorder, causes him to not be able to breathe every time he tries to sleep. I met these children in Tampa, Florida, at St. Joseph’s Children’s Hospital. They have the worldrenowned ChronicComplex Clinic that was started 16 years ago by a passionate pediatric doctor named Dr. Daniel Plasencia. The ACE Kids Act is modeled after the work being done at St. Joe’s by the professionals at the ChronicComplex Clinic and the 700 kids and families they currently serve and other children’s hospitals all across the country. The families have shared with us how difficult it is to get quality healthcare. It is oftentimes so fragmented and uncoordinated that they have to go from one office to another, and maybe the specialist is in another State. That is why we put together the ACE Kids Act, to help coordinate care in a single setting to help give these kids a better quality of life, and the ACE Kids Act will do just that. The bill provides an incentive to States to establish health homes to better coordinate care for kids with medical complexities. It also directs HHS to provide guidance to States on best practices relating to providing care across State lines. As so many of these families know all too well, coordinating care across State lines can be burdensome, so that is the aim of the ACE Kids Act: to lift that burden. In addition to Congressman JOEBARTON, who has worked diligently for so many years to get this over the finish line, I thank all of the families with children with complex medical challenges. They deserve credit for moving this bill forward, coming to Congress, and helping to explain the importance of coordinating care. I also thank Chairman WALDEN , Ranking Member PALLONE , Chairman BURGESS , and Ranking Member G REEN  for their support, and our stalwart partners: Representatives HERRERA  BEUTLER , ESHOO , and R EICHERT . Thank you to America’s children’s hospitals, the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and thanks to the professional staff at the committee for your dedication to these families, especially Rachel Pryor, Samantha Satchell, Tiffany Guarascio, and Josh Trent and Caleb Graff on the Republican side. 
Additionally, this bill would not be where it is without the stellar work of Representative BARTON ’s staffers: Krista Rosenthall, Gable Brady, Sophie Trainor, and Jeannine Bender, and my LD, Elizabeth Brown. Passage of this bill will be a gift to so many families during this holiday season and beyond, so I urge my colleagues here in the House and then over in the Senate to pass the ACE Kids Act contained within the IMPROVE Act. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to Dr. BURGESS , I echo what Congresswoman CASTOR just said about the staffs that have worked so hard. We couldn’t have done this bill without all the individuals she just named. I also thank her. When she said I have been tireless, she makes me look like a snail, and she is the rabbit working every day to make this possible. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), the distinguished subcommittee chairman of the Health Subcommittee, my good friend. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7217. This is a bipartisan Medicaid package that moves forward House priorities with responsible offsets. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been working to draft and perfect the legislation before us, and it is encouraging to see this reach the House floor. Not only does this package include a new program to improve access to care, it reauthorizes important and effective programs from which Americans benefit each and every day. Title I of this package is based upon Representative JOEBARTON and Representative K ATHY  CASTOR ’s ACE Kids Act. But I do want to assure families that have children with chronic illnesses that this legislation is intended to help them, if they want help, to obtain care coordination services. However, I also want to clarify that this legislation is not intended to limit families or their physicians from selecting their provider of medical services. There is nothing in this legislation that restricts the child’s family and their physician from deciding who is the best provider amongst those accepting Medicaid and qualified to offer the medical services. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has provided assurances that current freedomofchoice rules will apply to new care coordination activity. As a doctor, I know that many children with chronic illnesses have a strong relationship with their doctors and with other members of their healthcare team. I want to make certain that this new law will help families coordinate their care without affecting the relationship that families have with their current medical care providers or with other providers in their communities from whom they may wish to receive their care. This package also extends funding for the Money Follows the Person Demonstration, an effort that was led by my Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health Vice Chair BRETT  GUTHRIE and Representative D EBBIE  DINGELL from Michigan. This Medicaid demonstration was established in 2005 for individuals in States across our Nation, including Texas, to receive longterm care services in their homes or other community settings rather than institutions such as nursing homes. The funding for this program has already expired, and a funding extension is already overdue. While it would have been nice to extend this for longer, it was essential to get this extension across the floor. A 3month extension for the protection for Medicaid recipients of home and communitybased services against spousal impoverishment was also included. This effort was championed by Representatives FRED UPTON and DEBBIE DINGELL . The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, in an effort to be fiscally responsible, this legislation includes several offsets to make this package, on net, a saver. While it is largely a Medicaid package, there is one small but important Medicare provision. This provision excludes complex medical rehabilitative wheelchairs from Medicare’s Competitive Acquisition Program. Currently, these chairs are not included, but because the statute did not provide the same clear exemption that power wheelchairs received, there is fear that this unintended omission can lead to them being included. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the additional time, and I include my full statement in the RECORD . Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7217, a bipartisan Medicaid package that propels forward House priorities with responsible offsets. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been working diligently to draft and perfect the legislation before us, and it is encouraging to see this package reach the House floor. Not only does this package include an exciting new program to improve access to care, it reauthorizes important and effective programs from which Americans benefit each and every day. Title I of this package is based upon Rep. JOEBARTON and Rep. C ATHY CASTOR ’s ACE Kids Act. I want to ensure families who have children with chronic illnesses that this legislation is intended to help them, if they want help, to obtain care coordination services. However, I want to clarify that this legislation is not intended to limit families and their physicians from selecting the provider of medical services. There is nothing in this legislation that restricts the child’s family, and their physician, from deciding who is the best provider among those accepting Medicaid and qualified to offer the medical services. CMS has provided assurances that current ‘‘freedom of choice’’ rules will apply to new care coordination activity. As a physician, I know that many children with chronic illnesses have a strong relationship with their physician and with other providers. I want to make sure that this new law will help families coordinate their care without affecting the relationship that families have with their current medical care providers or with other providers in their communities from whom they may want to receive such care from.’’ This package also extends funding for the Money Follows the Person demonstration, an effort led by my E&C Subcommittee on Health Vice Chair, BRETT GUTHRIE , and Rep. D EBBIE  DINGELL . This Medicaid demonstration, which was established in 2005, has enabled eligible individuals in states across our nation, including Texas, to receive longterm care services in their homes or other community settings, rather than in institutions such as nursing homes. The funding for this program has already expired, and a funding extension is already long overdue. While we would have like to extend the funding for longer, it was essential that we get an extension across the floor, even if a small one. A 3month extension for the Protection for Medicaid Recipients of Home and Community Based Services Against Spousal Impoverishment program is also included. This effort was championed by Representatives FRED UPTON  and DEBBIE DINGELL . Our seniors are among our most vulnerable citizens, and it is programs like this one that help to protect them from financial ruin. In an effort to be fiscally responsible, this legislation includes several offsets that make this package on net a saver, which is something that Energy & Commerce insists upon and is critically important. While this is largely a Medicaid Package, there is one small but important Medicare provision. This provision excludes manual Complex Rehabilitative wheelchairs from Medicare’s Competitive Acquisition Program. Currently, these chairs are not included but because statute did not provide the same clear exemption that power wheelchairs received, there is fear this unintended omission could lead them to being included. This provision also delays the application of competitive bid pricing with CRT accessories used with a CRT manual chair for 18 months. This mirrors a similar protection last provided by Congress for power wheelchairs in the 21st Century Cures Act. This package contains mustpass provisions that the Energy and Commerce Committee have long fought to pass. The provisions included in this legislation will improve access to care for Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, which is a laudable and important goal. Not only are these provisions imperative, but they are responsibly offset. I would particularly like to thank Energy and Commerce Committee staffer Caleb Graff, who has spent countless hours negotiating to get this package to the floor. I support this legislation, and I urge my fellow members and our friends in the Senate to do so as well. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ), another member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. b1300 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Ranking Member GENE GREEN , for yielding me the time. 
I rise in support of H.R. 7217, the IMPROVE Act, and I thank Chairman WALDEN , Ranking Member P ALLONE , and Representatives UPTON and G UTHRIEfor their leadership in negotiating this important bill and for bringing it to the floor today. I also thank and acknowledge my dear friend JOEBARTON for all of his leadership on the ACE Kids Act and congratulate him on his retirement. JOEhas been a great friend to John and me over the years, and he will be dearly missed in the next Congress. Getting the IMPROVE Act signed into the law by the end of the year will be a fitting tribute to his decades of service in the Congress. Ranking Member GREEN has also been critical to so many measures. Texas has had two valuable public servants. Improving longterm care has been one of my top priorities since coming to Congress, and our system is completely broken. We need a broader overhaul of longterm care financing, and we also need to build off existing programs to make sure we are doing everything we can to ensure that we are enhancing the opportunities for independent living and supporting aging with dignity. I am proud to have authored two important provisions in the IMPROVE Act that extend critical programs that are about to expire. The first is a 3month extension of the Money Follows the Person program. This very successful program provides grants to States to cover transitional services for individuals who voluntarily wish to leave a nursing home or other institution and transition to a community care setting. Money Follows the Person is a win for both beneficiaries and taxpayers, because the program has demonstrated significant savings over the years while bringing a real benefit to people’s lives. I am also pleased that legislation I authored with the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ), my good friend, the Protecting Married Seniors from Impoverishment Act, is also included in this bill. Extending spousal impoverishment protections for seniors in Medicaid is just common sense. Nobody should be forced to spend down all of their resources and have to go bankrupt just to get the care they need. But these are only partial victories. Both programs are extended for 3 months. This is enough to keep these important programs alive for now, but all of us have a lot of work to do when we come back in the new year. Let me be clear: I will continue to fight for longterm extensions of both programs in the next Congress, and I am confident that we can get that done with the Democratic majority. These programs clearly have bipartisan support, and they do so much good for so many people. Once again, congratulations to my two dear friends from Texas for their leadership. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for her kind words. I appreciate the nice gift I got yesterday from her and her husband, his new book, ‘‘The Dean.’’ I look forward to reading it over Christmas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ). Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, the EMPOWER Care Act, which is included in H.R. 7217. It will ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries can receive the best long term care possible in their communities or in their own homes. The EMPOWER Care Act will extend the Medicaid Money Follows the Person program, which allows certain Medicaid beneficiaries, such as the elderly or individuals with disabilities, to transition from a healthcare facility to receiving care in their own homes. It does not force patients to leave a facility if they don’t want to. My home State of Kentucky is currently working to transition 50 individuals from healthcare facilities back into their own communities, empowering these individuals who have chosen to receive care in their community. I thank my friend, Congresswoman DEBBIE DINGELL , for working with me on this bipartisan bill. I look forward to working with her to make the Money Follows the Person program permanent in the future. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ), another good member of our Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I extend my congratulations as well to Mr. BARTON. It has been a pleasure working with you, sir. Thank you. Also, to Mr. GREEN , thank you very much for all your service. What an incredible career both of you have had. My colleagues have talked about the underlying bill, and I am in agreement with what everyone has said. I wanted to focus attention on an aspect of the bill that was sponsored by my colleague KURTSCHRADER and me, and that is a provision that addresses abusive practices of drug manufacturers who intentionally misrepresent their brand drugs as a generic in order to avoid providing a larger discount to the Medicaid program. My colleagues, whatever our position on the best way to deliver healthcare, one thing we know is the case: It is too expensive. Whether it is taxpayers footing the bill, consumers, or employersponsored healthcare plans, it is too expensive. And one of the reasons is ripoff pharma practices. This is a situation where, oftentimes, brandname drugs try to keep generics off the market. But this is a case where a brand name tried to pretend they were a generic in order to get a lower price. I will give an example. In 2016, Mylan misclassified the EpiPen as a generic drug instead of a brand drug, and that allowed them to charge Medicaid a higher price for the drug. Mylan ended up paying $465 million in a settlement to Health and Human Services, but the estimated malfeasance cost Medicaid— which is to say, taxpayers—more than $1 billion. Simultaneously, Mylan was raising its list price on EpiPen, which parents have to have for their kids who have an allergic reaction, from $103 to $608 over 7 years, a 500 percent increase. Mylan is not alone. This practice of unrelenting drug price hikes is tried and true for manufacturers. So I am very pleased that we have included in this bill an end to this abusive practice. We have to make healthcare affordable. Representative SCHRADER and I, with this provision, are taking a small step. With the help of our Congress and the passage of this very good bill, we will be taking one more step in dealing with the cost crisis in our healthcare system. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ), the former full committee chairman and the current subcommittee chairman of the Energy Subcommittee. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of this legislation today. I thank my colleague DEBBIE DINGELL . The two of us helped cosponsor the spousal impoverishment bill, which is part of this bill. There was no objection to that, and I am delighted that we are getting it done. But I want to particularly take this time and just thank JOEBARTON for his leadership on the ACE Kids Act. All of us come here to this House for particular causes that really grab our interest and attention. JOEBARTON has been so good—some would say like a dog to a Frisbee—in getting the ACE Kids Act to the House floor. This bill is going to save lives. It was bipartisan. Frankly, I wanted to move it as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, but we didn’t have a CBO score. We couldn’t get it done. We had plenty of meetings over the last couple of years on this, and here it is. We are going to get it done. Hopefully, the Senate is going to get it done, and we are going to get it to the President’s desk. This is probably the last time that JOEBARTON is actually managing a bill on the House floor, and it is appropriate that this is his bill, that it is his engine that is moving this train that really is going to make a difference for families across the country. So I say thank you, JOEBARTON . Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER ), a colleague from our committee. Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7217, the IMPROVE Act. I appreciate all the work that has been done on this bill over the years. 
From improving care for kids with complex medical conditions to strengthening communitybased, long term care services for the disabled community, there is a lot to support in this bill. I want to highlight one portion of the bill that my colleague and good friend PETER WELCH alluded to a few moments ago. A few years ago, families were shocked when the drug company Mylan raised the price on EpiPen, a common generic drug used to treat allergies in emergency situations, by more than 400 percent. While patients were facing this sticker shock for a drug necessary to keep them alive, investigators in the Department of Health and Human Services and in our own House and Senate committees were doing some digging of our own. In the course of their investigation, they found that not only was the manufacturer of EpiPen ripping off patients and their families, they were ripping off the American taxpayer, too. By misclassifying their drug as a generic when it was actually a brand drug, Medicaid was being overcharged for years. Further investigations by HHS found that hundreds of other drugs were also misclassified, and Medicaid was overcharged by more than $1 billion in the 4 years between 2012 and 2016. By passing this bill today, we can put an end to this waste and abuse in our Medicaid system. Under this bill, if a drug company knowingly misclassifies their brand drug as a generic, CMS will have the power to fine that drug company double the normal rebate they would have had to pay the government. The bill strengthens CMS and congressional oversight of the program to prevent this from ever happening again. I thank Mr. WELCH , and Senators WYDEN and G RASSLEY , for their active work on this one, as well as Mr. BARTON, Mr. G REEN , Chairman W ALDEN , and Mr. PALLONE for including it in this great reform package. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ). Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7217, the IMPROVE Act, which includes several important Medicaid provisions, including the ACE Kids Act. I have been a cosponsor of the ACE Kids Act since its first introduction. Mr. Speaker, in the Tampa area, we have St. Joseph’s Children’s Hospital. They run a ChronicComplex Clinic for children. This medical home is a great model that the ACE Kids Act is trying to build on. This integrated care model, where the care is built around the needs of the patient, has made a huge difference in the lives of so many children. I am excited that, finally, we have reached the finish line on the ACE Kids Act. I thank former full committee chairman and also, I guess—well, I am not sure, but he is a great guy. Yes, he is vice chairman of the committee. I thank him for all of his hard work on the ACE Kids and the IMPROVE Acts. I also thank my colleague KATHY CASTOR for being relentless. The two of them are relentless on behalf of our children. I thank all the children that came up and advocated for this bill as well. So, in any case, we are going to get this done. We couldn’t do it without these two, so thank you very much. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN ) has 41⁄2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ) has 61⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I think this is how we need to work together, and this is a good example of not only interState but also interparty, to be able to solve these three problems that this bill corrects. I hope the next Congress will continue that effort of Republicans and Democrats talking to each other, Texans talking to Oklahomans, which is sometimes tough, to work together for the people we represent. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), a strong supporter. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the IMPROVE Act. My colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee and I have been working to address a number of the issues that culminated under this legislation. For instance, the ACE Kids Act, an effort championed by Representative BARTON , would make strides in addressing the challenges of children with medically complex conditions. It sets standards for health home qualifications, so as to ensure better coordinated care for children in need. It updates and streamlines the coordinated care provisions for health homes for children, so that they will have the system and framework in place to properly respond and work with health systems and professionals. Additionally, it overhauls the data collection requirements for providers and updates the State reporting requirements, so as to maintain a more comprehensive network of care for children with complex medical conditions. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a culmination of a lot of hard work by my colleagues, particularly Representative BARTON and the staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and represents a commonsense step forward in assisting needy children. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. b1315 Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER ), one of the tireless supporters of this bill from day one, who herself has a medically complex special needs child, who went through the nightmare of having to create her own network for her child, and who has been a cosponsor since day one. Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman BARTON for his leadership on this. I am so excited that we are here today to celebrate this. I have spent months of my life in a NICU for my own medically complex child, and I have stood bedsidetobedside with many a family as they have faced the reality of having a sick kid and they have hit hard economic times. I can put too many faces and names to the reality that little kiddos often can’t get the care they need, and today we are taking a step to fix it. I am so excited about this. One in 25 children in the U.S. is medically complex. That means they have diagnoses like cancer or endstage renal disease or congenital heart disease or other diagnoses that require consistent critical medical care. They need the expertise. Out of those 3 million medically complex kiddos, 2 million of them rely on Medicaid, which means what we do with Medicaid significantly impacts them. They are also less expensive than the other folks on Medicaid, so we can go a long way to make sure of getting them care. So in order to enhance the critical care for these 2 million kiddos, the ACE Kids Act would create networks, anchored by children’s hospitals, to help coordinate care, allowing families to seamlessly pursue the best doctors and facilities, even if it takes them out of State, and that is the key. Right now under Medicaid, you can get stuck in your ZIP Code. So maybe there is a specialist for your child’s rare disease in another State. Well, if you are on Medicaid, you are limited. We are breaking open that limitation today to allow those kiddos to cross State lines and pursue the best doctors regardless of where they are. This just makes sense. Here is the great thing: the efficiency and the better coordination is going to improve outcomes, number one, that is the best thing. But the next best thing is this is even going to save money, because we are not going to build that expertise in every single community, we are going to get those kids where they need to go. It is really going to cut down on duplication and it is going to increase efficiency and it is going to be the right thing. So this is a winwin proposition. I am so excited about this. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
And, again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and Ms. CASTOR for their leadership here. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ). Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. BARTON for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in support of language that was added to the IMPROVE Act that would protect access to critical equipment for individuals with disabilities. In November of 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a rule stating that accessories used on complex rehabilitative wheelchairs would no longer be part of the fixed fee schedule and would be subject to competitive bidding pricing, decreasing access to customized wheelchairs and accessories relied on by adults and children with disabilities. My language included in this legislation will include a commonsense clarification to ensure those in the Medicare Program do not have to go through the difficulty of adjusting to the new rules and pricing arbitrarily set by CMS. This will ensure that they have reliable and consistent access to the equipment they need. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect those with disabilities and their access to the resources they rely on. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2
SICKLE CELL DISEASE AND OTHER HERITABLE BLOOD DISORDERS RESEARCH, SURVEILLANCE, PREVENTION, AND TREATMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2465) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize a sickle cell disease prevention and treatment demonstration program and to provide for sickle cell disease research, surveillance, prevention, and treatment. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2465 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2018’’. 
Part A of title XI of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 1105 (42 U.S.C. 300b–4) the following: 
It is the Sense of the Senate that further research should be undertaken to expand the understanding of the causes of, and to find cures for, heritable blood disorders, including sickle cell disease. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of S. 2465, the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2018. The policy included in this legislation is something on which Congress has been working towards for years, as improvements for individuals with sickle cell have largely remained stagnant. This text is similar to H.R. 2410, which was introduced by Representative DANNY DAVIS and myself and passed this Chamber unanimously in February. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative DAVIS, in addition to Senator TIMSCOTT and Senator C ORY BOOKER for working with me on this important policy. Since the passage of the Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act of 1972, the first law to address sickle cell, individuals living with this disease have seen a substantial drop in mortality rates; however, there remains work to be done. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States with sickle cell. Additionally, the disease occurs in 1 in 365 African American births, and in 1 in 13 African American births, the newborn has the sickle cell trait. In the 1990s, the Food and Drug Administration approved hydroxyurea, which stimulates the body to resume production of fetal hemoglobin to treat sickle cell disease. Last year the Food and Drug Administration approved Endari, which was the first new approved treatment in over 20 years. I met with Dr. Janet Woodcock and Dr. Peter Marks to learn more about why the approvals have taken such a long time. This bill would further our commitment to helping those with sickle cell by both continuing the Health Resources and Service Administration’s Sickle Cell Disease Prevention and Treatment Demonstration Program and by allowing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct surveillance of the disease and other heritable blood disorders. The CDC’s surveillance activity will allow for identification of health disparities, analysis of utilization of existing therapies, and evaluation of genetic, environmental, behavioral, and other risk factors. Having worked with patients with sickle cell disease while at Parkland Hospital, I have seen firsthand the real consequences that this disease can have on people. This bill provides an important step forward in ensuring that we have the resources to better understand this illness and maintain access for services for those affected by the disease. While sickle cell disease has been addressed in bills like the 21st Century Cures Act, among other rare diseases, it has been a long time since this illness was substantially addressed in legislation. The future of sickle cell disease treatment is bright if we pass this legislation and send it to President Trump. Better understanding of the landscape of sickle cell disease across the Nation and investing in new research for new treatments holds much promise for individuals and families who spend every day managing their disease. Think of the children who have been unable to play or had to quit competing, or who have had to struggle through school because they are frequently absent due to the complications or pain from their underlying sickle cell illness. The support this bill provides will enable publicprivate partnerships to take the reins to fight this disease headon in communities across the country. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation so we can send it promptly to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2465, the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act. This legislation will reauthorize the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program at HRSA. This program enhances the prevention and treatment of sickle cell through coordination of service delivery, genetic counseling, testing, training of health professionals, and other related efforts. The program is particularly important since individuals with sickle cell disease need comprehensive treatment throughout their lives in order to manage their symptoms and prevent their disease from worsening. Over 100,000 Americans are living with sickle cell disease today. Each will need access to robust network providers with the knowledge and skills to treat this condition. 
PREMATURITY RESEARCH EXPANSION AND EDUCATION FOR MOTHERS WHO DELIVER INFANTS EARLY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3029) to revise and extend the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act (PREEMIE Act). The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3029 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Reauthorization Act of 2018’’ or the ‘‘PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3029, the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2018. This bill passed the Senate with robust bipartisan support, and I expect it will do the same in this Chamber. This bill reauthorizes a program that is vital to the health and wellbeing of premature babies and their mothers. It is fitting that we have called this legislation to the floor following Prematurity Awareness Month, which took place the month of November. While we are taking up the Senate bill, which was led by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Chairman LAMAR ALEXANDER  and Senator MICHAEL BENNET , I would like to thank our House champions of this legislation, Representative ANNA ESHOO and Representative L EONARD  LANCE . I am pleased that we were able to rally bicameral, bipartisan support around improving the health of premature infants. Preterm and low birth weight, combined, make up the second leading cause of infant death following birth defects. This legislation will increase research relating to preterm labor and delivery and the care, treatment, and outcomes of preterm and low birthweight infants. Preemies and low birthweight infants are at risk for various health challenges and disabilities, and we still have much to learn about factors relating to prematurity. This bill allows for continued collection of maternalinfant clinical and biomedical information in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Such data collection and surveillance will allow the CDC, and national, State, and local health officials to have a better picture of what prematurity, including its causes and impacts, looks like in our country. This legislation also requires the Advisory Committee on Maternal and Infant Health to publicly publish and submit to Congress a report on its activities and recommendations. That advisory committee has been tasked with 
developing strategies to address gaps in Federal research, programs, and education efforts related to the prevention of severe maternal morbidity, maternal mortality, infant mortality, and other adverse birth outcomes. This ties nicely into H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, which will also be on the floor of this House this afternoon. Additionally, this legislation establishes an interagency working group, directing the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to collaborate with other departments to improve coordination of programs and activities to prevent preterm birth, infant mortality, and related adverse birth outcomes. The working group is required to submit a report to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 3029, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3029, the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers Who Deliver Infants Early, or PREEMIE, Reauthorization Act of 2018. Over the past 3 years, the preterm birth rate in the United States worsened, placing more mothers and babies at risk. Such preterm births are the largest contributors to infant death in the United States and, for those infants who survive, a major cause of longterm health problems throughout their lives. While this preterm rate in the U.S. is 9.93 percent, mothers and infants in Texas are at even greater risk. In fact, in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, 10.6 percent of live births were born preterm. The percentage is even greater for African American mothers and infants at 13.6 percent, a rate that is 39 percent higher than the rate among all women in Texas. This legislation would help combat those negative trends by continuing support for federally supported activities that prevent premature births, such as research and programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as activities that promote healthy pregnancies and preventing preterm birth at the Health Resources and Services Administration. This reauthorization legislation also requires such efforts to address the determinants that contribute to the health disparities in preterm birth. I thank Representative ESHOO and Representative LANCE for their leadership on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to support S. 6085 to extend and expand Federal efforts to prevent and address preterm birth. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ), one of the authors of this legislation. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act. My partner in this effort over several years has been the distinguished Congresswoman from California, ANNAESHOO . There may be no greater calling than to help infants thrive in the early days of their lives. Working together and getting this legislation signed into law is a matter of essential importance. This is good and important work and the kind of positive difference Federal efforts can make in the lives of many. We have a tremendous partner in the March of Dimes. For many families, the March of Dimes and its network and advocates across the country are beacons of light at dark moments. I thank the March of Dimes and their supporters for being the great defenders and fighters for mothers and for their infants. This legislation will keep up the momentum to help pregnant women. We need to reauthorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s research and data collection efforts and improve the Health Resources and Services Administration. Doctors and the public need to have the best information and care options available, and this bill does that. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ), the cosponsor of this bill and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Health Subcommittee. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and my classmate, Mr. GREEN , for his distinguished service here in the House. He is retiring, and I want to salute him. I also want to salute my partner in this effort, Mr. LANCE from New Jersey. He is going to be missed at the committee and missed in the House. I think he has always been value added to the Congress, and we all wish him well. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation. The shorthand for it is the PREEMIE Act. It is legislation that I introduced with Congressman LANCE to expand research, education, and the prevention of preterm birth. Preterm birth, or birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy, is the leading cause of newborn mortality and the second leading cause of infant mortality in our country. In 2016, over 388,000 infants were born too early; and, every year, over 20,000 babies in the United States will die before their first birthday, many of them from complications of preterm birth. In addition to being the leading cause of newborn death, premature birth can cause a lifetime of health challenges and intellectual disabilities for children who survive. In addition to the emotional and physical toll of prematurity, there are significant healthcare costs to families, medical systems, and our overall economy. A report by the Institute of Medicine found the cost associated with preterm birth in the United States was $26.2 billion annually—that is a staggering amount of money—or $51,600 per infant born preterm. While employers, private insurers, and individuals bear about half the costs of healthcare for these infants, 40 percent of this amount is paid for by Medicaid. Moms and babies face higher risks than ever before. After the statistics decreasing for over a decade, which is exactly what we wanted them to do, for the third year in a row now the preterm birth rate in our country has worsened, so the passing of this legislation has come at the right time. I am proud of the work that we have done on this Reauthorization Act and that it is going to head to the President for his signature, and I am proud to have authored the original PREEMIE Act with Congressman FRED UPTON in 2006. This updated reauthorization builds on the important investments that have been made, and we add to them. I think that is the most important thing to say. With the incidence of preterm birth increasing across the United States, we need to do everything that we can for the mothers and for the newborns so that we improve the outcomes for them because it is their lives. The PREEMIE Act did pass the Senate unanimously on September 12, and I have every confidence that the House is going to double the record. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and, again, pay tribute to him for his exceptional service here in the House. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS). Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I also want to commend the Subcommittee on Health and the Committee on Energy and Commerce for its outstanding work under the leadership of Dr. BURGESS . b1345 Mr. Speaker, I am going to speak about sickle cell, a bill that has been worked on and passed. Of course, sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by affected red blood cells that mutate into the shape of a crescent or sickle. And as such, these cells are unable to pass through small blood vessels. It is a recessivegenetic condition that occurs when a 
child inherits two sickle cell genes, or traits, from each parent. The consequences and complications of this disease are extreme. The Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, whom we have worked with for many years on this legislation, have studied and reported that common complications with this disease include early childhood death from infection; stroke in young children and adults; lung problems similar to pneumonia; chronic damage to organs, including the kidney, leading to kidney failure; damage to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension; and severe, painful episodes. In fact, pain episode are a hallmark of sickle cell disease. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are at this juncture in passing S. 2465, a bill designed to help improve, treat, prevent, and conduct research on sickle cell disease and to include other blood diseases for surveillance and data collection. While this legislation includes other blood diseases, its original intent and its continuing focus is to put major emphasis on sickle cell disease and issues related to it. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Representative MICHAEL BURGESS, and Representative G.K. BUTTERFIELD , Senator T IMSCOTT, and Senator CORYBOOKER for their tireless support and efforts to bring this bipartisan and bicameral bill to fruition. There has been a great deal of back and forth on this bill. Therefore, I want to thank, again, Dr. BURGESS , the chief Republican cosponsor and advocate. I want to commend the leadership on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Chairman GREG WALDEN and Ranking Member FRANK PALLONE . Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight the work of my colleague and friend, Representative G.K. BUTTERFIELD , who carried the bill for this legislation in the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Our staffs did outstanding work, and I commend all of them, especially my Health Subcommittee staffer, Dr. Caleb Gilchrist. I want to acknowledge and thank our advocate organizations, the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, the American Society of Hematology, and other organizations, hospital providers, families, and those infected with the sickle cell disease. Mr. Speaker, those who say that Congress does not work and is not working, I tell you, when we pass legislation of this sort, it tells me that America is on the right track and we are, indeed, moving forward to help make our communities as safe and healthy as they can possibly be. I end by just thanking Dr. BURGESS , again, for his outstanding leadership on this issue. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to take a second and thank Representative DAVIS for his kind remarks, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 3029, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3029. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6615) to reauthorize the Traumatic Brain Injury program, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6615 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act, and I would like to thank Representatives BILL PASCRELL and Representative T HOMAS  ROONEY for introducing this important legislation. Traumatic brain injuries impact many families each and every year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report last month that found that young children have one of the highest rates of TBIrelated emergency department visits. These injuries can harm the developing brain and have the potential to impact a child’s cognitive abilities in the long term. Whether the result of a hard hit during a football game as a teen, a car crash in middle age, or a fall as a senior, traumatic brain injuries pose various and serious risks to Americans. This legislation reauthorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traumatic brain injury initiatives at a level of $675 million per year for fiscal years 2019 through 2023. Additionally, this bill authorizes the National Concussion Surveillance System at a level of $5 million per year through fiscal year 2023. This is important in ensuring that we have adequate data regarding who is getting concussions, how they are treated, and if there are any trends. This data will help identify where individuals are seeking healthcare treatment, if they are seeking treatment at all. Additionally, we do not currently have national estimates of the number of individuals living with disabilities due to brain injury, and this system will help to establish such estimates. 
The Centers for Disease Control plans to conduct its data collection via telephone surveys and a pilot test to ensure that we will get the best data from a wide range of households. The bill also reauthorizes State grants for protection and advocacy services at the Administration for Community Living. These services protect individuals with disabilities by providing them with legal support, especially when it comes to their ability to make certain lifestyle choices, such as living independently. This is particularly important given that individuals who suffer from traumatic brain injury, such as concussions, may experience a disability. According to the CDC, more than 61 percent of children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury experience a disability. We have yet to see what cost to these individuals and to society these disabilities convey in the long term. The culmination of the programs that will be reauthorized by this legislation provides hope to individuals and families that are affected by traumatic brain injury. We still have much to learn about the risks and the short and longterm effects of traumatic brain injury, and this legislation will chip away at our goal of increasing knowledge, awareness, and treatment of traumatic brain injury. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6615, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018, introduced by Representative PASCRELL  and Representative THOMAS ROONEY . This legislation would reauthorize funding for Administration for Community Living’s Traumatic Brain Injury Program, TBI, to fiscal year 2024. The TBI program provides grants to States to support activities, such as improving screening to identify individuals with TBI, building a trained TBI workforce, providing resources to families, and funding protection and advocacy systems for people with TBI. H.R. 6615 will also reauthorize programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase the incidence of traumatic brain injury and reduce the prevalence of TBI. These programs are important in improving our understanding of traumatic brain injury, and our ability to prevent and treat such injuries. Recently, the CDC released new diagnostic guidelines focused on treating children with mild TBI and concussions, largely based on research and surveillance efforts funded by CDC’s traumatic brain injury program. Finally, this legislation also will reauthorize a new National Concussion Surveillance System to determine the prevalence and the incidence of concussions in the U.S. This is particularly important for improving our understanding of longterm consequences of concussions, as well as efforts to prevent, diagnose, and treat concussions. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6615, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ), the cosponsor of this bill. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018, and I also would like to thank Chairman WALDEN and Ranking Member PALLONE for their work to move this important legislation forward. I am grateful to House leadership for bringing this for a vote. I want to associate myself with the words of Mr. BURGESS and Mr. G REEN . Mr. Speaker, I commend Congressman GREEN and Congressman B URGESS  for their steadfast work to improve our Nation’s health landscape over the past several decades, and especially during Mr. GREEN ’s tenure on the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee. How time flies. I would also like to give a special thanks to my colleague, TOMROONEY , who sponsored this legislation with me. Congressman ROONEY has been a great partner as my cochair of the Congressional Traumatic Brain Injury Task Force. Over 20 years ago, Mr. Speaker, we put together the task force on a bipartisan basis, and it is still going, and it is still very, very active. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for all he has done for Americans living with brain injuries during his time in Congress. I am glad to see this body come together in a bipartisan manner to support the work being done in our Federal agencies and across the country to expand research and prevention in the treatment of traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury knows no bounds. It affects people of all backgrounds and every ZIP Code. We are only at the precipice of understanding how prevalent that is. The passage of this legislation will fulfill a very critical obligation to Americans living with brain injuries, including our servicemembers, our athletes, and our children. This reauthorization is especially important because it includes for the first time funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention so that they can determine how many Americans have sustained a brain injury. This will give us critical insight into the problem. Dubbed the signature injury of servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, TBI has continued to occur on the battlefield. TBI happens on the sports field as well, and we are working diligently to address this. We have come a long way to improve safety screening and rehab since we first talked about TBI two decades ago, but much more must be done. This legislation makes the right investments in our Federal and State TBI initiatives; provides those living with brain injuries the supports that they need, and when we are supporting the brain injured, we are also supporting their families. It includes critical increases in funding and modernizes how the government oversees TBI. Our legislation is endorsed by the Brain Injury Association of America, the National Association of State Head Injury Administrators, and the American Academy of Neurology. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with Congressman ROONEY , the membership of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, as well as Senator CASEY and Senator H ATCH to send this legislation swiftly to the President’s desk. b1400 Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6615, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6615, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PREVENTING MATERNAL DEATHS ACT OF 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1318) to support States in their work to save and sustain the health of mothers during pregnancy, childbirth, and in the postpartum period, to eliminate disparities in maternal health outcomes for pregnancyrelated and pregnancyassociated deaths, to identify solutions to improve health care quality and health outcomes for mothers, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1318 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS )? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act. I am glad that we are finally calling up this bill for a vote, as it is a truly important bill that will impact the lives of pregnant women and new mothers across this country. The media’s attention to the issue of maternal morbidity and mortality has shed light on serious problems within our healthcare system in terms of pre and postpartum care and complications in the delivery room. I thank Representative JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER and Representative DIANA DEGETTE for their leadership on this critical legislation. Ms. HERRERA  BEUTLER testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Health this September in support of her bill, which she and her staff have been working on daily to get across the finish line. She and I have shared a goal to improve maternal outcomes, and I am grateful that we had an opportunity to continue to push this priority forward together. I also thank the committee staff, which has been working through the language with the various stakeholders over the course of the past year. Their work has been imperative in getting this bill to the floor. Having spent nearly three decades as an OB/GYN, I believe it should be a national goal to eliminate all preventable maternal deaths. A single one is too many. The alarming trend in our country’s rate of maternal mortality first came to my attention in September 2016 when I was reading in my professional journal called The Green Journal, the journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The original research found that the maternal mortality rate had increased in 48 States and Washington, D.C., from 2000 to 2014 while the international trend was moving in the opposite direction. Since reading that article, I have spoken with providers, hospital administrators, State task forces, and public health experts. The more I dove into this troubling issue, the more I realized how little we understand about how our data is lacking. The Health Subcommittee has held both a member briefing and a hearing on the issue of maternal mortality. Our hearing this past September had a varied panel of witnesses, including Charles Johnson, who lost his wife, Kira, following the birth of their second child in 2016. Mr. Johnson’s wife was a healthy and energetic woman, yet he now has to explain to his two sons why their mother is never coming home. The Johnson family is not alone in living through such tragedy. However, if we pass this bill today and send it to the President’s desk, we will be taking a step in the right direction toward preventing future maternal deaths. This is a problem that we cannot address without accurate data. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States’ maternal mortality rate was 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1999 and increased to 18 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014. These are statistics that deserve our full attention. Representative JAIME HERRERA  BEUTLER ’s bill will address the complex issue of maternal mortality by enabling States to form maternal mortality review committees to evaluate, improve, and standardize their maternity death data. Once we fully understand the problem, there will be an opportunity to use the data to implement best practices. Texas is an excellent example of a State that has created and sustained a maternal mortality and morbidity task force. Texas has put time, effort, and funding into reviewing maternal deaths in order to identify trends and causes. Most of the pregnancyrelated and pregnancyassociated deaths—or many, I should say—are preventable, but they are all tragic. We should not be losing women to such a fixable problem, leaving their newborn babies and their families to have to wake up each day to face the unsolved mystery of why the mother did not make it home from the hospital or died shortly thereafter. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, sponsored by Representatives JAIME HERRERA  BEUTLER and D IANA DEGETTE . This is an important first step to addressing the maternal mortality crisis that is claiming the lives of too many new mothers in our country. Hundreds of women die each year from pregnancyrelated and pregnancyassociated complications in the U.S. More than 60 percent of these deaths are preventable. The Preventing Maternal Deaths Act encourages States to implement maternal mortality review committees that track maternal deaths and identify their underlying causes. Together, the data generated by these review committees will help experts identify trends, patterns, and disparities that contribute to preventable maternal deaths in order to save lives in the future. It is shocking that the maternal mortality rate in the United States has increased while in most of the rest of the developed world it has fallen. It is also shocking that women of color, lowincome women, and women in rural areas are disproportionately more likely to face pregnancyrelated complications. This must change. But in order to reverse this unconscionable trend, we must have the necessary data so providers can monitor their practices and improve their care delivery. The mortality rate is a critical indicator of the quality of our healthcare system, as well as how we prioritize women’s health in this country. While much more work still must be done, including improving access to care, I am proud to support this bill and believe it will set us on a path to understanding why women are dying and how we can stop it. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER ), who is the principal author of the bill. Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman BURGESS  for his tireless commitment on this issue. It is not just the gentleman’s career, but it has been something that the gentleman has fought for here in Congress as well, and I am very grateful to be standing here today. I also want to thank my coconspirator, DIANA DEGETTE , for her work on this bipartisan legislation that has more than 180 cosponsors. So why is this bill important to you, Mr. Speaker, or to those who are listening? Well, you either are a mom or you have got a mom. This bill impacts you. I stand in strong support of the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, a bill to save mothers’ lives and prevent more parents, husbands, grandparents, and children from the profound loss of their mother. Today in the 21st century United States of America, the U.S. is ranked fourth globally for maternal mortality. Many are shocked to learn that the 
U.S. not only has the worst maternal mortality rate in the entire developed world, but that these rates are on the rise. Seriously, Mr. Speaker, we are worse than Iran. Every year, between 700 and 900 maternal deaths occur in the United States, and I have seen tears brought to the eyes of many a colleague when they learn that more than 60 percent of these deaths could have been prevented, according to the CDC. It is difficult to imagine the grief felt by these families when a life is cut short and they learn that it could have been prevented. As a mom, as an American, and as a lawmaker, we must do better. Combating maternal mortality must become a national priority, which is why I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The Preventing Maternal Deaths Act represents the biggest step taken by Congress to date on this issue. It would enable States to establish and strengthen maternal mortality review committees, which bring together experts in public health, in maternal health, and in infant health to investigate each and every pregnancyrelated death to understand what went wrong and how to save future mothers’ lives. Currently, the available data is woefully inadequate, which hinders our ability to understand why moms are dying and why certain women are more at risk. Right now, African American women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancyrelated causes, and women living in rural areas are also facing higher risk. This bill will not only improve data collection, but it will empower States to participate in national information sharing, increase collaboration, and develop best practices. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to dedicate this bill to the mothers whom we have lost, moms like Kira Johnson who lost her life just hours after giving birth to a healthy baby boy. I will never forget hearing from Kira’s husband, Charles, who has been a tireless advocate on this issue. He is a single father of two boys and now lives by the motto: ‘‘Wake up, make mommy proud, repeat.’’ Stories like Kira’s have struck at the hearts of many of us and have compelled us to action today. Today, we honor the lives of these moms and the loved ones who remember them. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I thank both Congresswoman DEGETTE  and Congresswoman HERRERA BEUTLER  for bringing this issue to our committee and also to the House. Mr. Speaker, I urge a positive vote today, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), who is a valuable member of the Health Subcommittee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act. Unfortunately, we know all too well in Georgia the need to address maternal mortality rates in the Nation. My home State of Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country, and we learned about the challenges leading to this statistic on September 27 in the Energy and Commerce Committee when we were able to hear from my colleague and the sponsor of the bill, Congresswoman HERRERA BEUTLER . As my colleague noted in the hearing, we are seeing an estimated number of between 700 and 900 maternal deaths per year, a number that is unacceptable in today’s world. A 2015 World Health Organization report noted that nearly half of these deaths were preventable. From 1987 to 2009, the number of pregnancyrelated deaths per 100,000 births nearly doubled. That is why this legislation is so important. Whether it is updates to maternal mortality data collection or mental treatment options, or the reforms and changes for the maternal mortality review committees, this legislation is necessary to helping us curb this trend and reduce the number of maternal mortality deaths. We can and we should do more, and I hope that this will be one of our many steps to help us save the lives of mothers across the country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ). Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I know that the ranking member already yielded back, so I thank Mr. BURGESS  for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to hurry down here to speak in favor of this bill because I have been working on it for many years with my colleague and friend, JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER . According to the CDC, maternal mortality rates rose by 26 percent in the U.S. between 2000 and 2014. These deaths are preventable, and they should not be happening in 2018. So to combat this alarming trend, 33 States have established maternal mortality review committees made up of healthcare professionals who review individual maternal deaths and then recommend policy decisions. Our bill provides Federal support for these committees and supports efforts to standardize them. It has 190 cosponsors. It has received support from 90 national public health organizations. It is really a great example of how the Energy and Commerce Committee works in a bipartisan way. So I thank everybody for being here and thank the chairman for his comity. b1415 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Just in addition to all the other people who have been thanked, I want to acknowledge the work of my personal staff, Mr. Ed Kim and Elizabeth Allen, who have worked so hard on this bill, as well as Dr. Kristen Shatynski on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health staff, who really helped push this along and made sure that we got here today in a successful manner. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1318, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA TO RELEASE BURMESE JOURNALISTS WA LONE AND KYAW SOE OO Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1091) calling on the Government of Burma to release Burmese journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo sentenced to seven years imprisonment after investigating attacks against civilians by Burma’s military and security forces, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 1091 Whereas in recent decades the Rohingya people have lost, through systematic discrimination by Burmese national, state, and local authorities, a range of civil and political rights, including citizenship, and face barriers today such that they have been rendered stateless; Whereas the Burmese military and security forces have committed numerous crimes against civilians over many years in Burma’s Rakhine, Shan, Kachin, and Karen States; Whereas beginning August 25, 2017, the Burmese military and security forces, as well as civilian mobs, carried out widespread attacks, rapes, killings, and the burning of villages throughout Rakhine State resulting in approximately 730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh and bringing the total Rohingya refugee population in Cox’s Bazar to over 900,000; Whereas on November 14, 2018, Vice President Mike Pence said, ‘‘This is a tragedy that has touched the hearts of millions of Americans. The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes that resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh is without excuse.’’; Whereas to date, though the refugee crisis is not of their making, the Government of Bangladesh has generously accommodated the rapid and massive influx of Rohingya refugees into Cox’s Bazar; 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, the House will take the important step of naming the atrocities committed against the Rohingya people in Burma for what they are. The word for that is ‘‘genocide.’’ The Rohingya people, predominantly of Burma’s Rakhine State, are often called the world’s most persecuted minority. The Rohingya are essentially stateless people, as the Burmese Government refuses to recognize them as citizens, despite the fact that the Rohingya people have lived in Burma for generations. Further, institutional restrictions on the Rohingya have impacted their rights to study, work, travel, access healthcare services, practice religion, and even to marry. The most recent wave of persecution began in August 2017, when Burmese security forces and civilian mobs began a horrific wave of attacks. Mass murder, rape, and destruction of villages throughout Rakhine State has been well documented. We have talked to the survivors. These atrocities have driven 700,000 Rohingya from their homes to Bangladesh, bringing the total Rohingya refugee population in that country to nearly 1 million. Bangladesh has been very generous in accepting all these refugees in the face of such dire circumstances. A year and a half later, the evidence is overwhelming. As I said at our hearing on the subject this past September, 
it is time that we take the next step in declaring that these crimes amount to genocide. In September, the State Department released a report on the stomachturning, systematic, and widespread acts of violence against the Rohingya in northern Rakhine State, but failed to label these atrocities genocide. The State Department’s investigation revealed countless heartwrenching pieces of evidence, like the account of one woman who hid in bushes as she watched Burmese soldiers throw infants and toddlers into a river to drown and shot the mothers of these infants who tried to save them. The United States has a moral obligation to call these crimes genocide. Failing to do so gives the perpetrators cover and hinders efforts to bring those accountable to justice. With this resolution, the House fulfills its part of that duty. The measure also accomplishes a number of other important goals. It provides a thorough accounting of the crisis, calls out the complicit Burmese Government, urges the Secretary of State to join us in formally declaring genocide, and promotes multilateral agreement on that declaration. Importantly, the resolution also calls for the immediate pardon and release of two journalists who were framed and jailed by Burmese authorities for shining a light on some of the atrocities by government forces. Congress has a proud legacy of declaring genocide when warranted, just as we did over 2 years ago when the House voted unanimously to declare ISIS’ atrocities against religious minorities in Iraq and in Syria genocide. It is time to take this sober step again. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure and fulfilling our responsibility to reinforce the universal values we hold dear. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. First of all, I want to thank Mr. CHABOT for authoring this resolution. I also want to thank Representative JOE CROWLEY for his extraordinary dedication to all the people of Burma, including the Rohingya people. I thank Chairman ROYCE for bringing this resolution forward and for his leadership on this crucial issue throughout the years. This resolution calls on the Government of Burma to release Burmese Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who have been sentenced to 7 years following their investigation into the attacks on Rohingya civilians by the Burmese military and security forces. There is overwhelming evidence that these journalists were entrapped by the Burmese Government, who targeted them because of their reporting of the military’s horrific crimes. Their jail sentence is a part of a broader issue. Despite elections in 2015 that brought a prodemocracy civilian government to power, the Burmese Government still operates on antiquated laws that lead to locking up prisoners of conscience, even when their only crimes are reporting information that is unflattering or inconvenient for the government or for the military. This resolution rightly calls on the civilian government in Burma to repeal the laws that have been used to crack down on civil society and free expression and to pardon prisoners of conscience who have been imprisoned under these unjust laws. We must take a moment and reflect on the context of these arrests. The journalists were investigating what we now know were the crimes against humanity and genocide of the Rohingya people. They should not be sitting in a prison cell. They should be celebrated for faithfully carrying out their obligation to report the truth. This resolution does something else that is very important. It states that, in the opinion of the House, the atrocities inflicted on the Rohingya people by the Burmese military constitute genocide. It is important that we call it by name. It is a critical step towards justice for the victims. So we need to use the word ‘‘genocide.’’ I am glad that this resolution urges the Trump administration to call this atrocity what it is and pursue accountability for this heinous violence. With this resolution, Congress continues to assert our leadership and show that we stand with the Rohingya people. We will not be silent as the Burmese Government allows or tacitly encourages attacks on the press and on civil society. We will call out injustice when we see it. So I support this measure, and I urge all Members to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), the chairwoman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my friend STEVE  CHABOT ’s resolution, H. Res. 1091, which calls for the release of two Burmese journalists who were unjustly imprisoned for what crime? Courageously reporting on the genocide against the people known as the Rohingya. In September, I joined Jan Schakowsky and STEVE CHABOT in sending a letter to Secretary of State Pompeo expressing our grave concern for the 7 year sentence given to these brave journalists. Unfortunately, the stories of these men are just two of the many, many sad examples of the erosion of press freedom and other basic rights in Burma. At a time when these brave men should be rewarded for helping make the evidence available to the U.N. commission investigating these crimes, they get jail time. This resolution sends a strong message that the world is paying attention. In 2012, I was worried that it was too soon for the Obama administration to ease sanctions on Burma. Unfortunately, it has proven to be too soon. In the aftermath of the massacre of the Rohingya, we must hold all individuals responsible for these crimes against humanity accountable. I call on the Burmese Government to release these journalists and reform the law so that freedom of the press is not obstructed. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, once again, our chairman, EDROYCE , and ELIOT ENGEL for their continued commitment to bringing forth bipartisan and important bills to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support Mr. CHABOT ’s resolution. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), who retires this year and leaves an extraordinary legacy in this Chamber. (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution calling for the release of the two journalists imprisoned after investigating attacks against the Rohingya ethnic minority in Burma, also known as Myanmar. As I said in the resolution I introduced in early September calling for their release: ‘‘The Burmese police captain involved in their arrest reportedly admitted during the trial that his superior ordered him to entrap the journalists.’’ The atrocities committed against the Rohingya—mass killings; rape perpetrated on a massive scale; whole villages burned to the ground, with people being burned alive in their homes; and over 700,000 fleeing the violence to neighboring Bangladesh—have been so extreme that the United Nations issued a report earlier this year calling for Burma’s military leaders to be investigated and prosecuted on the charges of genocide. There can be no doubt about the culpability of Burma’s military in the oppression and violence inflicted on the Rohingya. I had the privilege of meeting Aung San Suu Kyi a few years ago as part of a delegation led by NANCY PELOSI , joining in admiration for her perseverance and triumph over oppression. There has been a hesitation by some to criticize Suu Kyi, worrying that it could make it more likely the military would take over the civilian government she leads. But her words and actions in the face of what, in reality, has been genocide have been deeply disturbing, contrary to her past example as a beacon of freedom. b1430 In 2017, the late John McCain and RICHARD DURBIN introduced in the Senate and I introduced in the House a resolution that encouraged ‘‘Aung San Suu Kyi to live up to her inspiring 
words upon receiving the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize with respect to ethnic reconciliation in Burma, and in particular to address the historic and brutal repression of the Rohingya in Rakhine State.’’ Unfortunately, that resolution was not acted upon. When Aung San Suu Kyi later said: ‘‘We believe that, for the sake of long term stability and security, we have to be fair to all sides,’’ it was a disturbing message of minimization. Suu Kyi later said: ‘‘In a way we can say that we understand our country better than any other country does, and I’m sure you will say the same of yours, that you understand your country better than anybody else.’’ As Bishop Desmond Tutu said in a letter to Suu Kyi: ‘‘My dear sister: If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep.’’ This resolution speaks out against the genocide and crimes against humanity that occurred in Rakhine State. All of humanity must speak out clearly and decisively. Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous support for this resolution. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He is the author of this measure. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their leadership on this issue, H. Res. 1091, which I introduced to commit the House to a determination that the Burmese military’s atrocities against the Rohingya minority in Rakhine State were genocide and to call for the release of the two Reuters journalists who have been unjustly imprisoned by the Burmese government for their investigation into these atrocities. On August 25 last year, the Burmese military began a barbaric campaign against the Rohingya people in Rakhine State. This premeditated operation resulted in 700,000 Rohingya fleeing from Burma into Bangladesh. In September, Congressman CROWLEY and I wrote to thenSecretary Tillerson to raise our serious concerns about the violence. Since then, sufficient evidence has been brought to light to fill in many gruesome details of what exactly happened. Much of this evidence is contained in two reports released in September. First, the U.N. FactFinding Mission on Myanmar released its final report that argued that the Burmese military had genocidal intent against the Rohingya. Second, the State Department released a report summarizing a survey of Rohingya survivors in Bangladesh that it had commissioned. The State Department’s report is particularly disturbing. It calls the violence extreme, largescale, widespread, and states that ‘‘the scope and scale of the military’s operations indicate they were well planned and coordinated.’’ Of the 1,000 Rohingya interviewed, about 80 percent witnessed killings and the destruction of villages. In total, 400 villages were burned to the ground. About half of those surveyed witnessed a rape. I could go on, but the gruesomeness of the eyewitness accounts I would rather not repeat in a civilized setting. Senior administration officials and numerous Members of Congress have all condemned these atrocities in harsh, unmistakable terms. In light of this evidence, I am asking my colleagues today to join me in making a legal determination by labeling these crimes what they were: genocide and crimes against humanity. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I also urge the administration and the Senate to make determinations similar to the one in this resolution so that we send a clear, unequivocal message to the Burmese Government and to the world that these barbaric and vicious atrocities will not be tolerated. Finally, Mr. Speaker, as cochair of the House Freedom of the Press Caucus, I also want to draw attention to the second half of the resolution, which condemns the Burmese Government’s decision to jail two Reuters journalists for trying to uncover the facts about the massacre in Rakhine State. Tomorrow marks the anniversary of their arrest, so it is especially timely that we are considering this resolution and calling for their release. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ), a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the ranking member of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, for reasons well explained by the preceding speakers, I am pleased to join in supporting this resolution and to commend Mr. CHABOT for introducing it. I was pleased to introduce it along with him and along with the chair, the ranking member, and several other Members of this House. This resolution deals with Burma, whose government chooses to call itself Myanmar, but we officially take the position that the country retains its name of Burma. This resolution calls out the Burmese military for their acts of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya and highlights the cases of two journalists who were imprisoned for simply trying to shed light on these historic stories. One of my priorities as ranking member of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee has been to focus attention on the 700,000 Rohingya who have been forced to flee Burma and relocate to Bangladesh, one of the world’s poorest countries. They have not fled because they wanted to leave home. They have not fled because Bangladesh is someplace where it is easy to make a living. They have fled to refugee camps because they have no choice, for the Rohingya communities have faced widespread attacks, rapes, killings, and burning of villages, all orchestrated by the Burmese military. Not only that, but the Burmese State takes the position that the Rohingya are not citizens of their country because they can’t prove that their great grandparents were born in the country. So, if someone is born in Burma, their parents were born in Burma, they could even prove their grandparents were born in Burma, they are denied a Burmese passport. Now, this resolution uses the term ‘‘genocide,’’ not a word we should throw around, but in this case it is clearly a test that has been met. In reports by the Public International Law & Policy Group and by our own Holocaust museum, the evidence is there that the United Nations’ definition of genocide has been met. The United Nations’ Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines ‘‘genocide’’ as acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. That is exactly what the Burmese military is doing, and denying citizenship is just part of that effort. This resolution sends an important message to the Burmese military, and it also focuses on two Reuters journalists who exposed the mass murder in the village of Indin. Those two journalists are Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were interviewing eyewitnesses to this crime. This is part of the Burmese genocide of the Rohingya. But instead of applauding their bravery, the Burmese Government arrested them and accused them of violating the Official Secrets Act. Of course, we understand that a government that is committing genocide wants to declare that genocide to be a state secret. And so, for that as their only crime, these two journalists have been sentenced to 7 years of hard labor in prison. There is only one just outcome here. State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint must pardon these journalists. They must acknowledge that the Burmese military is committing atrocities against the Rohingya. They must provide the Rohingya papers of citizenship. We need to pass this resolution, hopefully unanimously, to say that genocide must be stopped and the two journalists must be released. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1091. This resolution 
calls the atrocities committed against the Rohingya what they are—genocide—and asks the government of Burma to release two innocent journalists who were framed for helping to bring these crimes to light. I want to thank my predecessor, as chair of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, Congressman CHABOT , and Ranking Member ENGEL for introducing this resolution. Since August 2017, 700,000 Rohingya have fled their homes in Rakhine to neighboring Bangladesh to escape the horrible violence perpetrated by the Burmese military. In total, almost a million Rohingya refugees have been driven out of their homes in northern Rakhine and are sheltering in Bangladesh. They, the Rohingya, didn’t just decide to pick up all their belongings one day and leave. They are fearing for their lives, and so they left. The United Nations released a report just months ago asserting that the Burmese military systematically targeted civilians in a manner consistent with genocidal intent. This factfinding mission and other international NGOs have documented the violence, including torture; rape; killing unarmed civilians, including women and children; and burning down the Rohingya villages. Make no mistake; this is genocide. In a recent committee hearing on Burma, I spoke about the importance of journalists documenting these atrocities. However, we are seeing journalists inside Burma being punished and jailed for doing the basic requirements of their job. This resolution rightly calls for the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, the two Reuters journalists who were framed wrongfully and sentenced by the Burmese government to over 7 years in jail after investigating the very violence we are calling a genocide here today. How many more times do we and the world allow this to happen again? We either stand together as civilized nations, call this what it is—genocide—or we look the other way again as nations of the world did in World War II in Nazi, Germany, or during the Darfur genocide. We either are serious about this or not. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my fellow colleagues as an original cosponsor on this resolution and urge the rest of the House to join in support. When we say never again, we must mean never again. The House is today taking an important first step and speaking clearly on these atrocities. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, I want to, again, thank my colleagues and Chairman ROYCE for their hard work on this measure, as always. This is an important resolution. It gives a name to the atrocities that occurred in Rakhine State, calling them genocide, and urges the Trump administration to take appropriate action to hold the Burmese military accountable for these crimes. I agree with what everybody has mentioned. The resolution also calls for the release of two journalists wrongly imprisoned in Burma; and by passing this resolution today, we not only speak on behalf of these two journalists, but call for an open, civil, transparent, and increasingly democratic society in Burma. Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join me in supporting this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee for actually, again, speaking with one voice on this issue, especially the author, Representative CHABOT , but also Representatives ENGEL , SCHIFF , YOHO, SHERMAN , COMSTOCK , and C ROWLEYfor joining as original cosponsors. Mr. Speaker, this past September our committee convened another hearing to examine the desperate living conditions of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, and again we heard the story of survivors, all describing the same methodical, unthinkable acts of terror perpetrated by the Burmese military and by the security forces. Witnesses had no doubt that, based on all the evidence, genocide had occurred. It is time Congress, the administration, and the rest of the world called these atrocities by their rightful name, and that is genocide. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 1091, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1445 RECOGNIZING THE UNITED STATESREPUBLIC OF KOREA ALLIANCE Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1149) recognizing that the United StatesRepublic of Korea alliance serves as a linchpin of regional stability and bilateral security, and exemplifies the broad and deep military, diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties shared between the United States and the Republic of Korea. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. R ES. 1149 Whereas the United States Armed Forces and South Korean troops fought together to defend the Korean peninsula from Communist aggression before the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953, and the United States of America and the Republic of Korea have continued this camaraderie since signing the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of Korea that same year; Whereas the Republic of Korea is a model for alliance burdensharing, currently hosting 28,500 American activeduty military personnel, funding fifty percent of the total nonpersonnel costs of the U.S. troop presence on the Korean peninsula, fielding the world’s seventhlargest military, and spending over 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product on defense; Whereas the Republic of Korea is among the closest allies of the United States, having contributed troops in support of United States operations during the Vietnam war, Gulf war, and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while also supporting numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions throughout the world; Whereas United States forces on the Korean Peninsula are critical not only to the security of the Republic of Korea but also to protect against adversaries that threaten regional stability and the United States homeland; Whereas the U.S.ROK Combined Forces Command is the most integrated and effective combined military command in the world and, taken together with the United Nations Command, has formed a structure that has provided effective defense and deterrence on the Korean Peninsula for decades; Whereas North Korea has the world’s fourthlargest military, in addition to potentially as many as 60 nuclear weapons and between 2,500 and 5,000 metric tons of chemical weapons; Whereas the United States supports the Republic of Korea’s efforts at peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula and recognizes the critical importance of close policy coordination between Washington and Seoul; Whereas in February 2017, a United Nations investigatory body confirmed that North Korea attempted to sell key materials for constructing miniaturized nuclear warheads, and found that ballistic missile cooperation between Iran and North Korea was ‘‘significant and meaningful’’; Whereas the United States and South Korea share a commitment to democracy, human rights, and free market principles, as laid out in the 2009 U.S.ROK Joint Vision Statement as the foundation for a 21st century ‘‘strategic alliance’’ based on shared values; Whereas the Republic of Korea actively contributes to peacekeeping, cybersecurity, nonproliferation, overseas development assistance, climate change mitigation, counterterrorism, and postconflict stabilization; Whereas the Republic of Korea suffered economic retaliation from China for installing the United States Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense system, a measure necessitated by North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile belligerence; Whereas Korea is the world’s eleventh largest economy and the sixthlargest goods trading partner of the United States, and 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, strengthening U.S. Korea ties has been one of my top priorities in Congress. As a southern Californian, I have seen firsthand how Korean Americans serve as pillars not only for their communities in the U.S., but also for the friendship between the U.S. and South Korea. It was an honor to see my former staff member, Young Kim, represent my Orange County neighbors and myself in the California State Assembly. She served ably and energetically. Her story is the same as so many South Koreans who have come to this country and thrived. The United States has no better partner in the Asia Pacific than the Republic of Korea. We signed the KORUS Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in 2012. Since enactment of the KORUS Free Trade Agreement in 2012, trade has flourished, creating jobs in America and South Korea. In fact, South Korea is now our sixth largest trading partner, and, today, this partnership remains as important as ever as we look at the growing challenges across Asia. We stood by Seoul as it was wrongfully punished by China for installing the THAAD ballistic missile defense system. And we continue to lead in helping to address the grave and immediate threats North Korea poses to Seoul and poses to the United States and our neighboring partners. Despite recent diplomatic efforts, it was recently reported that North Korea has expanded a missile base along the Chinese border. A nearby second facility was also uncovered, while numerous undeclared missile bases have now been identified. And last month, North Korea’s official news media reported that it successfully tested a new ‘‘stateoftheart weapon that has been long developed . . . significantly improving the combat power of our people’s army.’’ That is their quote. These provocations and developments should underscore the threat we face from North Korea. That is why it is so important that we continue to press forward together with a campaign of maximum financial and diplomatic pressure. We must remain cleareyed that the third generation of the Kim regime poses just as significant of a threat to us, our partners, and, most acutely, the North Korean people as ever. Again, the U.S. has no better friend in Asia or anywhere else in the world than South Korea. We must continue to strengthen this partnership, particularly in the face of the threats we continue to face. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, let me once again start by thanking Chairman ROYCE . He has been one of Congress’ most active leaders, if not the most active leader, on policy related to the Korean Peninsula. He leaves behind a great legacy after a distinguished career in this Chamber and a remarkable record of bipartisanship and leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee. The measure before us today affirms that the United StatesRepublic of Korea alliance will continue to defend against outside aggressors, uphold the peace, and guard the prosperity built by our two nations. This resolution is before us at a critical time. The American alliance with South Korea is under intense strain. It is critical that we coordinate with our partners in Seoul when it comes to North Korea, but we see the administration and our South Korean partner are not on the same page when it comes to this important security issue. I am deeply concerned about the potential consequences of this gap between our administration and our ally, and many of us in both parties share the concern. Now, the question of how we handle American policy toward North Korea is very important. This resolution rightly lays out that we should continue to apply economic pressure to the Kim regime, but we need to remember sanctions are a tool, not a complete strategy. We need to fully articulate a diplomatic strategy to accompany sanctions and enable them to work properly. I also think it is important that our sanctions policy provides specific humanitarian exemptions. Lifesaving humanitarian aid has never been held hostage to the political whims of the Kim family. We need to continue that tradition and not allow the impoverished, mistreated people of North Korea to pay the price for their dictator’s political machinations. I agree with the chairman that we need to put economic pressure on the North Korean regime. But Congress should continue to provide space for diplomacy and humanitarian assistance, as we do now in our current sanctions policy. The resolution before us today would be a stronger piece of legislation if it contained mention of this principle. Although I wish the resolution laid out more explicitly the importance of a holistic strategy to accompany sanctions, it is a good measure that I am proud to support. Our alliance with Korea is of paramount importance to our strategic and security interests, and I am glad this 
measure reaffirms our strong commitment to that partnership. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, the United States recognizes its longstanding and multifaceted relationship with the Republic of Korea, one that runs much deeper than the headlines of today’s news may convey. Once among the world’s poorest countries and devastated by war less than 70 years ago, you would find it difficult to believe the stories of Korea’s past by visiting Seoul today. I led a bipartisan codel to Seoul this September to meet with members of the parliament, Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Defense Ministries, and North Korean defectors. The U.S.South Korea partnership is so much more than a military alliance. Our partnership cultivated the Miracle on the Han River and showed the world how a nation can transition from aid to trade. As stated, South Korea is now our sixth largest trading partner and tenth largest importer of agricultural products. South Korea has lived under the threat of war since its founding, but it has managed to lift its people out of extreme poverty and become an aid donor, a leader in international fora, one of the greatest sources of investment in the United States, and a shining example to many other countries in the region. As revisionist powers challenge the vision and values that underpin the South Korean miracle, the United States needs partners more today than ever before, partners that embody and promote the open border from which we have both deeply benefited. With this resolution, the House recognizes the United States’ special bond with the Republic of Korea, and the need to deepen and cultivate this partnership to promote peace and prosperity of both nations well into the future. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ), one of our most senior and ranking members on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. He is ranking member of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE for introducing H. Res. 1149, which recognizes the importance of our alliance with South Korea. As ranking member of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee and a member of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution with several other Members of Congress. The U.S. and South Korea share common values—democracy, commitment to justice—but we also share a unique bond of history. The United States military and South Korean troops fought side by side to defend the Korean Peninsula before the Armistice Agreement of 1953. Today, we continue to cooperate in order to defend the Korean Peninsula. In fact, South Korea currently hosts 28,500 American Active Duty military personnel. Only 35 miles separate Seoul from North Korea, and when I was there with the chairman, we noticed that property values are considerably lower on the north side of Seoul than on the south side of Seoul. While we have substantial conventional forces there, no number of soldiers can deal with the biggest threat from North Korea; namely, its nuclear arsenal. Now, I know it has been tweeted that we no longer face a nuclear threat from North Korea, would that that be so. Secretary of State Pompeo has recently stated that North Korea continues to make more fissile material, no doubt using that to make more nuclear bombs, even several every year. And satellite imagery shows that North Korea is continuing to build and expand bases for intercontinental ballistic missiles. So we are standing shoulder to shoulder with South Korea, but we face a real threat from North Korea, and we will not be able to deal with that threat without the assistance of both South Korea and Japan. This resolution reaffirms the need for the United States and South Korea to stand shoulder to shoulder in continuing to apply necessary economic pressure on North Korea. Toward that end, I would say that we have scaled back in substance, if not in legal form, our sanctions against North Korea, perhaps falsely believing that a few words exchanged in Singapore are a reason to do so. Recently, we have sent a letter to the administration, a bipartisan letter urging them to sanction major Chinese banks, not just small ones, that have done business with North Korea in violation of U.S. law and U.N. sanctions. Now, it is important also to look at the Korean American community, and I am pleased that the resolution recognizes the importance of the bridges created by the American Korean community between the United States and the Republic of Korea. I recently led a letter urging President Trump and President Moon to make a major priority among North Korea, the United States, and South Korea allowing American citizens, some 100,000 of them, who have relatives in North Korea to at least be allowed to visit their relatives and, even before that, at least be allowed to talk to them over the phone. We must recognize the potential for the Korean American community to serve the cause of peace and to help establish a dialogue. Again, I thank Chairman ROYCE for his leadership on this measure and urge its adoption. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Let me say, Mr. Speaker, I again thank Chairman ROYCE for his years of leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee and his remarkable legacy on setting the agenda for American policy in the Korean Peninsula. The United StatesSouth Korea alliance is essential to our strategic posture in Asia. Our commitment to the Republic of Korea will persevere as a critical part of American foreign policy. It should be our utmost priority to deepen and strengthen our cooperation, and this resolution continues and aids that strong partnership. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I again recognize and thank ELIOT ENGEL for his work on all of these measures, and I also recognize the importance of the U.S.South Korean partnership. I have discussed the importance of that defense relationship as we stood shoulder to shoulder during the Korean war and how our economic partnership, bolstered by the enactment of the KORUS FTA, supports 400,000 American jobs. b1500 While we discuss the importance of this partnership, I want to recognize that there is no greater bridge between our countries than the Korean American community. Since first arriving in the United States in 1903, they have worked tirelessly to form closer bonds between the United States and South Korea. And looking forward, the U.S. will remain committed to this important relationship. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for H. Res. 1149 and the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea. Our two nations have forged an important military alliance and strong economic and diplomatic friendship built on shared support for democracy, free markets and human rights. I have long advocated for increasing the American commitment to the IndoAsiaPacific region, with the important U.S.Korean relationship central to that strategy. Both of our nations are threatened by North Korea’s nuclear program. With nuclear talks at an apparent standstill, the current reduction in bilateral military exercises may be harming joint readiness with little to show for it. I will continue to urge the administration to conduct exercises when militarily necessary and separate our military cooperation with South Korea from ongoing negotiations about North Korea’s nuclear program. The United States and the Republic of Korea share a desire to eliminate the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile 
programs and secure a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. By working together as allies and friends we increase the likelihood of making these aspirations into reality. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BOST). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 1149. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REAFFIRMING THE STRONG COMMITMENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS REGION Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1157) reaffirming the strong commitment of the United States to the countries and territories of the Pacific Islands region. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Representative BORDALLO for introducing this measure on an important but often overlooked part of the world, and that is the South Pacific. Mr. Speaker, the Pacific Islands are an essential part of the South Pacific region. Today we express our commitment to these countries’ and territories’ security and to their prosperity. Our country has a long history with the Pacific Islands and territories. Today we have 300,000 United States citizens that reside in the territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and in American Samoa. The U.S. is engaged in this important region through a variety of programs which promote national security and also regional cooperation. They address conservation and public health threats. They distribute humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and they promote peace and prosperity. The United States has supported these endeavors under the Compacts of Free Association with Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. These important arrangements have allowed the U.S. to project a presence in the region for 30 years, but these compacts expire in 2023. The United States must continue to reassure the Pacific Island countries of our enduring commitment to having a continuing presence in the region and negotiate compact renewals before they expire. Our relationship with this region is unfolding against the backdrop of a shifting strategic environment where Beijing and others seek to wield a greater influence in the South Pacific. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure which reaffirms the importance of continuing to engage and cooperate with the Pacific Island countries and territories. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. First of all, I want to acknowledge the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ), my colleague, for her longstanding advocacy of American engagement in the Pacific region. I thank her for introducing this resolution. This measure supports cooperation with the Pacific Islands in the areas where we both have critical interests, including support for regional organizations and promotion of sustainable economic development. The resolution rightly focuses on a critical threat facing the Pacific Islands and the United States, which is climate change. In September of this year, Pacific Island leaders reaffirmed in a joint declaration that ‘‘climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security, and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific.’’ I wish that the President and the administration would act on that threat, but, instead, the United States refuses to acknowledge climate change at recent international conferences. The refusal to acknowledge established scientific fact is really wrong and dangerous. Our country has a critical role to play in the effort to address climate change, and when we abdicate that responsibility, we endanger future generations and the regions most at risk, like the Pacific Islands. So this is a good resolution, affirming America’s commitment to advance selfgovernment, economic development, and selfsufficiency for all the people of this strategically important region. It is important to note that this resolution expresses our continued support for our compact agreements with the Freely Associated States. The Pacific Islands remain a region critical to our interests and the interests of our partners, including Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. It makes sense that we would continue to support investments that enhance our partnership with the Pacific Islands. I support this measure, and I urge all Members to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ). Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, I rise to support H. Res. 1157, which reaffirms the strong commitment of the United States to the countries and territories of the Pacific Islands region. I want to applaud Representative BORDALLO for introducing this, and I am proud to join with others as a cosponsor. First, this resolution sends an important message to the 300,000 Americans who call the region home. Our fellow Americans in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa, for them, this measure recognizes that they are a critical part of our Nation’s fabric. Indeed, when North Korea threatened to launch missiles at a U.S. territory, it said that it would hit Guam. We cannot forget about these Pacific territories and, in Congress, we have an obligation to make sure that their voices are heard in these Halls. This resolution also specifically encourages continued support for the Compacts of Free Association which we currently have with the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau. Currently, the United States provides, under these compacts, essential governmental functions, including defense. While our compact with Palau was recently renewed, the Compacts of Free Association with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands will expire in 2023. We in Congress should not wait. We should ensure that the compacts are expeditiously renewed. These arrangements not only help encourage the development of Palau, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands, but also serve our core national security interests. I know firsthand that we cannot take our Pacific partnerships for granted— not just in the compact states, but across the region, because other states around the region are facing entreaties from the Chinese Government. The Chinese Government states that the Pacific Islands are a core component of their One Belt, One Road initiative, which seeks to ensnare small nations into Beijing’s debt traps. We know that China is stepping up its military involvement in the region, recently placing acoustic sensors in the Mariana Trench to track American submarine movements. As the resolution recognizes, the solution to this challenge is for the U.S. to strengthen its engagement. We must ‘‘increase the frequency of highlevel bilateral and multilateral visits with leaders of Pacific Islands’’ and find issues to work on in common. For example, many of the Pacific Island nations face an existential threat from rising sea levels. Accordingly, this resolution calls for us to work with these countries to address the negative impacts of climate change. Many of the territories or islands of these countries actually face submersion as a result of rising sea levels. In doing so, we would work with our partners around the world. While China employs bully tactics to unilaterally assert itself in the Pacific, the United States sets an example by working closely with the island nations and with Australia and New Zealand to promote sustainable development across the region. I want to thank Representative BORDALLO again for her leadership on this issue. This resolution is an overdue affirmation of our commitment to the prosperity of the American territories in the Pacific and to the strengthening of the relationships between the United States and the nations of the region. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to again thank Congresswoman BORDALLO for introducing this resolution. American engagement in the Pacific Islands region is critical to our strategic posture in the Western Pacific. With its passage, we reaffirm our commitment to the islands. I support this resolution, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, with the shifting strategic environment of the South Pacific, it is really more important than ever that we engage Pacific Island nations and the Pacific Islands Forum to solve regional problems and to promote prosperity. We must maintain support for the Compacts of Free Association which enhance the strategic posture of the U.S. and the Western Pacific, which also reinforce our regional commitment and preempt potential adversaries from establishing positional advantage there. This resolution signals our resolve to maintain and deepen our collaboration with our friends and allies in the Pacific Islands and territories. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 1157. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CONDEMNING THE ASSAD REGIME AND ITS BACKERS FOR THEIR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN SYRIA Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1165) condemning the Assad regime and its backers for their continued support of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this resolution represents a broad bipartisan agreement that there will be no peace in Syria as long as the Assad regime remains in power and as long as Russia and Iran continue their entrenchment in that country. For 7 years, the world has watched the brutal dictator, Bashar alAssad, inflict untold suffering on the Syrian people. Since the beginning of the conflict, half a million people have been killed and 13 million, largely women and children, remain in dire need of basic humanitarian assistance in Syria. The brutal Assad regime continues its onslaught on the civilian population in Syria, aided by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the ground and the Russian Air Force in the sky. Rather than working to eject Iran from Syria, Russia has been directly coordinating with Hezbollah, with the IRGC, and with other Iranianbacked militias that have expanded significantly throughout Syria. b1515 Russia has even now reportedly transferred the S–300 surfacetoair missile system to Syria, giving these militias additional cover for their activities in Syria. Despite signing a deescalation agreement with President Trump last year 
promising a ceasefire in southern Syria, Russia directly assisted Iranian backed militias in their takeover of southern Syria, moving these militias right up to the border with Israel. This resolution makes clear that it is unrealistic to believe that Russia will ever be a reliable partner to counter the Iranian presence in Syria. As Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has stated so clearly: 
It’s unlikely Russia has the will or capability to fully implement and counter Iranian decision and influence in Syria. 
This resolution also states that Iranianbacked militias should be investigated for the war crime of sectarian cleansing for their forced displacement of civilians in the Damascus suburbs, which has included demolishing civilian areas, implementing brutal sieges, and selling housing developments and then turning them over, once they have been occupied by these militias, to Iranianbacked militias, including Hezbollah. Finally, this resolution calls for the administration to act quickly to develop a strategy towards a political transition in Syria where the Assad regime leaves power and all Iranian and Russian forces leave the country. The Assad regime’s atrocities, which include the use of chemical weapons, barrel bombs, and brutal sieges, helped create the conditions whereby ISIS emerged in the first place. The regime’s continued survival, along with the Iranian influence in Syria, will only perpetuate the cycle of violence, once again creating the conditions for the reemergence of ISIS or alQaida and other radical Islamist groups. After 7 years of horror, U.S. policy in Syria should be guided by this key reality: there is no solution to the conflict in Syria as long as the brutal Assad regime remains in power. Efforts to legitimatize the regime through socalled constitutional reform negotiations or in allowing Assad to run in elections are unrealistic and are doomed to fail. Mr. Speaker, lastly, I want to thank my colleague and friend, the ranking member of this committee, Mr. ENGEL , for his efforts over the years in order to try to focus our attention. From the beginning, when this process of people protesting in Damascus began with people walking through the street saying, ‘‘Peaceful, peaceful,’’ and we watched on CNN as the automatic weapons of Assad’s forces opened up on those peaceful protesters, from that day on, Mr. ENGEL worked to try to get engagement and to head off some of this crisis, the magnitude of which we deal with today as a result of the Iranian militias. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. MAST of Florida, who authored this measure, and I want to, again, extend my thanks to Chairman ROYCE , particularly for his very kind and generous words. We have worked for the last several years, so many years, on the Foreign Affairs Committee to try to bring peace to Syria. We have been frustrated in watching the dictator kill hundreds of thousands of his own people, innocent men, women, and children. I think one of the most horrific days that I have ever spent in Washington was when we had Caesar, the photographer who was part of the regime but defected and escaped with his pictures of genocide and pictures of unbearable, unthinkable atrocities that kind of scarred my brain forever, and I know the same goes for the chairman. We will never forget it. And we will keep trying to fight for the people of Syria and try to bring the dictator and the people who allow him to do these horrific things to justice. It has been very difficult, because the Russians have embraced Assad, but it is absolutely disgraceful. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. ROYCE for his kind words. He has said a lot of things about what I did, but it couldn’t have possibly been done without him as the chairman working side by side, the two of us, pushing these important issues, and Syria has certainly been a situation that needed our attention. I just regret that we weren’t able to do more to stop the slaughter in Syria, but I want to thank Chairman ROYCE , who has just been fantastic in terms of having a moral compass to say that what is going on should not stand and calling attention to the atrocities. So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE and Mr. M AST. Mr. Speaker, the crisis in Syria has gone on for far too long, a civil war that has killed at least half a million people, displaced more than 11 million Syrians, and stoked instability and extremism well beyond Syria’s borders. Iran and alQaida are on Israel’s doorstep; refugees have overwhelmed Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan; and the human suffering inside Syria is still unimaginable. Just 2 weeks ago, an American family learned the tragic news that their daughter was tortured and killed in Assad’s prison. Leila was one of thousands of cases of enforced disappearance in Syria. The Assad regime has had plenty of help, as this resolution points out. The Syrian regime was on the ropes earlier in the conflict when Iran sent thousands of fighters to defend its ally, Bashar alAssad. Iranianbacked Hezbollah has been battle hardened, gaining fighting experience in Syria, displacing communities wholesale, and remaking Syrian society in their image. The Russian Government came in to save the Assad regime when they again seemed to be losing the war, and the Russians sent fighter jets to target civilian populations and infrastructure, hospitals, schools, markets. We have heard from Syrian doctors who were delivering babies as air strikes threatened them from above, and then when civilian defense workers, the White Helmets showed up to clear the rubble, Russian bombs targeted the emergency workers, too. That is just shameful. And it is not over. Idlib, a city of 2 million people, many of whom fled other conflict zones, is now under threat of annihilation. Truth be told, terrorists have a strong presence there, emboldened by the war crimes of the Syrian regime and their allies. As Assad seeks to consolidate power and territory, millions of innocent people stand in the crosshairs. There is no military solution to this conflict. Assad may believe that he can bomb his way out of this, but the regime’s presence will continue to be a magnet for extremists. Iran’s permanent presence in Syria will only lead to further instability. And let me be very clear: we cannot and should not rely on Russian assurances to remove Iran from Syria. You know the old adage, ‘‘Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.’’ The only thing that the Russians can be trusted to do in Syria is foment further instability on behalf of the regime. This resolution comes at a critical time. It calls on the administration to work toward a political solution to this conflict and it seeks to build American leverage in negotiations by opposing international reconstruction funds that would support projects in Assad controlled territory. Lastly, I want to thank the many SyrianAmerican groups, which I have worked closely with, who have been doing whatever they can possibly do to stop the carnage and the evilness of the Assad regime. I will be continuing to work with the SyrianAmerican groups. Hopefully we can one day restore freedom and democracy to that beleaguered land. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their leadership in bringing this bipartisan measure to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I also want to especially thank the author of this important resolution, my Florida colleague, BRIAN MAST, for his efforts in calling attention to the bloody Assad regime. What a highly valued member Mr. MASTis to our committee and to this institution. He is an American hero and an American treasure. There is no one more responsible for what is going on in Syria, as Mr. MAST 
has pointed out in his resolution, than Bashar alAssad. Who is the one responsible for this massacre of his own people? AlAssad. Assad brutally repressed peaceful Syrians who were demanding change in their country. Assad unleashed thousands of terrorists from the prisons into Iraq in 2003, helping to create the precursor to ISIS, and he did so again during the Syrian protests of 2011, leading to the founding and growth of ISIS. And Assad, with his brutal and insidious tactics, is responsible for the hundreds of thousands of murders, for war crimes, for crimes against humanity. He continues to be responsible for the daily terror occurring in Syria to this day. Bashar alAssad is the one responsible. This is not a man who can lead a country. So we must use every tool at our disposal to put pressure on Assad and his backers, including pressure on Iran, pressure on Russia. They are the ones who are backing him. We have got to pass my good friend Mr. ENGEL ’s bill, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, and the bill that he puts forth with Mr. ROYCE , the No Assistance for Assad Act. These are important bills, and they are still pending in the Senate, as all good bills go, pending in the Senate. We must ensure that Assad is not allowed to participate in any future election in Syria. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. MASTof Florida, for authoring this important resolution. I urge all of my colleagues to give it their support. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the author of this bill. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE for yielding me the time and for his continued leadership on this critical issue. It has been an honor to serve with him and to learn from him. Absolutely, I couldn’t say that more seriously. It has been an honor. Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of H. Res. 1165. It is a resolution condemning the Assad regime and its backers, including Iran and Russia, for their continued support of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. Now, after 7 years of war, as was already mentioned, the deaths of more than half a million people have occurred. Now, let’s do a little bit of math on that. That would be over 70,000 people each year. When you think of the march of killing each and every day, that is a government march by the Assad regime of killing over 200 people every single day of the year. The atrocities of the Assad regime are still ongoing with the help of Russia and Iran. And what do these atrocities look like: burning individuals to death, having them buried under rubble, having an adult put a 7.62 Kalashnikov round into a child, the use of chemical devices. The United States must push for an end to this and must push to hold these perpetrators accountable. Currently, Iran is estimated to have deployed over 3,000 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps soldiers into the area. Iran is also responsible for directing Hezbollah and other militia fighters to battle on behalf of the regime. Should Iran be allowed to maintain a permanent military presence in Syria, it will pose an even greater threat to Israel, to Jordan, and to all United States interests in the region. This resolution calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to work towards a sustainable political transition in Syria and a strategy to stop a permanent Iranian presence in the region. b1530 The resolution also condemns the Russian Federation, which has deployed more than 68,000 Russian personnel, for their continued support of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. H. Res. 1165 reiterates Congress’ opposition to U.S. assistance to governmentcontrolled areas in Syria. Mr. Speaker, the United States must continue to work with our partners to condemn the Assad regime’s horrific abuses against the Syrian people and counter Iran and Russia’s malign influence in the region. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical resolution. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1165, condemning the Assad regime and its backers for their continued support of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria: nearly half a million Syrians killed, 14 million Syrians displaced, and countless acts of atrocities from the Assad regime supported by its backers in Iran and in Russia. Clearly, it is right that Congress takes this step and acts. This resolution urges a political solution to this conflict, to ensure the Assad regime cannot use the air to target its own civilians. This resolution brings muchneeded attention to the atrocities of this regime, which is responsible for horrific crimes, again, against its own people. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their hard work and advocacy for this resolution that seeks to hold this regime accountable, and I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation. It shines a bright light on what is happening in Syria and the crimes committed by the Assad regime, along with its backers in Russia and in Iran. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this resolution, and, again, I thank my colleagues for their work on this effort. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for more than 7 years, the butcher of Syria has been slaughtering his own people. This relentless mass murderer has left half a million dead and millions others displaced. He has bombed, gassed, gunned down, and executed the Syrian people. He is, obviously, the Satan of Syria. After the horrors of World War II, we were supposed to have rid the world of such evil, but, for years, we have shamefully watched it unfold. Mr. Speaker, it has always been crystal clear who is responsible. The criminal butcher, the barbarian, Bashar al Assad and his Russian and Iranian outlaws have turned the cradle of civilization into ashes. Russian and Syrian warplanes have laid waste to Syrian towns, hospitals, and aid convoys from the air. On the ground, thousands of Iranianbacked militiamen have waged a campaign of outright sectarian cleansing. These militias are the wicked arm of the IRGC and the Ayatollah of Iran. These militias are one of the most dangerous aspects of this chaotic war. They not only kill innocents today, but they kill any hope for a future Syria by sowing deep divisions along sectarian lines. The time is well past that they are all called to be accountable. That is why I introduced legislation more than a year ago calling on the State Department to designate some of these Iraniansupported militias as terrorists. I am pleased this resolution also calls for these groups to be designated as such. These killers must meet justice for the crimes they have committed against the people of the world. I congratulate Mr. MASTon bringing this to the House floor. I also thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their tenacious efforts in making sure the American people understand what is taking place throughout the world. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me say that this resolution reminds us of the importance of building leverage as we push for an end to the crisis in Syria. We can and we should do more to increase that leverage. Congress, as Chairman ROYCE mentioned before, could do so today by passing the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, my legislation to pressure the Assad regime to stop the violence, to sit down and negotiate an end to this conflict. It really breaks my heart that it is being held in the other body, and we are hoping, before the end of the year, that we can shake it loose. It had tremendous support in this Chamber, bipartisan support, support on both sides 
of the aisle. The House passed it twice; the administration strongly supports it; and the Syrian people desperately need it. The clock is running out in the other body, with one single Member opposing it. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Caesar bill and the resolution before us today, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I thank my colleagues, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. ENGEL ; Major BRIAN MASTof Florida; as well as the leadership on both sides of the aisle, for their bipartisan work on this resolution. The Syrian people deserve a government that respects basic human rights and a government that is free of Iranianbacked militias. As long as the Assad regime remains in power, this will not be the case. The administration needs to develop a strategy toward a sustainable political transition in Syria and to prevent Iranian entrenchment, recognizing that Russia has not been a reliable partner in either effort. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to back this resolution to once again condemn the Assad regime, Russia, and Iran for their unspeakable crimes against the Syrian people, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 1165. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EXPRESSING OPPOSITION TO THE COMPLETION OF NORD STREAM II Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1035) expressing opposition to the completion of Nord Stream II, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, for many years, Russia has conducted a campaign of armed aggression and intimidation against many neighboring countries, but especially Ukraine and Georgia. That threat now includes massive Russian military exercises along the border of our NATO allies and repeated intrusions into the air and sea space of these and other countries in Europe. But Vladimir Putin is also employing more subtle weapons of influence. This includes leveraging energy exports, especially oil and natural gas. Many European countries, including key NATO allies, are dependent on Russian energy and, thus, are vulnerable to Moscow’s pressure. But even as the United States, its NATO allies, and other partners are seeking to impose economic costs on Russia to force it to end its aggression, a massive new pipeline known as Nord Stream II is being built. It will increase the flow of Russian gas directly to Germany and on to other countries in the heart of Europe. Moscow’s strategy is to undermine the energy security of our NATO allies, because the more dependent they are on Russian energy, the greater Moscow’s influence over them will be. Nord Stream II has another purpose, which is to strike at Ukraine. It will end Moscow’s reliance on Ukraine’s natural gas pipelines, thereby cutting off an important source of revenue and eliminating one of Ukraine’s few means of leverage against Russian aggression. H.R. 3364, the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which I introduced and was passed overwhelmingly by Congress, authorizes the President to impose sanctions on persons assisting the construction of this and other pipelines. This resolution recognizes the danger that Nord Stream II represents to the Atlantic alliance and urges the President to use the authority Congress has given him to prevent this pipeline from being constructed. If Nord Stream II is completed, it will undermine U.S. interests in Europe by rendering key NATO allies more vulnerable to Russian blackmail and convincing Moscow that its policy of aggression is, in fact, succeeding. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) control the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CONAWAY of Texas for authoring this resolution, and, again, I thank Chairman ROYCE . Mr. Speaker, in Europe’s far eastern reaches, construction has begun on a new pipeline to move natural gas, the Nord Stream II. If this project reaches completion, it will represent much more than a way to move fuel from point A to point B. It will, in fact, be a new tool for Russia to interfere in European politics, to pit ally against ally and neighbor against neighbor, to put down deeper roots in the heart of the European Union, and to weaken efforts to confront Russia for a range of aggressive behaviors. Russia has already shown the way it uses its gas resources as a weapon, choking off supplies to Ukraine and inflating prices. If the Nord Stream II 
goes forward, this dangerous practice could increase a hundredfold. We want to see a Europe that has access to a range of energy sources. The last thing European countries should do is become more dependent on Russian gas. There are plenty of other options, whether from the Caspian basin or from right here in the United States. This measure calls on European governments to reject this clear threat to stability and security. It is an appeal to our allies not to allow Russia another avenue to undermine European unity and involve itself in European politics. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ), the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and the author of this measure. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I thank the ranking member for bringing forth this resolution that I cosponsored. Mr. Speaker, Nord Stream II is an underwater gas pipeline that, if completed, will transport natural gas from the Russian Federation—Russian gas— through the Baltic Sea to Germany. This project may seem innocent enough, but it does several very dangerous things. One, it circumvents Ukraine, and the impact it has there. Two, it further dominates the European energy supply. Three, it will threaten European security and stability. And, four, it attempts to drive a wedge between NATO allies. This project is being sold to our European allies and partners as many things. They are being told, and we are being told, that the current routes lack transit capacity to meet the demand in Western Europe. Mr. Speaker, this is false. There is a 55 billion cubic meter surplus in transit lines existing currently through Ukraine that Nord Stream II plans to completely circumvent, which is the capacity of the Nord Stream II. b1545 In other words, Mr. Speaker, Russia is working to strangle Ukraine’s existing pipeline. Once Nord Stream II reaches its planned terminus in Germany, it is to move southward away from Western markets and back into existing lines. Mr. Speaker, the impact that that will have on the Ukraine pipeline is that, if it goes empty, then it will cease to exist and cease to operate. The argument that if Russia tried to use Nord Stream II as some leverage they could revert back to using the gas going through Ukraine lines is simply false and is misleading. We are also being told that the pipeline will reduce gas prices in Europe. This also is false. Nord Stream II circumvents market competitors and further reinforces Russia’s dominance in the market, essentially creating zero incentive to lower energy prices. We are also being told that Nord Stream II is a commercial deal with zero geopolitical impact. Compared to Nord Stream I, which is owned by a variety of stakeholders from Western Europe, Nord Stream II is 100 percent Russian owned and operated through Gazprom, which is controlled by the Russian state, i.e., Vladimir Putin, who is known to pursue political goals and whose chairman, Alexey Miller, is currently sanctioned by the United States. Mr. Speaker, the handwriting is on the wall. It could not be clearer, and we can no longer kid ourselves what Nord Stream II is and what it is not. It will provide greater latitude for the Russians to continue defiance of global norms, sovereign borders, and international law. The project is simply another tool for Vladimir Putin to wield in Russia’s everincreasing aggressive and subversive activities against the West. Mr. Speaker, Nord Stream II is a danger to peace as we know it. Our German and NATO colleagues should see clearly what it is. It allows Vladimir Putin to have an additional place to put his boot on the jugular of Europe. Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for this resolution. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, Russia is already enough of a problem for our European friends. Putin’s efforts to undermine democracy and stoke instability are a constant threat to European peace and unity. In 6 months’ time, Russia could have another way to exert even more leverage on Europe, and that is if its development of the Nord Stream II pipeline goes forward. Today we are going on record to say that that is a terrible idea, and we hope our allies and partners in Europe see it the same way. So I again thank the authors of this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Nord Stream II is energy blackmail. If completed, it will make our European allies more dependent on Russian gas to meet their energy needs. For three decades, Russia has used its abundant energy supplies to coerce European neighbors into doing its bidding. Europe, lacking natural gas reserves of its own, once had little choice in energy providers, allowing the Kremlin to block the flow of gas if Europe was opposing its interests. In fact, I was in Ukraine in 2009 when the Russians turned off the gas in Ukraine, and it was cold. People died. It is blackmail since they are a monopoly on European natural gas. This includes forcing Europe’s silence over Russia’s illegal aggression in not only Ukraine, but Georgia and Crimea as well. Today, Europe has other options, however. American natural gas is increasingly available on the global market thanks to the advances in technology. In 2019, the United States’ LNG exports are expected to surge by almost 80 percent. In Texas, Mr. Speaker, we have more natural gas than we ever had and more than we need. We should use all we can, and then we should sell the rest to the Europeans. Across Europe, more LNG terminals are coming online and allowing more American natural gas to reach the European market. Even Germany has pledged to build a new LNG terminal as a result of President Trump’s push to renew the transatlantic trade relationship. With the expanding availability of U.S. natural gas, Europe can and should say ‘‘no’’ to Nord Stream II. Vladimir Putin, the Napoleon of Siberia, cannot be trusted to be a fair trading partner. His recent aggression in Ukraine demonstrates Russia is a threat and not a friend. We must pass this resolution and send a message to our European allies that Nord Stream II is a bad idea. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. CONAWAY , for bringing this resolution, and I also want to thank the ranking member and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for their support. And that is just the way it is. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, Russia’s ongoing aggression has taken many forms, from outright invasion and annexation of territory in Ukraine to cyberattacks and other assaults against the U.S. and our NATO allies. One of the most powerful weapons in its armory is its export of energy, especially oil and gas. The Nord Stream II pipeline from Russia to Germany will hand Moscow another source of influence to wield against our NATO allies and Ukraine. The result will be to undermine Europe’s energy security and perhaps the will to resist Russian aggression. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for this resolution and urge the President to use all of the means at his disposal to prevent this pipeline from being constructed. Only then can U.S. interests in Europe, including the integrity of the NATO alliance, be made secure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 1035, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WITH RESPECT TO UKRAINE Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1162) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to Ukraine, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman ROYCE and esteemed Ranking Member ENGEL for their swift action in putting this important and timely resolution together in support of the people of Ukraine. For far too long, we have witnessed Putin’s increased aggression against Ukraine, directing and arming separatist forces on Ukraine soil and forcibly occupying and annexing the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. More recently, Russian forces were firing upon, ramming, and seizing Ukrainian vessels and crews attempting to pass through the Kerch Strait, in clear violation of international norms and agreements. The 2014 destruction of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 that killed close to 300 people also demonstrated the threat to civilians in this conflict. Until this day, Putin continues to deny any responsibility for that heinous act. Meanwhile, thousands of Ukrainians continue to be killed fighting for their basic freedoms that we as Americans hold dear, while hundreds of thousands flee looking for a safe haven. Mr. Speaker, Putin’s actions are simply unacceptable, and the United States and our allies must stand strong against Russia. That is why this resolution is so important. We must make it clear that we truly support the people of Ukraine and their aspirations for a free and democratic society. For that, it is crucial that the United States provides the kind of assistance—politically, militarily, and economically—that will allow Ukraine to fight Russia’s increasing coercion. We must also use all of the tools at our disposal, because these are not isolated issues, to ensure that Putin and his regime pay a heavy price for Russia’s aggression. Through this resolution and other measures, we can demonstrate to Putin and the world that we are paying close attention, that we will continue to support the people of Ukraine and do what is necessary to protect Ukraine and other countries threatened by his imperial ambitions, and to ensure that they can live in peace and live in security. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure to condemn Putin’s despotic rule, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me start by thanking Chairman ROYCE for bringing this measure forward. He and I introduced this resolution a few weeks ago after the latest flareup of Russian aggression in Ukraine. I also want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida, who has always, through the years, time and time again, been standing up with us for what is right and really showing a great moral compass. I am glad that, as we wrap up this Congress and as Chairman ROYCE wraps up a distinguished career as a Member of the House, we are again working together, working across the aisle with a bipartisan commitment to American leadership and American values. That has been the hallmark of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the 6 years Mr. ROYCE has been chairman and I have been ranking member. I am grateful that we are going out of this Congress on the same, positive, good note. Mr. Speaker, this measure is another opportunity for the House to go on record condemning the aggressive and destructive behavior of Russia under Vladimir Putin. Russia had shredded international norms and laws with its illegal occupation of Crimea, its violent campaign in eastern Ukraine, the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17, and Russia’s ceaseless shirking of its obligations under the Minsk II peace agreement, all at a cost of thousands of lives. Most recently, Russia has blockaded the Kerch Strait and militarized the Sea of Azov. A few weeks ago, Russian forces fired on Ukrainian vessels attempting to pass through the strait, ultimately seizing the vessels and their crews as well. What is remarkable about this latest action, Mr. Speaker, is just how brazen it is. Typically, Putin has always made sure that there is some veil of deniability over his dirty work so that he can say up is down and cast blame somewhere else. But this time, Russian forces are operating out in the open. It is almost as though Putin thinks he can turn the international order on its head and there won’t be any consequences. I cannot imagine where he got that idea. My measure that we are now considering says that Russia’s latest aggression cannot stand. It calls upon the 
Kremlin to immediately return the captured vessels and crews and to end its violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. It reaffirms our support for Ukrainian independence, democracy, and prosperity, and it calls on the Trump administration to hold Russia accountable, to make sure there will be consequences for this sort of behavior. We hope the administration hears us and acts accordingly, and we hope the people of Ukraine and the thugs running Russia hear us and know that Congress won’t stay silent in the face of Moscow’s outrageous behavior. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), who has been a Member of this House for many years and has done wonderful work. (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) b1600 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I will start first by applauding the leadership of this committee: Mr. ROYCE , who has worked so hard, and the gentlewoman from Florida. We went to Bosnia together some years ago, and they have worked so closely with Mr. ENGEL . I think it really demonstrates what can be done when people work together. The Congressional Ukraine Caucus cochairs—Representatives MARCY KAPTUR, ANDYHARRIS , BRIAN FITZPATRICK , and I—issued this statement rebuking the Russian Federation’s aggressive attack on Ukraine near the Kerch Strait in the Sea of Azov: ‘‘As cochairs of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, we strongly condemn Russia’s dangerous naval assault on Ukrainian ships. This episode, as well as Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports, is a deeply disturbing sign of continued Russian aggression in its efforts to tighten its bloody grip and illegitimate occupation of the Crimean peninsula. ‘‘We join the international committee and our NATO allies in resolute affirmation of the fact that Crimea and its surrounding waters belong to Ukraine. We call on Russian authorities, in accordance with international law, to cease any and all interference with access to Ukrainian ports and the Azov Sea. Russia must end this bloody and unjust occupation of Ukrainian sovereign territory.’’ I was in Ukraine at the time of the Russian attack. I was at meetings where the President of Ukraine spoke out clearly against the Russian action on behalf of the people of Ukraine. He also spoke out on what was the main aim of Russia’s military actions: to undermine Ukraine’s efforts to build democracy. Today, there is a dangerous tilt to authoritarianism in many places around the world. This makes Ukraine’s struggle to resist aggression, safeguard its independence, and develop democracy all the more important. Ukraine has witnessed firsthand that the challenges of democracy are not easily overcome. That makes it all the more important to overcome the threats to democracy, such as injustice and corruption. The United States must support Ukraine in its efforts. We must deepen our determination to help the fight for freedom and democracy, never making heroes out of dictators. That is what this resolution is all about. May it pass unanimously. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ENGEL and thank my pal from Florida for their work. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ), who is our esteemed chairman of our Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, last month’s Russian attack on Ukrainian vessels attempting to pass through the Kerch Strait is a dramatic reminder of Vladimir Putin’s continued aggression. This was not an isolated incident. Russia has opened a new front in the Sea of Azov, where it is attempting to choke off Ukrainian imports and exports and greatly undermine Ukraine’s economy. This is a dangerous escalation. In the past, Moscow has attempted to disguise its armed intervention in Ukraine by claiming that its troops and weapons in the eastern regions belong to the separatist entities there. Now let me share with you, Mr. Speaker, the reality that, in the east, there is Russian armor. ELIOT ENGEL  and I traveled to Dnipropetrovsk in the east, in the Russianspeaking east of Ukraine, with a delegation of four Republicans and four Democrats. We traveled in order to talk to those who were trying to deal with the fact that Russian military was rolling over provinces in Ukraine. But now Russia is openly using its own military against Ukraine in the territory of Crimea that it has illegally occupied and annexed. They are using the fleet. The United States and its allies and partners must hold Russia accountable. Failure to do so may be interpreted by Moscow as a green light to go even further, a miscalculation that could result in a dangerous military escalation. This resolution sends two messages. The first is to the Ukrainian people, to demonstrate that we remain committed in assisting them in their fight for freedom. The second, of course, is to Moscow, to make clear that the U.S. will oppose Russian aggression whenever it occurs. I urge the President to ensure, by his words and actions, that Moscow understands the potential consequences of its actions and the commitment of the United States to the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I am worried that Vladimir Putin is becoming emboldened because he has faced no real consequences for his ongoing violations of international law. I am glad we are considering this resolution today, saying that he should face consequences. I wish we had more time in this Congress to work on legislation that could make those consequences real. I am committed to staying focused on this issue when we come back in January. For now, I am glad we are sending this message, and I am glad to stand shoulder to shoulder as I have so many times over the past 6 years with my friend, EDROYCE , as we pass this measure. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN . I ask all Members to support this, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, Ukraine remains under assault from Moscow, which is betting that the West is tiring of the struggle and that it is free now to expand its aggression. Silence on our part at this critical moment invites miscalculation and an escalation of the conflict. We must demonstrate by our words and actions that we remain fully committed to assisting the people of Ukraine to defend their country, including by providing them with the weapons they need to defeat Russia’s continuing aggression. A slap on the wrist at this point will not restrain Putin and may guarantee the expansion of hostilities that we hope to avoid. We strongly encourage the President to use the authority that Congress has provided to impose sanctions on Russia and to take action to make clear that we remain committed to the sovereignty of the Ukrainian people and a Ukraine that is whole and free. I want to thank my colleague from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) for authoring this very important measure and, most importantly, for his consistent leadership on Ukraine. At the end of my service in this body, I thank him for the many years of friendship and cooperation as we worked together to promote the interests and the values of the American people around the world. It has been a real joy, and I thank Mr. ENGEL for sharing that ride with me. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 1162. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NICARAGUAN INVESTMENT CONDITIONALITY ACT (NICA) OF 2017 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 1918) to oppose loans at international financial institutions for the Government of Nicaragua unless the Government of Nicaragua is taking effective steps to hold free, fair, and transparent elections, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the Senate amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: 
The provisions of this Act (other than section 9) shall terminate on December 31, 2023. 
Mr. ROYCE of California (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SANCTIONING HIZBALLAH’S ILLICIT USE OF CIVILIANS AS DEFENSELESS SHIELDS ACT Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 3342) to impose sanctions on foreign persons that are responsible for gross violations of internationally recognized human rights by reason of the use by Hizballah of civilians as human shields, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendments thereto, and concur in the Senate amendments. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the Senate amendments. The Clerk read as follows: Senate amendments: Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sanctioning the Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act’’.

The text of the resolution is as follows: H. R ES. 931 Whereas 2017–2018 marks the 85th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine of 1932–1933, known as the Holodomor; Whereas in 1932 and 1933, millions of Ukrainian people perished at the will of the totalitarian Stalinist government of the former Soviet Union, which perpetrated a premeditated famine in Ukraine in an effort to break the nation’s resistance to collectivization and communist occupation; Whereas the Soviet Government deliberately confiscated grain harvests and starved millions of Ukrainian men, women, and children by a policy of forced collectivization that sought to destroy the nationally conscious movement for independence; Whereas Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin ordered the borders of Ukraine sealed to prevent anyone from escaping the manmade starvation and to prevent the delivery of any international food aid that would provide relief to the starving; Whereas numerous scholars worldwide have worked to uncover the scale of the famine, including Canadian wheat expert Andrew Cairns, who visited Ukraine in 1932 and was told that there was no grain ‘‘because the government had collected so much grain and exported it to England and Italy’’, while Joseph Stalin simultaneously denied food aid to the people of Ukraine; Whereas nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s rural population perished or were forced into exile due to the induced starvation, and the entire country suffered from the consequences of the prolonged famine; Whereas noted correspondents of the time were refuted for their courage in depicting and reporting on the forced famine in Ukraine, including Gareth Jones, William Henry Chamberlin, and Malcolm Muggeridge, who wrote, ‘‘They (the peasants) will tell you that many have already died of famine and that many are dying every day; that thousands have been shot by the government and hundreds of thousands exiled . . .’’; Whereas title V of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1986 (Public Law 99–180; 99 Stat. 1157), signed into law on December 13, 1985, established the Commission on the Ukraine Famine to ‘‘conduct a study of the Ukrainian Famine of 1932–1933 in order to expand the world’s knowledge of the famine and provide the American public with a better understanding of the Soviet system by revealing the Soviet role’’ in it; Whereas with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, archival documents became available

His poetry challenges society to improve lives. His spoken word and his written word are full of power that exceeds his 24 years of age. In a piece of prose, titled, ‘‘Between Lines,’’ Rashad writes: ‘‘As a poet, it feels like the souls of black folks fire through my lips.’’ He speaks truth through art and helps elevate everyone who listens. I am proud to honor a man whose creativity and passion pull people into poetry. Poet laureate Rashad Wright’s story is just the beginning. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Rashad for his accomplishments. b1715 HONORING WREATHS ACROSS AMERICA (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, one of our finest holiday traditions will take place this Saturday: Wreaths Across America. Many Americans can recall the iconic photograph of wreaths on the tombstones at Arlington National Cemetery. Snow blankets the ground, red ribbons adorn the wreaths that lay on the rows of tombstones as far as the eye can see. This annual tribute began in 1992 by a Maine wreath maker named Morrill Worcester, who donated 5,000 wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery in honor of our fallen heroes. Today, Wreaths Across America has grown into a national organization. A total of 1.2 million wreaths were placed on markers across the country last year in more than 1,400 locations, with more than 200,000 at Arlington alone. The mission is to remember, honor, and teach. As we celebrate with our loved ones, let us remember all of our military men and women, especially those we have lost in service to this Nation. Thank you to Morrill and to all the volunteers who honor their memory. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of our troops serving at home and overseas and wish them a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. f

Coach Mark Krikorian’s work and relationship with his players speaks volumes to the work they have been able to accomplish and to develop a program that will continue to produce remarkable results in the future. I hope these young women continue to work hard as they grow to new heights. I encourage them to carry over the same training, mindset, and attitude into all the things that they do here in life. I join my fellow alumni and fans from across the Nation to say congratulations, and go Noles. 
CELEBRATING REVEREND DR. F.N. WILLIAMS’ 90TH BIRTHDAY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE.

This coming Sunday, he will celebrate 90 years of age, but decades in the ministry, Reverend Dr. F.N. Williams, whose father preceded him in the ministry, whose sons have gone on into the ministry. He is a pastor of the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Acres Homes, one of the oldest churches in our State. He is a warrior. He is a fighter for civil rights and civil justice. He was there on the front lines when the Honorable Barbara Jordan was elected and Mickey Leland. But even before that, he was one who would lead the community on addressing their rights and the right to stand against inequality. He was a friend of President George H.W. Bush, who happened to represent Acres Homes before we had the 18th Congressional District, which I represent. They had a relationship. They fought against drugs in that community. And, as well, he believes in education. He believes in young people. He has a church that reaches those who are in need. So tonight, this evening, I am delighted to honor his beloved wife and his family members, but to say to him: I salute you on your 90th birthday. Reverend Dr. F.N. Williams, you are deserving and, yes, you are a great American. 
different things to different folks. Fair means to some folks in Texas where you take the chickens and cattle to on the weekends, to the fair. We have an obligation to uphold the laws as they were intended. And our forefathers didn’t scribble out these amendments in a tavern in Philadelphia after drinking some demon rum many years ago. They were carefully crafted to stand the test of time and make sure that all people—all people— had the power, and not government had the power. We have seen government grow more and more powerful and intrusive in our lives, in our businesses every year. With more and more control over our speech being handed down by the self appointed, selfrighteous speech police, they are running neck and neck with Big Brother that is digging deeper and deeper into our private lives. The Fourth Amendment, unique to America, is sacred, and it is sacred to this country and the Founders who drafted it. Privacy, the right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment should not be forsaken on the false altar of national security. Yes, we can have both: the right of privacy and also national security. As a former judge, I am very concerned about the loss of our Fourth Amendment right of privacy in the United States based on, in my opinion, the unconstitutional actions of the NSA. In the aftermath of 9/11, the government authorized a once secret program by the NSA to collect information on the bad actors, primarily terrorists and foreign agents who wished to create mayhem. They were terrorists overseas. We fought to go after them and get them. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was written to go after terrorists, but it is being used to go after Americans, Mr. Speaker. When I was a judge, I signed lots of warrants when peace officers would bring me a warrant. They would swear out an affidavit of truthfulness, so I would give them a piece of paper, a warrant, to allow them to go arrest or search a premises. That is all based upon the Fourth Amendment in the Constitution. And peace officers did exactly that. But that is not the case for many American citizens anymore. You might ask, well, who is doing this? Is it a criminal organization? Is it a private investigator? Is it Google? No. It is not a nefarious organization operating behind closed doors, and it is not even the Russians, Mr. Speaker. It is the spying eyes of the United States Federal Government. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, I agree; we should go after the terrorists with everything we have got, and our government should use techniques they have on those people who wish to destroy America and find out what those terrorists are doing. But despite the overall intention of the law, the program has been corrupted. Not only does NSA collect information on terrorists, which they should do, but it collects data on ordinary American citizens. What I mean by ‘‘data’’ is not just emails and text messages, but communications and conversations. This, I believe, is in violation of the Constitution. b1730 The government does not use a specific Fourth Amendment warrant, a warrant based upon probable cause for a person—law enforcement—to go and search or arrest someone, but it uses it anyway under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a lesser requirement, and still issues warrants to go and search and seize information. The Fourth Amendment says the warrantless search and seizure is unconstitutional without a probable cause warrant. I don’t see any exceptions there, Mr. Speaker. Our constitutional rights are not selected. They were written to keep big brother—government—in check. The government really doesn’t get to pick and choose which ones they want to follow and which ones they don’t. It sounds like a page out of George Orwell’s novel ‘‘1984’’ where it says: Always eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or bed, no escape. We read ‘‘1984’’ years ago, Mr. Speaker, and we all thought that would never happen. But the government’s ability to seize information, based upon information that is less reliable than the Fourth Amendment requires, and does so in secret I think is a violation of our rights. It is hard to believe this is happening, but we need to wake up and remember this. Remember, Mr. Speaker, the Bill of Rights was intended to protect us from government. People have rights. Government has power. Government has no rights. It has power that they take or we give it to them. But it is the individuals in this country who have rights, including the right of privacy to be secure in our persons and our places and our homes from unlawful searches and seizures. I think government has gotten out of the box because of this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows secret courts to issue secret warrants to law enforcement to go and do things that the person who is having their information seized may know nothing about. It was intended to be used against terrorists, but now it is being used against Americans and seizing that information against Americans. Congresswoman ZOELOFGREN and I cofounded The Fourth Amendment Caucus to protect our privacy. When I was first elected to Congress, they gave me a BlackBerry. That was new technology back then, Mr. Speaker. We could get emails on our phones. I called it a Strawberry. And I can’t tell you how many of those things I have lost all over the world. Now we have smartphones that are smarter than most of us most of the time. While technology continues to change, the Constitution does not change. The rights we have in the Constitution still apply to us today, even with technology. It is the duty of government to balance the interest of protecting Americans, while respecting constitutional rights. So the caucus has fought to protect Americans against warrantless searches and seizures, closing privacy violating surveillance loopholes, and champion reform efforts to protect and restore Fourth Amendment rights. The FISA abuse—the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—allowing secret courts to operate in secret and issue secret warrants against people who never know about it reminds me of the Star Chamber back in merry ole England, that operated in secret and issued secret warrants, all in the name of protecting the Crown, and that is what it seems like we have gotten to. Mr. Speaker, the First Amendment also talks about the right to practice the religion that we wish. The First Amendment states in part that ‘‘Congress’’—of course that is us—‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’’ You notice, Mr. Speaker, the First Amendment doesn’t just give us the right to believe any religion we want to, it gives us the right to practice the religion that we have: the free exercise. And Congress can make no law to prevent that. The freedom to practice one’s own religion is the reason why many of the colonists settled and founded in this great country. Modern revisionist historians don’t want to talk about that, but it is true. One of the primary reasons why people left England and Europe was to seek religious freedom. That is why it is in the First Amendment along with freedom of speech. When Thomas Jefferson, who is the author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote it, he proclaimed that God gives us our rights. He wrote ‘‘that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;’’ and that governments are instituted among men to secure those rights. We get our rights from the almighty. We don’t get our rights from government or the king. Jefferson’s reference to God is echoed throughout this Nation: our currency mentions God; our government buildings have religious scenes and words on them; we pledge allegiance every day in this House Chamber to one Nation under God; we even have the great lawgiver Moses on the far wall looking down directly on the Speaker; and above the flag is the phrase, ‘‘In God We Trust.’’ 
Those who argue we cannot mention God or religion in public government places are looking to destroy the very freedom that our country was founded on. The mention of God in our culture is not an establishment of religion; it is a freedom. Note that the right to practice one’s religion, Mr. Speaker, is a right that we have, as well as the right to believe whatever we wish when it comes to religion. We have this concept in the Declaration of Independence that we are worth something as individuals; that we are worth something as individuals not because government gives us rights, or politicians, or the king, but the Declaration of Independence says that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. The truth is our Constitution says that we are guaranteed freedom of religion, not freedom from religion. I believe, as many Americans do, that America is a special place, a chosen place, an exceptional place, and America is more than just another country on the globe. Throughout our history, we have served as a beacon of light in an often dark world, and one reason is because we say and believe ‘‘In God We Trust.’’ We cannot follow this fundamental principle that sets us apart to be taken away by those who want government to be the highest power of the land. In the end, I do not believe I will ever answer to my government for my time on this Earth, but I do believe I will answer to my God, and the freedom of that choice is what America stands for. Mr. Speaker, as a judge, I saw every imaginable crime. In 22 years on the felony court bench, about 25,000 felony cases worked their way through the courtroom—or the palace of perjury, as I referred to it in those days—everything from stealing to killing and everything in between. One of my first actions in Congress was to establish the bipartisan Congressional Victims’ Rights Caucus, along with Congressman JIMCOSTA  from California, to advocate on behalf of victims in our Nation’s Capital. I am very proud of the work we have done for victims of crime. The consequences of devastating crimes stay with victims for the rest of their lives. I saw victims every day at the courthouse come down there, their lives shattered because of some person committing a crime against them. Many of those victims recover and many do not recover, and they spend the last days of their lives in hopeless despair. So we started that caucus to promote the rights of victims. One such story that affected me personally, and has made its way through my career as a prosecutor and as a judge, was a case I prosecuted a long time ago. Kevin Wanstrath was his name. He was a 14monthold adopted baby. It was his murder, along with the murder of his mother and his father and his grandmother. Four outlaws had plotted to kill all four of them so they could collect the estate and the inheritance. I still have that picture of Kevin Wanstrath that I had on my desk as a prosecutor, on my desk as a judge, and on my desk here in the Rayburn building. I keep it with me to remind me really kind of why we are here: to protect those who cannot protect themselves. Kevin was assassinated, shot in the back of the head, sacrificed on the alter of greed. Fortunately, after a long duration of finding out who committed the crime, the four killers were brought to justice. All were convicted by juries in Texas. Two of them have received the death penalty and have been executed. Kevin was born the same year my son Kurt was born. It is about people. We are in the business here, as Members of Congress, to really help people, help other people in our country. Since that case changed my life, that is one reason why I have been so passionate, as others—JIMCOSTA , for example—in protecting victims of crime. We are not judged by the way we treat the rich folks or important folks. We are judged by the way we treat innocent people: the weak, the unfortunate, the elderly, and the young. Since its inception in 2005, the Victims’ Rights Caucus has taken the lead to protect programs that provide critical support for victim services throughout the Nation, including the Victims of Crime Act. It is called VOCA. What a great concept this was. President Reagan had the idea, Congress passed it, and the VOCA, Victims of Crime Act, does this. When criminals commit crimes, judges have the ability to fine those criminals, along with sending them to the Federal penitentiary, and that money goes into a fund that helps victims of crime. It is called the Victims of Crime Act, and it is a marvelous idea. It is not taxpayer money. Criminals are paying the rent on the courthouse, they are paying for the crimes that they have committed and putting that money into a fund. But every year, Mr. Speaker, Mr. COSTA and I have to fight the bureaucrats in government to let go of that money. Right now, there is about $12 billion in the Victims of Crime Act fund and only about $800,000 of that was used this year to help victims. What happens to the rest of that money? Well, I don’t understand the math, but they use that money as an offset for other government programs, and, therefore, they don’t spend it on crime victims, and I think that is wrong. Enough of the offsets. If the money goes to victims, it ought to be given to the victims. The government ought to keep its hands off of it because it doesn’t belong to the government, and it doesn’t belong to the taxpayers. I hope in the future we will let go of that and that that money goes into a lockbox and it remains always for victims of crimes. Because those Federal judges, God bless them, they are nailing people who violate the law with large fines and fees, and that fund continues to grow every year. Besides the VOCA funds, we have worked on the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA as it is called, and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. The caucus was also instrumental in the enactment of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act in 2006. That bill had to do with the abduction of children and then those children were sexually assaulted throughout the United States. It protects them and makes sure that we keep up with those child predators who roam the streets and byways of our Nation. So we have reauthorized that act this year. We have also passed the Cruise Vessel Safety and Security Act, the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act, the SAFER Act of 2013, and the Victims of Child Abuse Reauthorization Act. All this was bipartisan, Mr. Speaker. All of it was bipartisan. May I ask of the Speaker how much time I have left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 43 minutes remaining. Mr. POE of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We are in the midst of a situation in the United States, and throughout the world, where slavery has crept back into our environment and into our communities, and it is the slave trade of women and children for sexual assault. People don’t want to talk about it, but it is taking place. Unfortunately, my hometown of Houston used to be one of the hubs in the United States. What I am talking about is the buying and selling of people, primarily women and children, on the marketplace of sex slavery. b1745 A lot of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle worked on this very issue to try to get a grip on what is taking place in our country. We had 11 bills in the House that had to do with helping stop this scourge. I was glad to work with C AROLYN  MALONEY from New York. I mean, that is about as bipartisan as you can get, CAROLYN MALONEY , a New York Democrat, and TEDPOE, a Texas Republican. We are separated by common language, but I worked with her, and that is about as bipartisan as you can get. We passed those 11 pieces of legislation. Members of Congress had sponsored several pieces of those. It passed the House overwhelmingly. It went to the Senate, and they combined those 11 pieces into two, sent it back. We passed it, and it became law. President Obama signed it. What it does, this legislation goes after the trafficker, the person who buys and sells women and children, and makes sure that our law punishes those people to the fullest extent. That is why we build prisons, our Federal prisons and our State prisons, 
for people like that. But what it also does, it takes the victims and treats them like victims instead of treating them like criminals. Children are not prostitutes when they are forced into sex slavery. Children can’t be prostitutes. They are victims of crime. So it rescues them and treats them with the dignity they deserve. But it also goes after the buyers, the people who buy those women and children on the marketplace of sex slavery. We make sure that the law goes after those people and punishes them to almost the extent of the trafficker as well. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the progress we have made as a Nation to support victims of crime and crack down on those outlaws that run our streets. There is one piece of legislation that I hope we see passed before I leave Congress on January 2. Megan Rondini was a student. She was from Austin, Texas, and she went off to the University of Alabama. She met a person there at a bar, and they went to his place. He lived in a big mansion, and he sexually assaulted her. She jumped out the window to get away, and she went to the hospital. She wasn’t treated right at the hospital. They botched the sexual exam. The sexual assault kit was botched. She went to the police department— the sheriff’s department, to be specific—and when they found out who the alleged perpetrator was, they backed off and told her that they weren’t going to prosecute him, file charges on him. She went to the university, and the university offered her counseling, but the counselor knew the people involved, the defendant’s family, so the counselor said: I can’t help you. It is a conflict of interest. But no other counselor was provided. She went into deep depression. She withdrew from the University of Alabama, and she went back to Texas and went to SMU for the next semester. She wasn’t at SMU very long at all before she took her own life because the criminal justice system wasn’t justice for her. It failed her. As a result, we have offered bipartisan legislation, Representative JAYAPAL and others, Representative SEWELL . We have offered legislation, the Megan Rondini Sexual Assault Victims Protection Act, which is to make sure that a sexual assault forensic examiner or a sexual assault forensic nurse is available for people like Megan when they show up at a hospital, that universities make sure that they have the right medical exam. Otherwise, we end up with people like Megan who take their own life. That piece of legislation is pending, and I know the Ways and Means Committee and Energy and Commerce Committee are working on that. Hopefully, we can get it to the House floor next week before we recess. Topics like human trafficking, sexual abuse, and domestic violence are topics that we need to discuss to make sure that we can get a grip on it and stop that. Counseling, resources, and shelters are much more readily available to victims of crime than ever before in our history. Human traffickers and those caught buying human trafficking victims can no longer escape the long arm of the law, and that is one of the things I like about the long arm of the law. It can go after those individuals. Of course, our system is not perfect because it is run by people, but it is still the best that we have. The men and women who pledge to protect and serve as our first responders overwhelmingly do so with honor throughout our country. Those who pin the badge over their heart and go out there every day to protect and serve the rest of us always deserve our utmost recognition and respect. As a prosecutor and a judge, I worked with some of Houston’s finest police, as I call them. During my time in Congress, I had the privilege of getting to know the Texas sheriffs along the TexasMexico border. They are a special breed of law officers. I have visited every county along the southern border, from El Paso to the mouth of the Boca Chica at the Gulf of Mexico. It is 1,254 miles from New Orleans to Washington, D.C. That is about the distance of the TexasMexico border. I have held field hearings, flown the Rio Grande with the Texas Air National Guard. I think I may have walked all of those 1,254 miles, including much of it that goes to California from El Paso. I have made several dozen trips down there, and I have traveled the Rio Grande River with our peace officers, in particular, the Texas Department of Public Safety in their fast boats. Down on the border, I have seen the good; I have seen the bad; and I have seen a lot of the ugly. I have met a lot of people on both sides of the border. No matter what our position is on the issue of immigration, our total disregard for border enforcement has cost our State and our Nation tremendously, from the lives lost to the communities on both sides of the border. It has been destroyed by the cartel violence. Mr. Speaker, as you know, the cartels control the southern border. They control the border with Mexico on the southern side. They control what takes place. And they control the violence. We cannot turn a blind eye to the real issues because it is eroding our national security. Border towns on both sides of the border are unique, and the Texas border towns have their own personalities like no others. For some people, they are the lyrics in country songs and stories of college days. Long before a Houston billionaire added the Cadillac Bar to his restaurant empire, it was an institution in Nuevo Laredo that generations of Texans and Mexican families enjoyed together. But now, Nuevo Laredo, across the river from Laredo, is a ghost town, like many other border towns that we share, because the drug cartels control the environment. It seems to me that we haven’t done enough, and border security and immigration must go hand in hand. We must do both, but they are not the same. It is not, nor will it ever be, an eitheror option. We have tried to do all we can in my office to cut the red tape and send more money and boots to the border, and tell the hard, unpopular truth about what is going on in our southern border. Obviously, our Nation needs to secure the border. We are debating that very issue these last 2 weeks we are in session, about whether or not to secure the border. Well, I would think that we should. We cannot afford anything less. A country without borders will cease to be a country at all. Mr. Speaker, I don’t understand why we secure the borders of other countries but we don’t secure our own. I have been to Afghanistan, and we are protecting their border against the bad guys coming in from Pakistan. We have American troops protecting the border of the Koreas and all over the world. We are protecting the borders of a lot of countries, but we don’t protect our own, and I don’t understand why. As a veteran and a son of a World War II veteran, as I mentioned, I think the United States has the greatest military that has ever existed. I have been in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places to see our military. They are the best in the world, no question about it. Second place isn’t even close. We must recognize our military’s contributions, both during service and after our troops come back home. I am proud to represent southeast Texas. I think that is the most patriotic place on the planet. People where I come from, we love the military. We even have parades when the military is on Active Duty and the National Guard or the Reserves come back home. They march down the street. Can you believe that? It is still happening in parts of the country down in southeast Texas. I host a lot of veteran events. My staff, of course, does all the work. One of my favorite events is our annual honorourheroes event. We pick a day that nothing else is going to go on, and it is usually in the summer. We invite veterans and Active Duty military to come to the event. It is a pep rally for our military. We let each one of them come up to the microphone and tell us about their career in the military and try to do it in 60 seconds or less. It is a great honor for them to tell other people about what they did, whether it is World War II or Korea or last week when they got off Active Duty in Afghanistan. The final event that we had just a few months ago was marked by a surprise visitor. Vice President PENCE just 
showed up, walked into the room. Everybody was whooping and hollering when he showed up, showing support for our military. I say all of that to say that we have to continue to support the military, those on Active Duty and those who have served in the past. Some of the legislation I am proud that we have accomplished: EMANUEL  CLEAVER and I worked on bipartisan legislation to establish a commission to build a memorial in Washington, D.C., for all the World War I veterans. There is no memorial for all of the World War I veterans. Here we are, 100 years after the war was over, and there is no memorial. We have one for World War II, as we should. We have one for Vietnam. We have one for Korea. But we don’t have one for the Great War of World War I. We have been working on that for several years. We finally got that passed, and groundbreaking has taken place, and they will build it. It will not take another 100 years before we see it, Mr. Speaker. It will be done soon. My only regret was that my friend, and the last American doughboy, Frank Buckles, Jr., didn’t get to see that happen. Corporal Buckles came up to Washington and went around the House and the Senate, talking about getting that memorial built. He died before the legislation passed. He died at the age of 110. He lied to get into the Army in World War I. He said he was 15. He was probably 14 when he got in and served in World War I. In World War II, he was captured by the Japanese, because he was in the Philippines and he spent 3 years in a prisonerofwar camp. He was a great American. So we owe it to people like that. All of them have died and gone away. Get that memorial built. I thanked Mr. CLEAVER , Congressman CLEAVER —preacher, as I call him—for his support in getting that legislation passed. We have to remember him, Mr. Speaker, because the greatest casualty of war is to be forgotten. I could fill hours talking about the tremendous men and women who serve our country, but I know that you are watching the clock, Mr. Speaker, and I won’t do that. I have also spoken about the Greatest Generation as much as any other topic. I have lamented for those who fought in Vietnam—that is the war of my generation—because of the way they were treated when they came back home. Finally, America is getting to understand that we should honor those men and women who served and welcome them back home as well. There are no words that can come close to express how we should change our opinion of those individuals. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 22 minutes remaining. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee. My district stretches—or used to stretch—all the way to the TexasLouisiana border, where the Speaker is from. Some say that is why I was on the Foreign Affairs Committee, because the Texas border has that other international border with Louisiana. Be that as it may, I am glad that I have been able to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee. But during that service, I have been able to see our men and women in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Europe, the Philippines, and other places throughout the world, and I am impressed with their duty of service. As we know, they are all volunteers. Every one of them is a volunteer. b1800 When men and women join our military now, they know that they are probably going to be in combat somewhere in the world, but yet they continue to volunteer. I can always spot the Texans, though. When I was in Fallujah right after the Marines went in and eliminated Fallujah, I saw a Texas flag flying on the back of a Humvee as it was speeding down one of those streets. Somebody had written on the side of a bombedout building: ‘‘Don’t mess with Texas.’’ I don’t know who did that, but we do have that proud attitude of Texans who serve in the military. The enemy we fight today is not the enemy of the Greatest Generation. Our country is under threat from volatile, nucleararmed rogue nations like we have never seen. We have leaders of foreign nations who are not only untrustworthy, they are outright treacherous, and they want to cause harm in the world. We have little Kim of North Korea, and we have the little man in the sand in Iran. These rulers pose an increasing threat to not only our security, but to everybody throughout the world. They are determined to cause trouble. They are determined to cause terror in the world. As the chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs’ Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, it has been my goal to bring attention to some of the most pressing international threats to our country and global stability. Many of my bills, including legislation that targeted Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran’s proxies—the North Korean regime and incitement taught to kids in Saudi Arabia through Saudi Arabian textbooks—have all been shared security interests of the United States and our besieged Israeli allies. I have authored lots of pieces of legislation, and I am glad to see that many of them have been passed and signed into law. I do believe in America, Mr. Speaker, and I don’t apologize for it. It is the beacon of light for other peoples everywhere. I do believe that all Members of Congress on both sides want what is best for the country. We just disagree sometimes on how to get there. I am convinced of that. One of my greatest honors in being in the House of Representatives is to serve with people from all over the country who are passionate about making sure we make the right decisions on all types of legislation. We do have the freedom to disagree. People ask me what I am going to do when I retire. I don’t know what I am going to do. I haven’t decided. I just know that I am leaving Washington. I have often joked that D.C. stands for the Devil’s city. But I will miss being here, Mr. Speaker. I will miss representing Texas. Since I was elected in 2004, our four kids, Kim, Kara, Kurt, and Kellee, were all single or just recently married. Now, in those 14 years, I have 12 grandkids: Barrett Houston, Shaelyn, Elizabeth, Jackson, Brooklyn, Payton, Hallie, Olivia, Levi, Presley, Rosalyn, and Ivy. Of course, they all have names, Mr. Speaker, but I call them by their birth number, 1 through 12. I just say, ‘‘Twelve or Three, get over here. Six, leave Seven alone.’’ I call them by their birth numbers. You might try that, Mr. Speaker, when you get a little older and have grandkids. I am looking forward to being back in Texas where we have sweet tea. We have bluebonnets that bloom. And football under Friday night lights is the greatest. We have sunsets that are burnt orange. Sorry, Aggies, it is not maroon. For people to understand what I am saying—and people understand mostly what I am saying—there isn’t any doubt in anyone’s mind that Texas is the end all and be all for me, personally. I have had the time of my life sharing the stories of Texas on this floor. I have been through six hurricanes as a Member of Congress: Katrina, Rita, Humberto, Gustav, Ike, and Harvey. I will miss being around Members of Congress. It is an honor to serve the people of Texas in the people’s House, and there are many Members that I could thank. I want to thank them all for working with me. I have told a lot of stories about where I am from, Texas, including my hero William Barret Travis, Sam Houston, remembering the Alamo, and taking you all on our fight of independence in the marshy banks of the San Jacinto where we had folks from Louisiana come and help us out to win the independence of Texas. We are saving, currently, the Battleship Texas, the oldest dreadnought in the world, making sure that it maintains its dignity in the Houston Ship Channel. I have spent a lot of time talking about Judge Roy Bean. It is not true that Judge Roy Bean was my grandfather. Some said that at the courthouse, but he was not. 
Of course, my favorite law enforcement group in the whole world is the Texas Rangers. Above all, it has been an honor to recognize servicemembers from the Second Congressional District who gave their lives for our country while I have been in Congress. In my office here and my office in Texas, we have the photographs, 8by10s, of the 40 men and women from my congressional district, of all races and all branches of the service, who have been killed in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and in other places in the world. I am grateful that the incoming Member of Congress, Congressman Crenshaw, is going to keep those 8by10s, all 40 of them, on our wall here in Washington, D.C., so that we can remember those men and women who served and gave their lives for the rest of us. I have had the honor to represent people in southeast Texas from Beaumont to Port Arthur, Sabine Pass, Dayton, China, Liberty, HullDaisetta, Baytown, Ames, Nome, Highlands, Kingwood, Humble, Porter, Mont Belvieu, Tarleton, Cleveland, Champions, Spring, Klein, Spring Branch, Memorial, parts of Houston, and where I am from, Atascocita. I see so many wonderful people along the way. I have a staff that I would put up against any staff. I have the best staff in Congress. I always have. It is fortunate for me, and it is fortunate for the folks in our congressional district. Of my four chiefs of staff, Heather RamseyCook was my first one. She was my chief of staff when I was a judge. She was my chief of staff when I started here, and she is now my current chief of staff. Others were Janet Diaz Brown, who has since moved off to Seattle, Washington, with her family, and Gina Santucci who is now Gina Foote. My latest was Tim Tarpley, and now Heather RamseyCook again. My chiefs of staff have been excellent, and I think all of us owe a lot of our success in getting things done to the people who work for us. My caseworkers in Texas are great. Viviana and Amy are both veterans: one from Afghanistan, one from Iraq. One of them is a wounded warrior. They deal with the casework. They get it. They understand veterans’ issues. One of the major things we do as Members of Congress is casework for our veterans. But all of my staff have been excellent, and I want to thank them for their proud work that they have done, especially in constituent services. So I don’t know what is next, Mr. Speaker. I do know that it is time to dance with the one that brung you and pack up my old 1998 Jeep and head on home. By the way, my gaudy Jeep left a mark here in Washington as well. Aside from being the only ‘98 Jeep with a lift kit and lights across the top—you never know when you will see deer up here, Mr. Speaker—there is a special oil stain on the White House front drive that President Bush didn’t take too kindly to. It is fitting, leaving a little Texas oil on the driveway of the White House when you leave town. So this is where the cowboy rides away, Mr. Speaker. Also, at the end, there is really no better goodbye than the words of Davy Crockett when he left Congress, when he said, affectionately: ‘‘You may all go to hell, I am going to Texas.’’ And that is just the way it is. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Lasky, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate agrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2) ‘‘An Act to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes.’’. 
IS AMERICA FIRST? (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, following the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi ordered by the Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the world raised its voice in condemnation. Noticeably quiet was the leader of the free world, our own President. A closer look at President Trump’s deeply troubling financial connections and conflicts of interest likely explain why. In August 2015, the President himself said on the campaign trail: ‘‘Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. . . . I like them very much.’’ That same month, The Trump Organization registered eight separate companies to do business in Saudi Arabia. Indeed, The Hill newspaper reported that a 5day stay from the Saudi crown prince at the Trump Hotel caused a 13 percent surge in revenue in the first quarter of this year. How about that? Mr. President, the American people wonder, is it America first, or is America for sale to foreign interests? Given the President’s clear conflicting interests, Congress must assert its power to limit the ability of corrupt regimes to influence our politics. Our colleagues on both sides of the aisle must reaffirm America’s values of liberty, justice, and equality, and restore America’s faith in our politics. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
HEALTHCARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity. There are so many things that we need to consider. Today, the President announced that he is going to do his best to shut down the Government of the United States, and he wants to call it the Trump shutdown. I wonder if he really understands what that means to Americans. The Department of Homeland Security— about which there is so much discussion as to the security of the border, the Coast Guard, all of the ICE agents and so forth—presumably would stand down. I guess that is what a shutdown means, that we would have no border security. So I am curious exactly what the President has in mind when he says it will be the Trump shutdown. We don’t really want to do that. I have been there before in the mid1990s, when Speaker Gingrich decided to shut down the government. I was over at the Department of the Interior as the Deputy Secretary, and I think that the Department of National Parks and the Bureau of Land Management and on and on simply shut down. The National Parks shut down, the Washington Monument. So the Department of the Interior would apparently shut down—not apparently, would definitely shut down— under a Trump shutdown. I suppose the Washington Monument, the memorial to World War I, World War II memorials, Yosemite—that would be a problem actually. We usually go to Yosemite on the 18th of December. That is my anniversary. So, Mr. President, do you have any idea what you are going to cause here in America? The Department of Agriculture would shut down. Food safety, presumably, would shut down. It goes on and on, and all of that over a border wall that nobody other than the President thinks would be useful. We do need border security, no doubt about it. We just heard our colleague from Texas talk about this a little bit. Yes, we do need border security. But nobody thinks a big, massive, beautiful wall from here to there, from the Caribbean to the Pacific Coast, would solve the issue of border security. By the way, if you shut down the government, it is the Coast Guard that shuts down, and the Coast Guard has confiscated 10 times more drugs than the Border Patrol. So I guess we will have the President shut down that part of border security also. Nobody says a wall is the answer. They said use technology. Use observation devices of various kinds that sense and watch remotely, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles and things of that sort. By the way, why don’t we beef up and provide the kind of security and the 
kind of access that our ports of entry really need, whether those ports of entry are along the Mexican border or the ports? We really are justifiably concerned about port security. I mean ocean port security. So, come on, Mr. President. Realistically, you don’t have the votes here in the House of Representatives for your $5 billion border wall, which now you would say Mexico is going to pay for. b1815 Show me the money. We can negotiate this out. And Democrats—the leader of the House and of the minority in the Senate, Ms. PELOSI and Senator SCHUMER , went over and said: We put more than $1 billion—I think it was about $1.3, $1.4 billion from last year’s appropriations—and you have only spent 6 percent of that for border security. So you have got that billion or so available now. And now you want $5 billion. How do you want to spend it? No plans on how to spend the money. It is just fulfilling a campaign promise, which now, apparently, Mexico is going to pay for. We will see. I wasn’t really going to talk about that. What I wanted to talk about is what Americans are really concerned about, which is healthcare. That was an issue in the campaign. I know from the Democratic Party side, we made healthcare a major central issue of our campaign for the people: affordable healthcare for the people. That is what we campaigned on. That is what we promised. On January 3, when the Democrats take control of this House of Representatives, we will put forth solutions to the healthcare crisis. The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, and it brought more than 22 million Americans into the insurance market and gave them a quality insurance product. They had to pay for it. It wasn’t all free. The price varied. It created exchanges, a marketplace in which individuals and families can go and select policies from various insurance companies. Unfortunately, the public option was not adopted, but nonetheless, there was an opportunity for 22 million Americans. No sooner did that bill pass than the Republicans used that Affordable Care Act, with what they then called ‘‘ObamaCare,’’ to beat up the Democrats. They did a very, very good job at it. They took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 election, and in 2011, they began a process of eviscerating the Affordable Care Act. More than 60 times on this floor our Republican colleagues voted to eviscerate, gut, kill, terminate, but never to replace, just to eliminate that, with 22 million Americans losing their insurance. The expansion of the Medicaid program across this Nation is gone, reduced, gutted. So we go into the 2018 campaign, and we said: No. No. Healthcare is a fundamental issue, a fundamental right. The wealthiest country in the world ought to be able to provide healthcare to all its citizens. That was our campaign. So we are going to move forward on this. One of the things we want to take up right away is why we want to do it. Those of you who follow my occasional 1hour Special Orders here on the floor have seen this. This is kind of to center me, to center what it is we want to accomplish, why we want to do these things. Franklin Delano Roosevelt said it very, very well back in the late 1930s. He said: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ That is where I am coming from, and I think that is where my Democratic colleagues are coming from. The wealthy are doing quite well. They certainly are. The tax bill that was passed by the Republicans without one Democratic vote last year in December 2017 ripped nearly $2 trillion out of the Federal Treasury and gave 85 percent of that $2 trillion to the wealthy American corporations and to the top 10 percent of the wealthy Americans. So we come back to values. We are not here to make the rich richer—although they certainly would like that, and they certainly did get that in the tax bill, or scam, I think is what we would call it—but, rather, for people who really need help, the men and women and families of America who go to their kitchen table, are unable to figure out how they are going to get healthcare, how they are going to get a job. There is talk there is a tax break, but that tax break was eaten up by inflation for the working men and women of America. So let’s go to the healthcare issue. One of the things we spent a lot of time talking about and intend to deal with is the cost of prescription drugs. Let’s spend some time on that. This little chart is a comparison of prescription drugs versus generic drugs. Ninety percent of the prescriptions are filled with generic drugs and 23 percent of the prescriptions are filled with other, nongeneric drugs. Seventyseven percent of the total cost of drugs is on the nongeneric side; and on the generic side down here, it is about 10 percent. So one solution here is to advance the availability of generic drugs. Clearly, a generic drug is significantly cheaper than a prescription drug. You may ask: Why is that? The pharmaceutical industry will say: The reason is, we have got to do all this research, and we have got to do all this marketing. They certainly do a lot of marketing. You turn the television on; they are marketing like crazy one drug or another. That is a prescription drug. They are not marketing the generic drugs. So there you have it: Generics, 90 percent of the prescriptions are generic, and 70 percent of the cost is on 23 percent, the prescription drugs. What has happened to the cost of prescription drugs? Well, if you take the average price of the specialty drugs, these are prescriptions, they have tripled over the last— 2006 to 2015, that is what?—10 years. So the prescription drugs, the specialty prescription drugs, same drugs, over a 10year period, the cost has tripled. You might ask: Well, why? Is it suddenly more expensive to make the same drug that you made before? Well, possibly. But maybe it has to do with market power. If your prescription drug has a patent or many, many patents, then the generic drug cannot be made. So you control the market for that particular drug. That particular drug might be rather important. Now, for those of you who watch television, you may actually have heard of a couple of these drugs. Let’s just take a look here at key metrics for the three major brand drugs: Humira, Revlimid, and Lantus. I don’t take them, so I really don’t know how to pronounce them that well. But let’s take a look here at Humira: the number of patents, 247; the price change since 2006, 144 percent—using patents to protect the drug from competition, allowing a 144 percent price increase—years blocking competition, 39 years before there will be any competition for the most expensive and most used drug, Humira. This one for multiple myeloma; I think that is a cancer: number of patent applications, 106; number of patents pending, 96; price increase since 2012, 79 percent price increase; years blocking competition, if you happen to have this particular cancer, there is one drug that seems to work really, really well, but it will be 40 years before there is competition, in other words, a generic that could be used, similarly with the other drug. So what is happening here is the pharmaceutical industry is using multiple patents and not a brandnew drug, but just a little minor tweaking of the existing drug, giving an opportunity to extend way beyond whatever the patent law originally intended, in some cases 30, 40 years before a generic drug can come onto the market and replace what is going on. How can we deal with that? Well, let’s take another example. Here is one. You have heard of insulin. I bet you have. Insulin prices have tripled over the last 15 years. One of the most expensive insulin products in Medicare part D, only one out of the six most expensive insulin products faces competition. So, in the absence of competition, now the cost per year is $2,300. Another example is using patents on a drug to deal with diabetes. Let’s take a look at this one. As if the patent policies and the ability of the drug companies to tweak 
their product to use multiple patents over time, one after another, to gain market domination and to eliminate competitors for these very essential drugs, as if it is not bad enough now, our good President recently, I think about 10 days ago, sat down with the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada and signed a new really big, wonderful trade deal to somehow replace NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Act. Well, way down in the guts of that agreement was a little clause, subsection C, measures relating to pharmaceutical products, biologicals, et cetera, extended by 10 years the existing patent law for biologicals. This is the hot new area of pharmaceutical drugs: biologicals. So, in the patent law, as if the patent law wasn’t already being abused sufficiently to drive up the price of medical costs in the United States, the President goes out with his team of negotiators and adds an additional 10 years to the existing patents for this particular type of pharmaceutical product. Together with the ability to tweak small, little changes in the processing or in the drug itself, using that to gain control of that particular solution to a very serious health problem that Americans face, the President decides to add 10 years to the foundation patent. So, what does it mean to Americans? Well, it means you are going to pay a whole, whole lot of money for your drug prices. There are solutions. I assure you that we are already, on the Democratic side of this coin, looking at solutions, first and foremost, to allow the Federal Government, which is the single biggest purchaser, payer for these drugs, to negotiate the price, that is, to use the purchasing power of government to overcome the patent lock that the drug companies have been able to secure using patents and other technologies and techniques. b1830 That is the first thing, to allow the Federal Government to negotiate. So, you remember when Medicare part D was installed back in 2003? The pharmaceutical industry weaseled into that law—that is, the prescription drug benefit in Medicare—a provision that said the Federal Government could not negotiate for the prices of drugs. So taxpayers and those who have a deductible or a copay, you are being harmed. Now, generics, yes; generics are an answer. But just to complete this system of harming Americans by charging more than necessary for drugs using the patents, as we just discussed, the savior to the problem, which many would say is the generics, well, there is a little problem there too. And the problem was laid out in a recent article in The Washington Post. You have heard of antitrust laws, which basically say that competitors in an economic sector cannot conspire to control the price. Antitrust. It turns out that the generic, according to The Washington Post and to 47 State attorneys general around the Nation and a whole lot of—CVS, I believe, and a few others who buy drugs and sell them— retailers have launched an antitrust complaint against a cabal of generic drug companies who are alleged to have conspired to control the cost of the generic drugs—that is, to maintain a higher cost—and to divide up the market. A generic drugmaker decides: I am going to make drug A, starts making it, controls 100 percent of the generic market for that drug. Good. Generic drugmaker B comes along, says: I can make that drug, and I can probably make it a little bit cheaper, so I am going to compete with company A. Company A said: Whoa, wait a minute. We can make this good for both of us. It can be a winwin. You take 25, 30 percent of the market; I’ll take 75, 60 percent of the market; and we will both be doing very well. That is the allegation. So this is something we need to deal with also. We need to encourage the Department of Justice, the State departments, to use the antitrust laws to make sure that these kinds of conspiracies are not happening. Clearly, if the generic drugmakers are engaged in a conspiracy to control the cost or to divide up the market for their drugs, it is illegal. There are serious penalties associated with that. These cases, as reported by The Washington Post, are proceeding. Wonderful. What we need to do is to make sure that the Department of Justice, the Federal Department of Justice as well as the State departments of justice and the Commerce Department and others who are responsible for enforcing the antitrust laws are doing so. So, with regard to pharmaceuticals, with regard to drugs, I want you to know that the Democratic Congress is going to attack this problem, first by making certain that the United States Government can use its market power to break the monopoly that the drug companies presently have as a result of their ability to hold their specific drug forever, at least 30 to 40 years, under the patent schemes that they are now doing. There are other things that I would like to take up, and I will do so quickly. We said that we would also want to deal with the issues of preexisting conditions. Now, in the Affordable Care Act there was a requirement that insurance companies do not discriminate in the sale of insurance and the pricing of insurance based upon preexisting conditions. Now, what is a preexisting condition? Well, we just had one example up here: diabetes, childhood diabetes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, other childhood illnesses. I was the insurance commissioner in California twice, in the early ‘90s, ‘91 to ‘95, and again from 2003 to 2007. This issue of insurance companies discriminating based upon preexisting conditions was rampant in California, despite our efforts to try to pass a law in California to prohibit the insurance companies from discriminating based upon preexisting conditions. We were unsuccessful. What we did find is that in the application process for insurance there was a form, and it listed every conceivable thing that a human being could be afflicted with—headaches, colds, sinus problems, sore throats, on and on and on—a list of maybe 20 or 30, and you had to check off each and every one of those. If you checked them off, they would go: Ah, you have got a preexisting condition. We will insure you, but we are going to charge you 10 times more than a person that didn’t have that condition. And they would then provide the insurance. If you went through and you said: No, I don’t have a sinus problem; no, I don’t have a sore throat; blah, blah; and then you come down with a sore throat, they say: Ah, you didn’t honestly fill out the form, and therefore we are not going to cover you for that illness. This was a common problem. So when the Affordable Care Act passed, in that law was a provision that said the insurance companies could not do that, they could not discriminate either in the cost of it or not providing insurance at all. Couldn’t do it. However, in legislation that passed the House of Representatives, passed the Senate, and was signed into law— not a healthcare bill, but an addition to a mustpass piece of legislation—the Republicans, without Democratic support here, passed legislation that wiped out that portion of the Affordable Care Act, basically putting Americans at risk once again to insurance discrimination, health insurance discrimination. And suddenly America woke up and goes: Whoa, wait a minute. You mean to tell me that if I have diabetes I can’t get insurance or I am going to have to pay 10, 20, 30 times more than somebody else? Even to the point of a woman being discriminated against because she is a woman and she might have a baby. Anyway, America woke up and goes: Whoa, wait. We don’t like that. So, yes, we made that an issue. We made it a really big issue in the campaign: No discrimination based upon preexisting conditions. Can’t do it. We are going to eliminate that problem for America. It wasn’t too long before my Republican colleagues go: Oops, we had better get on board that ship. And I want my Republican colleagues and the President to know they are going to have an opportunity to be on that ship. We are going to put that bill 
before the House of Representatives in the early days of the 116th Congress in 2019. We are going to do that. We will see if they are willing to stay with the promises that they made— most of them unsuccessful, but nonetheless the promises they made—to deal with the problem of insurance discrimination. So those are two things that are on the agenda right up front. There are many other things that we intend to do with healthcare because we believe that healthcare is a right. In the richest country in the world, you ought to be able to have quality healthcare available to you. That is our pledge. That is what we intend to do. A final point. A week ago I was here talking about climate change with my colleagues, and we were talking about the Federal Government’s report on climate changes that are occurring. It was an eyeopener. It basically said we are—by ‘‘we,’’ not my generation, but the next generation out, 10, 20 years out—going to face a monumental problem of sea level rise, massive storms, massive fires, the epidemic of tropical diseases moving into the Northern Hemisphere in through the countries that have not experienced tropical illnesses. All of those things were in that report, and we spoke about it here. We called upon our government, our President, and our colleagues here—Democrat and Republican—to aggressively attack this problem by reducing carbon emissions, by moving away from a carbonbased energy system. We can do that. As I said during that debate here on the floor, in 1978 I authored a law in California, the first in the Nation, to provide a tax credit for wind, solar, and conservation. And those kind of laws have been in place forever, and we have proved that we can do it. Over the years, significant efforts have succeeded in bringing on board clean green power. So, a week goes by, and in the newspapers yesterday and today are two articles that deserve our attention, and actually a third that just came up this afternoon. The first article was that the carbon emissions over the last year have grown substantially. For the United States it is around, I think, a 2
1⁄2percent increase in carbon emissions; and in China and India, the other two large emitters of carbon, significant growth. In other words, the world is falling backwards in addressing the carbon pollution that is creating climate change. Oh, my goodness, a wakeup call. We have the report that these bad things are going to happen unless we change the direction we are going. And then a week later we find out the direction we are going is not downward but, rather, upward. Article one: Today in the newspapers, even in the fake newspapers, is an article that the President’s emissaries to a conference in Europe on climate change are advocating—advocating— for the burning of more coal and oil. This wasn’t a coal conference. This was a conference on how does the world go to green, noncarbon energy sources. And so the United States, leading away from solving the problem. Yes, that is what our President sent those folks over to Europe to do, not to solve the problem but to make the problem worse. It was an OMG moment. You have got to be kidding. The least you could have done is keep your mouth shut. But oh, no, advocating for more coal, advocating for more oil, and pushing aside all of those technologies—solar, wind, biomass, biofuel, all of those things—pushing them aside. No, no, no, we have got to have more coal. It is reprehensible and an absolute dereliction of duty and responsibility to this generation here and now and to future generations to come. b1845 What would you expect from the man who wants to shut down government? I would expect better. We just want A Better Deal. We want A Better Deal for the American people. The rich and wealthy, they got one big beautiful deal in the tax cut. Working men and women and families, we have got our work cut out for us. A Better Deal for the people—that is what we want to do. Many different ways to do it. We are going to work at it. We ask you to work with us. f 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) for 30 minutes. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, tonight it is a privilege that I have to yield to somebody who has become a good friend and an excellent colleague, who has served with me, at my side, at the House Financial Services Committee, who will be leaving us at the end of this Congress. Her voice of common sense and her voice to really promote economic growth among all Americans will be missed; but in her short tenure, she has made her mark in our committee and made her mark in Congress, and I am pleased to yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ). Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, it was certainly an honor and a privilege to serve in the prestigious Financial Services Committee as a Member of the 115th Congress. It was a distinct privilege to be selected to serve on that committee by our chairman, JEBHENSARLING , who recognized the urgent need to reignite our economy and to give small businesses like ours and millions like our family business around the Nation a chance to thrive again against the oppressive weight of government overregulation. As a small manufacturing business owner and as an attorney to small community banks and credit unions in my community, I am acutely aware of the challenges that small businesses and families face concerning Big Government overreach in the financial realm. Families were not able to save for their future, small businesses were laying off employees instead of hiring, and community banks were closing at a record pace. The policies we championed and the incredible work we have done on the Financial Services Committee this year under the leadership of Chairman JEBHENSARLING has turned all of that around. For the first time in over a decade, I am witnessing growth and renewed enthusiasm in our economy, thanks to the work of our committee. The jurisdiction of the Financial Services Committee may seem esoteric to some; however, the work that we do is vitally important to this Nation. We have the power, of course, if used correctly, to open up markets, to unleash free enterprise, and to give citizens the opportunity to pursue the American Dream. In May, President Trump signed S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, into law after House passage. Our committee, through numerous hearings and markups, originated most of this legislation. The ultimate work product, S. 2155, made muchneeded reforms to DoddFrank that directly impact the ability of small community institutions to conduct business and to drive the economy in a positive direction. As a freshman member, I was honored to be one of the only members to have two bipartisan bills included in this package: the first, the Small Bank Exam Cycle Improvement Act, and, the second, the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act. These bills are vitally important because community banks are the lifeblood of New York’s upstate economy. Community institutions provide access to capital for entrepreneurs starting or growing their small businesses, for families and farmers acquiring new equipment or assets, for loans to new car buyers, and for mortgages to families purchasing a home, especially for the first time. In rural areas like the 22nd District in New York, consumers and small businesses often rely on lending with local institutions in order to gain access to capital. These reforms ensure that small community institutions like Tioga National Bank, the Bank of Utica—my personal bank—Adirondack Bank—another bank that I use—and many others throughout the country can keep their doors open and continue to lend to people in our communities. I am grateful to Chairman HENSARLING and the expert and professional staff on the committee who worked with our office and leaders in 
the financial services community in our region to ensure that we had the opportunity to pass meaningful legislation that will benefit the constituents of New York’s 22nd Congressional District for many years to come. I thank Chairman HENSARLING for his unparalleled integrity, tremendous leadership, sage advice, and deep friendship. I am so honored and privileged to have played a small role in Chairman HENSARLING ’s noble mission of empowering all Americans through freedom and economic opportunity. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her very, very kind words. And, again, she will be very much missed from this institution, but I will treasure our service together. I will treasure our friendship forever as well, and I thank her for coming to the floor tonight. And now, Mr. Speaker, I will issue the remainder of my remarks from the House well. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for what I expect to be my final speech on the House floor. After 8 terms, I have chosen to go home to Texas, the land of my forefathers, with the hope of being a better father and a better husband myself. I am also going home because I believe America is best served by the Jeffersonian model of American democracy, and that is a citizen legislature. I fear too many wish to become members of the permanent ruling class. I am not among them. I also know that this congressional seat, Mr. Speaker, never belonged to me. It belonged to the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. It has always belonged to them. They allowed me—they allowed me to hold it in trust. It was a sacred trust, Mr. Speaker, a sacred trust to be the guardian of their freedoms and their opportunities, and I will always, always be grateful for that privilege. So, come January 3, I reverently return their seat back to them, and I wish my successor, Lance Gooden of Kaufman County, Texas, all the best— all the best. Mr. Speaker, 16 years ago, I went to these very same people in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas and I told them: I believe I know what the genius of America is. It is faith; it is family; it is free enterprise; and, yes, it is freedom. And it does indeed all start with faith because, Mr. Speaker, over your chair right there is emblazoned our national motto, ‘‘In God We Trust.’’ And it is my firm prayer that, for our Nation, may it always be so. And I firmly believe we cannot be a virtuous nation unless we are first a godly nation. People come to America for many reasons. They come here for political freedom, economic freedom, but, also, most profoundly, for religious freedom. May we never forget Jefferson’s prophetic words enshrined: ‘‘Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure, when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of people that these liberties are the gift of God?’’ Mr. Speaker, as vital as faith is, so are our families. And the family that made me in College Station, Texas, all those years ago was blessed with two wonderful parents, Chase and Ann. My father was a poultry farmer; my mother was a stayathome mom; but together, they taught me and my siblings invaluable lessons about hard work, fairness, faith, discipline, and honesty—in a word, Mr. Speaker, values. They lovingly led by example, which is what my wife and I attempt to do today with our two children. We now have, over so many different years of history, showing that it is our families—it is our families—that can best perpetuate our values, raise our children, and care for our elderly. Now, let me turn to free enterprise. 1776 wasn’t just a revolutionary year for America. It was a revolutionary year for free enterprise, for American capitalism, free market capitalism, as well, because it was in that year that Scottish moral philosopher Adam Smith penned its intellectual foundation in his opus magnum, ‘‘The Wealth of Nations.’’ Prosperity would never, never be the same. We now have over 200 years of history in this country proving that free market capitalism produces the greatest wealth for the greatest number of people. Yes, free enterprise is about wealth creation, but this is not to be confused with materialism. Yes, free enterprise does produce Porsches, it produces Jacuzzis, and it produces vacations to Paris; but, more importantly, it empowers a factory worker in my district in Mesquite, Texas, to start her own business. It helps a family in Jacksonville, Texas, send their first kid to college. It puts ample, nutritious food on the kitchen table. And that kitchen table is found in a home that some hardworking family in Forney, Texas, never dreamed they could own but they have because of American free enterprise. But even perhaps more profound than wealth creation, free market capitalism is really about the pursuit of happiness. It is about the freedom to use your Godgiven talents to create, to innovate, and to produce, to take pride and joy that can only arise from what American Enterprise Institute scholar Arthur Brooks terms ‘‘earned success.’’ As is written in the book of Isaiah, chapter 65, verse 22: My chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands. And finally, freedom, Mr. Speaker, the inalienable right to liberty endowed by our creator. Never in the vast expanse of time, history, and space have the blessings of liberty been enjoyed in greater abundance than they have here in the United States of America. Only in America are you only limited by the size of your dreams. As my friend and mentor, former Senator Phil Gramm, is fond of saying: Only in America can ordinary people achieve extraordinary results. Mr. Speaker, generations—generations—of our forefathers have taken up arms in defense of liberty and found it worthy of the very sacrifice of their lives. There is no greater foundational principle to the American people than liberty: personal liberty, political liberty, religious liberty, and economic liberty. May we, in this body, always fight to preserve it. Now, in the Federal city, political calculus changes by the moment. Policies come and go, but principles endure, and there are no more enduring or foundational principles in America than faith, family, free enterprise, and freedom. I believed it 16 years ago when I came to this body. I believe it even more fervently today, Mr. Speaker. Now, Mr. Speaker, I have learned a couple of things in my 16 years of service in Congress. One thing I learned is that, when one announces their retirement, two things happen: One, people begin to say nice things about you. Had I known about this phenomena earlier, perhaps I would have retired years ago. Second of all, reporters ask you about your socalled legacy. Well, Mr. Speaker, I have to laugh because I am not sure there is anything as soon forgotten in the Federal city as a former Member of Congress. So I don’t really think in terms of legacy. I, frankly, don’t know if I have changed Washington. Now, Mr. Speaker, I know Washington didn’t change me. I do take solace, though, and I take a measure of pride knowing that, along with a handful of other conservatives in this body, I fought steadfastly against the forces of what I view crony capitalism, and that be either by earmark setasides, subsidies, tax preferences, or trade protectionism, particularly now as the specter of socialism once again rears its ugly head in our Nation. We can never let our fellow countrymen somehow confuse free market capitalism with crony capitalism. In the one, your success depends upon how hard and how smart you work on Main Street. In the other, it depends on who you know in Washington. The latter is a threat to the former, and the Republican Party will lose its moral authority to prevent a social welfare state if we ever acquiesce in a corporate welfare state. This we cannot allow to happen. b1900 Mr. Speaker, you know personally, as does the previous speaker, the gentlewoman from New York, how much pride I take in the work of the great men and women of the House Financial Services Committee. Most Americans today are seeing the best economy they have ever seen in their lifetimes, and that is in no small measure to the work of the men and women of the House Financial Services committee. 
Now, I am not going to argue that our work was on the same order of magnitude as tax reform. It wasn’t. But the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act signed by President Trump was the most progrowth banking bill in a generation, and has certainly done more to grow our economy than any other legislation passed by the House besides tax reform. Now, Mr. Speaker, economic growth cannot solve all of America’s problems, but it lifts the downtrodden from poverty; it empowers middleincome America; and it enables tens of millions to achieve their version of the American Dream. It has, indeed, for 16 years of my service, been worth fighting for. As I prepare to leave office, Mr. Speaker, I leave with many, many hopes. But, Mr. Speaker, I leave with a few fears as well that I believe my fellow countrymen should pay close attention to. First, I am concerned about the state of America’s entrepreneurial spirit. I wonder how long we will have robust economic growth if the government continues a regulatory onslaught against American business to attempt to render all risk out of our financial system. From its earliest beginnings, America has always been the land of the entrepreneur, the land of the dreamer, and the risktaker and, yes, that includes the risk of failure. Several of the colonies, such as Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Virginia, were founded, not by the Crown of England but, rather, by profitseeking corporations that were willing to take risk. You know, someone who clearly understood something about risk was Steve Jobs, the cofounder of Apple; I believe still the largest company in the world today. In an interview, Jobs was once asked how he thought about himself. He said: ‘‘I look at myself as sort of a trapeze artist.’’ And then the reporter asked: ‘‘With or without a net?’’ He didn’t bat an eyelash, he said: ‘‘Without.’’ Steve Jobs was a risktaker and because he took a risk, Apple again became the most valuable company in the world whose innovations have revolutionized our lives. And what is important is not the amount of money that Steve Jobs made, but what he was able to do with it, and that is create a successful company, to employ and serve millions who collectively have exercised their God given rights at the pursuit of happiness. Fewer entrepreneurs taking fewer risks means fewer jobs, Mr. Speaker. It is that simple. And so one day, if we lose our ability to fail in America, we will soon lose our ability to succeed. There are simply too many burdensome regulations that crush the entrepreneurial spirit. This must cease. Another fear I have, Mr. Speaker, is that I fear we are drifting away from our constitutional moorings as I witness the rise of the administrative state, because we need to appreciate our birthright, the sheer genius of the Constitution which, unfortunately, today is threatened. Our Constitution’s framework of checks and balances, limited government, coequal branches of government, that has secured our fundamental rights and given us the freest, most prosperous society the world has ever known. But we are witnessing now a century long liberal expansion of unconstitutional government that has unleashed the modern regulatory state as we know it, extremely powerful, exceedingly intrusive, imperiously opaque, bafflingly bureaucratic, and alarmingly unaccountable. Instead of being governed by the rule of law, increasingly, citizens are being ruled by the rule of rulers; specifically, the rules promulgated by legions of unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats. The result? It is OSHA now, not Congress, that governs over workplace safety. It is the EPA now, not Congress, that governs over our air quality. It is HHS, not Congress, that now governs over our healthcare. Today, the citizen’s right to carefully deliberate proposed legislation through their chosen elected representatives in Congress is now reduced to nothing more than a little ‘‘notice and comment’’ period where the citizens are permitted to lodge complaints and suggestions, all of which the unelected bureaucrats are free to ignore, and which they may actually use to retaliate against the citizen. Madison, in Federalist 47, warned us of this phenomena when he wrote, 
The combination of all power, legislative, executive, and judiciary in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. 
It is time for Congress, Mr. Speaker, to reclaim its constitutional powers of the purse, to no longer allow these economically significant rules to pass without congressional approval, and to outlaw the Chevron Doctrine that has tilted the scales of justice toward the state. This must change. The next fear I have as I get ready to leave Congress, Mr. Speaker, is one that has really come about fairly recently in our State of the Union, and that is the tenor and tone of the national debate; in other words, what is happening in our public square. Now, on the one hand, for those who believe that we are on the precipice of something truly catastrophic, I remind them, we have survived a bloody Civil War. We survived the turbulent 60s of my youth. Politics has rhetorically always been a full contact sport. And if you read biographies of the founders like Jefferson, and Adams, and Hamilton, you will discover just how coarse and vile ad hominem attacks could be at the dawn of American politics. But with the exception of the notorious Alien and Sedition Acts, I don’t recall ever there being a greater effort in our Nation’s history to actually silence dissent. The cry for civility in political discourse, welcome as it is, is somewhat misplaced. The threat to democracy does not come from incivility but, instead, from those who are committed to preventing; preventing the debate, as opposed to winning the debate. That is where the true threat comes. Democratic selfgovernance relies upon a free flow of differing ideas within the public square to fully inform all opinions and challenge all accepted orthodoxies and ideologies. There was a time in America’s history that the American ethos was encapsulated by the words that have been attributed to Patrick Henry: ‘‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’’ Regrettably, I can hear all over the Nation today people saying something along the lines of: ‘‘I disapprove of what you say, and I am going to harass and intimidate you and your family, defame your character, and attempt to take away your livelihood until you simply shut up and withdraw.’’ Those who do not respect the rights of others to be heard in the public square may be little better than book burners and represent a clear and present danger to American democracy. It is time for every citizen who cares about the destiny of their Nation, it is time for courage, but it is a time also for goodwill and mutual respect among our citizens. It is time to resecure our democratic values in the public square. Mr. Speaker, my greatest fear for my Nation, though, is our national debt. When I first came to Congress the national debt was $6.7 trillion. Today it has tripled. Tripled. My greatest regret in public office is my inability to convince more of my colleagues and more of my fellow citizens of the peril of this national debt. We are experiencing debttoGDP ratios that haven’t been seen since World War II, but in World War II they were episodic and temporary. Today’s debt is structural and permanent. As a veteran of the socalled super committee, the SimpsonBowles Deficit Reduction Committee, and now chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, my iPad is awash in reports saying that our national debt is simply unsustainable. Yet, denial, justification, and obstruction continue to rule the day. We should all be troubled and sobered by the fact that if one carefully reviews history, you will find few examples of republics that have existed beyond 200 years, and most of those republics met their demise through some type of fiscal crisis. There is so much at stake. Now, Mr. Speaker, in my heart, and in my head, I don’t really believe America one day will wake up and become Greece, but I do believe that we are on the path, within a generation, to 
being a secondrate economic power, a secondrate military power and, frankly, a secondrate moral authority as we become the first generation in America’s history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. It is beyond time for both a spending limit amendment to the United States Constitution and fundamental reforms of our current entitlement programs for future generations. It is not too late to take America off the road to national bankruptcy. Now, Mr. Speaker, I have spent the last few minutes speaking about my fears, but please know I have far, far more hope than I have fear as I come to the House floor for the last time to give a speech. Most Americans, as I observe, are enjoying the greatest economy in their lifetimes. Oh, what a difference that has made in the lives of millions of Americans and, indeed, to borrow a phrase from the past: ‘‘It is morning in America again.’’ Opportunity abounds like few periods in our Nation’s history. And our military might that had been hollowed out in the last presidential administration is being rebuilt and it is respected and feared around the globe again. As we look at our Nation’s history, we cannot but conclude that we live in a time of relative peace, relative security, and we should always, always be grateful. But the main reason I come to this floor tonight, so hopeful, so hopeful for the future, is because of the people I have met in the Fifth District of Texas that I have had this privilege to represent. I have met great entrepreneurs, like Sam Bistrian of Lake Highlands. He immigrated to this country as a 12 yearold boy from Romania. He didn’t even speak the language. A few years later, he managed to get a job at one of the local retailers, Neiman Marcus. He got a job starting at the bottom; I think it was stocking shelves. And with hard work and vision, he ended up one day launching his own line of designer rain boots called Roma, and now he heads up a multi million dollar enterprise. And oh, by the way, he gives his boots away to poor people all over the world. Another entrepreneur I met is Rick Carmona from Terrell, Texas. As a kid, he used to visit a local TexMex restaurant and, after going there a few times he said, you know what? My mom cooks better food than this. So after saving his money from a number of jobs, he finally took the great leap. He invested his money; took out a small loan; started his own restaurant. He seated the customers; he bussed the tables. His mom did the cooking. His office consisted of a back table and a pencil behind his ear. And a couple of decades later, he runs one the most successful restaurants in the entire county because of his entrepreneurial vision. I also have hope because I met great patriots, patriots like Doc Collins from Van Zandt County, who is a real conservative leader from that county. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, he has bone cancer that he continues to battle. But during a recent election, he got chemotherapy in the morning for his bone cancer, and he was working the polling places in the afternoon because he felt that strongly about his cause and his country. Then, Mr. Speaker, there is Howard Banks of Kaufman, Texas. I wish everybody could meet this wonderful patriot. He is legally blind. He is a World War II veteran. He flies Old Glory every day. Every day. One day, some noaccount vandal decided he would take Mr. Banks’ flag, and Mr. Banks fought him. He fought him. He is age 92 and he still decided that he would fight for and he was willing to die for his American flag and the country it represents. These patriots inspire me, Mr. Speaker. And then there are the social entrepreneurs that I have met in the Fifth District of Texas; people like Morgan Jones of Athens, Texas, who owns a pawnshop. Every single year, what he will do is he will take himself and all of his managers on mercy ships to Africa in order to deliver care and gifts. This is something he does at his expense. There are so many people, I wish I had time to mention, in the Fifth District of Texas who represent the best of America. I don’t have all that time, Mr. Speaker, so let me mention one more. Kenn Waterston of Terrell, Texas. I mean, he is a bulldog of a Marine veteran. b1915 He opened the Veterans Resource Center not a block, maybe two blocks away from the Dallas VA hospital. And now if homeless veterans will go to the VA Hospital to get their healthcare, as soon as they come out, they can get clean clothes; they can get showers; they can get counseling; they can get access to computers and people to help them find a job in society. So, Mr. Speaker, when I see patriots and entrepreneurs and Good Samaritans who are stepping up every day in the Fifth District of Texas, I know America has a very bright future, a very bright future ahead. So let me simply conclude where I began. For me, it is time for me to go home. It is time to go home to my family. It is time to go home to Texas. All things must pass, including our congressional service. I continue to have so many blessings in my life, but, Mr. Speaker, I don’t believe I will ever have a greater privilege than fighting for freedom and opportunity in the people’s House, the House of Representatives. My heart is just full of gratitude, full of gratitude to my staff, whose work empowered me; full of gratitude to my constituents, whose encouragement and prayers supported me; and most of all to my family, so much gratitude to Melissa, Claire, and Travis, whose support, love, and grace have sustained me all those 16 years. They are my rock. So here is what I know after 16 years, Mr. Speaker: I know if we will continue to trust in God, I know if we will continue to revere freedom, I know if we will keep faith with our Founders’ vision, our children will have brighter futures and our Republic will be forever preserved. May God continue to shed his grace on this great country. And, Mr. Speaker, for the final time on the House floor, I yield back the balance of my time. 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ) for 30 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, before Congressman HENSARLING leaves, I just want to commend him for his service and tell him what a privilege it has been for me to serve with him and to know him as a friend. We are both retiring, and we are both, so far as I know, going to move home to Texas. And if we don’t see each other anyplace else, we will see each other at some Texas A&M football games. So I thank my good friend. Mr. Speaker, in January of 1985, at the ripe old age of 34, I stood right here in the well of the House with my 2 yearold daughter, Kristin, in my left arm, held up my right hand, and took the oath to defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic, to the best of my ability. I was one of 43, I believe, of that year’s freshmen. I think we had a little over 30 Republicans and a dozen or more Democrats. As soon as I took the oath, I walked over to the hopper—and, yes, there really is a little wooden hopper here in the well of the House, as I look out, on the righthand side, as the audience looks in, on the lefthand side—and I dropped the Barton Tax Limitation/ Balanced Budget Amendment into the hopper. That constitutional amendment in 1995 was the number one item in the Contract with America, which, when the Republicans took over the House majority for the first time since 1954, we voted on this same floor the first day that we were in session in January of 1995 on my amendment. It failed. It didn’t get the twothirds vote necessary. We stripped out the tax limitation requirement and brought it back up for a vote, and it did pass by a twothirds margin. That amendment went to the Senate, and it failed by one vote in the Senate. Since that day in January, Mr. Speaker, in 1985, as I stand here on the 
House floor tonight, I have voted over 19,700 times on behalf of the people of the Sixth District of Texas. I have an attendance record of 94 percent. I have had a large number of bills that I sponsored become law. I will talk about some of those in a minute. In this current House, in the 115th Congress, I am number eight in seniority. There are four Republicans ahead of me and, I guess, three Democrats. In the alltime history of the House of Representatives, the House historian is not sure where I stand senioritywise, but I am in the top 100. In the Texas delegation, we have had about 250 Congressmen represent the great State of Texas, and I am tied for eighth place in seniority in Texas. The folks ahead of me are an allstar list of former Congressmen: Sam Rayburn, who was Speaker of the House; Wright Patman, who was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee; George Mahon, who was chairman of the Appropriations Committee; Bob Poage, who was chairman of the Agriculture Committee; Jack Brooks, who chaired the Judiciary Committee; Henry Gonzalez, who chaired the Banking Committee; and Jim Wright, who was majority leader and Speaker of the House. That is not bad company, Mr. Speaker, for service from Texas. Some of the bills that I am proud of that have become law that I was the leader on or the chief sponsor of, we started with the Tax Limitation/Balanced Budget Amendment. That did not become law, but it did pass the House. It did go to the Senate, and it did fail in the Senate by one vote. I sponsored a bill that reformed the National Institutes of Health. That was the last bill that passed the House and Senate in December of 2006. In January of 2007, the Democrats took the House back, and Congresswoman PELOSI of California became Speaker. Then Speaker Denny Hastert kept the House floor open until, I believe, 3 o’clock in the morning so that my NIH bill could clear the Senate and come back. That NIH bill created a common fund that has been utilized to form some of the cuttingedge research that is now bearing fruit. The immune cell therapy that is helping in some cases cure cancer is one result of that. Some of the stem cell research that is going on is another. I am very proud of that NIH bill. We passed an FDA reform bill that, again, has helped reduce time to bring new drugs to market. It has cut some of the red tape in getting new drugs and medical devices approved by the FDA. In the energy sector, as a young Congressman, I sponsored a bill to decontrol wellhead prices of natural gas. That bill was signed into law as a part of a larger bill signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, who just passed away. In 2005, I was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I led the effort to pass what was called the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That bill included a reform in the review of importexport facilities, which we are now using to permit LNG facilities to export our natural gas overseas. That bill also had a number of authorizations for renewable fuels and alternatives that have led to wind energy becoming a significant factor in this country and solar power becoming a significant factor in this country. It authorized some subsidies and protections for corngrown ethanol, and that has led to the ethanol industry becoming a significant factor in some parts of the country. It also protected hydraulic fracturing from Federal EPA jurisdiction except in a few limited circumstances. That one thing, if we hadn’t done anything else, has led to the boon in oil and natural gas production in this country that is the envy of the world. Three years ago, with Congressman HENRY CUELLAR , my good Democratic friend from Laredo, we sponsored and passed the bill that led to the repeal of the ban on crude oil exports, Mr. Speaker. At the time, people kind of pooh poohed that bill, but as I stand here on the House floor this evening in this month of December 2018, there are going to be days this month that we export more crude oil than we import, and that is a huge, huge accomplishment, and we are doing it based on market principles. The U.S. is now the number one producer of crude oil in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. We are producing in the neighborhood of 12 million barrels of oil per day, and that number is going to go up. Literally, the sky is the limit. The Lord has blessed the United States of America with great natural resources, and with the energy legislation that I have helped to lead the fight on and helped to get passed, we have the human resources and the capital resources and the natural resources so that the United States is going to be the leader in energy production and energy innovation for the foreseeable future, for the next 40, 50, 60 years, and I am very proud of that, Mr. Speaker. So I could talk for quite some time, Mr. Speaker, about my legislative accomplishments, but you really don’t run for Congress just to legislate. This is the people’s House. You are expected to be an ombudsman for the people you represent, in my case, the Sixth District of Texas, which has changed because of redistricting three times since I have been elected, but the core is kind of south central Texas: Ellis County, Navarro County, Tarrant County, and at various times we have gone as far south as Montgomery County. I have gone up into Tarrant and Parker County to the west, and Hood County and Hill County. As it is currently configured, there are a little over 600,000 people. When you run for Congress, Mr. Speaker, you really run because you want to help people. You want to be their spokesperson on the House floor, but also with the bureaucracy, with the executive branch, and in some cases with the private sector to make sure that they get a fair shake. In any given year, we have over 1,000 pending cases in the district and a success rate of around 80 percent, but some of these cases stand out more than others, and I want to give you a few. As a young Congressman back in the late 1980s, we still got a lot of what I call realmail letters, handwritten letters from people. One night I was in my office in Longworth going through the mail and jotting down responses or looking at draft responses that my staff had prepared, I came across a letter from an 11yearold boy, Mr. Speaker, in Burleson, Texas. His name was Garrett Roper—Garrett Roper, 11 years old. b1930 I am going to paraphrase his letter, but it was: Dear Congressman BARTON : My name is Garrett Roper. I am 11 years old. I live in Burleson, Texas. I had a good friend, Adam Settle, who was also 11. He was riding a threewheel ATV on his grandparents’ farm, and it flipped over, crushed his chest, and killed him. What are you going to do about that, Congressman? What can you do? I thought about it and I thought, I don’t know that I can do anything about it. But he had a phone number in his letter. Every Congressman has a phone on his desk, and I picked up the phone on my desk and dialed the number in Burleson, Texas. It was probably about 9 o’clock at night. In any event, the little boy’s mother answered the phone. I said: I am Congressman JOEBARTON . I am calling from Washington, D.C. Could I talk to Garrett Roper? And she said: You are who? And I said: I am Congressman JOE BARTON . And she said: Are you sure? And I said: Yes, ma’am. This isn’t a joke. She said: Well, he is in the bathtub. I said: Well, I hate to bother him, but could you ask him to come out of the tub and talk to me? And she did. He came on the phone. I identified myself and I said: Did you write me a letter? And he said: Oh, yes, I did. And I said: Well, I am here to tell you that I have read it. I am not sure what I am going to do, but I am going to try. What do you want me to do? He said: Those threewheelers are unsafe. It killed my friend. And, if you can, I want you to prevent them from being used, so that other little boys and adults don’t get hurt or killed. And I said: Well, that is a pretty big order, but let me see. To make a long story short, Mr. Speaker, I started the work. That issue was in the jurisdiction of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. I was the junior member of the minority party. The chairman was the great John Dingell of Michigan, one of my very best friends to this day. But, at that time, he was the powerful chairman, and I was the junior member of the minority. The ranking Republican on the committee then, I think, was Norm Lent of New York. So I went to Mr. Lent, and I went to Mr. Dingell. They decided that it needed to be investigated. We did an investigation. We had a number of hearings that the Justice Department came to, and the ATV industry and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The little boy who had been killed, his mother, Anne Settle, who today is one of my best friends and still lives in Burleson in the same house, she came and testified. Over a 3year period—I believe it was 3 years—a consent agreement was formed among the Justice Department, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the ATV industry, and the Congress. That consent agreement was signed and ratified, and threewheeler ATVs, Mr. Speaker, were taken off the U.S. market. It was a 10year agreement. When it expired, I don’t know if the agreement was renegotiated. But, in any event, the threewheelers did not come back, and the industry really moved to four wheelers, which are much safer and not nearly as dangerous. Mr. Speaker, that one letter from that one little boy, who was 11 years old, to his Congressman made a huge difference. It saved hundreds of lives per year, thousands of injuries, hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars, and it made the country safer. It took that little boy writing that letter to his Congressman, and then that Congressman, who in this case was me, doing something about it, picking up the phone, calling the little boy, then calling a Congressman. And people in the executive branch and people in the industry made a difference. I will give you another case of a young woman, I believe she lived in Waxahachie, Texas, named Robin Benton. She was a nurse. Her mother became ill. She quit her job and moved, I think down to Houston, to take care of her. She took out insurance on an individual basis instead of a group basis where she had worked. She moved back after her mother improved, and Robin developed breast cancer—double. She had cancer in both breasts. The insurance company that she had been covered by dropped her coverage, returned her premiums, and told her that they wouldn’t cover her. Her doctor said she needed a double mastectomy, and she needed it immediately. She didn’t write a letter. She called my congressional office in Arlington and asked for help. My staff looked into it, touched base with the insurance company, and got the answer that the insurance company had checked their files and they didn’t believe that they had made a mistake, that they had the right to cancel her coverage. My staff brought the file to me. This was a desperate situation, Mr. Speaker, so I checked with the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation in Dallas and got their take on it. Then I picked up the phone, and I called the president of that insurance company. I explained the situation to him. I said: It is my opinion that your internal review has made a mistake. I think this woman should be insured by your company, and I think her surgery should be covered. I would sure like for you to take a look at it. If I am not factually correct, then I won’t pursue it. But if I am, if what I say is factually correct, I would ask that you reinstitute her coverage. To his credit, the president of that insurance company checked his facts and checked the case file. He called me back and said: You are right, Congressman. We should cover her. They did. She had the surgery. And to my knowledge, Mr. Speaker, she is alive today. That is the power of the Congress, the power of the people, the power of an individual asking their Congressman for help, and the Congressman trying to help, and, in this case, the private sector checking the facts out and agreeing that the facts dictate that the woman should have been insured. I will give you one more example. When I was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, we got jurisdiction over the internet. We had an investigation in the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of child pornography in America, Mr. Speaker. We had a number of witnesses in and a number of hearings. The FBI had set up a special task force on child pornography. We had asked if they could send someone, one of their agents who was involved with that task force, to testify. The FBI said their policy was that their agents didn’t testify before Congress. We went back and forth, the staff to the FBI staff, without any resolution. Then I saw that the particular individual from the FBI who we wanted to testify, Mr. Speaker, did an interview on a national news show. When I saw that, I said, well, if that agent can appear on national TV, that agent ought to be able to appear before Congress and testify. I picked up the phone on my desk, and I put in a phone call to the FBI Director. I was told that the FBI Director was unavailable. So I called back and I said: Well, where is the Director? ‘‘Well, the Director is on travel, and he is out West.’’ And I said: Well, I need this agent to testify. I checked with the ranking member, Mr. Dingell, and if he is not willing to testify voluntarily, I am willing to issue a subpoena that the minority will support to compel testimony from the FBI. I got an agitated phone call that you couldn’t do that, that it wasn’t proper. The President at the time was my good friend President George W. Bush. So we said: Well, just check with the President of the United States and then let us know whether you are going to send your agent or not. Well, sure enough, later that afternoon, I got a phone call from the FBI Director. He was very cordial, what could he do to help, that there would be no problem. I said: Well, I really appreciate that. I am just curious why the change of attitude. He said: Well, we called over to the White House, and the President said that Congressman BARTON was a good man, meant business, and, if it was not totally impossible, the FBI should cooperate. The agent came the next day. We had good testimony, and that hearing led to a renewal of purpose in terms of the task force against child pornography. The FBI went on and did some really good work, and we passed some legislation that has tightened the law and the laws against child pornography on the internet. Mr. Speaker, what is the point of all that? The point of those stories is that any Member of Congress who is given the privilege to have the voting card has a great opportunity. There are 435 phones on the desks of offices in the Rayburn, the Longworth, and the Cannon office buildings, and every Member has the potential to pick up that phone and call to help somebody in their district or their country or the world: the power of the people in the United States of America through the Constitution, delegated to the Congress, delegated to the House and Senate, delegated to individual House districts, given to Members who win elections. And every Member who walks on this floor, Mr. Speaker, comes because they have won an election, not because they have been appointed by the President or the Speaker or the Governor, but because they have won a free and fair election in the congressional district they wish to represent, and a majority of those voting have said: You are the person. You are the man, you are the woman, to come to Washington. So we are allowed to come up here and take the oath, be sworn in. Then we represent for a 2year term, Mr. Speaker, our constituents, and we have an opportunity to help people. In the 34 years that I have served here, I have done some great things legislatively. But the thing, Mr. Speaker, that I will miss the most, that I will really miss, is, every now and then, when I see something that is injurious to a person in my congressional district that I represent, I will not have the ability any longer to pick up that phone and call on behalf of that person. I will miss that. It is not an entitlement. It is a privilege won by being freely and fairly elected. I have stood for office 17 times. I have won 17 primaries, one primary runoff, 17 general elections. I had the privilege to serve the people of the Sixth District for 34 years. As I said, I 
think, earlier, in the history of the House, we are not sure where I stand in lifetime seniority, but it is in the top 100. I am tied for eighth in terms of senior service from the great State of Texas. I have had the privilege to meet great people. John Dingell, the dean of the House, who served longer than any other person in the history of the House, is a role model for what a Congressman should be. Newt Gingrich, who was a backbencher bombthrower from the Conservative Opportunity Society and rose to be Speaker of the House, is probably the most brilliant person I have met who served in the House: inspirational, innovative, and a visionary. It has been a real privilege to get to know him and call him a friend. b1945 Phil Gramm, who was the Congressman before me for the Sixth District, got elected to the Senate and represented the great State of Texas in the Senate until his retirement a number of years ago. He is another absolutely brilliant man who really has been a role model and a mentor for me. In the current House, our current Speaker, PAULRYAN, I think has done yeoman’s work to move this country in the right direction. The incoming probable Speaker, NANCY PELOSI , we have different views philosophically, but she and I, when she was a junior Member and I was a junior Member, we worked together to pass the Chinese Student Asylum Act that let all of the Chinese students who were here in the country when Tiananmen Square happened, they were allowed to stay in this country legally until it was safe for them to go back to China. Most of them did eventually return home, but some of them did choose to stay here. That is a bill that I worked on, and I am proud that she and I were able to get it passed. The current chairman of my committee, GREG WALDEN , I think he is doing a great job as chairman. I had the privilege to meet wonderful people, like the immediate past chairman, FREDUPTON ; senior Members like J OHN SHIMKUS of Illinois, who has worked so hard on Yucca Mountain. On the other side of the aisle, BOBBY  RUSH from Chicago, a former Black Panther, and I have a bill that passed the House and is standing in the Senate, to reform the strategic petroleum reserve. This afternoon, Mr. Speaker, on this floor, Congresswoman KATHY CASTOR  from Florida and I passed a bill called the IMPROVE Act, but within it are the ACE Kids Act. That bill passed the House 400–11. And if the Senate can pass it this week or next week—and I think they will—that bill will transform the way we provide healthcare for the poorest of the poor children who are already Medicaid eligible. Mr. Speaker, it has been a privilege to serve the House of Representatives for the great people of Texas in the Sixth District for the last 34 years. I consider it the highest honor of my life to have had the title of United States Representative, and I yield back the balance of my time. f

Empower them this day to mount up on wings like eagles, running without weariness and walking without fainting.

Amen.
