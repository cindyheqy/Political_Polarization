Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the campaign rhetoric and politics of the last 7 years now must confront the reality of health care. No political party can repeal the basic economics. All of the features that make health insurance policies better today—the elimination of lifetime limits on health insurance payments; preventing denial for preexisting conditions; charging women the same premium as men, not more; keeping children on their parents’ insurance policies until age 26—are wildly popular, but they all increase the cost of insurance. We cannot allow people to wait until they are sick to get a policy. That undermines the very concept of insurance, hence, the mandate to have health insurance. The truth is that the impact of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in healthcare costs rising more slowly than before the act. We have expanded coverage and subsidized care for millions of Americans, while improving the quality of health insurance. All of these reforms are, in fact, working. A reckless act to repeal something that is now baked into the healthcare system on which millions of Americans rely and benefit from—indeed, the entire system benefits from—would have serious destabilizing effects beyond the loss of coverage for almost 30 million Americans. Republican efforts to weaken Medicaid for the poor and disabled and undermine Medicare for the elderly means that almost 100 million Americans have their health care at risk. We will begin the battle fighting any effort by the new administration and the suddenly empowered Republican majority to act on their campaign rhetoric abolishing ObamaCare but not providing a replacement. A repeal without a clear alternative replacement at the same time is unacceptable. It is not just unacceptable to Democrats in Congress. It is unacceptable to millions of recently insured Americans—in fact, millions found in red States—unacceptable to healthcare professionals, insurance companies, hospitals, and the vast array of other people involved with the healthcare industry. Most importantly, it is unacceptable to our families. The most unpopular feature of ObamaCare was the name, suggesting, perhaps, a simple solution. When identified with the President, the Affordable Care Act provisions were 20 percent more unpopular than when the act was described in exactly the same terms but the name was different. So perhaps we just allow the Republicans to abolish ‘‘ObamaCare’’ and then get back down to work doing what we should have been doing for the last 7 years: making the Affordable Care Act better. By all means, let’s look for ways to make the system less burdensome. We can continue to demand accountability, but allow some competition with valuebased purchasing and negotiation of prescription drug prices by the largest pharmaceutical customer in the world: the Federal Government. Dealing with skyrocketing prescription drug prices and other outrageous practices by some in the pharmaceutical industry will find broad support in and out of Congress. When the Republican majority and the new administration get serious about a replacement that keeps all of their campaign promises and protects the industry from chaos and consumers from loss of essential coverage, there will be plenty of bipartisan cooperation. But any effort of breaking that fundamental promise by denying coverage and upsetting the healthcare applecart will be met with strong opposition, and, ultimately, they will lose. For the sake of the American families and the people who provide health care, not only should they lose, they must lose. We must stand strong and united on that proposition. f 
TRIBUTE TO DEAN BORG The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ) for 5 minutes. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor veteran Iowa journalist Dean Borg and to offer my congratulations on his upcoming retirement from Iowa Public Television’s ‘‘Iowa Press.’’ Dean Borg is a leader in Iowa, in our community, and his contributions to over four decades of ‘‘Iowa Press’’ are unparalleled. His presence on Iowa Public Television’s respected weekly news program will surely be missed. A native of Forest City, Borg attended Iowa State University and began his journalism career at WOI Radio while still a student. Earning degrees in journalism and public education from Iowa State University and the University of Iowa, Borg served as a reporter and later as news director for WMT Radio and WMT Television stations in Cedar Rapids. His career path is an example of how Iowa hard work, talent, and dedication can set you on the path to achieving remarkable successes in life. Dean Borg’s first appearance on ‘‘Iowa Press’’ took place on January 16, 1972, during the program’s fourth episode, as a panelist, while still working for WMT News. The other panelists who joined him that day were Iowa State Representative Frank Bowers, a Democrat from Orange City, and John McCormally, of the Burlington Hawk Eye newspaper. Borg later went on to host the television program for decades, providing the insightful commentary and leadership of discussions with numerous guests from around the State and country. Borg’s commitment to Iowa Public Television, work moderating nationally broadcast Presidential debates and beyond, has set the bar high for aspiring journalists in Iowa and across the country. From his contributions to the show’s decades of broadcasts to his documentary reporting from around the world, Dean Borg has spent a career dedicated to providing folks with national and statewide news. With this type of commitment, it is not surprising Borg has interviewed every President since Lyndon B. Johnson and many of the Presidential contenders who travel through our firstintheNation State. I can attest to Dean Borg’s dedication to his craft personally, as I have had the honor of getting to know him— I have been on the ‘‘Iowa Press’’ show with him—as a Member of Congress and throughout my career working for the people of Iowa. He is the longest serving program host in Iowa Public Television history, a significant feat. He is an awardwinning journalist, an Iowa State distinguished alumnus, and a trailblazer in 
Iowa journalism, defending the craft and defending journalists. While Dean will officially retire from ‘‘Iowa Press’’ this month, I look forward to his return for special occasions and live broadcasts. Dean is the epitome of Iowa nice: a humble, but bold Iowan putting the interests of his fellow Iowans over himself, dedicated to truth, to his craft, and dedicated to service, dedicated to his fellow Iowans. Dean is a very good and true man. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Dean Borg on his distinguished career and wishing him the best in his retirement. Dean, I will miss you. If I don’t see you soon, I will see you at the Iowa State Fair. 
b1015 DANGERS OF REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) for 5 minutes. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to put people before politics. As we speak, the Senate is moving to strip millions of families of their healthcare coverage and replace it with, well, nothing. Now, I know that some of my colleagues ran on a platform of repealing the Affordable Care Act, and now they feel boxed in by politics. But let’s be very clear about this. The political stakes of repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement are nothing compared to the terrible human cost. I would like to share with my colleagues the experience of Suzie Clayton, my constituent from North Canaan, Connecticut. ‘‘The ACA had a huge, positive impact on my life,’’ Suzie wrote to me last week. Because Suzie is a breast cancer survivor, a preexisting condition, it was nearly impossible for her to get decent healthcare coverage before the ACA. ‘‘All that we had put away in retirement funds, nearly $70,000, had to be tapped in order to cover our health costs,’’ she wrote. If it weren’t for the coverage she gained through the Affordable Care Act, she and her husband would have lost everything they had worked for, quite likely, including their home. Instead, with the ACA, her family is once again saving for retirement, completing some overdue home repairs, and getting their medical needs taken care of at an affordable price. All of that will go away if this House follows through on its political crusade to wipe away the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. Mr. Speaker, there are millions of Suzie Claytons in this country, millions of people who will lose their homes, lose their savings, and some will even lose their lives if this Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. In my home State of Connecticut alone, 180,000 people who have gained coverage since the ACA was implemented stand to lose their health care. That includes 43,000 children. Think about that for a moment. If Congress repeals the ACA and doesn’t replace it with anything, 43,000 children just in my State will lose their health coverage. When those children get sick, too many of their parents will be faced with a heartwrenching choice: bankrupt the family to pay for their child’s medical care or go without the health services their child needs to get better. All of us here who are parents know that that isn’t really a choice. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues who are beating the drum for wholesale elimination of the Affordable Care Act: How can you, in good conscience, take away the health care from 43,000 children in my State just to score a political point? How can you throw our healthcare system into chaos just because you are in a political jam? Let’s work together. Let’s work together to improve our healthcare system. Let’s forge a sensible, bipartisan approach to lower healthcare costs and ensure access to quality care for everyone. The politics of ObamaCare, no matter how fraught and divisive, should not, must not take priority over the well being of the American people that we are here to serve. 
WOMEN’S MARCH ON WASHINGTON The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you where I will not be on Inauguration Day. I will not be here or outside at the inauguration ceremony. I will be in Washington late that evening because the event that I am going to is on January 21. It is the Women’s March on Washington. You can get more information on Facebook, which is how I heard about it, or should I say, how my wife, Soraida, heard about it. I said to her a little after the election: You know, honey, I don’t think I can go to D.C. and watch Donald Trump get sworn in. And she said: Oh, you are going to D.C., just not for that. And she told me about the Women’s March. She said: You and I are going together. Now, I can already hear the phones ringing in my office with people calling to say: Oh, you Democrats are sore losers and you just hate Republicans. No. I went to George Bush’s inauguration and I work with Republicans all the time. Just read Breitbart, which seems to write an article anytime I even glance favorably at a Republican colleague. But this is different. I knew that George W. Bush and I would disagree on many issues from trade to health care, to the war in Iraq, but I never thought that George W. Bush was trying to make my own country hostile to me personally, to my wife, to my daughters, to my grandson. I never felt he was a threat to the Nation that I love so deeply and have served now for more than a quarter of a century. The reason that I am not going is that I cannot bring myself to justify morally or intellectually the immense power we are placing in that man’s hands. I could not look at my wife, my daughters, or my grandson in the eye if I sat there and attended as if everything that the candidate said about the women, about the Latinos, the Blacks, the Muslims or any of the other things he said in those speeches and tweets, and that all of that is okay or erased from our collective memory. We all heard the tape when Donald Trump was bragging—bragging—about grabbing women by their private parts without their consent. It is something I just can’t unhear, bragging to that guy on TV that he would grab women below the belt, as if that was hitting on them. Sorry. It is never okay. It is never just locker room talk. It is offensive and, if he ever actually did it, it is a crime. I hang out with Republicans, with Republicanelected officials in an actual locker room in the Rayburn Building, and if they ever started talking like that, I wouldn’t just walk away. I would tell them to their faces that they are wrong, and I wouldn’t allow it to go unnoticed or dismissed as normal or excusable. I don’t know a Republican colleague of mine in this body who would let that type of comment just slide as if it were just okay. So that is why I will hold hands with my wife and march with the women on January 21 in D.C. And that is why I am calling on all of my progressive allies to come and march with the women as well. If you care about a living wage, come and join the women. If you care about the environment, come and join the march. We know as a society that when women win, we all win. So I plan to be there. It is deeply personal and deeply patriotic to march, to make my opinions known by walking with my allies arm in arm. I want to be able to look at my two beautiful Latina daughters and my beautiful halfPuerto Rican, halfMexican, but 100 percent American grandson, Luis Andres, in the eye with a clear conscience. When the new President denigrates Latinos or Mexicans or immigrants as drug dealers and criminals, I want to be able to say that I did not condone or allow that type of speech to go mainstream. That was not normalized on my watch. Because the future President said that the Americanborn children of immigrants were not capable of being American judges, I cannot sit there as if this inauguration is okay and I forgave him. I am deeply honored to return to the U.S. Congress, and I want to thank the people of the Fourth Congressional District. My constituents knew that when 
they voted for me, I would be a fighter; and I don’t intend to let them down. If the new President comes for the Muslims, I will be a Muslim. If they come for Planned Parenthood, I will stand with Planned Parenthood. When they deny climate science, I will make my voice heard. I will use whatever peaceful means available to make sure the words and the actions of our new President do not become the new mainstream and normal in America. That, Mr. Speaker, is why I will not be here for Inauguration Day and why I will be marching with my wife and with a million women from across this country. 
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT—DO NO HARM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA) for 5 minutes. Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise not as a Member of Congress, but as a doctor. When I graduated medical school and took that oath, there are two core ethics that we take when we take that oath: to do good. And that is exactly what we tried to do when this body passed the Affordable Care Act. It was about doing good. It was about giving people basic access to health care. That is a good thing. The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but let’s keep doing good. Let’s fix it. Let’s address the cost of health care. Let’s make sure people can afford their medications. That is doing good. Another core ethic that we take when we enter the profession of medicine as a physician is to do no harm. If this body repeals the Affordable Care Act, we are going to harm 20 million Americans that now have access to health care that didn’t have it prior to the Affordable Care Act. We shouldn’t do harm. Let me put it into real context. I am a primary care internist. My wife is also a primary care internist. You can tell we have exciting conversations at our house. I was asking her the other day what the Affordable Care Act meant to her as a physician, and she was sharing a story of a patient that she had cared for for years. This was a patient that had diabetes and hypertension, high blood pressure. We know these are silent killers. If you don’t control your diabetes, if you don’t control your blood pressure, it can have devastating consequences leading to heart attacks, leading to strokes. It is one of the leading causes of death in America. But if you control it, you can prevent all of these illnesses and people can live a normal, healthy life. So my wife—she is a very good doctor—had her patient under good control. The patient stopped coming in to see her—maybe the patient moved away or something happened—for a couple of years. And then about 2 years ago, the patient came back in. Once she came in, her blood sugars, her diabetes was out of control; her blood pressure was out of control. My wife looked at this patient and just said: Well, what happened? How come you stopped taking your diabetes medicine? How come you stopped taking your blood pressure medicine? She said: Well, Doc, in the recession, I lost my job. I lost my health insurance coverage. I couldn’t get the medications. And then she said: But you know what? With the Affordable Care Act with Covered California, I was able to get health insurance again. I was able to come in and see you. It wasn’t too late for this patient. My wife was able to get her back on her medications, get her back on her blood pressure medicine, get her blood pressure and diabetes under control, and, hopefully, there is no permanent damage. But if we do harm and repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to do irreparable damage to 20 million and more Americans who are just like this patient, who need their health care covered, who need their access to medications. That is what this is about. Mr. Speaker, let’s do what we are trained to do as physicians and what this body should do. Let’s do good by making sure people have better coverage, affordable coverage, and better access to health care. Let’s definitely make sure we do not do any harm by repealing the Affordable Care Act. Let’s make sure we fix it and make it better. 
STATE SPONSORS OF TERROR REVIEW ENHANCEMENT ACT—115TH CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) for 5 minutes. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, today I will reintroduce my bill, the State Sponsors of Terrorism Review Enhancement Act. This legislation passed the full House last Congress unanimously. I hope this Chamber will once again take up this commonsense legislation and pass it as soon as possible. The designation of a foreign government as a ‘‘State Sponsor of Terrorism’’ is one of the United States’ most powerful statements that we can give on another statement. Besides imposing sanctions, the stamp of ‘‘State Sponsor of Terrorism’’ labels a state untouchable to the international community. b1030 This pariah status is much deserved as these are states that support the killing of innocent people as a matter of policy. Under current law, in order for a state to be delisted, the President of the United States only needs to certify that the country being considered for delisting has not engaged in supporting terrorism for a paltry 6 months. We are talking 6 months to be delisted. Considering the heinous acts of violence these countries have supported in the past, we should not be allowing them to be delisted after only 6 months. To address this, my legislation will— and, again, it passed last Congress unanimously—quadruple the time a designated country must refrain from sponsoring terrorism, before the President can remove it from the sponsor list, from 6 to 24 months; increase congressional oversight by doubling the time Congress has to review the President’s proposed removal from 45 to 90 days; establish a uniform process through which Congress can disapprove of the President’s decision to remove a country from that list; and require the administration to notify and brief Congress upon initiating a review of a designated country’s potential removal from the list. This legislation will assert congressional scrutiny and oversight and hopefully bring to an end politically motivated delistings. Successive administrations—both Republican and Democrat alike—delisted countries based on their presidency’s legacy rather than the facts. This will stop absurd delistings like that of North Korea in 2008. North Korea was delisted in exchange for their promises of dismantling their nuclear program. However, 9 years and 5 nuclear tests later, they remain off the list. This rescission from the list has enabled North Korea to engage in supporting terrorism abroad. By increasing the amount of time for a state to not be engaged in terrorism and increasing congressional oversight and scrutiny, my legislation will not allow mistakes such as this delisting of North Korea’s to take place. I want to remind people that this passed unanimously, and we hope that we will get the support again. 
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION NOMINEE BETSY DEVOS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today to join my colleagues from the great State of Ohio. I come here because we have a statement that we want to make to voice to not only the citizens of Ohio but to this great country. I am honored to join Congresswoman MARCY KAPTUR and Congresswoman MARCIA FUDGE , two women who have been in the battle for our citizens, but, more importantly, for our students, for education, and for our teachers. So today, Mr. Speaker, I demand that Betsy DeVos, Presidentelect Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Education, repay the $5.3 million—yes, Mr. Speaker, I am going to say that again—$5.3 million in fines owed by her political action committee, All Children Matter, to my home State of Ohio. 
The PAC’s contempt for Ohio campaign finance laws by illegally funneling contributions from a nationwide PAC to an unregistered Ohio affiliate is troublesome. And its refusal to pay these fines to the State of Ohio is disgraceful as the debt is nearly a decade old. Can you imagine what would happen if a student refused to pay something that they owed to a university or to the State? I don’t have to answer that. We all know what would happen. Mr. Speaker, I ask: How can the public trust Ms. DeVos to ensure borrowers repay their student loans in a timely manner when the group she chaired failed to pay fines that were imposed nearly a decade ago? The fines owed to the State of Ohio—the $5.3 million—belongs to the taxpayers of Ohio. And every time, Mr. Speaker, I say $5.3 million, I am going to say it twice because she owes $5.3 million that belongs to the taxpayers of Ohio. This is money that could be used to pay for more teachers and other initiatives to help educate Ohio’s children. We cannot let her skirt the system and cheat Ohio taxpayers. No, we cannot let her be nominated and confirmed to be over our educational system. I urge her to repay the $5.3 million in fines prior to her Senate confirmation hearing next week. 
PRESIDENTELECT TRUMP’S CABINET The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, in America, we expect no one to be above the law. But, what happens if someone is super rich and breaks the law? Today, I rise to place on the Record a demand that the Presidentelect’s Cabinet nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos of Michigan, immediately pay fines she owes to the State of Ohio. These obligations total $5.3 million, just as Congresswoman JOYCE BEATTY  stated in her opening statement, and also Congresswoman MARCIA FUDGE , who will speak subsequent to my own remarks. This is an enormous amount of money owed to the State of Ohio in unpaid fines and levied late penalties for Ms. DeVos’ political organization for campaign finance violations in Ohio. They broke Ohio law. These are the largest fines ever levied in Ohio history, dating back to 2008. Essentially, the political organization Ms. DeVos led violated Ohio’s election laws. Betsy DeVos of Michigan was in charge of the political action committee known as All Children Matter, based in Virginia. During her chairwomanship, she broke Ohio’s election laws which impose spending donation limits of $10,000 per candidate. She, in fact, violated those limits by funneling national PAC money, over $870,000 of it, to Ohio’s State candidates—incidentally, all Republican candidates. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  these names and the amounts of money they received.

Ms. KAPTUR. All these candidates pledged to advocate for privatizing public school education through vouchers once elected into office. The Ohio Election Commission, comprised of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, swiftly and unanimously levied a record fine against her organization in 2008. Their decision was subsequently vetted and upheld by a Republican judge in a State court. Yet, now nearly a decade later, neither Betsy DeVos nor All Children Matter has paid their penalty of $5.3 million to the citizens of Ohio. Indeed, the State of Ohio prior to her violations had even informed Ms. DeVos by issuing a legal opinion that such contributions from her national PAC would be illegal to State candidates, and she willfully ignored them and that opinion. No one, no matter how wealthy, should be above the law. And who exactly were the State candidates that received a direct campaign contribution from Betsy DeVos’ political action committee All Children Matter? You will notice a few candidates still serving in Ohio office, including Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor, Secretary of State Jon Husted, State Treasurer Josh Mandel, and Ohio Senate President Keith Faber. Former Ohio gubernatorial candidate J. Kenneth Blackwell also received a direct contribution. Mr. Blackwell now leads the Presidentelect’s domestic policy transition team. In addition, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Betsy DeVos gave direct contributions to at least 20 current Members of the United States Senate. These are the same Senators who will now confirm her for her Secretary of Education position. Talk about pay to play and a real need to drain the swamp, the Presidentelect ought to start in his own backyard. The $5.3 million fine that Betsy DeVos’ political organization owes to Ohio could pay for better education for Ohio’s children. It is outrageous that a candidate for Secretary of Education holds herself above the law and fails to make good on outstanding fines imposed nearly 10 years ago. Public records indicate she personally has a net worth of over $5.1 billion. The New York Times today has a front page story by Noam Scheiber that includes a quote from a writer and scholar who observes about the life of Ms. DeVos. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  this article as well. 
[From the New York Times, Jan. 9, 2017] BETSY DEVOS, TRUMP ’SEDUCATION PICK, PLAYS HARDBALL WITHHERWEALTH  (By Noam Scheiber) After Tom Casperson, a Republican state senator from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, began running for Congress in 2016, he assumed the family of Betsy DeVos, President elect Donald J. Trump’s nominee to be education secretary, would not oppose him. The DeVoses, a dominant force in Michigan politics for decades with a fortune in the billions, had contributed to one of Mr. Casperson’s earlier campaigns. But a week before his primary, family members sent $24,000 to one of his opponents, then poured $125,000 into a ‘‘super PAC,’’ Concerned Taxpayers of America, that ran ads attacking him. The reason, an intermediary told Mr. Casperson: his support from organized labor. ‘‘Deceitful, dishonest and cowardly,’’ was how Mr. Casperson’s campaign described the ads, complaining that the groups running them ‘‘won’t say who they are or where their money is coming from.’’ On Primary Day, Mr. Casperson went down to defeat. In announcing his intention to nominate Ms. DeVos, Mr. Trump described her as ‘‘a brilliant and passionate education advocate.’’ Even critics characterized her as a dedicated, if misguided, activist for school reform. But that description understates both the breadth of Ms. DeVos’s political interests and the influence she wields as part of her powerful family. More than anyone else who has joined the incoming Trump administration, she represents the combination of wealth, freemarket ideology and political hardball associated with a betterknown family of billionaires: Charles and David Koch. ‘‘They have this moralized sense of the free market that leads to this total program to turn back the ideas of the New Deal, the welfare state,’’ Kim PhillipsFein, a historian who has written extensively about the conservative movement, said, describing the DeVoses. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed for this article. Like the Kochs, the DeVoses are generous supporters of think tanks that evangelize for unrestrained capitalism, like Michigan’s Acton Institute, and that rail against unions and back privatizing public services, like the Mackinac Center. They have also funded national groups dedicated to cutting back the role of government, including the National Center for Policy Analysis (which has pushed for Social Security privatization and against environmental regulation) and the Institute for Justice (which challenges regulations in court and defends school vouchers). Both organizations have also received money from the Koch family. 
Indeed, the DeVoses’ education activism, which favors alternatives to traditional public schools, appears to derive from the same freemarket views that inform their suspicion of government. And perhaps more than other rightwing billionaires, the DeVoses couple their seeding of ideological causes with an aggressive brand of political spending. Half a dozen or more extended family members frequently coordinate contributions to maximize their impact. In the 2016 cycle alone, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, the family spent roughly $14 million on political contributions to state and national candidates, parties, PACs and super PACs. All of this would make Ms. DeVos—whose confirmation hearing has been delayed until next week amid mounting pressure that her government ethics review be completed beforehand—very different from past education secretaries. ‘‘She is the most emblematic kind of oligarchic figure you can put in a cabinet position,’’ said Jeffrey Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies economic elites. ‘‘What she and the Kochs have in common is the unbridled use of wealth power to achieve whatever political goals they have.’’ 
BIRTH OF A POWER COUPLE  Ms. DeVos, 59, grew up in Holland, Mich., the daughter of a conservative auto parts magnate who was an early founder of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group. When she married Dick DeVos in 1979, it was akin to a merger between two royal houses of western Michigan. Her husband’s father, Richard Sr., co founder of the multilevel marketing company Amway, was an active member of the Christian Reformed Church that preached a mix of social conservatism and selfreliance. He once told the church’s official magazine that Chicago’s poor dwelled in slums because that was ‘‘the way they choose to live,’’ according to a Washington Post story from the 1980s. A fan of RollsRoyces and pinkie rings, Richard Sr. wrote books with titles like ‘‘Ten Powerful Phrases for Positive People.’’ A similar air hung over his business. Amway sales representatives, which the company calls ‘‘independent business owners,’’ make money both by selling the company’s products—everything from perfume to toilet bowl cleaner—and by recruiting other sales representatives. The Federal Trade Commission once investigated the company for running a pyramid scheme before concluding that it had misled potential recruits about how much they could expect to earn. The flip side of the family’s proselytizing for capitalism, according to Professor PhillipsFein, has been an effort to dismantle much ‘‘that would counterbalance the power of economic elites.’’ Amway funded a nationwide ad campaign in the early 1980s, protesting high taxes and regulations. Not long after, the company pleaded guilty to cheating the Canadian government out of more than $20 million in revenue. The family had a more winning public face in Dick DeVos, who combined the practiced empathy of a pitchman with the entitlement of an heir, spending over $30 million on an unsuccessful run for governor of Michigan in 2006. The Detroit Free Press described him that year as the wealthiest man to seek office in the state’s modern history. Betsy DeVos, who served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party for most of the decade between 1996 and 2005, has often played the role of strategist in the relationship. She was a key adviser in her husband’s run for governor and publicly brooded that he had been too gentlemanly in his first debate against the incumbent. ‘‘He’s very good with people, a retail politician who looks you in the eye, shakes your hand, listens to what you say,’’ said Randy Richardville, a former Republican leader of the Michigan Senate, describing the couple’s strengths. ‘‘I would never underestimate Betsy DeVos in a knife fight.’’ Ms. DeVos has sometimes lacked her husband’s finesse, once famously blaming many of the state’s economic woes on ‘‘high wages.’’ She has won detractors, by their account, by browbeating legislators into voting her way. ‘‘Betsy DeVos was like my 4yearold granddaughter at the time,’’ said Mike Pumford, a former Republican state representative who once clashed with her. ‘‘They were both sweet ladies as long as they kept hearing the word ‘yes.’ They turned into spoiled little brats when they were told ‘no.’’’ But Ms. DeVos has often made up for what she lacks in tact through sheer force of will. Mr. Richardville said he and Ms. DeVos disagreed over term limits, which she supported as party chairwoman and he opposed: ‘‘I said, ‘I don’t think you should be setting policy. You should be supporting those of us who do make policy.’ But she never backed down.’’ While Dick and Betsy DeVos appear to practice a more tolerant form of Christianity than their parents—Ms. DeVos has spoken out against antigay bigotry—as recently as the early 2000s they funded some groups like Focus on the Family, a large ministry that helps set the political agenda for conservative evangelicals. They have also backed groups that promote conservative values to students and Christian education, including one with ties to the Christian Reformed Church. Their economic views are strikingly similar to the elder Mr. DeVos’s. According to federal disclosures, Amway, which Dick DeVos ran between 1993 and 2002, has lobbied frequently over the last 20 years to reduce or repeal the estate tax. Only the top 0.2 percent wealthiest estates paid the tax in 2015. The company has also opposed crackdowns on tax shelters. Ms. DeVos has been an outspoken defender of unlimited contributions known as soft money, which she described in a 1997 editorial as ‘‘hardearned American dollars that Big Brother has yet to find a way to control.’’ After Congress later passed a major campaign finance reform bill, a nonprofit that Ms. DeVos helped to create and fund masterminded the strategy that produced Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision laying the groundwork for super PACs funded by corporations, unions and individuals to raise and spend unlimited amounts in elections. And then there are the family’s efforts to rein in the labor movement. Through their contributions to think tanks like the Mackinac Center, as well as Mr. DeVos’s direct prodding of Republican legislators, the family played a key role in helping pass Michigan’s socalled rightto work legislation in 2012. The legislation largely ended the requirement that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment. Unions in the state bled members in 2014, the first full year the measure was in effect. Allies say the DeVoses fight for their beliefs. ‘‘Betsy and Dick see themselves as principled conservatives,’’ said Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute. ‘‘It kind of seems healthy and admirable to give resources to folks who are going to fight for causes you believe in.’’ But the fights can appear to be as much about consolidating power as ideology. Unions were arguably the family’s most formidable political opponent in Michigan, one of labor’s traditional strongholds. CHANGES IN MICHIGAN  The DeVos family’s roots as education activists date back at least to when Richard DeVos Sr. was running Amway and an institute based at the company’s headquarters trained teachers to inject freemarket principles into their curriculum. According to an interview Ms. DeVos gave to Philanthropy magazine, she and her husband became interested in education causes when they began visiting a Christian school that served lowincome children in Grand Rapids in the 1980s. ‘‘If we could choose the right school for our kids’’—by which she appeared to mean primarily private schools—‘‘it only seemed fair that they could do the same for theirs,’’ she told the magazine. The family spent millions of dollars on a ballot proposal in 2000 asking if Michigan should legalize vouchers, in which students can use taxpayer money to attend private schools. Many critics, like the education historian Diane Ravitch, argue that the point of vouchers is to destroy public education and teachers’ unions. The group Americans United for Separation of Church and State has documented how conservative Christians have long supported vouchers, which could fund religious schools. After voters objected by more than a two toone ratio, Dick DeVos gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation saying such efforts would have to shift to state legislatures, where groups backed by deeppocketed donors could offer ‘‘a political consequence for opposition, and political reward for support of education reform issues.’’ It is not unusual for the wealthy—who devote nearly 50 percent of their philanthropic dollars to education, according to the group WealthX—to spend aggressively in the political realm to impose their preferred reforms. Even by these standards, however, the DeVoses stand out for the amount of money they spend trying to advance their goals through politics rather than philanthropy, such as research into reforms or subsidizing schools. As Sarah Reckhow, an expert on education philanthropy at Michigan State University, put it: ‘‘The DeVoses are like: ‘No, we know what we want. We don’t need to have all this window dressing.’’’ Ms. DeVos has led two nonprofits that have spent millions of dollars electing governors and legislators sympathetic to school vouchers around the country. Matt Frendewey, a spokesman for one of the groups, said the efforts had frequently been bipartisan, and that the amount of money they had spent has been dwarfed by contributions from teachers’ unions opposed to reform. Yet in Michigan, at least, the family’s political strategy has not been subtle. After he defied Ms. DeVos on a key charter school vote, Mr. Pumford, the former Republican legislator, survived an effort by the Great Lakes Education Project, a nonprofit the DeVoses bankrolled, to defeat him in his 2002 primary. But shortly after, the House speaker told him the Education Committee chairmanship he coveted would not be forthcoming. ‘‘I said, ‘Why?’’’ Mr. Pumford recalled. ‘‘He said: ‘You know why. The DeVoses will walk away from us.’’’ Mr. Pumford added: ‘‘She told me that was going to happen.’’ 
(Rick Johnson, the House speaker, said he did not recall the conversation but also that he had not promised Mr. Pumford the chairmanship and would not have explained his reasons for withholding it.) Over time, the Great Lakes Education Project helped elect Republican majorities sympathetic to the DeVoses’ agenda. But the DeVoses’ lobbyists and operatives also discovered less messy ways to advance legislation. Late one night of their last workweek in 2015, the Michigan House and Senate were about to approve some uncontroversial changes to campaign finance law, when the bill abruptly grew by more than 40 pages. After the legislators discovered what they had voted for, many said they were horrified. Tucked away in the new pages was a provision that would have made it much harder for local bodies like school boards to raise money through property tax increases. ‘‘Michigan schools will likely suffer the brunt of the impact because the vast majority rely on periodic voter approval of local operating levy renewals for property taxes,’’ the ratings agency Moody’s wrote of the measure the following month. ‘‘I was fooled into voting for something I opposed,’’ said Dave Pagel, a Republican representative. ‘‘I consider it the worst vote I’ve made.’’ The chief culprits, according to Mr. Pagel and others at the state Capitol when the bill passed, were lobbyists closely tied to the DeVoses. Tony Daunt, a spokesman for the Michigan Freedom Fund, a nonprofit headed by the DeVoses’ longtime political aide, and whose political spending arm they have funded generously, said the group was ‘‘part of the discussion process with people in the legislature’’ about the proposal and ‘‘had consistently expressed support for the policy.’’ The law was later blocked by a federal judge, but the group has vowed to try again. 
RADICAL SUSPICIONS  Ms. DeVos’s advocates see in these fights the toughness to take on entrenched opponents of expanding reforms like charter schools and vouchers. In promoting Ms. DeVos in The Washington Post, Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee, emphasized that her wealth gave her the independence to be ‘‘someone who isn’t financially biased shaping education.’’ He added, ‘‘DeVos doesn’t need the job now, nor will she be looking for an education job later.’’ But critics see someone with an unmistakable agenda. ‘‘The signs are there that she will do something radical,’’ said Jack Jennings, a former general counsel for the House education committee. ‘‘Trump wouldn’t have appointed this woman for this position if he didn’t intend something radical.’’ 
Ms. KAPTUR. The article states: ‘‘She is the most emblematic kind of oligarchic figure you can put in a cabinet position. . . . What she and the Kochs have in common is the unbridled use of wealth power to achieve whatever political goals they have.’’ If confirmed, Betsy DeVos would be responsible for administering our Nation’s student loan portfolio and would have to ensure borrowers repay their loans in a timely manner. Yet, how can we believe she will demonstrate sound judgment in her responsibilities or be a role model when her own political organization has blatantly avoided paying legally obligated fines for her violations of Ohio’s election laws? Mr. Speaker, Betsy DeVos’ attempt to subvert the law and buy influence are diametrically opposed to everything the Presidentelect advised was wrong with America. He wants to drain the swamp. No one in America should be above the law, and neither should Betsy DeVos be above the law. She ought to pay the $5.3 million she owes the people of Ohio. f 
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION NOMINEE BETSY DEVOS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. FUDGE ) for 5 minutes. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues, Representatives BEATTY and K APTUR , to address the Secretary of Education. Mr. Speaker, Betsy DeVos is an imminent and present danger to all of America’s children. She does not support public schools. Public schools are where 93 percent or better of all America’s children attend. She opposes increased accountability and transparency in forprofit schools, and has a privatization agenda that can set public education back more than 50 years. Even more alarming, she breaks laws and does not pay her bills. DeVos has owed my home State of Ohio $5.3 million since 2008 for violating campaign finance laws. Despite repeated attempts to collect the money, she has failed to pay those fines. As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, I am deeply concerned about DeVos’ nomination for Secretary of Education. As a member of the Ohio delegation, I am appalled by her deliberate refusal to pay millions in fines she owes our State. We cannot give the purse strings of America’s education system to someone only concerned with her own bank account. And we cannot entrust the future of our children to a person who breaks the law, cozies up to Wall Street, and calls public schools, which I believe are the bedrock of our education system, a dead end. I urge my Senate colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on DeVos. The future of our country and our children are at stake. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day. As the early days of the 115th Congress play out, we are mindful and grateful that our Nation has once again experienced something so often lacking in our world’s experience: the peaceful transition of government. Though major change of party control did not take place in this Chamber, it is still the American experience that our streets are peaceful and winners and losers of elections move on with their lives in dignity. We thank You again for the inspiration of our Nation’s Founders and the legacy they left us with. May the Members of this assembly, and all Americans, be worthy of that legacy. And may all that is done in the people’s House be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. BERGMAN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
SWEARING IN OF MEMBERELECT The SPEAKER. Will the Representativeelect please present himself in the well. Mr. SCHRADER of Oregon appeared at the bar of the House and took the oath of office, as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations. You are now a Member of the 115th Congress. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express strong opposition to any attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In North Carolina, more than 552,000 people have gained affordable health care through the Affordable Care Act. One of those residents is Mrs. Darlene Harris of Charlotte, North Carolina, who was born with a hole in her heart. Each and every breath she has taken has been a miracle. When her heart was beats away from rupturing, her husband’s insurance saved her life. Following his death, Darlene tried to cope without that insurance, gambling with her own life. Thanks to the ACA, she is free from that awful burden. A repeal of the Affordable Care Act would condemn millions of hardworking Americans and their loved ones to the nightmare of the past when preexisting conditions were not covered. It is imperative that we not ignore the pleas of our fellow Americans. It has and will continue to save the lives of our family, neighbors, and friends. I urge my colleagues to absolutely object to any repeal of the Affordable Care Act. f 
THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, this week kicks off the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. As a car guy all my life, I never missed the world’s premier automotive event, the greatest show on Earth. This year there is plenty to celebrate. Just yesterday, Fiat Chrysler announced it would create 2,000 jobs and invest $1 billion to modernize manufacturing plants in Michigan and Ohio. Last week, Ford scrapped plans for its facility in Mexico and instead promised to invest $700 million at the Flat Rock plant. This move will bring 700 new jobs to Michigan. These are exciting developments for our State’s economy and good paying jobs for our dedicated and talented workforce. Mr. Speaker, as everyone will see at this year’s auto show, Michigan continues to lead the way in car manufacturing. Working together, we can keep Michigan on the forefront of innovation and mobility and keep making the best cars and trucks in the world right in our backyard, the motor capital of the world. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let’s not make America sick again. I am deeply disappointed my Republican colleagues are moving forward with their plan to undo the historic progress we have made by expanding health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, repealing it and leaving millions of Americans with no coverage. While repeal and replace was an abstract talking point for years, it is clear that there is no plan for replacement, no plan. The new phrase ‘‘repeal and delay’’ will, in effect, be repeal and chaos, with no plan in place. Repeal will have reallife, personal impact on 30 million Americans who will stand to lose their health insurance. The options for the 129 million Americans with preexisting conditions who have newfound health security would disappear. We would be returning to a time of lifetime limits, annual caps for care, and consumers will be sold junk health plans at high costs. Not only will the newly insured suffer, repeal would destabilize the individual health insurance market and send the healthcare system into disarray. Let’s don’t make America sick again. Let’s have no repeal without a replacement. f 
THANK YOU TO MICHIGAN’S FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say thank you to the people of Michigan’s First Congressional District for giving me the opportunity to represent them in Congress. I would also like to thank my wife, Cindy, and our children and grandchildren for their constant and unwavering support. It is truly an honor and a privilege to be here, and I am so humbled to be doing the people’s work in the House of Representatives. I came to Congress not only to restore common sense and fiscal sanity to the Federal Government but, most importantly, to serve the constituents of Michigan’s First District and to be their voice in Washington. We have a new opportunity ahead of us to bring industry and prosperity back to the American people, but it is up to us here in Congress to do the work and put in the long hours it will take to get there. My promise today is that I will work tirelessly for my district and do everything I can to make sure we are leaving a better country for our children and grandchildren. Again, thank you to the people of Michigan’s First Congressional District for this opportunity. 
DON’T TURN YOUR BACK ON MILLIONS OF FAMILIES (Ms. TSONGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, millions of Americans have gained access to valuable healthcare services, and every American has seen their health insurance benefits improve. While there are ways the Affordable Care Act can be improved, we cannot afford to go back to the days when big insurance companies had the power to decide what care Americans could receive, deny coverage to children with diagnosed conditions, cancel coverage 
when people got sick, and place limits on the amount of care people can receive. Last week, Carol Lodi from Harvard, Massachusetts, in my district, called and told her story. She and her husband gained healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act. She is 61. Her husband is 63. They are selfemployed. She said: ‘‘If we lose the insurance, we don’t know what we’ll do.’’ Mr. Speaker, please listen to the Lodi family and millions of other families like them. Don’t turn your back on them and make America sick again. 
HONORING DR. PRISCILLA THOMAS (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Priscilla Thomas, a commissioner in Chatham County, Georgia, a champion of our area’s local youth and a Savannah native. In 1990, Dr. Thomas was first elected to serve as a commissioner in Chatham County. During her tenure, she became chairman pro tem and later the first minority and female vice chairman. However, long before she entered government, Dr. Thomas was already dedicated to creating more opportunities and better lives for young people. She worked as a principal at Haven Elementary School in Savannah after earning her Ph.D. in educational administration from the University of North America. When she was elected to serve as commissioner in 1990, she continued to use her passion for young people to provide entertaining and enlightening activities for them, including the Chatham County Youth Commission and the Summer Bonanza Partnership. On December 16, 2016, Dr. Thomas attended her final county commission meeting and retired from her 26 years as a Chatham County commissioner. She will always be remembered for being one of the toughest, fairest, and most wellinformed members of our local government and for her 60 years serving young people. She certainly will be missed. 
OPPOSING THE CONFIRMATION OF JEFF SESSIONS AS ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the confirmation of JEFFSESSIONS as Attorney General. In a 2006 speech, thenSenator SESSIONS wrongfully misstated: ‘‘Fundamentally, almost no one coming from the Dominican Republic to the United States is coming here because they have a provable skill that would benefit us and that would indicate their likely success in our society.’’ When I was 9 years old, Mr. Speaker, I immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic without any papers, and now I am a Member of the U.S. Congress. Mr. SESSIONS , have I not succeeded in America? On behalf of millions of Dominican Americans and notable Americans such as fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, Pulitzer Prize winner Junot Diaz, Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, and baseball giant Big Papi, I stand here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives as a proud Dominican American. I say to Mr. SESSIONS : you are wrong, wrong in thinking, and wrong for our country. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the confirmation of JEFFSESSIONS as Attorney General. Hateful speech and racist rhetoric have no place in our American society. 
b1215 NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to our Nation’s law enforcement men and women. I respect and appreciate the important work of our police throughout the Nation who are charged with the critical work of protecting the people in our States and our local communities. The heartbreaking violent targeting of our Nation’s police officers, recently, demonstrates the dangers these men and women face every day. Every American is so proud as our many neighbors and fellow citizens get up every morning, put on their local law enforcement uniform and badge, kiss their families goodbye, and go out and serve us, keeping our cities and towns safe, trying to build trust and faith among all of our citizens. Monday was National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and our law enforcement men and women in Arkansas and throughout the country deserve our gratitude and respect. I proudly displayed a blue light in my office window to honor our law enforcement men and women, and I thank them for their selfless service. 
FORT LAUDERDALE AIRPORT SHOOTING (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, last week, we observed a moment of silence to remember the victims 6 years after the Tucson shooting. Just yesterday, another moment of silence to remember the five people killed and six wounded when they were shot while waiting at the Fort Lauderdale Airport baggage claim. In those awful moments after the shooting, the airport was thrown into chaos and confusion. Yet, before we knew anything of the circumstances, every American could tell you what would come next because Congress has developed a wellworn routine in response to gun violence: first, shocking news of a deadly shooting, followed by thoughts and prayers, followed by a moment of silence on this floor, followed by a complete failure to take action. To truly honor the victims, moments of silence must be followed by productive discussions of policy: What will we do to keep our community safer? I ask my Republican colleagues, meet with me. Let’s at least start a conversation here on the House floor. We can no longer remain silent during this epidemic of gun violence. Thoughts and prayers are all that we have offered the American people, and that is not enough. f 
OBAMACARE (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the families that are feeling the burden of ObamaCare. Premiums have skyrocketed an average of 19 percent in our State, and insurers are fleeing the market left and right. In fact, 73 percent of counties in Florida only have one insurance provider, leaving people with higher costs and less choice when it comes to their health care. That is why the President’s healthcare law has failed the people of Florida. Now, Republicans are offering up solid solutions to make our Nation’s healthcare system work for everyone, without pulling the rug from anybody’s feet. We are focused on a more affordable, more personalized healthcare plan that empowers patients, not Washington. I am proud to serve on the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee as we begin our first steps this week to bring relief to the people of Florida and our Nation. 
OBAMACARE (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, as we were home over the Christmas holiday break, so many calls that came into my office dealt with the ObamaCare issue—the rise in premiums, the lack of affordability. Here is one example. A 64yearold man, his premiums $30,000, deductible $12,000—indeed, too expensive to afford and too expensive to use. But we do have a plan for repealing and replacing. You will find it at A Better Way. This will help lift the financial burden from many Americans 
who are currently facing high costs due to ObamaCare. Our plan allows patients greater access to affordable care and affordable insurance. Our next step includes my legislation, H.R. 314. It is the Health Care Choice Act of 2017. What it will do is allow greater access, more choice, and more options by allowing acrossState line purchasing of health insurance. You find the plan that is most suited to you and your family at a price that you can afford. It is time for us to repeal and replace with good patientcentered options. 
PRESIDENTELECT DONALD TRUMP’S PROMISE TO BUILD A WALL WITH MEXICO AND MAKE THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT PAY FOR IT (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, you might recall, during the campaign, President elect Donald Trump promised to build a wall with Mexico and, of course, make the Mexican Government pay for it. Well, now we are hearing that Republicans intend to come to this body, Congress, to spend your hardearned money and mine, American taxpayer money, to build a wall with Mexico. They are estimating $10 billion to $12 billion. Well, do you know what? In comprehensive immigration reform, which I was proud to support last session, we had over $40 billion for border security. So apparently Donald Trump is building onequarter of the wall, all directly with deficit spending. In comprehensive immigration reform, we not only paid for that border security, not only paid for that $40 billion and required people who were here illegally to pay fines and register and get right with the law, it actually would reduce the budget deficit by over $200 billion over 10 years. So what we have is onequarter of the wall and deficit spending with Donald Trump. With Democrats, four times the wall and reduce the deficit by $200 billion. Mr. Speaker, the choice is obvious. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, a day we set aside to thank those who risk their lives to protect our communities nationwide. These men and women are the hidden heroes of our country, and they deserve our respect and our gratitude. When they put on their badge and kiss their family goodbye each day, these officers have no certainty that they will return home safely. They willingly face that risk to keep the rest of us safe. This past year, 135 law enforcement officers made the ultimate sacrifice. One of those courageous individuals was our own Officer Scot Fitzgerald, who lost his life serving on duty with the South Jacksonville Police Department, located in my district. Last night, throughout the Capitol, blue lights were lit to honor our heroes in blue. In my office, we lit our blue candle in remembrance of fallen Officer Scot Fitzgerald. In 2016, more officers lost their lives on duty than in any of the previous 5 years. Let us show our admiration and appreciation to the sworn law enforcement officers across the State of Illinois and the 900,000 who serve and face danger in the United States every day. Not just this week, but throughout the year, we need to honor our law enforcement officials. f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO JUDGE BRUCE MOSIER (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I sadly rise today to pay tribute to Judge Bruce Mosier, who lost his life yesterday; to his lovely and beautiful wife, Diane; beautiful daughter; and extended family. The whole of Harris County in Texas loved and respected Judge Bruce Mosier. Oh, he was a strong and vibrant Democrat, but he was a man that, whenever you called upon him, he would serve. He loved the law, practiced, and continued to represent individuals, many of whom could not help themselves. And, of course, he stood by his wife’s side, championing every effort she made to empower people to vote. He was a stalwart in the last Presidential election. He continued to encourage and support all of us to do what is right and to ensure the rights of all people to vote. Judge Bruce Mosier served his neighborhood, served his county, served his State, and served this Nation. I will miss Judge Mosier. I will miss his friendly smile and his kindness, his willingness to help those who were just starting in their political or legal career, his willingness to lift up this country and to be the kind of American that always had an open mind to anyone, no matter how different they might be. So today, my dear friend, Judge Bruce Mosier, may you rest in peace. Diane, we will continue to love you and honor his legacy, work with you to continue his dreams and aspirations, and encourage those in this Nation, our county, and our State to be participatory participants in the wonderment of democracy in this Nation that is, that was, Judge Bruce Mosier. REPEAL OBAMACARE (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, on November 8, the American people gave my party control of the entire Congress and the White House because of the promisebreaking, jobkilling law known as ObamaCare—the craziest thing in the whole world, according to President Bill Clinton. The fearmongers on the other side are telling Americans they will lose their health care in a snap. They should talk to Martha. Martha is a selfemployed CPA who developed a nasty leukemia a couple of years ago. She was told to get ready for the end of her life. A miracle happened. Experimental treatment reduced her cancer from grade III to grade I. The drugs to save her life cost $15,000 per month. On October 20, because of ObamaCare, she was told that she had to pay 50 percent of that cost instead of 30 percent. That is tough for her to afford. Martha got to hold her fifth grandkid this past summer. House Republicans want her to hold her sixth and seventh grandkid in the future. We have our orders to repeal ObamaCare. It is time to go to work. 
ELK COUNTY CATHOLIC STUDENTS PERFORM AT PEARL HARBOR (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize seven Elk County Catholic High School band students who performed on December 7 at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for the 75th anniversary of the tragic attacks that brought the United States into World War II. This anniversary marks one of the major milestones, which may be one of the few opportunities for survivors of the attacks to participate. Elk County Catholic represented the Commonwealth, alongside the survivors of the USS Pennsylvania, one of the eight battleships in Pearl Harbor on that fateful day in 1941. I am so proud of how the students paid tribute to World War II veterans who served at Pearl Harbor and all of the military men and women that fought for our Nation. This event was especially close to the heart of baritone saxophone player, Luke Ferragine, whose grandfather is a World War II veteran. Also performing in the honor band was Emily Miller, Kendra Smithbauer, Holly Kim, Andrew Wingard, Simon Glatt, and Nathan Schlosser. Congratulations to each of them. 
CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF GIVING BY FRIENDS OF ST. JUDE— MIAMI (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10th anniversary of the founding of Friends of St. Jude—Miami. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, located in Memphis, Tennessee, is a leading institution in the fight against pediatric cancer and other diseases that harm children. Friends of St. Jude—Miami is made up of young professionals in south Florida, who, like my dear friend Wendy Grant, are dedicated to St. Jude’s lifesaving mission and who have continued to help the organization to ensure that no family ever receives a bill for the worldclass care their son or daughter requires. To Wendy and, indeed, all of the members of the Friends of St. Jude in south Florida, thank you for the difference you continue to make in the lives of children across our Nation and across the world. 
b1230 DESHAUN WATSON, A MAN OF CHARACTER (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, last night, as we all watched football, no matter who you rooted for, team sports also still comes down to individuals. Last night, a young man named Deshaun Watson—the favorite son of Gainesville, Georgia, my hometown—showed the character that I have witnessed since he was a young boy, playing with my son in the 7 and 8yearold little flag football league. His athletic ability has never been questioned, and last night it was on full display for the world to see. I believe that he is the best college football player in the country. Beyond football playing, he is a better man. He is looking forward to the leadership of his team, to the leadership of his classmates, and the leadership he has shown in his community back in Gainesville is exemplary and will not be forgotten. Gainesville is proud of its favorite son, Deshaun Watson, and of the national championship that he won last night with his team, Clemson, during the football game. But, as with everything in life, as the game ended, it reminded us that the games are played by men of character. Deshaun Watson is a man of character, and I look forward to watching his career as he goes forward. CONGRATULATIONS TO UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA’S MACHINE INTELLIGENCE LABORATORY ENGINEERING TEAM (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the other Gainesville—the University of Florida’s Machine Intelligence Laboratory Engineering Team. On December 12, 2016, the University of Florida’s Machine Intelligence Laboratory Engineering Team won a world championship and beat 12 teams from five countries at the Maritime RobotX Challenge in Hawaii. This team, which is comprised of UF students, designed a vessel that completed a number of different obstacles, including navigating through buoys and selfparking—all without human intervention. As a supporter of scientific research, I am proud of the inspiring work being done in Florida’s Third Congressional District. The dedication displayed by these students and professors is an outstanding example of the success that comes from hard work. It is the dreams of the students and scientists, like these of today, that will propel them to go on and create the innovations of tomorrow that will make this country great again. I am honored to announce their accomplishments, and I look forward to witnessing their continued success. As a UF alumnus, I would be remiss not to say, ‘‘Go Gators.’’

PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5, REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2017, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 79, HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 33 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H. Res. 33, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act, and H.R. 79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS, Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for each bill, equally divided between the majority leader and the minority leader and the chairman and the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, respectively. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit for both pieces of underlying legislation. Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from Congressman TOMMARINO and Congressman HANKJOHNSON , on behalf of the Judiciary Committee, and from Congressman HUIZENGA , on behalf of the Financial Services Committee. We also heard from several Members on both sides of the aisle who testified on their amendments. The Rules Committee made in order both amendments submitted for the HALOS Act and 16 amendments from Members on both sides of the aisle for the Regulatory Accountability Act. Mr. Speaker, I spoke from this podium last week about the positive, pro growth agenda we in the majority are advancing. The bills before us today are additional pieces of that puzzle, and they help us to return to commonsense governance that fosters economic success. H.R. 79, the HALOS Act, was introduced by my friend from Ohio, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Mr. STEVE CHABOT . Last Congress, very similar legislation passed the House with my support and by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. The HALOS Act ensures that socalled angel investors, who serve as the largest funding source for startups in the United States, are able to effectively hold educational economic development events, like ‘‘demo days.’’ The bill also helps to ensure that startups can connect with angel investors who can serve as funding sources, mentors, or outside directors. In plain English, the HALOS Act helps to ensure that small, innovative companies and startups have access to the necessary capital. This, in turn, enables these companies to expand and generate jobs that put Americans back to work while fueling our economy as a global hub of innovation. Mr. Speaker, in order to keep America’s market competitive, we must relieve American job creators and employees from suffocating regulations. We can move toward this by helping government function as our Founders intended. Our Constitution lays out a system of three coequal branches of government, which is meant to fulfill unique roles and to provide checks and balances for one another. Over time, we have allowed cracks to form in that system, and we have gradually seen executive agencies usurp power from the elected officials of the legislative branch—to the detriment of hardworking Americans and the separation of powers. We, too often, see unelected bureaucrats handing down regulations that have enormous impacts on small businesses, family farmers, individuals, and families. In an unfortunate irony, these bureaucrats are isolated from the very entities they are trying to regulate. Congress must stop ceding authority to the executive and reassert the power of the legislative branch to write law. The Regulatory Accountability Act helps us do just that. It helps us to ensure that burdensome rules that handcuff American business with red tape aren’t crushing our economy, our competitiveness, or our future. It also restores common sense to the rulemaking process. H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act, combines six bills that have previously passed the House. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation. I thank Chairman CHABOT , Chairman GOODLATTE , and Chairman M ARINO for their thoughtful and diligent work on this legislation. Additionally, Congressman RATCLIFFE and Congressman LUETKEMEYER contributed important provisions to this package. The bill reforms the process by which Federal agencies analyze and formulate new regulations and guidance documents, clarifies the nature of judicial review of agency interpretation, and calls for more complete analysis of the potential impact of rules on small entities. H.R. 5 includes the text of the Separation of Powers Act, which amends the Administrative Procedures Act to overturn two doctrines that call for judicial deference to agency interpretations of statutory and regulatory provisions: the Chevron and Auer doctrines. In plain English, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act prevents Federal bureaucrats from interpreting the legality of their own regulations at the expense of hardworking Americans and the constitutional separation of powers. Title I of the Regulatory Accountability Act requires agencies, when establishing new rules, to consider the lowest cost option that meets statutory requirements. The bill also provides for more public input in the rulemaking process. Title IV of the bill, the Providing Accountability through Transparency Act, requires agencies to publish plainlanguage summaries of new proposed rules online. These proposals are not farfetched. Instead, they provide more information and a voice to the American people while reining in agencies that have gotten drunk on their rulemaking power. Mr. Speaker, our current administration issued over 600 major regulations with an economic impact of over $740 billion. These numbers show the staggering number of rules put forth by the executive branch, but nowhere are the true costs of regulations highlighted better than in the stories that I hear from my constituents. I know other Members hear similar stories, and all across the Nation, we are seeing the toll that overregulation has taken on growth and competitiveness. Back home in northeast Georgia, Elbert County is known as the granite 
capital of the world, but a rule put forth by OSHA that is related to silica levels threatens to jeopardize that industry; and, of course, there is the waters of the United States rule, which could negatively impact everyone from farmers to ranchers to Realtors. The menu labeling rule is yet another example of a misguided regulation that the administration has put forth without impunity. That rule would raise costs for businesses, from restaurants to convenience stores, leading to higher costs for consumers—in actuality, hurting the very ones that it proclaims to help. This is the irony of many of these regulations. Sadly, they are borne out in the costs to the American people. Last year, the EPA finalized a rule that established Federal standards for residential wood heaters. In rural districts like mine, many individuals may count on wood heaters to keep their families warm. This EPA rule will raise costs for consumers and undermine families’ decisions about what type of heater may work the best for them. Mr. Speaker, is this really where we want to go, having the Federal Government decide things like this, away from the scrutiny of the elected body? I think not. The examples from this administration are numerous, but, importantly, this problem of overregulation is not unique to this administration. This is not a Republican or a Democratic problem. This is a balance of power problem; this is a problem between branches not doing what they are supposed to be doing and staying within that. b1245 The Regulatory Accountability Act helps ensure that this administration and future administrations do not ignore Congress by writing law through regulation. It returns transparency to the process. It restores Congress’ rightful place as the legislative branch and reins in the unelected fourth branch that regulators have become. Mr. Speaker, many of the bills in this package have previously passed with bipartisan support. I hope my colleagues can continue to agree that Congress should make the laws and that we should do so in such a way that encourages growth, innovation, and American ingenuity. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the customary 30 minutes. We will get to the content of the bills in a moment, but there is a procedural issue here that disenfranchises millions of American citizens in this process. We are in the 115th Congress since the founding of this country. We were just sworn in last week to begin that. There are 56 new Members who just started serving last week that have never served in this body before, and there were 56 people that served in the last session who are no longer with us. What we are doing here is we are taking bills that those former Representatives worked on and new Representatives have not worked on and advancing them to the floor without going through committee, without going through the regular order. So, for example, you have two bills, H.R. 5 and H.R. 79. We will talk about them in a moment. These are Committee on Financial Services bills. They should have gone to that committee, and members of that committee, Democratic and Republican, would have had the chance to amend those bills in that committee and mark it up before it comes to the floor. That is the normal process. Both parties are now constituting those committees; we are putting people on them. I heard you, Mr. Speaker, read just before we began this debate how a number of Members were officially appointed to those committees. That is what we do in our first week or two. Fiftysix new Members should have a say on these bills. They will get a vote on the floor on these bills, but they were completely excluded from the committee process that wrote these bills. That is wrong, Mr. Speaker, to not allow 56 new Members of this body to be the lawmakers that the people of their districts elected them to do. In fact, it disenfranchises the tens of millions of people collectively that those 56 Members represent. And I hope that, for future legislation, we can move through regular order and allow the new Members, as well as those who are returning, to be part of the lawmaking process. With regards to these bills, we have largely seen these bills in prior sessions that people who are no longer in this body worked on. The HALOS Act, I was proud to support last session and I am proud to support again. It addresses a potentially real problem. There is guidance from the SEC that—in our Rules Committee meeting yesterday I questioned the subcommittee chair—largely also addresses those concerns, but it is better to do it in statute and it is better to do it in the broader language that is included in the bill, which is why many Democrats—I hope a majority—support the HALOS Act. The United States is the leader in innovation in the global economy, and this is a small piece of that. What we are talking about here are demo days where entrepreneurs can pitch their idea. I, personally, have been able to attend a number of those, and it is a question of who can be in the room when that occurs. Should it only be millionaires who are allowed in that room? Or can it be the next great generation of entrepreneurs? Can it be students? Can it be aspiring entrepreneurs? Can it be community members who want to learn what it means to pitch and how to do it and how ideas are spread, or maybe they are looking for a job? It doesn’t change who can invest in those startup companies. They still have to be qualified investors. By the way, I hope we have the opportunity to work with Republicans on the definition of ‘‘qualified investor’’ because I think it is unfair to restrict investment opportunities to multimillionaires. We need to allow educated and qualified investors of all levels. Just because somebody is rich doesn’t mean that they are a good investor, and just because somebody has not yet earned a lot of money doesn’t mean that they can’t be trusted to invest $10,000 or $50,000 of their own money. We made progress in the original JOBS Act with the result of crowdfunded investing, but that is only a small piece—almost an insignificant piece. Private placements are the much larger piece of capital formation for venturestage startups in our country. If there is a way we can have an alternative to the net worth test that allows individuals to, perhaps, take a qualitative test of their knowledge and, therefore, qualify as an investor, they ought to be able to do that, too. This bill does not do any of that. That is a controversial area. It is one that it will take Democrats and Republicans working together on to help fund tomorrow’s great companies and allow opportunity for all people, not just millionaires and billionaires. What this bill does is it continues to restrict the actual investors to the millionaires. Okay? But it allows other people in the room at least. That is a start. It allows an MBA student who him or herself wants to, perhaps, come up with their own company to hear 10 or 20 companies pitch so they can assemble their own deck; somebody who might have a great amount of value to give as a mentor who themselves is a veteran of a number of companies. Maybe they are not quite worth a couple of million dollars. Maybe they are worth only—only, right?—$500,000. Maybe they were a reasonably successful person worth $500,000, but they have a lot of knowledge to give. Without the HALOS Act, it would be unclear whether that person would even be allowed in that room. So we want to make sure that mentors, up and coming, young entrepreneurs, and, frankly, upandcoming entrepreneurs of all ages have access to the knowledge and the learning that can occur in these pitch events. Congress has a role in making sure we have laws in place that really help build an environment that promotes innovation. When we passed the JOBS Act in 2012 that allowed for crowdfunding, Congress took a step forward. We have room to go there, room to go with private placements. The HALOS Act is a small step, but it is a good one and a noncontroversial one. It creates a clear path for startups to participate in demo days, sponsored by government entities, nonprofits, angel investment groups, et cetera, and 
a clear safe harbor from the SEC with regard to the definition of general solicitation to make it clear that business experts and others can be in the room, while maintaining that only existing accredited investors can actually participate in offerings under Regulation D for the purchases or sale of securities that are mentioned in those demonstrations. Currently, sponsors of demo days are relying on the 12yearold, noaction letter by the SEC to make sure that they don’t face the consequences of failing to comply. The guidelines outlined by the SEC’s noaction letter are actually incorporated into the HALOS Act. So, in many ways, this clarifies and puts in statute something that has been at the whim of the SEC for too long. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) and others will join me in talking about the importance of angel investors for early stage capital to create jobs, to allow tomorrow’s great entrepreneur who might not have any resources of their own today to raise the resources they need to hire people and succeed. The Center for Venture Research estimates that U.S. angel investors invested $24.6 billion in about 71,000 small businesses in every area, every congressional district of our country. Many of those were startups in the early stages of building a company. Tomorrow’s company that employs 10,000 or even 50,000 people is today’s garage startup trying to figure out how to get $50,000 or raise $100,000 to make their payroll or buy their inventory. Angel investors focus their investment on local startups and much more so than, for instance, national venture capital firms that tend to be clustered at the coast. It is an important way we can continue to grow the economy in every ZIP code in this country, across the heartland and the middle of the country, not just the coasts where the venture capital firms themselves are situated. The Coloradobased digital home design firm, Havenly, started by two sisters, utilized demo days as networking opportunities to perfect their pitch to investors, a very common path. After participating in a 500startup demo day, the pair received nearly $13 million in investment capital from qualified investors. Now Havenly is a thriving business, employs hundreds of interior designers across the country, and I am proud to say it has a staff of 40 people in their Colorado headquarters. Havenly is a perfect example of how demo days provide opportunities to startups that create real jobs for real people in our country. The HALOS Act simply gives the same opportunities to other startups that thousands of others have had when getting off the ground. I believe the HALOS Act is the appropriate approach to regulatory relief. I appreciate the bipartisan nature of the legislation. It is targeted to provide clarity around a specific potential problem and certainty around what these events can entail. Now, there is another bill under this rule as well. It is a bad bill. It is not a strong bipartisan bill. It is called H.R. 79. Since we began the 115th Congress here, the Republicans are promoting a deregulation agenda. Often this agenda results in this body, Congress, potentially being buried in having to do inordinate amounts of work to review the executive branch of government. Now, we all believe in oversight of the executive branch. Believe me, Mr. Speaker, you are going to hear many Democrats speaking up about how important oversight of the executive branch is, particularly for the incoming administration. We are not the executive branch. Congress delegates authority to agencies, under the laws we write, to fill in gaps and decide how best to implement the law. If we disagree, we can always change or amend the authorizing statute to make more clear the intent of this body. However, these bills being brought to the floor by the Republicans would either require Congress to spell out exactly what ways to implement a policy in a changing world or give the authority of how to interpret and implement law to the judicial system, neither of which are wise or expedient choices regardless of who occupies the Presidency. While I certainly will have more sympathy with this approach with President Trump in the White House than President Obama in the White House, I still believe this is the wrong way to go about the separation of powers under our Constitution. This bill sets out 60 new analytical requirements that agency actions must meet before they can be implemented. In other words, any attempt by agencies to protect the public from toxic substances, make sure our planes and trains are meeting safety regulations, or make sure our food is toxin free would be subject to 60 new bureaucratic hurdles, effectively creating more and more red tape to tie the bureaucracy up rather than make their work quicker and more efficient, which is what Democrats seek to do. This bill would bury the agency rulemaking process under a blizzard of bureaucratic hurdles and documentation requirements, literally burying the executive and administrative branch of government in red tape and paperwork. This bill would hold the regulatory process hostage to the whims of the very corporations and bureaucrats whose rulemaking it is designed to address. The process that the bills call for have been roundly discredited by so many experts on regulatory policy from the left and the right and consumer advocates as well. The administrative law and regulatory practices section of the American Bar Association stated that these burdens would reduce transparency, reduce public input, threaten public safety, and, most importantly, not result in any better rules. This bill is nothing other than a recycled effort that 56 Members of this body have not had a chance to participate in writing through the committee process to slow down the government and get in the way of agency rulemakings that are critical for protecting public health, safety, and our environment. We are simply failing our constituents that we are elected to serve by spending time on legislation that would deliberately sabotage our own ability for our government to function efficiently. This is a bill that would make government less efficient. That is not what I hear when I am back home from my constituents—Democrat, Republican, Independent. I don’t hear: Go to Washington to make government less efficient. My constituents want government to be more efficient. Finally, this bill is being considered under a structured rule limiting the amendment process. There were over 30 amendments filed. Yet, we are only considering 16 amendments under this very overly restrictive rule. This is particularly onerous because, again, there was no opportunity for the 56 new Members through the committee process to amend this bill. There was a new Member that appeared before the Rules Committee yesterday. Unfortunately, he was not even allowed to advance his amendment to the floor under this rule. Another example is an amendment offered by a new Member, Ms. BLUNT  ROCHESTER , who filed an amendment that would ensure that LGBT employees are protected from workplace discrimination. It would allow Federal agencies that are tasked with protecting the civil rights of employees to continue to do their work without being hamstrung with unnecessary requirements. Civil rights protections do not fit neatly into a corporate monetary analysis, and our government has a responsibility to ensure that all Americans are protected from arbitrary or unjust discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Given the breadth and scope of this legislation, an open amendment process would have allowed this amendment to be debated if the majority wanted, perhaps even voted down, although I hope the majority would have approved it. It would have produced a more thoughtful piece of legislation. Yet, we are not even allowed to have that debate on the floor of the House, which is why this rule is wrong and why I stand in strong opposition to it. We should be considering legislation to create permanent, highpaying jobs, investing in infrastructure to grow our communities, fixing our broken immigration system, and streamlining and improving our tax system through tax reform rather than recycling old bills 
that 56 Members have not even had the opportunity to put their imprint on. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule for those very reasons. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1300 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I think there is no better way to start this Congress fresh but with some understanding. It is very clear, and it has become obvious to Members here on the floor, that there is a discussion going on. And, Mr. Speaker, if Members would like to see the difference that is being portrayed here on the floor today, it is very obvious. There is one party that is really concerned about tying the hands of bureaucrats; and there is one party, the majority, that is looking to untie the hands of the American people. I think I will side on the side of the American people and job creators and job promoters, and those who go out every day and earn a living. We worked on this last Congress, and I will talk about it again here. Let’s not start the strongman that Republicans are wanting to do away with all regulations. We do not. We want government to operate in the most efficient manner possible and do what it needs to do, but also get out of the way. The problem with government, many times the government has overstepped where it needs to be, and it needs to be out of the way to start with. Also, I would like to at least clear the record and make something understood. At the beginning of the year, we are bringing a rule. We had a full Rules Committee hearing yesterday, and Members were able to offer amendments. Not all amendments were made in order. Sixteen amendments were made in order on both sides of the aisle. I would like to remind Members, Mr. Speaker, as we go back in history, we are promoting discussion here in the Rules Committee and bringing to the floor and allowing Members to talk about amendments and give them the opportunity. I will just remind Members, Mr. Speaker, in the 111th Congress, which was controlled by my friends on the other side of the aisle, in the very first rule bill they brought, the rules for the House, they put two major bills in the rules package that did not even get a rules hearing, that did not get anything except just pushed to the floor. I think we will stand firm that we are pushing to the floor stuff that Americans care about, and also doing it in a way that Members can participate. Speaking of that, the American people, especially the good folks of Nebraska, have sent to us a new Member, and I have gotten the chance to know him. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. B ACON ), and I welcome him to the floor. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying bill which provides for H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. I promised my district in eastern Nebraska that I would work my hardest to rein in an outofcontrol bureaucracy that is burdening our Nation with over 3,000 new regulations each year. The cumulative cost of all of these regulations passed each year cost approximately $2 trillion, almost 10 percent of our GDP. That is a tremendous burden, and it largely falls on our small businesses, farmers, and community banks. I meet often with our local, small business owners. The top concern that I hear, and they are loud and clear, and I hear it over and over, is that regulations and ObamaCare are preventing them from growing, and, in some cases, making it very difficult for them to stay afloat. There is anger that the health of our businesses are not being undermined by competition or new technology, but they are being undermined by their own government, and they are angry about it. I have promised my district that I will be aware and push back on these regulations and on a bureaucracy that is on steroids. That is what we are doing today by passing H.R. 5 and by passing these rules. I think one of the Members of the very first Congress and the writer of our Constitution would be proud to see H.R. 5 passed. James Madison thought the separation of powers was vital to the safeguarding of our Republic. In recent years, we have seen that separation of powers undermined by an overzealous bureaucracy that creates laws, then executes those laws, and then acts as their own appeal authority. Madison said the accumulation of powers—legislative, executive, and judiciary—in the same hands is the very definition of tyranny. Today, we move toward the right balance, toward restoring the separation of powers and lifting the burden that has been put on our small businesses and farmers. I urge support for the rule and the underlying bill. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up a bill that would establish a national commission to investigate foreign interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD along with extraneous material immediately prior to vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, we have all been very concerned about the reports from our own intelligence agencies about foreign interference in the 2016 American elections. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) to discuss our proposal, the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong opposition to this rule so that it can be amended to include consideration of H.R. 356, Protecting Our Democracy Act, which is sponsored by the gentleman from California (Mr. SWALWELL ) and yours truly. Mr. Speaker, we are presently in a struggle for the soul of our democracy. This legislation would create an independent commission to examine Russian attacks on our electoral process. I am pleased that all of my House Democratic colleagues have joined in this bill and that similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate. I want to be clear about why we are here today. It is not just about the past. It is about the future. The CIA, the FBI, and the NSA have issued a declassified report warning that Russian entities acted under the orders of Vladimir Putin to execute ‘‘an influence campaign,’’ and they say they did this ‘‘to undermine public faith in the United States democratic process.’’ Again, I say: our democracy is under attack. Our intelligence agencies explain that Moscow’s attacks will not end with the attacks they launched in 2016. They warn that Moscow ‘‘will apply lessons learned from its campaign aimed at the U.S. Presidential election to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide. . . . ’’ Democracy under attack. These Russian attacks on our electoral process were attacks on our Constitution, our people, and they are attacks on our great Nation. Our intelligence agencies are warning that if we do not respond now, the Russians will attack us again. Mr. Speaker, we must not take our democracy for granted. We must guard this democracy. We must guard the fundamental foundation of that democracy, and that is a vote, and a vote with integrity. We are all Members of the Congress of the United States of America. We have taken an oath to protect and defend our Constitution and our great Nation. That is what this legislation is about. It is not about Donald Trump. It is not about Hillary Clinton. It is not about Republicans, Democrats, or independents. It is not even about 2016. It is about our future, and it is about generations yet unborn. We cannot allow ourselves to be distracted from our solemn duty and our solemn oath. We cannot allow foreign attacks on our electoral process to become normal or inevitable. They are neither. This legislation attempts to rise above politics. If there was any moment in our history when we should be rising above politics, it is this moment. 
This commission is intended to be truly bipartisan, to have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, to examine how Russia and any other foreign powers interfered with our elections, including hacking Federal and State political parties and disseminating fake news stories intended to warp public opinion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. POLIS. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. CUMMINGS. Most importantly, this bipartisan and independent commission will make recommendations to try to prevent any foreign power from interfering in our elections again. I sincerely hope Republicans, including the Presidentelect, who, for the first time ever, will swear his own oath to protect and defend our Constitution, will join us in supporting this independent commission. I urge all Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so this rule can be amended to require consideration of the Protecting Our Democracy Act. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado, and I thank my good friend from Georgia. It is important to take note of the value of democracy and the discourse on this floor, and my friendship with the gentleman from Georgia, but absolute disagreement with him on our purposes here. Yes, regulation should be fair, and it should cede to the administrative process and the administrative laws that dictate how they should be formulated, and that fairness should be their underpinnings. But I think my constituents, in terms of the regulatory scheme, are far more interested in clean water and clean air. They are far more interested in making sure that consumer products that impact toddlers and babies are enforced. They are far more interested in ensuring that there is competition to the FTC, and that there are fair energy laws to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Having said that, I am disappointed as well that we are moving forward on H.R. 5, which is a bill that went through the Judiciary Committee, and, as my colleague from Colorado said, with 56 new Members, it did not go through regular order. We are recycling the same bad bill again. I rise today to express concern over the number of amendments that were presented that were good amendments that did not get in. Before I speak to the amendment I am concerned about, first, I want to speak to the previous question. I support the gentleman from California (Mr. SWALWELL ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) on a very important statement, and that is in the tragedy and the heinousness of 9/11, we formulated the 9/11 Commission. Mr. Speaker, there is no more heinousness than a foreign nation interfering with the just and fair voting of every American. There are many who lost their life in the name of one vote, one person. For that reason, I would make the argument that it is imperative that this bill be amended to create the commission that will address the question of foreign intrusion, particularly Russian intrusion and hacking in our election. I believe this election was skewed, in spite of the peaceful democratic transfer of government, which we will all adhere to, but there is no doubt. This does not compete to 2001 with President Bush in Florida. It does not compete to 2004 with Mr. Kerry. It is beyond any kind of comprehension of what happened in this election, a direct intrusion and skewing of this election. But, more importantly, protecting the systems of election and the voting rights, the preciousness of the voting rights, is crucial to democracy. This commission, independent of any of the committees that should be working—and I agree, Congress should be working. Senator MCCAINhas already begun working—a Republican—but this commission would be a vital asset. So I am certainly disappointed that the amendment I had that was crucial as relates to cybersecurity to deal with the question of cyber intrusion was not made in order. It would have been appropriate for us to have an amendment that would have spoken directly to the idea of identifying new tactics or techniques that a malicious actor might deploy, or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion, in addition to protecting the data that enables cybersecurity firms and other network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian intelligence services use. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman. This amendment would have been vital to have not only a vigorous discussion on the floor but also to recognize that cybersecurity has now become a potential weapon. I have worked on this issue for a decade as the former chairwoman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. It was under my subcommittee that we began to look at electric grids and began to see the enormous power of the cyber world. My amendment should have been included because we are now faced with what the cyber world used as a weapon can do. I am disappointed that that amendment was not made in order. I am disappointed that H.R. 5 is again before us without regular order, and would hope that we have the opportunity to vote for and support the previous question to find out what happened and who conspired to alter our elections in 2016. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and the underlying bill. I strongly oppose this rule because it makes in order H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017, which is a radical measure that could make it impossible to promulgate safety regulations to protect the public. I oppose this rule because it would effectively shut down the entire U.S. regulatory system, amending in one fell swoop every bedrock existing regulatory statute. My opposition to H. Res. 33 is amplified by the Rules Committee’s decision to decline to make in order the Jackson Lee Amendment, ‘‘to provide an exception for regulations that help prevent cyberattacks on election processes or institutions.’’ Apparently, House Republicans are still reluctant to debate the subject—undisputed by our Intelligence community—of Russian cyberattacks on American cyber networks and infrastructure. Key Judgments in the Intelligence Community Assessment’s declassified version of a highly classified report entitled, ‘‘Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections,’’ have confirmed that 2016 witnessed the first American presidential election that was the subject of cyberattacks. These and other subversive activities have been confirmed to have been perpetrated by entities allied with the Government of Russia and were undertaken for the express purpose of influencing the presidential contest to secure the election of its preferred candidate, Donald Trump, who made history by becoming the first presidential candidate to invite a hostile foreign power to launch cyberattacks against his political opponent. All three agencies, CIA, FBI and NSA, agree with this judgment. The socalled Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA), in addition to this rule, demonstrates the deceptive design of the majority to make it harder to establish regulations to protect the public by tilting the entire regulatory system significantly toward special interests. The bill allows Federal courts without expertise on technical issues to substitute their judgment for those of the expert federal agencies. These agencies are staffed with career subject matter experts that are deeply knowledgeable of the background, context, and history of agency actions and policy rationale. For this reason, courts have long deferred to agency experts who are in the best position to carry out the statutes. The RAA would end this wellestablished practice and allow far less experienced judges to secondguess expert opinion—essentially sanctioning judicial activism. The Jackson Lee Amendment, however, would have attuned this dangerous legislation to provide an exception for regulation upon which Americans so greatly rely on their government to help prevent cyberattacks on our highly coveted and esteemed election processes and institutions. The bill promoted by the majority, calling for accountability from our Administrative Agencies—fails to answer in accountability to the threat posed by foreign and domestic invaders on our national cyber networks. 
As the new Congress commences in the People’s House, obstructionist Republicans are circumventing the very procedures by which elected officials answer the cries of outrage and dismay of desperately concerned constituents. To the obstructionist majority perpetuating this restrictive rule, let me stand firm in the American convictions laid bare by the Jackson Lee amendment—the system of Checks and Balances established by the Separation of Powers clause of the Constitution will not be thwarted. The spirit of the H.R. 5 is clearly designed to stop all regulation dead in its tracks—no matter the threat to cyber networks, national security, economy, or the very health and safety of the American people. We know that Russia’s cyber activities were intended to influence the election, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S. government. These actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The mission of the Intelligence Community is to seek to reduce the uncertainty surrounding foreign activities, capabilities, or leaders’ intentions. On these issues of great importance to U.S. national security, the goal of intelligence analysis is to provide assessments to decision makers that are intellectually rigorous, objective, timely, and useful, and that adhere to tradecraft standards. Applying these standards helps ensure that the Intelligence Community provides U.S. policymakers, warfighters, and operators with the best and most accurate insight, warning, and context, as well as potential opportunities to advance U.S. national security. This objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to hide or obfuscate their activities. My amendment would have improved H.R. 5 by exempting only those regulations critical to making cyber networks invulnerable to attack from foreign and domestic agencies and individuals. Specifically, the amendment that the Rules committee disallowed for presentation on a vote here on the floor today would have provided the American people an exemption to allow for the prevention of tampering, alteration, or misappropriation of information by agents of foreign countries with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions. In particular, restrictions put forth in H.R. 5 could result in further delay to agencies attempting to take action to help network defenders better identify new tactics or techniques that a malicious actor might deploy or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion, in addition to protecting data that enables cybersecurity firms and other network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian intelligence services use. The Regulatory Accountability Act provides no accountability to the American public. Instead, it allows polluting industries and special interests to game the system and escape accountability for any harm they inflict. It makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to secure new public protections and arms industry with numerous tools to avoid their legal obligations. The increasing use of cyberenabled means to undermine democratic processes at home and abroad, as exemplified by Russia’s recent activities, has made clear that a tool explicitly targeting attempts to interfere with elections is also warranted. We cannot afford to let global terroristic threats, in the form of cyber activities, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, influence elections, or undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S. government. My amendment would have offered protections guarding the integrity of our cyber networks, while at the same time allowing the bill to achieve the proponents’ major purposes. The exceptional Americans we serve deserve a Congress that does its job and keeps our timehonored institutions functioning. For these reasons and more, I oppose this rule and the underlying bill. b1315 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
1⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SWALWELL ). Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and allow an amendment to be put forward on H.R. 356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act. A public report was released on Friday by the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA, and it was chilling. It declared that Russia attacked our democracy in the past Presidential election. It said that the attack came from the Russian services themselves. It was ordered by Vladimir Putin and, most concerning, that Russia had a preferred candidate and that they sought to denigrate Secretary Clinton along the way. Going forward, this is not about relitigating the past. Donald Trump will be the next President. This is about preserving the integrity of our democracy and saying that our dialogue, our democracy, these fights between our parties, they belong to us. The report also said that Russia intends to do this again. We know that Russia has done this before across the globe to our allies. They are doing it right now to other countries as they seek to move forward in their democracies. Now other foreign adversaries of ours will look at what Russia did, if we do nothing, and see an opportunity to strike us again. So we have an opportunity, as Republicans and Democrats, to come together and say that the victims may have been the Democratic Party in this past election and, if history has its way, in the next election it may be a different party. The constant will always remain this: both parties will unite to say, We believe that this democracy, which has been fought and sacrificed for, is worth defending. To do that, we should have an independent, bipartisan, appointed commission to look at how this was able to occur, why our democracy was so vulnerable, and, most importantly, make recommendations to the public to ensure that this never happens again. We should do this so, first, we can devote ourselves fully—with an independent commission, you have full time members and fulltime staffs—to understanding what happened. Second, we should do this to depoliticize what has occurred. The incoming President has continuously undermined the findings of our 17 intelligence agencies that Russia was responsible. We should depoliticize this by taking this out of Congress and having an independent commission, once and for all, sign off on who was responsible and, again, make recommendations to protect us going forward. We should also declassify, to the extent possible, the evidence behind the findings. Finally, once this commission is formed and once congressional investigations also take place, the American people have to come together. We have to come together because we can never again let an outside meddler influence our elections. So we have every single House Democrat cosponsoring this legislation. This legislation should not be partisan at all. When you talk to Republicans and you talk to Democrats in our districts and you talk to Independents, they all express a concern about what Russia did. So what we can do in this House is say: We are united. We are united to get to the bottom of what happened. So I invite my Republican colleagues to join us in the search for what happened. Join us in this responsibility to do everything we can to tell our constituents that, in the next election, we won’t let it happen again. Defeat the previous question and support H.R. 356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, are there any more speakers the gentleman from Colorado has? Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentleman from Georgia is. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I am prepared for the gentleman to close. I reserve the balance of time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, so, in summary, when we defeat the previous question, we will then bring forward our bill to establish an independent report on foreign interference in this most recent 2016 election, something that the American people deserve to see, that we need to see. We need to put safeguards in place to prevent our election system from being hijacked by foreign powers. With regard to the rule, Mr. Speaker, it is a bad, closed rule, particularly given the chance that 56 new Members of Congress have not had the opportunity to add their imprint to the bills that are before us. The gentleman mentioned, oh, the Democrats did this 10 years ago. Well, 
that is hardly an excuse that the American people buy. There were many things about the Democrats’ tenure in this body the American people didn’t like; and to simply cite some of those less popular elements of Democratic leadership and now say: Well, now we Republicans are going to do earmarks; now we Republicans are going to have a closed process that doesn’t allow amendment; now Republicans are going to gut the ethics rule. In over 200 years, you can always cite some precedence for that from both Democrats and Republicans, but those aren’t good things. We want to learn from our mistakes, I hope, and not say, just because some Democrat or some Republican did this in 1952, it is a good thing to do today. Mr. Speaker, we are 6 days into the next Congress. After we defeat the rule, hopefully, and defeat the previous question, we can bring forward an independent study on foreign interference. With regard to these two bills, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on the HALOS Act and, of course, oppose the ridiculously broad H.R. 5, Regulatory Accountability Act, which would simply add more paperwork to the bureaucracy, further reducing the efficiency of a branch of government that many Americans believe is already too inefficient. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I serve a wonderful part of the world. With all due respect to all the other Members of Congress, I do believe it is one of the fairest in the country. As I go around and travel, one of the things I have not heard, Mr. Speaker— and I am not sure if you have or other Members sitting here—I have never been hit, when I run into something saying the fact that government is efficient, and I am really wanting it to be efficient in a sense that it is working for me. It is a very obvious statement here, and what we see time after time after time after time is rules and regulations that most of the American folks are saying: Government, do what you are supposed to be doing. Get us back on a fiscal financial path that is solid, that balances, that gets us back in understanding that we can’t spend more than what we make or bring in, and that we have to have a strong national defense. Let’s get back to the things that make America the shining light all around the world. One of the things I do not hear them asking me to do, Mr. Speaker, is make it easier on bureaucrats in Washington. I have not had them beg and bring petitions to my table and say: Please make it easier on bureaucrats to run our lives. That is not what we do. What we are trying to do is simply say: Let’s get up, go out to work, do the regulations that matter. Make sure that government does what it is supposed to do. Make sure that the balance of power is honored and not looked upon with disgrace. It is looked upon as something that should be taken care of. Let the legislative body be the legislative body. Let the executive be the executive, and let the judicial be the judicial. I have no problem putting before the American people the choice: Do you want a party that will defend a bureaucracy that stifles them? Or a party of the majority, like we are, that are putting forward regulation reform that says, We want to help you; we are concerned about you? Obvious choice, Mr. Speaker. Today we have two opportunities to this rule. They both look at our economic engines in the country and reviving it again. The HALOS Act helps us ensure that small businesses have access to the capital necessary to grow and succeed. Small business is the backbone of our economy, and it makes sense to enact policies that promote the viability and growth. The Regulatory Accountability Act restores simple checks and balances so that Congress, once again, makes laws so they work better for those who elected us. It is time we demand the voice of the American people be heard rather than letting the others up here, separated in cubicles, decide what is best. When we look at that, the obvious choice is clear. You pass this rule, you vote ‘‘yes’’ on these bills, and you say to the American people: I agree with the majority. We are looking after those that get up every day and have the American Dream in front of them and get up and say: I want to be better and I want my government to be out of the way. When we understand that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous 
question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on ordering the previous question will be followed by 5 minute votes on agreeing to the resolution, if ordered; and agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 79, to clarify the definition of general solicitation under Federal securities laws, and for other purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 33 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 79. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1408 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 79) to clarify the definition of general solicitation under Federal securities law, with Mr. BOSTin the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act, also known as the HALOS Act. I remind all Members that the House passed this bill just a few months ago with overwhelming support from both Republicans and Democrats by a vote of 325–89, Mr. Chairman, almost 4 to 1. It is hard to get more bipartisan than that. It has received overwhelming bipartisan support because then and now the HALOS Act will help create needed jobs and grow our economy. I think we all know, Mr. Chairman, from listening to our constituents, jobs in the economy continue to be the number one issue of concern of the American people. I commend the bipartisan sponsors of this bill, Mr. CHABOT , the chairman of the Small Business Committee, who we will hear from soon, and Ms. SINEMA , who serves with me on the Financial Services Committee. I also thank the six Republicans and four Democrats who joined them as original cosponsors. These Members reached across the aisle and produced legislation that is especially important to America’s small businesses. Let’s remember, Mr. Chairman, that half—half—the people who work in this country earn or work at small businesses, which historically create twothirds of all the new jobs in America. So small business—small business—is the job engine of America. Our economy clearly works better for working Americans when small businesses thrive and they can focus on creating jobs rather than navigating bureaucratic red tape, red tape that disproportionately hurts the small businesses and startup companies that we are counting on to create jobs for our constituents. Burdensome regulations make it harder for entrepreneurs to access startup capital, and they place credit out of reach for many who wish to start up a small business. Many of these harmful regulations arise from complicated laws, like the DoddFrank Act. Overall, small business loans are at a 25year low, in large part due to regulatory burdens on our community banks and credit unions. Even the former Director of the Small Business Administration, appointed by President Obama, admitted as much when she said: ‘‘Small banks have been laden with excessive costs and confusion from overlapping regulations, which are getting in the way of their ability to make small business loans.’’ We simply must not allow our security laws to inhibit the free flow of investment capital to Main Street. The HALOS Act provides an important regulatory solution to make it easier for small businesses to attract investments and put both the ‘‘open for business’’ and ‘‘we are hiring’’ signs on their front doors. The bill provides a clear path for startups to connect with angel investors and allows investors to make their own informed decisions. Angel investors, Mr. Chairman, have a huge impact on economic growth. Famous companies like Amazon, Costco, Google, Facebook, and Starbucks were all first funded by angel investors. That is just how important this matter is. Today, approximately 600,000 employees earn their paychecks from working for these specific companies. Unfortunately, when Washington bureaucrats get involved, we often see the dreaded ‘‘unintended consequences’’ of red tape. Five years ago, Congress passed the bipartisan JOBS Act to make it easier for business startups to gain access to critical capital. But the Securities and Exchange Commission instead issued regulations on angel investors that have the complete opposite effect. This is a problem Congress can easily fix by passing a bipartisan HALOS Act, which will ensure that funding from angel investors remains available to small business startups. Mr. Chairman, you cannot have employees, unless you first have employers. You cannot have jobs without job creators. And that is what this bill is all about—jobs. It is about helping small businesses overcome misguided Washington red tape so they can create jobs. I urge all Members to support this commonsense bipartisan bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act. This bill, under the guise of helping angel groups attract additional investors for small businesses and startups, would alter the balance between capital formation and investor protection that we sought to achieve in the JOBS Act. Let me remind my colleagues of what we did in the wake of the financial crisis when bank lending was scarce. Our Nation’s startups had trouble getting off the ground and attracting new capital. Previously, they had done so using rule 506, which allows companies to sell private securities to accredited investors who are financially savvy and have the means to bear their heightened risks and lack of SEC oversight. As a condition to using rule 506, however, companies could not solicit purchasers from or advertise to the general public. b1415 This condition was viewed as a barrier to capital formation for startups. Therefore, Democrats worked with Republicans to provide companies in the JOBS Act with an alternative so that they could broadly advertise and solicit new investors. Recognizing the need to balance investor protection with this expansion, Ranking Member WATERS offered an amendment requiring companies to take reasonable steps to verify that the ultimate purchaser was an accredited investor. This verification requirement is a necessary investor protection designed to prevent unsophisticated investors from purchasing—either accidentally or by fraudulent means— risky, illiquid, and lightly regulated Rule 506 securities. 
competitive in the new global economy, we need to encourage the growth of innovative startups and jobcreating small businesses. Again, I thank Representative CHABOT for working with me on this commonsense, bipartisan bill. I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that Arizona startups have the support they need to grow their businesses and create jobs. b1445 Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ) and welcome her as a new Member. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan HALOS Act because it will help startup companies with angel investors without compromising important investor protections. When working in the private sector, I participated in numerous socalled demo days where earlystage entrepreneurs make presentations. I have counseled multiple startups and small firms through this process, particularly women and minorityowned businesses. I have seen firsthand as they struggled to overcome regulatory hurdles and to obtain access to muchneeded capital when traditional financing sources, such as banks, may not be feasible. It is important for the government at all levels—Federal, State, and local—to promote economic growth and encourage innovation by connecting people with good ideas to people with the capital and courage to bankroll those ideas. Robust entrepreneurial ecosystems is how great products come to market and how wellpaying jobs are created. This is particularly important for my district in central Florida, which has a growing innovative and entrepreneurial startup community. Based on personal experiences and on the experiences conveyed to me by Floridians with expertise in this area, the current Federal regulations governing demo days can be made more clear and less burdensome so that they better promote the flow of capital through our economy while continuing to protect nonaccredited investors. Because I believe the HALOS Act achieves these dual objectives, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 79. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, both Democrats and Republicans want to help facilitate capital formation, particularly for groups such as angel investors, who have substantial experience in the private securities market, and for small companies like startups who are seeking funding to innovate and grow. But as Members of Congress, we also have the responsibility to protect investors and ensure that the rules of the road are reasonable and appropriate. This is especially important for retail investors, those of us who are looking to save for retirement or to buy a house or to support our children’s education. That is what concerns me about the bill we have before us today. We cannot create loopholes in the securities laws that could have a serious negative impact on Americans’ nest eggs, so we must strike the right balance between capital formation in our securities markets and investor protection. It is with these goals in mind that Democrats supported the current rules in place. Companies can raise money to grow and support their businesses in our securities markets under the purview of the SEC and State regulators. The regulatory framework we have set up allows for different activities and oversight depending on the nature of the security offering. For example, public offerings provide robust information to investors about the risks and rewards of a particular securities purchase. They require the SEC or State securities regulator to preapprove and review an offering, and they provide legal recourse to investors that may be deceived. This is a strong regulatory framework that ensures our markets are safe and sound. In exchange for complying with these rules, companies can advertise and sell their stock to anyone in the general public. On the other hand, private offerings do not come with the same regulatory requirements and protections, which can make it easier and less costly for firms to raise money. This means less information for investors, less legal recourse, and little to no scrutiny by regulators. So we put in place procedures to ensure these private offerings, which are inherently riskier, are only sold to accredited investors. Private offerings now play a significant role in the market. Unregistered securities have surpassed registered securities in terms of capital formation. They have accounted for more than $2 trillion in new capital. Moreover, $71 billion has been raised since 2012 through the general solicitation and advertising exemption that we put in place in the JOBS Act. This is clearly an important and growing segment of our market, and, as such, I believe we need to be even more cautious about who is participating in it. In fact, the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee said we should do more, not less, to protect investors in the general solicitation and advertising market for private offerings. They think we don’t have enough guardrails in place. And yet this bill would do the opposite, by expanding the exemptions on general solicitation without similarly protecting the investor. The bill also undercuts an important amendment Ranking Member WATERS  offered to the JOBS Act, which was approved unanimously. It required companies to verify that the purchaser is an accredited investor and is financially sophisticated enough to bear the risks involved in private offerings. By effectively allowing purchasers to ‘‘selfcertify’’ at or after demo days sponsored by certain groups, the bill could open the door to financial ruin for a retail investor who may not have understood the consequences of his or her investment. So I oppose this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. I have actually had the pleasure and the honor of sitting through a number of these demo days and seeing these pitches being made. People are coming in, and they are literally laying out their dreams, their hopes, and, frankly, their hard work because they wouldn’t be there that day if it wasn’t for their hard work. They are looking for a couple of things. As small businesses and entrepreneurs, they are looking for capital and credit. We use the word ‘‘capital’’ a lot around here, but think of it as cash and credit. They really are looking for someone who will buy into their dream, who will look at their hard work, and who will understand that their dreams can become a reality with hope. This bill is trying to do that. Members are hearing a lot of doom and gloom on the other side. In fact, I think the phrase was just thrown out, financial doom for the retail investor. Let’s talk about these retail investors. For you to become an accredited investor, someone who would qualify to be able to invest in these startup companies, according to SEC rule 501, you need to be married, jointly; $300,000 in income; and $1 million of net worth, excluding your home. So you cannot include a milliondollar home. You have to have $1 million net worth outside of your home and have an income of $300,000. Earlier, college students were brought up. Not a whole lot of college students that I am aware of have $300,000 annual income or $1 million net worth. These are people who are sophisticated, typically. They are high net worth, by definition. Interestingly enough, as Members of Congress, if we allowed some of these amendments to go through and these restrictions to go through, as Members of Congress, we would be excluded from the room. We would be excluded. We couldn’t even go in there to educate ourselves about how this process works. That, ultimately, is what this is about. Those pitch days are not just for those people who are going to invest. Those pitch days are not just for the people who are going to do the investing. Those pitch days are for others to learn, to have an understanding. If you are a college student sitting in the back row, to understand what it looks like to become an entrepreneur, to really become a part of that engine of the American economy, you should be in the room. If you are someone who might be making a pitch later on and want to see how this happens and 
works, you ought to be in the room. Let’s not exclude those people. Why would we have a government closed off, closed room, a government sanctioned closed room that would keep people from understanding and achieving their hopes and dreams and success? I am pleased to be up here and to talk about this issue because we know that for our standing in the world, we need to have a dynamic economy. Our dynamic economy starts with our entrepreneurs and the risktakers who are willing to invest in those ideas. I just want to commend the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) for working in a bipartisan manner. I expect we are going to see a massively bipartisan vote for this bill, and I eagerly await that. I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 79. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 79 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act’’ or the ‘‘HALOS Act’’. 
The CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed in part B of House Report 115– 2. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MS . VELA´ZQUEZ  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 115–2. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When we think of a startup business, the early days of Apple or Google usually come to mind. Their stories are familiar—hardworking entrepreneurs who beat the odds. Like these companies, most successful startups have several common ingredients: a new product or service, a willingness to take risks, and leadership that can navigate the complexities of today’s economy. And successful firms also have a way of securing capital to both get off the ground and to grow. This last ingredient can present serious obstacles as startups face unique financing challenges. Many do not have positive cash flow, putting traditional bank loans out of reach. While some of these firms participate in incubator or accelerator programs that provide a small amount of seed capital, they must find new sources of funding when their initial capital runs out. One avenue for securing additional capital is by participating in demo days or pitch days. At these events, entrepreneurs have an opportunity to showcase their companies and innovations to potential investors. Today’s bill will alter SEC rules to exempt the use of general solicitation for presentations made at demo days. In other words, demo day organizers will not have to comply with the usual procedures verifying that the investors they are attracting to the event are accredited. Despite the wellintended goal of expanding the use of demo days to better meet startups’ capital needs, it is easy to see how unscrupulous actors could exploit this exemption to deceive ordinary people that were drawn to the event by a public advertisement. My amendment makes improvements to ensure attendees at demo days have an opportunity to be informed about the nature of these presentations and the risks of investing in startups. b1500 Typically, demo days are limited to select groups of potential investors. Let’s be clear, these are not science fairs, but they are sophisticated business presentations designed to raise capital for the entrepreneurs and their startups. However, the underlying bill allows colleges and universities and nonprofits to host these events and advertise them to the public. It is easy to see how some attendees might not know the true nature of the presentation. My amendment will address this by requiring event sponsors to provide an SECcreated disclosure outlining the nature of the event and investment risks. By creating a uniform disclosure, the SEC can take the burden off the sponsors and issuers on what to disclose. This amendment would also clarify that attendance at a demo day alone does not constitute a preexisting relationship and does not allow a stock issuer to sidestep their obligation to verify that an investor is accredited. Without this clarification, it is possible that issuers could defraud lesssophisticated retail investors. 
Demo days are a great way for our Nation’s entrepreneurs to raise capital, but they should be making presentations to the right investors, those that understand the risks of investing in risky startup businesses, not just anyone who saw an advertisement. My amendment would both expand the ability of small businesses to raise capital by tapping into demo days while ensuring that the right kind of investors, those accredited and fully informed, are participating in the small business capital markets. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, so here is the alternate reality you are expected to believe in this scenario that has been created. You are going to have somebody wander off the street with their checkbook in their pocket, listen to a 3 to 5minute pitch on an idea that is going to change the world, and then they are going to sign away their financial future and life savings. That is the scenario that is being painted for you out there today by the opponents of this commonsense legislation. Again, to be an investor, you must be an accredited investor, according to the SEC rules, Rule 501, that says you have $300,000 of income annually and a net worth of $1 million outside of your home. Owning your house doesn’t count towards that. I have been to these pitch days. You know what you are walking into. You don’t just stumble on it and go: Wow, what’s going on here? I have never thought about this. Tell you what, I am going to write a five or six or sevenfigure check today and put myself into financial ruin. That is not how these things work. Mr. Chairman, at the end of the day, I think it is important to just review a little bit of the history here. First of all, this amendment isn’t necessary. It would create yet another SECrequired disclosure and further burden the ability for startups to present their ideas to demo days. I would note that this amendment could have been offered last March, either in committee or while we here in the House had consideration last April 2016. However, in both cases that didn’t occur. Let’s remember why we are here today, Mr. Chairman. When the SEC promulgated the rules to implement Title II of the JOBS Act, the agency made something that was legal prior to April 5 of 2012 suddenly illegal. The SEC decided that demo days that bring together those entrepreneurs and those companies suddenly became a general solicitation. That isn’t the case, and this amendment would require the SEC to prescribe a disclosure that ‘‘describes the nature of the event and the risks of investing in securities being advertised.’’ There is no sale that day, Mr. Chairman. No sale at all is going to happen. There is no exchange that happens at that event. This amendment is unnecessary, overly broad, and would delay the return to the certainty that the pre JOBS Act had brought. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how many other speakers the gentleman has? Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on this amendment. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First of all, I am the author of the amendment, and in the amendment, there is no place in which it requires anyone to sign anything. This is a reasonable, straightforward, simple amendment that provides transparency and protection to the investors. The gentleman says that this is not an offering. While some presentations may not explicitly be offering securities for sale, these demo days are not a simple science fair. They are sophisticated business presentations designed to generate hype and investor interest. If a sponsor wants to advertise such events to the public, it is reasonable that they also provide information regarding the risk of investing in startups. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, you just heard the author of the amendment make the case that this is a complicated process in general that an unaccredited person is not going to be allowed to invest in. So it requires the event sponsor to provide attendees with a written disclosure outlining the nature of the event and the risks of investing in the securities for sale. It is not an offering that is happening at those demo days. I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . CLAY  
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chair, I move for the adoption of the amendment. This amendment, combined with Velazquez amendment, if adopted, would ensure that the bill strikes the appropriate balance between capital formation and investor protection. First, the Waters amendment would prohibit event sponsors from collecting finders’ fees for connecting potential investors to companies. This prohibition helps ensure that event sponsors, including colleges, nonprofits, and trade associations, don’t have perverse incentives to drum up sales of stock. Second, the Waters amendment would require the company selling securities to be a company operating in the real economy, not a hedge fund, shell company, or company going through bankruptcy. Not only does this provision protect investors from purchasing shares of an opaque or speculative firm, but it also ensures that the bill is targeted to provide relief to our Nation’s startups and small businesses. These two provisions are commonsense changes that I hope will receive bipartisan support. I move for the adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chairman, once again, we are seeing an unnecessary, duplicative amendment here. The amendment, as it is laid out, creates a new definition of an issuer. The Securities Exchange Act already defines an issuer, and Ms. WATERS ’ definition is vague, confusing and, frankly, unnecessary. Demo days are opportunities for startup companies to present their ideas to potential investors that are accredited. Again, accredited. At this point, all of America is shouting back at C–SPAN, saying, $300,000 in income 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 306) to amend the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to promote energy efficiency via information and computing technologies, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 306 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Energy Efficient Government Technology Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BOST). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government is a major consumer of electricity, and its information technologies account for a large and growing percentage of that major use. That is why we need H.R. 306, the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act, introduced by my good friend from California (Ms. ESHOO ). This bill creates a process by which Federal agencies can incorporate the latest efficiency improvements in their information technologies, including data centers. It also sets out yardsticks to measure progress. The result of this bill would be lower Federal energy bills and taxpayer savings. In addition, the Federal Government can set an example for energy efficiency that the private sector IT systems would be able to copy. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to rise today in support of this legislation, the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act. I want to thank my colleague and friend, Mr. OLSON , for his wonderful description of the bill and his important support of it. I want to thank the new chairman of the full committee, Mr. WALDEN , and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. PALLONE , for their support, and my legislative partner, ADAM KINZINGER , for his partnership on this bill. I hope that this, the 115th Congress, is going to be the magic charm. I have introduced this bill now in three Congresses, and it passed in each Congress, but it didn’t make it to the President’s desk. I hope this time it will. The bill is really a very simple one. It is about bringing the Federal Government’s IT and data centers into the 21st century. The Federal Government is the Nation’s largest energy user. I want to say that again. The Federal Government is our Nation’s largest energy user, and we should lead by example in this area. By requiring Federal agencies to utilize the best technologies and energy management strategies, this bill will reduce the government’s energy use. Very importantly, it is going to save taxpayer dollars, and it is going to also set an example for the private sector. Today, the world generates more data in 12 hours than was generated in all of human history prior to 2003. I can tell by the look on your face, Mr. Speaker, that that takes your breath away. This data must be stored and processed at data centers, which are the backbone of the 21st century economy, but can be highly energy inefficient. While we now routinely hear about data centers, this was not the case when I began examining this issue over a decade ago. In those days, I had to explain to my colleagues what a data center was. In 2005, I offered language in the Energy Policy Act which mandated an EPA study on the energy use and energy costs of data centers. This report was then transmitted to Congress in 2007, and today most Americans understand that data centers are a critical part of our national infrastructure and are found in nearly every sector of our economy. According to the GSA, the Federal Government, alone, has more than 2,000 data centers which store everything from Social Security and tax records to ebooks at the Library of Congress. Several Silicon Valley companies have taken the lead in developing efficient, sustainable data centers, but we can do much, much more across the private sector and the government. The Department of Energy estimates that the 70 billion kilowatt hours of electricity that are used by U.S. data centers annually could be slashed in half simply through implementation of best practices and existing technologies. This bill, H.R. 306, will drive energy efficiency improvements across the government’s IT and data centers by requiring Federal agencies to, number one, utilize the best technologies and energy management strategies; two, formulate specific goals and periodically review their energy efficiency—it 
is very important to track the efficiencies—and, three, make government center data energy usage statistics public in a way that empowers further innovation. Importantly, the bill requires government agencies to formulate specific performance goals and a means to calculate overall cost savings from implementation. Mr. Speaker, as I said, I first introduced the legislation in 2013. It has passed the House by wide margins in each of the last two Congresses. It is noncontroversial. It is bipartisan. It makes sense. I want to urge all of my colleagues to support the bill. I thank my colleagues on a bipartisan basis at the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague in trying to spice things up, so I reserve the balance of my allotted time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ), my valued colleague on the committee. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 306, the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act, sponsored by the committee. It is also bipartisan, as my colleague from California mentioned, sponsored by Ms. ESHOO and Mr. K INZINGER of Illinois. H.R. 306 promotes the use of energy efficiency and energy savings information technologies and practices across the Federal Government, especially in data centers. The bill amends the Energy Independence Act of 2007 to require Federal agencies to coordinate with the OMB, DOE, and EPA in developing an implementation strategy for the maintenance, purchase, and use of energy efficiency and energy savings information technology. Ten percent of Federal electricity is consumed by Federal energy centers. H.R. 306 aims to keep that at 10 percent or even to reduce it. The legislation also sets out specific items for consideration in developing an implementation strategy that requires the establishment of performance goals for evaluating agencies’ efforts. In addition, the bill would amend the 2007 act to require the DOE and EPA to collaborate with stakeholders in the implementation of data centers, efficiency programs, and other measures to improve data center energy efficiency. Again, the legislation was passed by the House without dissent last year as standalone legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it. I commend my colleagues Ms. ESHOO  and Mr. KINZINGER . Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I have been a naval aviator, a Senate staffer, and a Member of Congress. In those 20 years, the best leaders I have seen are ones who lead by example. H.R. 306 makes sure D.C. leads by example. If we lead, the whole country will follow. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘aye’’ on H.R. 306. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 306. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SMALL BUSINESS BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT ACT Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 288) to ensure that small business providers of broadband Internet access service can devote resources to broadband deployment rather than compliance with cumbersome regulatory requirements. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 288 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Business Broadband Deployment Act’’. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the RECORD on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. b1530 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 288, the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act. I am glad that the House is taking swift action on this bill, which would protect small Internet service providers from the enhanced disclosure requirements laid out in the 2015 Open Internet Order. After adopting the Open Internet Order, the FCC recognized the importance of exempting small ISPs from these enhanced transparency rules and subsequently granted a temporary exemption to broadband providers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers. However, the Commission failed to reach an agreement to grant another exemption before the deadline last December and, as a result, has left hundreds of our Nation’s small providers vulnerable to cumbersome rules. FCC Commissioners Pai and O’Rielly have taken action, since the exemption expired, to reassure our small broadband providers that the rules will not be enforced until the situation has been addressed by the Commission, but Congress should go a step further and provide certainty to our Nation’s small businesses and pass this bill. Rather than a 1year exemption to the enhanced disclosure requirements, this bill would exempt for 5 years broadband providers with fewer than 250,000 subscribers from the enhanced reporting obligations, providing them with the regulatory certainty to invest in their business. At our hearing last January, we heard from multiple witnesses just how cumbersome and burdensome these rules are. One witness described the difference to be as significant as the need to hire regulatory counsel versus the ability to build another tower to provide service. For a small business in a capitalintensive industry, that could be the difference between getting more people connected to the Internet and going out of business. We cannot let our small businesses and hardworking taxpayers be saddled 
with more onerous rules and the costs that they bring. In addition to regulatory relief for small ISPs, the bill adds certainty for our Nation’s small ISPs by extending the exemption for 5 years. It was disappointing to see the Commission fail to reach an agreement at the end of last year to extend the exemption, and it is why we are here today. Despite overwhelming bipartisan support from Congress and President Obama’s Small Business Administration, negotiations fell short, and our Nation’s smallest and most competitive Internet service providers were left to bear the burden. In today’s 21st century economy, we need to do more to encourage connectivity, and this bill embodies that spirit. Congress is poised to provide the regulatory certainty small businesses are seeking in order to invest in stronger networks and foster a better consumer experience. I want to thank Chairman WALDEN  and Mr. LOEBSACK for acting quickly to reintroduce this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the commonsense measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First of all, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Oregon on his new chairmanship. I look forward to working across the aisle on most of the issues. It is a good bipartisan subcommittee. I think we have a lot to accomplish. The Small Business Broadband Deployment Act, H.R. 288, unanimously passed the House last Congress on a bipartisan vote, unanimous. H.R. 288 provides a 5year exemption from the FCC’s enhanced transparency rules for small Internet service providers that serve 250,000 or fewer subscribers. This exemption comes with the understanding that there is a 5year sunset on the exemption and that the FCC report to Congress with sufficient information to help us better understand the impacts on the consumers of a permanent exemption, of a possible permanent exemption. This data will also better inform us whether a longer term exemption is necessary and whether we got the definition of what a small business is right in this case. It is also worth noting that H.R. 288 would leave intact the FCC’s 2010 transparency rules that consumers have come to rely on, such as what they are paying for, Internet speeds they rely on, data quality, and so on. At the same time, these modifications provide certainty for small ISPs while the FCC collects and reports relevant information to Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the author of this legislation. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the new subcommittee chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology. I know our country is in good hands and our committee is as well with Mrs. BLACKBURN  chairing that important subcommittee. I want to thank my colleague from California for his kind comments and his work over the years on these issues. I concur with him that we have a wonderful opportunity to continue our bipartisan work as the committee has been known for, for a long time. Clearly, from time to time, we will have our differences, and we know that as well. It is part of democracy. There is so much of this work, like this bill, that is so very important. As we begin the 115th Congress, I am pleased to be here to support this bipartisan bill because I think it reflects the best of what government can do for those who sent us here. Small Business Broadband Deployment Act seeks to alleviate, as you have heard, Mr. Speaker, these unnecessary regulatory burdens on small Internet service providers—these are the small ones, oftentimes in our rural communities but not always—while still ensuring that consumers are protected. We found the right balance here. By extending an exemption to the Federal Communications Commission’s enhanced reporting rules, this bill allows these small businesses to focus on their core mission, and that is to provide broadband Internet access to customers throughout America. Over the past year, we spent a great deal of time focused on this issue. We first raised concerns with the Federal Communications Commission in a letter, Mr. Speaker, from the committee, as well as from the Committee on Small Business. We urged the chairman, Tom Wheeler, to not only make the exemption permanent but also to raise the threshold by defining a small business to bring it in line with the definitions previously blessed by the Obama administration’s Small Business Administration. We were trying to find some consistency, some workability, and some common sense here. Well, unfortunately, the FCC only extended the exemption for 1 year, despite the overwhelming support to do this permanent extension. It was clear Congress needed to act. That is what we are doing here. I introduced a discussion draft last year that would have permanently extended the exemption and increased the threshold by defining a small business. At our January 2016 legislative hearing on the bill, we heard from a small Internet service provider who shared the dilemma that many small ISPs face in these circumstances: Should they put up new equipment, or should they hire a lawyer to help with compliance? Should they improve service for customers, or should they devote those financial resources to sifting through regulatory language and drafting extensive reports on packet loss? So often these small ISPs provide service to areas of the country that are rural, like in my district throughout eastern Oregon or Representative LOEBSACK ’s district in Iowa—we heard from him—or may not be as easy to serve and, in some cases, provide a vital competitive edge to larger Internet service providers. We should be making all efforts to promote the viability of these businesses, not saddle them with additional requirements that make it more difficult to do what they are in business to do. Representative LOEBSACK and I were able to come to a compromise through extensive negotiation. In the bill we have before us today, we extend this exemption for 5 years. Now, it gives greater regulatory certainty to these small Internet service providers looking for predictability when making investment decisions. In addition, we increased the threshold for defining a small business and required the FCC to report back to Congress on the exemption along with data around small ISPs that is currently lacking. In the end, this bill presents a good compromise that will relieve burdens for small businesses while leaving in place protections for consumers. So it is important to note this bill doesn’t affect the transparency rules, as my colleagues have mentioned, adopted in the FCC’s 2010 rules. Consumers will continue to have access to those disclosures they have come to expect, with the information needed to make informed decisions about their Internet service. Again, this bill passed the House unanimously last year, 411–0. Unfortunately, while it made it through the Senate Commerce Committee, it never quite came up for a vote in the Senate. In addition, the exemption granted by the FCC expired on December 15, 2016, and has not yet been renewed. Now, that leaves these many small businesses exposed to the serious reporting burden that we have heard about throughout this process, as well as a great deal of uncertainty around what the future may hold for them. It is now more important than ever that we act to quickly fill this gap and protect these businesses and the consumers they serve. I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, especially Representative LOEBSACK , for working with us on this bill. This bipartisan process has resulted in a strong piece of legislation that I am confident will protect many and promote continued network investment and buildout by small businesses. This legislation represents a commonsense approach to a problem that directly impacts so many of our constituents. This solution will enable our country to continue its leadership in broadband deployment. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the chairman for his work on this and for his willingness to 
compromise. As he pointed out, it was a process. It took both sides. I think he wanted permanent exemption, we wanted a less exemption, and it worked out. I think it is the right compromise. Five years gives businesses the predictability they need. It is a good place to be. In 5 years, we will see the report and whether it makes sense to continue the exemption or not. I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague from Tennessee on assuming the chairmanship of the subcommittee. I look forward to our working together. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), a new member of our committee, the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support of H.R. 288, the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act. In 2015, the FCC adopted burdensome transparency requirements for Internet service providers. The FCC immediately recognized that these new transparency requirements would be particularly burdensome for small Internet service providers, so they provided a temporary exemption for providers with 100,000 or fewer subscribers. Despite overwhelming support to make the exemption permanent, the Commission extended the current exemption for just an additional year. The bill eases the burdens created by the FCC rule by extending the exemption to Internet service providers who have 250,000 subscribers or less and extends the exemption for 5 years. This is commonsense legislation. This bill provides relief and certainty to Internet service providers so they can continue to build networks, deploy broadband, improve connectivity for rural consumers, and create jobs. I commend Chairman WALDEN for championing this legislation so that we can continue to grow our infrastructure and improve connectivity for rural Americans. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ). Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 288, the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act. This commonsense, bipartisan legislation does two important things. First, it extends the temporary exemption granted to small businesses by the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, from the burdensome disclosure requirements for Internet service providers and the FCC’s own Open Internet Order by 5 years. Second, it increases the number of small businesses that can utilize the exemption by raising the threshold from 100,000 subscribers to the much more realistic 250,000 subscribers. Small businesses frequently feel that the Federal Government exercises its most creativity in looking for new ways to get in their way. Oftentimes, small Internet providers are the only ones willing to take the risk and deploy broadband to particularly hardto reach areas of rural America. The last thing they have time for is the FCC imposing a greater regulatory burden on them, diverting precious resources to make Washington bureaucrats busy instead of doing what they do best, providing high quality broadband services to millions of Americans in every corner of our country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and help reduce a portion of the tedious regulatory burden on small businesses. b1545 Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to say that the bill passed unanimously in the last Congress. It is bipartisan. It gives small ISP providers a certain amount of time and it allows the FCC to decide if it is overburdensome or not, to require them to disclose information to their customers. This allows us to give customers the amount of protection that is due them as well. So it is a good compromise. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. I thank my colleagues for their hard work. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I will just encourage my colleagues to join us in passing H.R. 288. As my colleague from California said, this is one of those commonsense measures. When you talk about removing the burden of regulatory overreach from our Nation’s small business, and in this case, our small Internet service providers, this is something that will help get that job done. It is also something that will help extend Internet service to more Americans, and that is a goal that we all share. So at this time, in closing, I encourage passage of H.R. 288. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 288. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
INSPIRING THE NEXT SPACE PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, RESEARCHERS, AND EXPLORERS (INSPIRE) WOMEN ACT Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 321) to inspire women to enter the aerospace field, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, through mentorship and outreach. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 321 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Inspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers (INSPIRE) Women Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Mrs. C OMSTOCK ) and the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Virginia. 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 321, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise to offer H.R. 321, the INSPIRE Act. I am pleased to lead this effort along with the chairman and ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, LAMAR SMITH and EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , as well as Congresswoman ESTY. We did pass this bill last year and now we are revisiting it since it didn’t get through the Senate. Recently, the movie, ‘‘Hidden Figures,’’ was released detailing a few of the unsung heroes of NASA. This movie highlights the moving story of a group of African American women who worked at NASA at a historic time in the 1960s as mathematicians during the space race. Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson were featured in the movie for their work that launched America into space. In a recent interview with the LA Times, Ms. Johnson, who is still living, was asked: ‘‘At the time, did you know that John Glenn asked for ‘the girl’ (which would be you) to check the numbers before he took his landmark flight into space? Did it heighten the stakes for you?’’ Ms. Johnson’s response: ‘‘I knew they asked me to check the numbers. That was what I did. They knew my record for accuracy. I knew and had confidence in my math, so I did it. I always did my best.’’ Mr. Speaker, I didn’t know the story of these women growing up, even though they were doing these things at a time when we were all watching these things happen. But now today’s young women well know that story. It is an inspiring story. It is one of those movies Ms. ESTYand I were speaking about yesterday that were on our list of mustsees. These women were critical to the success of our astronauts and our space program that would eventually put a man on the Moon. Now is the time to pass this legislation that will afford opportunities to a future generation of women leaders who will have a similar impact on our Nation’s history, and maybe, one day, put a woman on Mars. The INSPIRE Act authorizes the NASA administrator to encourage young women to study mathematics, known as the STEM fields, and to pursue careers that will further advance America’s space science and exploration efforts through support of NASA initiatives such as NASA GIRLS, Aspire 2 Inspire, and the Summer Institute in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Research—SISTER. The goal of NASA GIRLS is to create a virtual mentoring project that offers a oneofakind experience to middle school students using online capabilities. NASA’s vision for Aspire 2 Inspire was to reach out to young girls and present some of the STEM career opportunities through the real lives and jobs of early career women at NASA. The SISTER program is designed to increase awareness of and provide an opportunity for female middle school students to be exposed to and explore nontraditional career fields with Goddard Space Flight Center women engineers, mathematicians, scientists, technicians, and researchers. According to NASA, 58 women have traveled in space. Fortynine of those have flown with NASA. Of course, there are so many other careers available for women in NASA, and we want to make sure all of those are available for them. We know the stories of women like Sally Ride and Mae Jemison, but, ironically, we didn’t know these hidden figures that are behind the scene. So now, as we move forward under this program, we hope everyone will know about the many women and the many careers open to both men and women in this NASA program. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 321, the INSPIRE Women Act. This bill calls on the NASA administrator to support initiatives that encourage girls and young women to study STEM fields and pursue careers in aerospace. Unfortunately, women are woefully underrepresented in many STEM fields, including aeronautics and aerospace. One of the key barriers to women entering technical fields is self selection out of STEM degrees due to a lack of role models. In the words of longtime children’s advocate and activist, Marian Wright Edelman: ‘‘You can’t be what you can’t see.’’ Too many girls and young women decide not to pursue studies in technical fields such as science, engineering, and aerospace because they look at their teachers and their role models and they see no one who looks like them. When students are able to visualize themselves working in technical fields, they gain the confidence they need to take the first step in pursuit of a challenging and rewarding STEM career, to their benefit and to the benefit of society as a whole. NASA, with its extraordinary STEM workforce, is in a unique position to help close this gap. The agency has access to a diverse group of current and retired women astronauts, scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and innovators whose accomplishments and career paths are just the sort of inspiration that girls and young women need. Astronaut Kate Rubins broke barriers and boundaries when she became the first person to ever sequence DNA in space during her spaceflight last year. Just last Friday, Peggy Whitson, the first female commander of the International Space Station, completed her seventh space walk. Vera Rubin’s recent passing reminded us of her trailblazing career in astronomy in which she made the groundbreaking discovery of dark matter. As has already been mentioned by my friend and colleague, BARBARA COMSTOCK , the newly released movie, ‘‘Hidden Figures,’’ highlights through the pioneering story of early NASA mathematicians and engineers Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson that women have been instrumental to our aerospace enterprise since its inception. NASA has developed a number of programs aimed at leveraging its inspirational workforce to encourage girls and young women to pursue STEM degrees and STEM careers. This includes the NASA GIRLS program, the Aspire 2 Inspire program, and the Summer Institute in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Research, or SISTER program. H.R. 321 instructs the NASA administrator to continue supporting these and other programs that encourage women and girls to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, as well as to pursue careers in aerospace. Additionally, the bill calls on NASA to develop a plan for how it can best facilitate and support current and retired astronauts, scientists, engineers, and innovators to engage with K–12 female STEM students. Although retired engineers, astronauts, scientists, and engineers are invaluable to inspiring the next generation of NASA scientists, I am especially glad and thankful to my colleague for including early career female astronauts, scientists, engineers, and innovators in this plan. It is very important for America’s young girls to have experiences interacting with young women who look like them in the STEM fields. I thank my Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleague, Representative COMSTOCK , for her leadership on the bill, as well as our esteemed chairman, LAMAR SMITH, and our wonderful ranking member, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON . I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. COSTELLO ). 
Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 321, the INSPIRE Women Act, and commend the leadership of Congresswoman COMSTOCK and Congresswoman E STYon this bill, which I am pleased to also cosponsor. We should be doing all we can to encourage young women who wish to study or follow a STEM career path, and Congresswoman COMSTOCK has introduced this commonsense bill to achieve that goal. H.R. 321 would require NASA to support astronauts, scientists, and engineers who have retired in their efforts to encourage young women who are interested in studying or working in a STEM field. Mr. Speaker, innovative thinkers are critical to our country’s success in the modern global workforce. But we have heard the statistics. Women make up half of the U.S. workforce and half of the college educated workforce. Yet, only 25 percent of women who attain degrees in the STEM field actually end up working in STEM jobs. That is why I support this bill and that is why I think the aims of this bill are very laudable and could go a long way toward closing that gap. It is an important effort to improve retention of women studying and working in STEM fields. I thank again Congresswomen COMSTOCK and E STYfor their leadership. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON ), my ranking member. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 321, the Inspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers Women Act. I want to express my appreciation for the leadership of Congresswoman ESTY and Congresswoman COMSTOCK . This bill would help ensure that the incoming administration continues to promote and strengthen important programs at NASA to inspire and mentor girls and young women to pursue studies and careers in STEM areas. Despite progress in the right direction, women remain largely underrepresented in STEM fields because they continue to face cultural and institutional barriers throughout their studies and career progression. H.R. 321 would support existing programs at NASA that encourage young girls and women to study STEM fields and pursue careers in aerospace. b1600 These programs include NASA GIRLS, a virtual mentoring program; Aspire to Inspire, a program connecting young girls with women in STEM careers at NASA; and a summer institute program that increases awareness and exposes young, middle school girls to the STEM careers at NASA. H.R. 321 also calls on NASA to develop a plan for how best to use its current and retired workforce to mentor female K–12 students. What comes to mind are the inspirational women who are featured in the new movie ‘‘Hidden Figures.’’ Those brilliant and brave women opened the door for so many who followed. We must continue to support our great women in STEM who dedicate their time to mentor the girls and young women who will be our next scientists, engineers, and innovators. I thank my colleagues again—Representative COMSTOCK for her leadership on this bill and Representative ESTY. I strongly support this bill and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass it. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my esteemed colleagues for their leadership on this, in particular, Representative COMSTOCK from Virginia and the ranking member. This is a very laudable bill that plays an important role in inspiring the next generation of STEM engineers and scientists, and I am pleased that we are able to offer this again. This did pass in the last Congress. Unfortunately, it did not make it through the Senate. I am delighted that we are moving early in this session and would urge all of my colleagues to swiftly pass this, to send it to the Senate, and to get it on the President’s desk and make sure these important programs are supported long into the future. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, we have had over 65 cosponsors this year on the bill, as was mentioned by my colleague. It had strong bipartisan support last year and it has also been introduced now in the Senate, so we certainly hope it will move through quickly. Eileen Collins, who became the first female to command and pilot a spacecraft, was asked to give advice to future astronauts. She stated: 
My advice to young people is to go into the field you are most interested in. If you love your job, you will do well in your job. 
I think what we have all discussed here today is, when you can see that job and when you can see people who look like you—see women and people from all walks of life in those positions—and the Internet allows us to do that now, then you can really have that kind of exposure, which is quite exciting. I appreciate the opportunity to, once again, present this bill, and I ask my colleagues to join me in support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, science, technology, engineering and math are critical to America’s future prosperity. Women are unfortunately underrepresented in STEM careers. Despite representing nearly half of the collegeeducated and total U.S. workforce, women account for less than 25 percent of America’s STEM workforce. Supporting women’s involvement in the fields of aerospace and space exploration should be an important part of NASA’s mission. Current NASA programs such as NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS are important and give young students the opportunity to interact and learn from real NASA engineers, scientists, and technologists. They provide virtual mentoring that use commercially available video chat programs to pair NASA innovators with young students across the country. H.R. 321 builds upon this success. It leverages NASA’s talent pool of current and retired astronauts, and early career female scientists, engineers, and innovators to inform and inspire young women to pursue their dreams in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. One day, these young people will push the boundaries of space. Space can be a catalyst for inspiring young girls to enter the STEM fields. By doing our part to support their engagement in space with this legislation, we are investing in the futures of our daughters, nieces, and grandchildren. I again want to thank the bill sponsor, Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman COMSTOCK for her leadership on this topic. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 321, the INSPIRE Women, Act. I support this legislation because Article 1 Section 8 of the United States Constitution states our duty ‘‘To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries . . .’’ This includes the education of our next generation of women considering participation in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and to pursue careers in aerospace. Statistics show that women remain underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce, although to a lesser degree than in the past, with the greatest disparities occurring in engineering, computer science, and the physical sciences (NSF, Science & Engineering Indicators, 2014). 1. Female scientists and engineers are concentrated in different occupations than are men, with relatively high shares of women in the social sciences (58 percent) 2. biological and medical sciences (48 percent) 3. relatively low shares in engineering (13 percent) 4. computer and mathematical sciences (25 percent) (NSF, Science & Engineering Indicators, 2014). Women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. workforce, but are much less represented in particular science and engineering occupations (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Women in the Labor Force: A Databook, 2014): 1. 39 percent of chemists and material scientists are women; 2. 27.9 percent of environmental scientists and geoscientists are women; 3. 15.6 percent of chemical engineers are women; 4. 12.1 percent of civil engineers are women; 5. 8.3 percent of electrical and electronics engineers are women; 
6. 17.2 percent of industrial engineers are women; and 7. 7.2 percent of mechanical engineers are women. These statistics show that measures need to be taken in order to promote women participation in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and to pursue careers in aerospace. H.R. 321 will support NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS, virtual mentoring programs using commercially available video chat programs, to pair National Aeronautics and Space Administration mentors with young students anywhere in the country. NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS give young students the opportunity to interact and learn from real engineers, scientists, and technologists. H.R. 321 will also support the ‘‘Aspire to Inspire’’ Program (A2I), which engages young girls to present science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career opportunities through the real lives and jobs of early career women at NASA. H.R. 321 also promotes the Summer Institute in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Research (SISTER) program at the Goddard Space Flight Center designed to increase awareness of, and provide an opportunity for, female middle school students to be exposed to and explore nontraditional career fields with Goddard Space Flight Center women engineers, mathematicians, scientists, technicians, and researchers. Let me close by urging all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 321. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 321. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PROMOTING WOMEN IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 255) to authorize the National Science Foundation to support entrepreneurial programs for women. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 255 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ) and the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Virginia. 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 255, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I offer another bipartisan bill that Ms. ESTYand I have introduced, H.R. 255, her bill called Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act. We are joined again on this measure by the chairman and the ranking member, who are original cosponsors of this bill. Our bill, H.R. 255, amends the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act to authorize the National Science Foundation to use its entrepreneurial programs to recruit women and to extend their focus beyond the laboratory and into the commercial world. The bill also includes a number of findings regarding women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, also known as the STEM fields. One finding in this bill notes that women make up almost 50 percent of the workforce but less than 25 percent of the workforce in STEM professions. We want to make sure we can do everything to improve these statistics, and we believe this bill, along with our earlier bill that we voted on, is a step in the right direction. Again, I have been happy to collaborate with my colleague, Congresswoman ESTY, on this important legislation for our young women so that they may look to the stars and realize their dreams in this important field that will really be important in the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 255, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act. Our bill encourages the National Science Foundation to use its successful entrepreneurial education and training programs, such as the Innovation Corps, known as ICorps, and Partnerships for Innovation, to inspire, recruit, and support women scientists and engineers who are interested in turning their laboratory discoveries into commercial technologies. Mr. Speaker, you may ask: Why is it that we need a bill like this? We have these programs. Doesn’t everyone know that we need more women in the STEM fields? The answer is twofold: Number one, we have a workforce shortage. If you take the field of advanced manufacturing by itself, in New England, there are 16,000 positions that are open currently. We have people who are looking for work—many of them women. They don’t have the skill sets to meet that open job need right now, and that is a need for America to fill those jobs; so, number one, we need our qualified workforce with appropriate skills to meet the jobs of today. We also need to think about the jobs of tomorrow. We are a wonderfully diverse country. Over half of our workforce is made up of women and people of color—historically, chronically, still—underrepresented in the STEM fields. There are problems we aren’t even addressing and solutions we haven’t thought of if we don’t have more women with these power tools of the STEM skills to address the challenges and opportunities that this country is facing; so it is both a moral and an economic imperative that we equip more young women, and that is what our bill aims to do here today. I have heard time and time again in my district, in which we have a lot of small startup companies and major universities, about this challenge that we face of bridging that gap between the laboratory and what happens in the commercial workforce. Through my work, I have formed a STEM advisory council and have met with them for the last 2 years. Among these are the problems they identified: limited access to capital, a lack of women mentors in the STEM fields, unmanageable expectations for worklife balance, and unconscious biases against women in the sciences. These are among the sorts of issues for which the ICorps and the Partnerships for Innovation have been designed—in order to help close that gap to deal with these issues. I want to give you examples of two of the women in my district with whom I have met who are benefiting from these programs and why we need to have more of them and the kind of difference that they will make. 
The first is Zengmin Xia. She is a student at the University of Connecticut, and she helped the Wei Laboratory secure a National Science Foundation ICorps grant to commercialize her work on tissue engineer scaffolds, innovative work which is going to help with bone repair and regeneration. She attributes her success to her female adviser and mentor, Professor Mei Wei, who encouraged her as a young woman to carry out her path forward in the biotech world. She helped her make that transition from the lab and the classroom out into the commercial world. She was lucky that she had a mentor with the experience to help close this gap. Claire Leonardi is the CEO of Health Esense, which is a digital health startup firm in Avon, Connecticut. She received seed grant funding and gained access to handson training workshops to learn how to market her technology to consumers. She is now equipped with the tools to take her discovery and bring it into market. Both of these women scientists are examples of the kind of innovation, the kind of economic engine, and the problem solving we need all Americans to participate in. That is what is at stake. That is why we are proposing this. This is not simply about having a poster with a diverse group of scientists to hang on the wall at the Air and Space Museum and inspire young people. That is important, but it is also important to build on the good work we have already done with the National Science Foundation—to really provide that equipment, those tools, those mentors, the training, and to take those lab discoveries, the basic R&D, and commercialize it. I am very excited that we are reintroducing this bill. It passed with overwhelming support in the last Congress. Once again, sadly, it did not pass in the Senate, but we will start early in this Congress. I am delighted to be working again with my colleague, Mrs. COMSTOCK ; with the ranking member, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , who is here today; and with Chairman SMITH, who is detained with other committee work. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON ). Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 255, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act. The bill helps to build on STEM education and mentorship programs, such as those highlighted in the INSPIRE Women Act. More women are pursuing STEM degrees and careers overall, but they continue to be underrepresented in many STEM fields. This is especially true in STEM fields with high entrepreneurship rates, such as engineering and computer science. Women who successfully complete degrees in these fields and want to turn their research and their talents into building new companies and creating new jobs then disproportionately face new hurdles, such as obtaining access to credit. Unfortunately, because of these barriers, it remains as important as ever for our Federal science agencies to support programs and provide grants with the goal of encouraging, inspiring, and supporting women in STEM at all levels of their education and training, including entrepreneurship education and training. H.R. 255 ensures that longstanding entrepreneurship education and training programs at the National Science Foundation continue to encourage and recruit women who are looking to move beyond the laboratory and commercialize the results of their research. If we are serious about growing our economy, it is just common sense that we would encourage all of our best and brightest—male and female—to commercialize their best ideas and create new companies and new jobs. I thank my colleagues Representative ESTYfor her leadership and Representative COMSTOCK for her leadership on this bill. I strongly support the bill and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1615 Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank Congressman COMSTOCK , Ranking Member EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , and our Chairman LAMAR SMITH, and I would urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile piece of legislation. It is wonderful to be able to start out the legislative session with important legislation that will help make a difference. Not only the lives of the individuals who receive these grants and this training but the entire country benefits when we have more women and more young women trained in these fields and able to operationalize and commercialize their discoveries to the benefit of all Americans and, in many cases, the entire world. I urge my colleagues to adopt this and vote in favor of this important resolution. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman ESTYand Congressman JOHNSON and appreciate their passion on both of these bills and their leadership and, once again, being able to join with them on inspiring the next generation of women leaders in the STEM fields. As was noted by my colleagues, there is such a shortage of people to fill these jobs in general. Now this will equip more women to be able to be prepared in these important fields that will allow us to be leaders in the 21st century economy. I would like to thank our staff—particularly we have our female staff here who have been very active on our bill, as well as a male. We are fortunate to have female leadership on our staff, also, and we thank them. I know, in working on a program that I have had over the past 4 years, a young woman’s leadership program, NASA, space, and astronauts have been some of the most popular people that our women in junior high and high school have liked to meet, hear from, and really be able to see themselves in those roles and to talk to women who have actually been leaders in those fields. So I appreciate the opportunity to join with my colleagues now in giving that opportunity to the next generation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 255, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act. I thank my Science Committee colleagues Ms. ESTY, who authored the bill, and Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman COMSTOCK for their initiative on this issue. H.R. 255 authorizes the National Science Foundation (NSF) to use its existing entrepreneurial programs to recruit and support women and help them develop their research and technology ideas for the marketplace. STEM education is critical to our country’s economy and global competitiveness. A well educated and trained STEM workforce promotes our future economic prosperity. These STEM workers have the potential to develop technologies that could save thousands of lives, jumpstart new industries, or even discover new worlds. That’s why I authored with Ms. ESTY the STEM Education Act, a new law that strengthens science, technology, engineering and mathematics education efforts at federal science agencies. It also, for the first time, expands the definition of STEM to include computer science. The bill was signed by the President in October 2015. Unfortunately, studies show that only 26 percent of women who attain degrees in STEM fields work in STEM jobs. H.R. 255 encourages NSF to tackle this problem. It enhances women’s ability to translate their enthusiasm, scientific expertise and research ideas into tangible products and businesses. Inspiring American students to seek science and math careers is a goal shared by Republicans and Democrats alike. Some of the most energizing and exciting moments of my Science Committee chairmanship have been interactions with young people who want to pursue STEM studies and careers. At various Committee hearings and robotics competitions in my district, I have encountered motivated, talented young people who want nothing more than an opportunity to pursue their dreams. And, in some cases, change the world with their ideas. Their passion for learning and science reminds me of why I enjoy serving in Congress and on the Science Committee. I again thank Ms. ESTY and Chairwoman COMSTOCK for their work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 255. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 255 the ‘‘Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act.’’ 
As a Senior Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security who sits on the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies, I know well of the need to encourage and train women to thrive in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Promoting diversity in the STEM professions is more than just an idea; it requires an understanding that there is a need to have a process that will ensure the inclusion of all minorities and women in all areas of American life. Studies have found that women make up almost 50 percent of the workforce. Studies note that 23 percent of STEM workers are women; however, women make up 48 percent of workers in all occupations. Only 26 percent of women who do attain degrees in STEM fields work in STEM jobs. According to the most recent available data women are less likely to focus on the STEM disciplines in undergraduate and graduate studies. In 1991, women received 29.6 percent of computer science B.A.’s, compared to just 18.2 percent in 2010. Jobs in computer systems design and related services, a field dependent upon high level math and problemsolving skills, are projected to grow 45 percent between 2008 and 2018. There are approximately 6 million women and minority owned businesses in the United States, representing a significant aspect of our economy. My home city of Houston, Texas, the energy capital of the world, knows the importance of professionals in the STEM industries. It has been reported that the highestpaying STEM occupations are petroleum engineers with an annual salary of $147,520, architectural and engineering managers with an annual salary of $138,720, natural sciences managers with an annual salary of $136,450, computer and information systems managers with an annual salary of $136,280, and physicists with a reported annual salary of $117,300. There is an increasing demand for individuals with STEM degrees to extend their focus beyond the laboratory so they can be leaders in discovery and commercialization. Women deserve a fair shot in the STEM programs in this nation. In addition, I believe that work needs to be done to modernize key contracting developmental programs designed to increase opportunities for women, minorities and lowincome individuals who pursue STEM degrees and STEM job training. I support programs at the National Science Foundation that have worked to reduce the current barriers and ensure women have the support they need in the STEM fields. Mr. Speaker, we should encourage women to pursue degrees and careers in the STEM fields so we can continue to compete in the global economy. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MARCHANT ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 255. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
SUPPORT FOR RAPID INNOVATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 239) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide for innovative research and development, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 239 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP SON) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to bring two important bills to the floor today that strengthen the government’s ability to effectively leverage cuttingedge cyber technologies. Last year, the House passed both of these provisions as part of Majority Leader MCCARTHY ’s Innovation Initiative, and I am excited that we are able to bring them to the floor here so early in the 115th Congress. Mr. Speaker, over the past 2 years, my colleagues and I have been working diligently with technology innovators and tech startups to find solutions that will spur innovation and break down the bureaucratic barriers that prevent the government from effectively leveraging the private sector’s emerging technologies. H.R. 239, the Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017, addresses this problem by requiring the science and technology directorate, or S&T, to more effectively coordinate with industry and academia to support the research and development of cybersecurity technologies. H.R. 239 does so because it requires S&T to support the full life cycle of cyber research and development projects and identify mature technologies to address cybersecurity gaps. In doing so, S&T will be required to target federally funded cybersecurity research that demonstrates a high probability of successful transition to the commercial market within 2 years. This bill will also extend the use of other transactional authority, or OTA, until the year 2021, a move that will improve DHS’s ability to engage with tech startups that are developing these cuttingedge technologies. H.R. 239 also includes additional accountability requirements to ensure that there is proper oversight of the authority. Mr. Speaker, our digital borders are constantly being barraged by cybercriminals, by nationstates, and by terrorists seeking to exploit and harm innocent Americans. Almost daily, we read news stories on how these hackers are intruding into our networks and doing so with increased sophistication. One thing is for certain, we have seen that cyber intrusions and their impact on victims quickly morph and increase both in frequency and in their severity. In 2017, these hackers will unfortunately continue to pose a great threat to the U.S. homeland and to our critical infrastructure. The Federal Government, therefore, needs to keep pace with these evolving threats by more actively working with the private sector to find effective solutions. DHS’s Directorate of Science and Technology is the primary research and development arm of the Department. The directorate manages basic and applied research and development, including cybersecurity R&D, for the Department’s operational components and for our first responders. Ensuring there are mechanisms in place, like S&T’s cybersecurity R&D programs and the OTA, to support the dynamic nature of cybersecurity research and development is essential for addressing homeland security capability gaps. Thank you again, Mr. Speaker, for calling up this important bill today. I believe it will have an incredibly positive impact on encouraging technology innovation across the Nation to address our vital homeland security needs. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this very important bill. I reserve the balance of my time.

In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 239, the Support for Rapid Innovation Act. Mr. Speaker, this timely legislation authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to support cybersecurity research and development and to help innovators with promising cybersecurity technologies to help commercialize their products. Government and private sector networks are under constant attack by increasingly sophisticated cyber hackers. The cyber hacking campaign carried out by the Russian Government against U.S. political and business institutions, during the 2016 election, is a recent, highprofile example. Concern has also been growing about the threat of cybercriminals carrying out attacks by exploiting unprotected Internetenabled consumer products. This threat was brought into sharp focus last October with the denial of service attack against Dyn. During that attack, malware was used to direct tens of thousands of Internetconnected cameras, DVRs, and other consumer products to carry out successive, highly sophisticated attacks. Our adversaries are constantly innovating. It is imperative that the Federal Government—and specifically DHS—innovate, too. To that end, H.R. 239 directs DHS to invest in innovative cybersecurity technologies and provide DHS with flexibility to overcome bureaucratic obstacles that sometimes 
discourage smaller companies, like tech startups, from working with the Federal Government. H.R. 239 directs DHS to pursue cybersecurity projects that will improve detection, mitigation, and recovery from attacks and bolster the security and resilience of our networks, particularly for critical infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation to ensure that DHS does its part to advance cybersecurity research and development. Cybersecurity threats to our Nation are growing in diversity and sophistication. We cannot afford to let promising technologies languish. The Department of Homeland Security should work with the private sector in support of innovative cybersecurity research, development, testing, and evaluation. We have seen that publicprivate collaboration can give these technologies the boost they need to enter the market. Just last month, DHS announced the commercialization of an eight cybersecurity product launched with the help of the Department’s Transition to Practice program. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 239. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member THOMPSON for his leadership on the committee, and I want to thank the Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies Subcommittee staff for their hard work. Once again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 239. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 239, the ‘‘Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017,’’ which amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide for improved innovative research and development. I support this bill because it would extend the Department of Homeland Security secretary’s pilot program for research and development projects and prototype projects through 2020. This bill would require the secretary to report annually to the House Homeland Security and Science committees and the Senate Homeland Security Committee on the dynamics of the projects undertaken. Specifically, H.R. 239 would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include fundamental improvements to facilitate information, analytics, and methodologies related to cybersecurity risks and incidents, consistent with the current law. In particular, it adds a new section to the Homeland Security Act, directing the Department of Homeland Security to support— whether within itself, other agencies, or in academia and private industry—the research and development of cybersecurityrelated technologies. As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee and Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I support this bill as it directs the Under Secretary for Science and Technology to bolster research and development, along with the testing and evaluation of cybersecurity technology to improve the sharing of information, analysis, and methodologies related to cybersecurity risks and incidents. The Rapid Innovation Act is a smart bill that will enable the Department of Homeland Security to establish and improve technologies for detecting attacks or intrusions. The ‘‘Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017’’ will equip the Department of Homeland Security with vital tools and resources to prevent and remove attacks and threats implemented by those who target our nation. Mr. Speaker, we face growing cybersecurity threats, which demands that we increase research and development, along with the testing and evaluation of cybersecurity technology to expand the sharing of information, analysis, and methodologies related to cybersecurity risks and incidents. This is a comprehensive bill that will help protect all Americans in every corner of this nation. I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 239. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 239, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
LEVERAGING EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ACT OF 2017 Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 240) to encourage engagement between the Department of Homeland Security and technology innovators, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 240 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP SON) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, I am pleased that the House is today considering H.R. 240, the Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2017. H.R. 240 encourages engagement between the Department of Homeland Security and technology innovators, including startups. This bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to proactively engage with innovative and emerging technology developers and firms to address our vital Homeland Security needs. Additionally, H.R. 240 provides the Secretary with the authority to identify geographic areas in the United States where high concentrations of these innovative and emerging technology developers and firms exist and to establish personnel and office space in these areas to more effectively collaborate with these technology hubs. The Federal Government certainly needs to do a better job working with the private sector, and H.R. 240 will help to address that. Mr. Speaker, this bill also requires the Secretary to develop and to implement a targeted strategy to proactively engage innovative and emerging technology developers and firms. b1630 Under this bill, the Secretary must use the strategic plan to address existing barriers to leveraging innovative and emerging technologies, and the small businesses and startup ventures that create those technologies, and to incorporate them into the Department’s acquisition process. For example, in order to keep pace, the Department of Homeland Security has established an office in Silicon Valley to encourage engagement and communication with the innovative technology developers in that area. Although it is a vital technology hub, Silicon Valley certainly is not the only technology hub in the United States. The Department should not be limited to a single geographic area from which to identify these emerging and innovative technologies. Mr. Speaker, all Americans are learning that cybersecurity is national security. The impacts of cyber intrusions are being felt everywhere, from boardroom tables to kitchen tables. We have seen them undermine consumer confidence and damage a company’s hard earned reputation in just a couple of seconds. Cybersecurity is a complex and serious issue that our Nation will have to address for decades to come. So it only makes sense for us to require the Department to consider strategically just how it will engage these technology developers to strengthen the Department’s ability to access innovative and emerging technologies to better combat evolving cyber threats. I am happy to support this measure today because I believe it will move us forward, further addressing our homeland security needs by supporting technology innovation. I urge Members to join me in supporting this important bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 240, the Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor of this measure, as I was for its predecessor last Congress. Last June, the House approved this measure by a 347–8 vote. This bipartisan bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to engage small businesses, startup companies, and other developers of innovative and emerging technologies to tackle some of our most vexing, persistent homeland security challenges. It is no secret that navigating the Federal procurement process is difficult, especially for small startups. Meanwhile, small companies continue to develop some of the most innovative technological solutions in use today. They are a huge source of untapped potential, capable of bringing forward thinking, groundbreaking ideas to the homeland security enterprise. To build these relationships, H.R. 240 allows DHS to establish personnel and office space in areas around the U.S. where technology innovators are concentrated. Having a physical presence in these tech hubs will make it easier for DHS to grow and maintain connections with local startups, innovators, and incubators. The Department has already taken action in this regard. In 2015, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate established a Silicon Valley office and announced its firstever procurement focused on working with nontraditional contractors and tech startups. The DHS innovation ‘‘other transaction’’ solution sought technologies to address security challenges in aviation, border, and cybersecurity. To date, under this program, DHS has funded awards to 13 small businesses in California, Texas, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Washington State. Additionally, DHS has reached out to technology innovators at regional events in Boston, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, New Orleans, Chicago, Louisville and Austin, raising awareness with more than 1,500 startups, accelerators, and venture capitalists through industry days, panels, conferences, and startup meetups. The feedback has been very positive, but it has also validated the need to educate the community about who DHS is and what the challenges are. Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. H.R. 240 recognizes that DHS depends on technology to carry out its missions, and must nurture and maintain robust and direct relationships with talented technology developers, even those that do not fit the mold of the typical Federal contractor. DHS could improve the productivity and sustainability of these outreach efforts by developing a strategy to proactively engage with innovators in a way that supports longterm relationships. H.R. 240 calls for such a strategy to be delivered to Congress and implemented within 6 months. Two features of that strategy required under this bill that I would like to highlight are provisions that I sponsored. One requires the strategy to give attention to fostering engagement with developers that may be located outside a recognized regional technology hub. The other directs the strategy to include coordination with venture capital organizations, like the InQTel nonprofit, to help emerging technology developers, including small businesses and startup ventures, commercialize technologies that address a rapidly growing list of homeland security needs. Mr. Speaker, for all of the reasons discussed, I urge support of H.R. 240. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON ) for his support of this bill and for his leadership in keeping this issue at the forefront of our cybersecurity discussion. This is an incredibly important bill, and I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 240. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 240, the ‘‘Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2017,’’ which requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to engage with innovative and emerging technology developers, including technologybased small businesses and startup ventures that can help tackle the rapidly expanding list of homeland security technology needs. H.R. 240 helps to protect America’s computer and communications networks, which security experts believe represent the nation’s most critical national security challenge, including Internet functions and connected critical infrastructure such as air traffic control, the U.S. electrical grid, and nuclear power plants. H.R. 240 authorizes DHS to establish personnel and office space in diverse geographic areas around the United States that have high concentrations of technology developers and firms. The bill also directs DHS, within 6 months, to develop and submit to Congress a Departmentwide strategy to engage with innovative and emerging technology companies. Importantly, the bill specifically requires the Secretary to include in that strategy ways to effectively integrate technologybased small businesses and startup ventures. Importantly, the bill also requires the DHS Secretary to coordinate with those in the venture capital industry to assist in the development of technologies that are ready for commercialization and use in the Homeland Security Enterprise. Since its founding, the Department of Homeland Security has overcome many challenges as an organization but much more 
progress must be made regarding effective interoperable communication between the federal, state, and local agencies. Although not a panacea, H.R. 240 is a step in the right direction because it will help improve DHS’ overall functions so that it can more effectively protect our people. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 240, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
MODERNIZING GOVERNMENT TRAVEL ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 274) to provide for reimbursement for the use of modern travel services by Federal employees traveling on official Government business, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 274 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Modernizing Government Travel Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. DESAULNIER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. 
Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous remarks on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 274, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, is a bipartisan bill sponsored by Congressman SETH MOULTON of Massachusetts. Mr. WILLHURD of Texas and Congressman MARKMEADOWS of North Carolina have all come together on this bill. It is a good bill. This bill came up in the 114th Congress. The same bill passed through the committee by regular order, and then in a close vote—much like the ClemsonAlabama game last night— when we voted on this bill last session was 415–0. I think there was a pretty good sense from the past Congress that is a good bill, and it should pass. Federal employees’ current transportation options on official travel are limited. While some agencies allow employees to be reimbursed for the use of sharing economy services, such as Lyft or Uber, not all of them do. As a result, the whole Federal Government does not benefit from the cost savings that can occur while being associated with these services. The Modernizing Government Travel Act allows the Federal Government to reap the benefits of the sharing economy. The bill ensures that new transportation services as they emerge, Federal employees can quickly take advantage of the efficiencies of the new technologies that may be offered. By opening up a new market for transportation services, H.R. 274 will also help spur innovation and competition, creating greater cost savings. We have some 2 million Federal employees. So this is an important part and it shouldn’t be glanced over. There could be considerable savings along the way. We must ensure that there is accountability for travel expenditures. Our committee, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and other watchdog groups outside of government are looking at these expenses. We have a duty and obligation to ensure that we are dealing with Federal taxpayer dollars responsibly. This bill mandates that agencies report their travel costs for each type of travel service to the General Services Administration, the GSA. The GSA must publish that data, helping make the Federal Government more transparent and accountable. The GSA will also report to Congress on agency official travel costs in order to make sure that they inform future transportation policy decisions. I urge passage of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I was trying to think of a BYU football analogy to go with the Clemson Alabama analogy, but I haven’t been able to come up with one yet. I will work on it. I rise in support of H.R. 274, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, as amended. I appreciate the good work of Representatives Moulton, Hurd, Meadows, Bustos, and Swalwell on this bipartisan measure. H.R. 274 would expand the transportation options for Federal employees on official government travel by allowing them to be reimbursed for the use of ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft. This bill would also allow for the use of future mobility technologies not yet known or available to be covered as by reimbursable travel expenses. The General Services Administration would be directed to issue implementing regulations. The bill would require Federal agencies to submit to GSA detailed information on their travel costs, including breakdowns of costs by transportation type by November 30 of each year. GSA would be required to submit annual reports to Congress containing an analysis or survey of agencies’ travel costs as well as descriptions of new or revised regulations. 
H.R. 274 is a commonsense, good government bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD), the cosponsor of this bill and someone who has been very involved in this subject. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, it is way past time that our government reconsiders the way that it views technology. Adherence to decadesold policy regarding technology costs our taxpayers billions of dollars, stifles creativity, and needlessly prevents our government from utilizing private sector technologies. This bill, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, is simple. It will allow Federal employees to utilize the services of innovative companies while on official travel. Last Congress, as the chairman alluded to, this bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support, 415–0. Private sector companies have had a tremendous impact on the way that people travel, and we should allow our government to recognize these changes. By widening the scope of reimbursable forms of transportation, we are encouraging the adoption of innovative technologies and promoting competition. The bill also requires agencies to report what type of transportation their employees are taking while on official travel, and this data will be publicly available, thus increasing transparency and accountability in how taxpayer dollars are being spent. b1645 H.R. 274, as amended, is a sensible piece of legislation that can help modernize our government and ensure that the United States is moving seamlessly into the 21st century. I want to thank my colleague, Representative MOULTON , for his leadership on this important issue, as well as Representatives MEADOWS , B USTOS , and SWALWELL for their support for this bill. I ask my colleagues to join me in the support of H.R. 274. Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my colleague from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ). Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from California for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 274, the Modernizing Government Travel Act. This legislation is a bipartisan effort that demonstrates a consensus amongst all of us that the Federal Government has failed to keep pace with the technological advances and innovation that have come to define the 21st century. Despite the emergence of new technologies designed to improve the way we travel, today, some Federal employees are unable to be reimbursed for using more costeffective, innovative modes of transportation when traveling on official business. Innovative ridesharing services supported by mobile apps have dramatically changed how we get from one place to another. Now, with just a few taps on a phone, we can access a variety of new transportation options like rideshare, carshare, and bikeshare that complement rapid transit, take more cars off our congested roads, and reduce fuel emissions. According to a recent study, 52 percent of people using transit for workrelated travel chose to use ridehailing services and other innovative technologies. While the General Services Administration allows agencies to authorize the use of these transportation options by Federal employees, it has not nor is it required by law to issue comprehensive guidance across the Federal Government. H.R. 274 would require the General Services Administration to implement regulations to allow Federal employees to use transportation options like rideshare and bikeshare for official travel. The GSA Administrator would be required to submit annual reports to Congress on the implementation of these regulations and the resulting amount of government savings. I want to thank my friend and colleague, Representative HURD, for working with me on this legislation, as well as Representatives SWALWELL , ISSA, MEADOWS , and B USTOS for their support. This is truly a bipartisan effort that will increase the Federal Government’s engagement in the sharing economy while saving taxpayer dollars. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. MOULTON , first and foremost, for his service to our country, serving in the armed services. We really do appreciate that. I can’t thank him enough for that service. But I also appreciate him bringing forward this bill and his working with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD) and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS ). I appreciate what Mr. DESAULNIER  and our ranking member on our committee, Mr. CUMMINGS , have done, too, to help move this bill forward. So there was good, broad, bipartisan support, strong support in the 114th Congress, passing unanimously, with 415 votes. I think it is worthy to bring this up early in the Congress and get on with the idea of saving money and taking advantage of technology, as Mr. HURDsaid and as Mr. M OULTON talked about as well, save some money and tap into the technology that is available to save money for the government and, ultimately, for the taxpayers. It is their money indeed. So I would urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 274, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

b1800 ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 39) to amend title 5, United States Code, to codify the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 39 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Tested Ability to Leverage Exceptional National Talent Act of 2017’’ or the ‘‘TALENT Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD) and the gentleman from California (Mr. DESAULNIER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the government is many things. It is large, it is complicated, and it is ineffective. I don’t think anyone would call it modern. While the world is rushing forward with things like voicebased interfaces, autonomous vehicles, online retail, and data analytics, government is stubbornly years, or even decades, behind. We do not have to accept it. One of the purposes of the Innovation Initiative, our effort here in the House, is to bring government into the modern age. Right now, it can still take hours for citizens to get the IRS on the phone to ask the most basic questions. Parents and students still deal with the clunky user interfaces when applying for tuition assistance. And the VA still uses a scheduling system that is a quarter century old. It doesn’t have to be this way. We have a program right now, the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, that brings in highly talented professionals from across the country to help upgrade our government’s use of technology. Now, these are engineers, designers, innovators, and thinkers. They challenge the old ways of thinking and introduce new approaches to make our government work the way the American people deserve it to work. I sponsored the TALENT Act to make sure this innovation program continues into the future. By drawing on the great talent of the American people, we can make government effective, efficient, and accountable. Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of the TALENT Act, a bill to ensure that we continue to bring top private sector innovators into government to help solve complex technological problems at Federal agencies. The Presidential Innovation Fellows program was established by President Obama in 2012 to identify and pursue projects that apply and implement innovative private sector techniques in as little as 6 months. The program was made permanent by Executive Order 13704 in 2015, and would be codified by the bill before us today. H.R. 39 would require the General Services Administration to continue managing the program with guidance from an advisory board comprised of representatives from different executive branch agencies. Over 100 Presidential Innovation Fellows have already been appointed to work alongside dedicated civil servants at 25 Federal agencies and departments. At those agencies, fellows have been able to merge their experience from top universities, pioneering companies, and successful nonprofits with their desire to contribute to society through public service. This collaboration has allowed the Federal Government to obtain new tools, develop new technologies, and ultimately become more effective and efficient. Presidential Innovation Fellows have reshaped the way Americans interact with their government in areas ranging from health care and science to law enforcement and disaster response. Fifteen million Americans can access their health data as a result of the program’s Blue Button initiative, and cancer patients can search for clinical trials as part of work to support the Vice President’s Cancer Moonshot initiative. Scientists can now obtain more weather data collected by NOAA, and veterans can now more readily access custom prosthetic designs. Citizens can review police records, including crime statistics and data on officerinvolved shootings. And FEMA and other first responders can better target and prioritize their response to natural disasters. All of these things have been made possible through the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, and it is crucial that we continue our support of these and other endeavors by ensuring its permanency. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 39. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today, I am urging my colleagues to support H.R. 39, the TALENT Act, introduced by Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY of California. This bill passed the House on a strong bipartisan vote in the 114th Congress, and I am glad to be part of the team working to enact this important legislation into law. The TALENT Act makes permanent the Presidential Innovation Fellows program that was created in 2012. This highly competitive program recruits talented, private sector innovators and technologists from across the United States. Presidential Innovation Fellows serve in the Washington, D.C., area for 12 months at an executive agency. These agencies include the Department of Energy, NASA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Fellows bring with them their experience in the private sector to help government turn ideas into tangible results that ultimately benefit the American people. Since 2012, at least 96 top innovators have participated in the program. Past and current fellows have come from companies large and small and hold degrees from top universities across the country. They have won a variety of awards, including Fulbright scholarships, Silicon Valley Business Journal’s 40 Under 40 recognition, and Truman National Security Project fellowships. These fellows truly are the best and the brightest the United States has to offer, and they seek to utilize their skills for the American people. Presidential Innovation Fellows are giving the Federal Government the tools it needs to successfully operate in the 21st century. Previous projects completed by fellows include Uncle Sam’s List. Fellows created a database to offer a centralized information center in which agencies can forgo buying new commodity IT and support services in favor of existing services provided by the Federal agencies. This program has saved an estimated $2.5 billion, and it is helping government become more effective and efficient. I commend Majority Leader MCCARTHYfor the work to bring this innovation to the government. Again, I urge support for this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative HURD for his work, which has been an ongoing continuing work on this issue and on this particular program. I rise in support of this bipartisan bill, which builds on the work that Majority Leader MCCARTHY and I and others in this House have been doing to modernize government technology and renew America’s faith in government. In 2016, exit polls showed that dissatisfaction with the government spanned the political spectrum. That is a shame because government is supposed to be a force for improving people’s lives, keeping our country safe, and expanding opportunities for all Americans. That is why I unveiled the House Democrats’ Renewing Faith in Government agenda last summer. We must present bold solutions to reform our democracy and our government. Certainly, on both sides of the equation, that is what the American people were saying in the last election. One of the goals of our agenda is modernizing government technology. Most Americans understand the transformative power of technology—the Majority Leader spoke of it in so many different aspects of our lives—and how digitizing businesses makes them more efficient, transparent, and accountable. We have seen it in the private sector. Every day, millions of Americans shop on sites like Amazon or Etsy and catch a ride using Uber or Lyft. Government technology is in terrible shape, and bringing the latest practices from Silicon Valley into government would make a huge difference in serving our citizens and streamlining the way government works for the American people. Last year, I worked closely with the Obama administration and Tony Scott to advance one of its top priorities in this area: creating a technology modernization fund for the rapid upgrade of 
the most outdated, costly, and insecure technology systems across the Federal Government. Mr. HURD was involved deeply in that effort. The result was the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which the House passed overwhelmingly with the help of Chairman CHAFFETZ and Majority Leader MCCARTHY . Last month, Majority Leader MCCARTHYand I expressed our bipartisan support for one of President Obama’s most successful efforts at bringing Silicon Valley talent into the Federal workforce: the U.S. Digital Service and GSA’s 18F program. In fact, I visited the 18F program in San Francisco and was extraordinarily impressed with the individuals who peopled that project and were giving of their time. I guess we were paying them a little bit, but, relatively speaking, they were giving their time. Today’s bill, the TALENT Act, would make permanent the precursor to both these programs: the Presidential Innovation Fellows. This program has a proven track record of bringing top talent from the innovation economy into the Federal workforce where it is sorely needed. I hope the next administration will continue all of these innovative programs, which have begun to change the culture within our government. I also hope that the talented individuals—many of whom, as I referenced, left highpaying jobs in the private sector—will stay on through the transition and continue to serve their country by improving government technology. President Obama made real progress in this area, including with the launch of his Open Data Directive, his We the People petition platform, and his Cyber National Action Plan. More could have been achieved if Congress had agreed to his request to invest more in these areas. We have seen a dramatic example of why cybersecurity investment is so critically important for our country, not for Democrats, not for Republicans, but for all Americans. This is an effort toward that end. I hope we can work together in this new Congress to unleash the transformative power of modern technology within government and help renew America’s faith in our government. That is critical if we are to be successful as a Nation. I am sure it hopefully is what all of us want to do on a bipartisan basis. I thank Representative DESAULNIER  for his efforts, and I thank Representative HURDfor his leadership on this effort. I am pleased to join with my counterpart, Majority Leader MCCARTHY , in strong support of this legislation. b1815 Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from California aware that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I just briefly congratulate everyone who has been involved. As somebody who represents the bay area and struggles with the innovation in the private sector there to integrate it into the public sector at all levels of government, I really admire the work by Mr. HURD, the comments and the contributions by the administration, and Mr. MCCARTHY  and Mr. HOYER . Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on our side. I congratulate Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to thank for their years of service on such an important issue Mr. DESAULNIER and Leader HOYER and Leader M CCARTHY . I would like to urge the adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 39. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
NORTH KOREA MISCHIEF (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this week, North Korea declared that it can launch an intercontinental ballistic missile at any time that it wishes. Even our own Deputy Secretary of State recently warned that Little Kim’s weapon capabilities have shown qualitative improvement within the past year resulting in ‘‘unprecedented level of activity.’’ Why is that? Well, because this administration has done little to stop Little Kim. Instead, the administration has naively pursued a strategy it calls ‘‘strategic patience.’’ Strategic patience is a fancy phrase for ignoring the obvious. There was a time when we kept North Korea on the State Sponsors of Terrorism List. They came off the list because they have made promises that they have clearly broken. Mischievous Little Kim’s threats continue to grow bolder and bolder, with no repercussions. We cannot afford to risk the security of our citizens for the sake of diplomatic strategy that has proven to be a failure. This week I will reintroduce legislation to put North Korea back on the State Sponsors of Terrorism List because Little Kim is a terror to world peace. And that is just the way it is. f 
GIVING THANKS (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give thanks. I give thanks to the people of California’s 44th District for giving me the honor and the privilege to serve them. My district is rich with immigrants. My own mom, who turned 76 today, is an immigrant from Mexico who came here with a third grade education so her kids could have a shot at the American Dream. In my district, only 10 percent of students go on to college. I am grateful to be one of those 10 percenters who beat the odds and got a piece of the American Dream. But those numbers are unacceptable. I pledge to fight for them to make sure everyone, regardless of income, immigration status, or race has a shot at the American Dream. 
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FERGUSON ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to be here and, especially, to look out and see some people for whom I have eminent respect in this body. That is a nice thing, being in a body where I actually have respect for the people in the body, a good thing. We know that elections, as President Obama told us quite succinctly 8 years ago, have consequences. Elections do have consequences, and we have a new team coming to town. One of the things that has concerned me greatly, and I know it has concerned many in this body, is that we as a Nation have had the ability to give protection basically to this idea of freedom that our Founders had, cultivated, and gave their lives to create. As I have mentioned from this podium previously, as I was told by some west African Christians in Togo, they said: 
We were so excited when you elected your first Black President, but since your President has been there, we have seen America get weaker and weaker. We all are Christians and we know where we are going when we die, but we also know our only chance for peace in this world is if America is strong. So please go back to Washington and please tell the other Members of Congress to stop getting weaker. We suffer when you get weaker. 
I seen this article from Melissa Mullins after a study was done. It said, ‘‘Christians Most Persecuted Religious 
Group in the World.’’ And that is while America is supposed to be the strongest nation in the world. Mr. Speaker, I see a friend is here on the floor, and I now yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY). Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to serve the constituents of the Second Congressional District of West Virginia for a second term. As we begin the 115th session of Congress, my top legislative priorities are rolling back anticoal regulations that have been imposed by President Obama’s administration over the last 8 years; fighting the drug epidemic; repealing ObamaCare and making health care more affordable and accessible; and investing in our roads, bridges, airports, and other key infrastructure. West Virginia needs goodpaying jobs. President Obama has spent the last 8 years waging a war on coal on our country. During this session of Congress, we must continue to work together to promote an allofthe above energy strategy that conserves our natural resources, cultivates our economy and jobs, and promotes American energy independence. One of our Nation’s and our States’ greatest natural resources is our fossil fuel. Fossil fuel, including coal, supplies around 85 percent of our Nation’s energy. West Virginia produces about 15 percent of that total. Under the outgoing administration, we have seen our West Virginia energy industries come under attack even though we have made significant strides in recent years to improve the quality of our air, land, and water. By rolling back harmful regulations like the socalled stream protection rule, we can save 30,000 jobs in the Appalachian region right now. That is why last year I introduced my bill, the Supporting Transparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining Act, also known as the STREAM Act. My bill was passed by the House last year with bipartisan support, and I will continue to fight to stop this outrageous rule from taking effect. Another top priority for this Congress must be stopping the drug epidemic in our country. Drug abuse ravages our communities, rips families apart, and further ruptures our State’s alreadyailing economy. This issue is above party politics. It is a plague that both parties must come together to solve. There is no magical solution to this epidemic. We need local, State, and Federal officials to work together to effectively and efficiently fight back. This past Congress I worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to find commonsense solutions to fight back against this scourge. That is why I introduced H.R. 4499, the Promoting Responsible Opioid Prescribing Act. This bipartisan bill struck out a harmful provision of ObamaCare that places unnecessary pressure on doctors and hospitals to prescribe narcotic pain medicine. I am proud to say that the Department of Health and Human Services announced that they changed their policy and implemented my bill. This change in policy is an important part of the fight against opioid abuse. I will remain steadfast in my efforts to fight this epidemic. Another important way to fight back against the drug epidemic is by making health care more accessible and affordable. The first step to do this is to repeal ObamaCare. Healthcare costs are on the rise because ObamaCare adds burdensome taxes, regulations, and mandates onto American consumers. The limited choice in health insurance plans is harming families and their budgets. ObamaCare will kill 2.5 million jobs in 10 years. It has continued to raise health insurance costs and has placed the Federal Government in between patients and their doctors. Research done by the National Center for Policy Analysis found that average monthly premium costs increased for almost everyone regardless of their age, race, or gender after ObamaCare was implemented. As a Republican in Congress, I want to ensure that everyone has access to health care, but I want it to be quality health care that people choose for themselves. That is why Republicans have come up with a plan that we call A Better Way. Our plan recognizes that people deserve more patientcentered care, not more bureaucracy. That means more choices, not more mandates. The A Better Way plan offers many improvements that will help West Virginia’s Second Congressional District, including commonsense reforms such as allowing health insurance sales across State lines. Simple changes like these will lower costs and increase choice for Americans. Finally, it is imperative to pass bills that invest in our Nation’s deteriorating infrastructure. Presidentelect Trump has said that updating our Nation’s infrastructure is a top priority for his administration. b1830 The Federal Highway Administration has classified more than 142,000 bridges as either ‘‘structurally deficient’’ or ‘‘functionally obsolete.’’ Also from the Federal Highway Administration, traffic delays cost the U.S. economy more than $50 billion annually. Most major roads are rated as ‘‘less than good condition.’’ Improvement to other Nation’s infrastructure would greatly benefit West Virginia, which needs road, bridge and rail repairs. We are also in need of water, sewer, and power line repairs. By improving the transportation, our country will open the opportunity for job growth and expansion. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and the Senate, as well as the new administration, to make sure that these legislative priorities take hold. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much my friend Mr. MOONEY ’s points. Well made. This administration hasn’t turned around health care in America, hasn’t seen more choices, people keeping their doctors, keeping their insurance policies they liked. They have seen deductibles skyrocket, such that so many people across America have had $5, $6, $7, $8,000 deductibles. We never had deductibles that high before. What that effectively meant was they weren’t going to get any health insurance help. They were totally on their own, that every single payment that they made, even if they got subsidies from the Federal Government, was for nothing. They got no help. They could never come up with enough money in 1 year to meet the deductible so that the insurance would start paying in. What is even more egregious is that apparently we found out that much of this was known would happen before people had ObamaCare forced onto them. Then, in the last week we have had this story from Stephen Dinan, from The Washington Times, finding out that the IRS prioritized their role in ObamaCare over taxpayer customer service. That is what their own inspector general report said. You would think that an administration that says their number one concern was America’s health care, that they would not drive so many people off of the insurance they had, they loved, that they could afford, that had the doctor in the system they could use, had the medicine in the policy covered that they could use. Millions have been driven off of their policies to Medicaid, which so many doctors don’t even take, and this administration has called that a great victory. Yet, in the midst of all of this, we knew—it was talked about back in 2010 when this bill was being passed—that there could be 18,000, 17, 18,000 new IRS agents that would force ObamaCare upon the country. And as so many people have reported, when you get notice from the Internal Revenue Service that they are coming after you, it does not do anything to enhance your health. KLTV, in my hometown, contacted me here today, wanting to know more about what was happening with the IRS. It has been outrageous what they have been doing across the country in their local taxpayer service assistance offices. It was reported to us that a sign was put up by one of the IRS employees that, basically, if you don’t like the long line and the bad service, then contact your Member of Congress—and fortunately, many did, so we became acutely aware of it. And what was worse, I mean, we had an office in Longview. Some people are able to go—are required to go get documentation from the IRS in order to do 
what they need, whether it is with insurance, with their employer, and they couldn’t get into the IRS office. The IRS office closed in Longview, making it so much more difficult for Americans in east Texas to get the customer service they needed. Well, this article from The Washington Times points out that the IRS has made things much more painful for taxpayers than it should have been, and that is according to the IRS’ inspector general. That was in a report Thursday that accused the agency of cutting money for customer service and ignoring phone calls while moving the money over to keep ObamaCare and other administration priorities on track. Well, what that means is the IRS would be there to bully people who had concerns about or problems with ObamaCare, which certainly would not help their health at all. But one reporter had told me that previously they were told by the IRS that Congress cut funding and, you know, that is why customer service was cut. Yet, when we presented the actual facts of what had happened, yes, in the past 6 years, the House of Representatives—not the Senate, for heaven’s sake. They haven’t cut anything in their own House of Congress. But the House of Representatives cut our own budgets about 22 percent over a 3year period, and that is pretty dramatic. Anybody that has ever had to cut their budget by a fourth understands. Americans have had to do that across the country. We did it right here in the House of Representatives, and it has been very difficult for some of our offices to provide the care for constituents. So many areas, we are it. We are the ones that can help them stand up against the bureaucracy and demand that they get what the government is required to provide, and yet we were able to do it. On the other hand, the IRS wasn’t cut 22 percent like the House cut ourselves down to the bone. In fact, they had a substantially smaller cut over 2 years, I believe it was. In this past year, we increased the amount of money the IRS got by millions and millions of dollars. What the IRS chose to do is not help taxpayer service, which could also help the IRS from increasing their punitive work against taxpayers that make mistakes because they didn’t get proper advice or service from the IRS assistance. But no, they moved the money. The massive increase we gave to the IRS, they moved it over to be a bigger bully regarding ObamaCare and cut out offices, like the one in Longview, and fell more into the stereotype than I have ever seen for the IRS, this as ‘‘IRS employees ignored more than 30 million phone calls from desperate taxpayers seeking help in the runup to the 2015 filing deadline—and those who did get through often waited a half hour before getting help. ‘‘The IRS apologized publicly for the poor service and blamed Congress, saying lawmakers needed to pony up more money if they wanted better results. ‘‘But Inspector General J. Russell George said the IRS cut its own funding by eliminating nearly $150 million from customer service, slashing more than 2,000 staff positions’’—and that is so they could go after more enforcement of ObamaCare, as if ObamaCare wasn’t doing enough damage to people’s health as it was. As my friend, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman KEVIN BRADY  pointed out: ‘‘The IRS is running out of excuses for its abysmal customer service record and poor management decisions.’’ This new report is even more proof the IRS is failing the very people it was created to serve—American taxpayers. Congress did add more money for the agency last year, just as I was saying, Mr. Speaker. This article also echoes the same thing. The IRS doubled the number of calls it was able to answer, but the agency has promised to maintain a level of service for next year. But let’s face it, the IRS has shown they will target people because of their political beliefs. They will allow themselves—not just allow themselves. They insert themselves and have allowed themselves to be political weapons. Certainly saw that occurred from what has come out from 2012. Did they affect the election? It is hard to say. But they certainly prevented many conservative groups from being able to organize. I have heard some who are liberal, not that smart, asking questions: Well, I don’t see how that would hurt conservative groups just because the IRS did not recognize them. They could still have gone ahead and organized and done their thing. Again, apparently they pay too much attention to the mainstream media and don’t think for themselves, because when one begins to understand the power of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States, you put a group together and you pool your money into one pool to start spending as a group, somebody’s going to be in trouble and going to be accounting for that money as income. I mean, there may be creative ways to handle it, but the way you are supposed to handle it is to get recognition from the Internal Revenue Service that you have a group that can come together, put your money together, and work together toward a common goal. Liberal groups have not had much problem getting that kind of approval, but conservative groups really were targeted by the IRS. And there is a law—we didn’t need to pass a new one—that, according to the facts that have come out regarding Lois Lerner and others at the IRS, it certainly appears that there is probable cause to believe crimes were committed and should have been pursued. Yet nothing was done. Why? Because they were groups that were persecuted, not allowed to organize, that did not support this administration; therefore, according to the Justice Department that became more of ‘‘just us department,’’ they weren’t going to pursue anything like that. And in the further category of further deAmericanization of America, this report from Paul Bedard that U.N. shipped 6 of 10 refugees to the United States, even more this year. Then there is a list from the United Nations refugee resettlement referrals. This report just came out in the last week, less than a week. The U.N. reports that of the 134,044 refugees settled in 2015, gee, 82,491 of the 134,000 were sent to the United States, that despite the fact information came out, study done, that actually we can support 12 refugees in place in the Middle East for the same price of bringing 1 refugee to the United States. b1845 In fact, this administration didn’t have to use the term redline. This administration could have simply said: we are going to make sure there is a safe zone in which people can live in the Middle East in a certain area and the U.N. will assist them with food— hopefully, without raping the women and girls, because they have in some areas. We will provide them a safe zone, and their needs will be cared for there. We can handle 12 times as many for the same price as bringing 1 into the United States. I think voters understood that, when they voted Donald Trump as President, there are so many of these refugees that simply cannot be vetted. We know this administration has made mistake after mistake, not only with people that we have no information to use to determine whether or not they are a threat because we have no background information on so many of these, but also, once they are here, we don’t know where they are, we don’t know where they go. We don’t know even the threat. Then, on top of that, we find out hundreds, maybe thousands—we know hundreds—of people were supposed to be deported that this administration accidentally—instead of deporting them and getting them out of the country so they were no longer a threat, this administration accidentally granted them citizenship. There are some things that this government could do and you would say: well, it is easy to understand. That is an easy mistake. Instead of a 1, they put an 11. Or, instead of a 0, they put a 3. Instead of deporting people and getting them out of our country, this administration accidentally gives them citizenship and has made clear that they are not capable of protecting us from the threats that we are seeing all over Europe and other areas of the world. A point of personal privilege, really, I would like, Mr. Speaker, a shout out to the TSA, which is underneath our 
Department of Homeland Security. It was such an honor to be singled out last Friday for the two molestations. Apparently, I am attractive when it comes to TSA agents. They want to feel up and down, make sure all the parts are actually attached. They did a very good job of that both times on Friday evening when I was flying back to Texas. So my thanks to the TSA. Job well done. It delayed me 30 minutes or so. I kept thinking the TSA agent was going to lie back and have a cigarette or something, but that never happened. Anyway, due regards for the TSA. I am really and truly hoping that we can change substantially management of the TSA in this coming year. At airport after airport, we see two, three, four times longer lines for the TSA PreCheck than there is for the general boarding. Yet, TSA continues to encourage people to go ahead and apply. We can streamline your getting through the inspection. And yes, that does mean when you are in PreCheck, you will enjoy having hands laid on you, not in a Christian kind of sense. Over and over, there are good TSA agents, I am finding, all over the country, but the management is atrocious. How long would any security agency stay in business if every day they had longer lines in one area that was the least threat to our security as they do in the general boarding lines that need to be more carefully monitored, we are told? Well, you would fire them. You would hire another security agency. I haven’t seen a study done on this, but, as I recall—I was watching back during my days as a judge and chief justice, and I will have to go back and look—there were so many screams from Congress, especially the Senate, especially on the other side of the aisle, that we have got to have the Federal Government take over security at the airports. We have got to. We are in such danger. We have to have that happen. Has security been enhanced by adding tens of thousands of people to the government unions? No, it hasn’t. It really hasn’t. So, what I want to go back and look at, it seems like I remember back years ago, after the Democrats were able to prevail over Republicans who were in the majority and get them to agree to federalize the security at airports so that they could get them in the government unions, I was thinking, I don’t know that that is really going to help. Are we going to see a better quality of TSA agent than we had in private security? I would like to see an official number. Maybe if somebody in Homeland Security is listening, Mr. Speaker, they could, in their time between looking the other way as people come into the country illegally, they might just look up how many private security airport personnel were not hired by TSA. The reason for federalizing the security was so that we will get a better quality of security. It seems like there was a lawsuit back there by a couple hundred people, maybe. We are the only ones not hired by TSA. Out of the thousands and thousands, we are the only ones that weren’t hired. It seems like there was a problem in response that yeah, we really needed people that could read and had finished high school. If you couldn’t read or hadn’t finished high school, we really needed that level. So, basically, it seems what happened is one group here in Congress—and it wasn’t the Republicans—had their way. The security at airports was federalized. We are not seeing an increased percentage of capturing items that are coming in, but I have got to say they do a good job of feeling up and down my person. I am not really a threat, though Homeland Security would assume that. Well, I was in the Army for 4 years. I am a strong Christian. I believe in the Bible, and I believe in the United States Constitution as the greatest governing document that was ever promulgated. Apparently, according to the minds at the top of this Homeland Security Department, that makes me more of a threat than most anybody in the country. I was even told back in London, coming back, I believe that was from another trip to Egypt or maybe Israel, and I had to go out from security and come back through. I was told by one of the security guys: Sir, I know who you are and your position, but your Homeland Security Department tells us we have to thoroughly inspect your baggage and you personally. I got it from the British security folks as well. Apparently, if you believe in the Constitution, you believe in the Bible, you have served your country in the United States Army, and you are a Christian then you are a bigtime threat. It will be so nice to have an administration that doesn’t see the world the way this administration has seen it. We had a lecture from the Secretary of State. The President of the United States said amen and hallelujah when he condemned Israel over and over and over. We stabbed our friend, Israel, in the back. There are reports in some sectors that not only did we abstain but we encouraged the resolution to be brought forward so that Israel could be condemned. It apparently generated this article from Victor Davis Hanson from National Review. He said: ‘‘Secretary of State John Kerry, echoing other policymakers in the Obama administration, blasted Israel last week in a 70minute rant about its supposedly selfdestructive policies. Why does the world, including now the U.S.’’—I would submit, Mr. Speaker, not for much longer—‘‘single out liberal and lawful Israel but refrain from chastising truly illiberal countries? Kerry has never sermonized for so long about his plan to solve the Syrian crisis that has led to some 500,000 deaths or the vast migrant crisis that has nearly wrecked the European Union. No one in this administration has shown as much anger about the many thousands who have been killed and jailed in the Castro brothers’ Cuba, much less about the current Stone Age conditions in Venezuela or the nightmarish government of President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, an ally nation. ‘‘President Obama did not champion the cause of the oppressed during the Green Revolution of 2009 in Iran. Did Kerry and Obama become so outraged after Russia occupied South Ossetia, Crimea, and eastern Ukraine? ‘‘Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power was never so impassioned over the borders of Chineseoccupied Tibet, or over Turkishoccupied Northern Cyprus. ‘‘In terms of harkening back to the Palestinian ‘refugee’ crisis that started in the late 1940s, no one talks today in similar fashion about the Jews who survived the Holocaust and walked home, only to find that their houses in Eastern Europe were gone or occupied by others. Much less do we recall the 11 million German civilians who were ethnically cleansed from Eastern Europe in 1945 by the Soviets and their imposed Communist governments. Certainly, there are not still ‘refugee’ camps outside Dresden for those persons displaced from East Prussia 70 years ago. ‘‘More recently, few nations at the U.N. faulted the Kuwaiti government for the expulsion of 200,000 Palestinians after the liberation of Kuwait by coalition forces in 1991. Yet on nearly every issue—from ‘settlements’ to human rights to the status of women—U.N. members that routinely violate human rights target a liberal Israel.’’ b1900 ‘‘When President Obama entered office, among his first acts were to give an interview with the Saudiowned news outlet Al Arabiya championing his outreach to the most nondemocratic Islamic world and to blast democratic Israel on ‘settlements.’ ‘‘Partly, the reason for such inordinate criticism of Israel’’—well, the article says ‘‘sheer cowardice,’’ but that might be inappropriate for a Member to say about the President, so I am not even going to read that part. ‘‘If Israel had 100 million people and was geographically large, the world would not so readily play the bully. ‘‘Instead, the United Nations and Europe would likely leave it alone—just as they give a pass to humanrights offenders such as Pakistan and Indonesia. If Israel were as big as Iran, and Iran as small as Israel, then the Obama administration would have not reached out to Iran and would have left Israel alone. ‘‘Israel’s supposed Western friends sort out Israel’s enemies by their relative natural resources, geography, and population—and conclude that supporting Israel is a bad deal in cost/benefit terms. 
‘‘Partly, the criticism of Israel is explained by oil—an issue that is changing daily as both the U.S. and Israel cease to be oil importers. ‘‘Still, about 40 percent of the world’s oil is sold by Persian Gulf nations.’’ And I might add parenthetically, when we have a new President, that will drop even further because the United States will begin to produce more of the energy that we have been blessed with. There will be more nations in the world that will not have to go begging to Russia, which supposedly those on the left are so concerned about these days. Well, if they are so concerned, let us produce more west Texas oil, more east Texas natural gas, more oil and gas from around the country, and, boy, we will be energy independent. And as smart people have pointed out for a long time, it is a whole lot easier to take on terrorists who are throwing rocks than terrorists who are launching nuclear weapons. Back to this point being made here in National Review: ‘‘Partly, the criticism of Israel is explained by oil—an issue that is changing daily as both the U.S. and Israel cease to be oil importers. ‘‘Still, about 40 percent of the world’s oil is sold by Persian Gulf nations. Influential nations in Europe and China continue to count on oil imports from the Middle East—and make political adjustments accordingly. ‘‘Partly, antiIsrael rhetoric is due to herd politics. The Palestinians— illiberal and reactionary on cherished Western issues like gender equality, homosexuality, religious tolerance, and diversity—have grafted their cause to the popular campus agendas of race/ class/gender victimization. ‘‘Western nations in general do not worry much about assorted nonWestern crimes such as genocides, mass cleansings, or politically induced famines. Instead, they prefer sermons to other Westerners as a sort of virtue signaling, without any worries over offending politically correct groups. ‘‘Partly, the piling on Israel is due to American leverage over Israel as a recipient of U.S. aid. As a benefactor, the Obama administration expects that Israel must match U.S. generosity with obeisance. Yet the U.S. rarely gives similar ‘how dare you’ lectures to less liberal recipients of American aid, such as the Palestinians,’’ for example, ‘‘for their lack of free elections,’’ not to mention their lack of paying, encouraging, immortalizing people who are suicide bombers who are successful in killing innocent victims. The article says: ‘‘Partly, the cause of global hostility toward Israel is jealousy. If Israel were mired in Venezuela like chaos, few nations would care. Instead, the image of a proud, successful, Westernized nation as an atoll in a sea of selfinflicted misery is grating to many. And the astounding success of Israel bothers so many failed states that the entire world takes notice. ‘‘But partly, the source of anti Israelism is ancient antiSemitism. ‘‘If Israelis were Egyptians administering Gaza or Jordanians running the West Bank’’ as they did for 20 years or so, ‘‘no one would care. The world’s problem is that Israelis are Jews. Thus, Israel earns negative scrutiny that is never extended commensurately to others. ‘‘Obama and his diplomatic team should have known all this. Perhaps they do, but they simply do not care.’’ Then we find out this administration, we see what happens when there is yet another terrorist attack in Israel. What does this administration do after such a powerful chastising of our dear friend Israel? Nothing. But ‘‘a Palestinian who may be linked to ISIS rammed his speeding truck into a group of Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem Sunday, killing four people and wounding 15 others before being shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a yearlong campaign of violence.’’ Now, even that, from friends at FOX News, is not as accurate as it could be. Yes, they were soldiers that were killed. They were on a sightseeing tour, and apparently the insidious radical Islamist sat parked and waited for them to be in a vulnerable position, not in a position to use weapons, not fighting. They were sightseeing. As this radical Islamist saw these people getting off the bus, that is when he moved and became the murdering, bloodthirsty, radical Islamist that he was. Mr. Speaker, might I inquire how much time remains? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FASO). The gentleman from Texas has 14 minutes remaining. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to finish talking about this issue that has been raised about the Russians being such a big threat to our elections. Some of us have been screaming here on Capitol Hill that we need to have security of the Internet. And as part of that, one of the last things we needed to do was give control over Web site determinations to the international community. That was created as an American entity, the Internet. We had control over ICANN, the organization controlling the Web sites, and this President did irreparable damage to our security. Oh, I know he thinks he didn’t, so I am not accusing anything untoward, but irreparable damage was done by giving over that power to the socalled international community. This article from John Fund, who had a great book about election fraud, points out, and he quotes from a former colleague, Rahm Emanuel: ‘‘‘You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,’ Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s justnamed chief of staff, told a Wall Street Journal conference of top CEOs in November 2008 while his boss was still Presidentelect. Since then a slew of constitutionally dubious executive orders, presidential emergencies, and rushed legislation have characterized the Obama presidency. Now he is leaving office by issuing a blizzard of ‘midnight regulations’ and edicts. ‘‘One of the most troublesome came last Friday and gave the federal government the power to begin centralizing our election systems. The Constitution explicitly gives states the power to set the ‘times, manner and places of holding elections.’ ‘‘But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson used the excuse of Friday’s release of a report on Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee to declare that state and local voting systems will be designated as ‘pieces of critical infrastructure’ so that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security can protect them from hackers. ‘‘His move—coming just 15 days before President Obama leaves office—led many experts to question both its wisdom and its constitutionality. ‘While the Federal Government has the general power to protect the nation’s cyber infrastructure, it cannot intrude into areas of state sovereignty without clear constitutional mandate,’ John Yoo, a law professor at UC Berkeley, told CNSNews.com. ‘‘‘There is no federal power to control or secure elections. Each state administers its own elections, restricted only by constitutional protections for voting rights,’ agreed Illya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute. ‘It may make sense for states to request federal support here, but it would set a dangerous precedent for a federal agency to unilaterally take over state electoral processes. ‘‘Secretary Johnson’s decision sparked outrage among many of those who are most knowledgeable about our election system—the 50 secretaries of state who, along with local officials, run the election process. Even Johnson admitted that ‘many of them are opposed to this designation.’ ‘‘Secretary of State Brian Kemp of Georgia, told me in an interview that Johnson’s action ‘uses security as an excuse to subvert the Constitution and establish the basis for Federal encroachment into election systems.’’’ Now, Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to pause and look at what happened in this last election. Now, there have been some people saying, as I heard down at the Senate in the Kennedy Room at JEFFSESSIONS ’ hearing this morning, there were 17 intelligence agencies that agreed about the Russian hacking. Well, I am not sure. They must have seen something I didn’t, but I had understood there was, like, three, and that we have been told actually they had these conclusions, but people have admitted—no, actually, they didn’t hack our election system. They didn’t hack any voting machines. Clapper even admitted that. Of course, he has said: I have testified very falsely. He has admitted under oath that he has not been truthful under oath to the Senate before. So as a law professor once asked: If you have admitted lying, well—he 
would say—are you lying now or were you lying then? If you admit you are lying, which one is really the lie? We don’t know. Is he lying now or lying then? You have said—you have told us you are a liar. Which one is it? What we find among smart juries, once they found you lied to them, is that they are not going to trust you about anything else. I think that contributed to the voting results we had. But Conservative HQ had an article: ‘‘Russian Hacking Story A Twofer For Obama And the Left.’’ Say, gee, they get to blame the Russians and they get to take control of the voting system. b1915 Well, all that has come out is somebody hacked John Podesta’s emails— most likely an unprotected server like Hillary Clinton was using—and we lost secrets we may never know. But it was unprotected. Podesta’s was at least protected. And people saw published what Democratic people participating in the Hillary Clinton campaign had said about Christians, Catholics, the duplicity of trying to bring down BERNIESANDERS , the duplicity at debates, the if it is not illegal, the certainly ruleviolating strategies of revealing questions before a debate. Shockingly, when the truth was revealed and certain people in the Hillary Clinton administration, or in their campaign, were exposed as lying about so many things, those people are now saying: Hey, when America found out we were lying, they voted against Hillary. They hurt our election. They affected our election because we were exposed as liars and it cost us votes. That is grossly unfair. The American people should never have known the truth that we were lying about so many things, that we were conspiring to bring down BERNIE SANDERS and defeat him unfairly. The American people weren’t supposed to find those things out and, doggone it, those Russians need to be punished. Well, I don’t know where it came from. And I also know, as a fact, that some intelligence personnel have lied to the chairman of our Intel Committee in the last Congress. I know it is a fact. I don’t know who it was, but they did. When you have Clapper say, Yeah, I came in here and testified about a bunch of stuff that wasn’t true, you wonder wouldn’t it be a good idea to take those incredible individuals in our intelligence agencies that have been faithful to our country, served our country, not their political agenda, and done great things for America, let’s get them in the positions of authority in the intelligence agencies. And since they have been working there, they will know what to do; they will know who to trust, who not to trust. As you find out, if you ever sit on the bench as a felony judge very long, it doesn’t matter what area of life you are in, there are people that are not honest. Fortunately, in law enforcement, intelligence agencies, homeland security, places like that, in my opinion, there is a much higher number of good, honorable, honest people that care about providing for the safety of the American people. That is where we need to go. Find those people in those departments and put them in positions of leadership. We have a great opportunity now before us, and if you are agnostic or atheist, you should believe it was all a roll of the dice. This kind of stuff happens. Hey, even a pragmatist agnostic would probably say: Well, if I am honest, somebody—Julian Assange said it wasn’t the Russians. Indications were it may well have been an unhappy Democratic operative in the party that provided. But wherever they came from, information was provided to the American public showing the terribly unfair and untruthful things that have been said or done, and they voted against the party that had apparently done the unfair, untruthful things. So I think we need to look, as Shakespeare would say, not to our stars, but in ourselves. Personally, I think we were mercifully given another chance to give back to the American people the power that this Congress and the executive branch has used for far too long and let America be America, not the evil parts—the KKK, the lynchings, the horrid things that mar our history—but the goodness, the part of America that would say, ‘‘I don’t care about the KKK. I am going to take you into my home. I am going to protect you’’; the parts of America that said, ‘‘I don’t care what color your skin is. We are fellow human beings and we have got some good ideas and we are going to work together and we are going to raise this Nation to heights it has never seen before.’’ I am hoping and praying that is where we are headed. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
WHO GETS THE BREAKS FROM REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT? THE SUPERWEALTHY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, indeed, we do have an extraordinary country. Down through the last 230 years, this Congress has met, has discussed, decided, voted upon, and set in place policies that advanced our country. And we are so very fortunate, all of us Americans, to be living here with all the promise that this incredible history has given us. But at this period of time, we also have some profound questions about where this country is going. We wake up and we say: What is happening here? What is happening in the international scene? What is all this about Russia hacking? What is all this about trying to influence the American election? Did they really, and did it really happen, and was it effective? Well, we know it really happened. The American public is scratching their head and they are saying: What is it? And then all this talk about change, all this talk about we are going to change things; we are going to repeal ObamaCare, and we are going to replace it with something great. Hmmm. I wonder what that might be. And I suspect all across this Nation there are men, women, families that are also wondering: What do they mean it will be great? What is it that is great? Well, if you were to go around the Capitol, if you were to talk to Members in the House of Representatives or over in the Senate and say: So it is gonna be great; what is it? Well, we will tell you tomorrow or we will tell you later, but it will be great. Maybe, maybe not. Right now, the Senate is working on a piece of legislation that will set the stage for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act—and some would derisively call it ObamaCare. Repeal it. Oh, yeah, get rid of that thing. But not to where it is going to be great as soon as it is gone. Really? I don’t think so. I know that in my part of California, a lot of people—in fact, more than 20,000—don’t think it is great at all. They are going to lose their health care. And there are a whole lot of seniors in my community that are going: Wow, it is going to be great. Really? But I will lose my annual checkup. And that awesome drug doughnut hole that was so frightening just years ago is going to come back? That is not so great. I drove into town or into the Capitol today. I don’t live so far away, but it is 20 degrees, and I decided I would rather drive than freeze. So I drove in and an advertisement came on the radio, and it said: You are going to get a trillion dollar tax cut. Wonderful. The middle class will have a trilliondollar tax cut. I said: Well, that is not what I saw last night when I read the statistics about the great repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, I read something quite different from the tax committees, from Americans, various people. Let me put something up here. Here it is. Who gets that trilliondollar tax cut? Who is it? Is it the middle class? Well, I don’t think so, because when you look at the numbers, it goes to the very wealthy. They are the ones who are going to get the tax cut with the repeal of ObamaCare. When the Affordable Care Act is repealed the way it is presently going, the bill that is over in the Senate will require that the taxes that were put in place to support the Affordable Care Act and to provide insurance for 20 million people—that is both the government insurance, the Medicaid, Medi 
Cal in California, and the subsidized insurance from the various programs that exist State by State—that money was raised from the wealthy. When the tax cuts come into place, here is the real story. The top 1 percent—do you remember the 1 percenters? Do you remember all that discussion about the 1 percenters and the 99? The 1 percenters get 57 percent of that trillion dollars, and everyone else gets to split the remaining 43 percent. The top onetenth of the taxpayers in California—we are talking about the superwealthy. We are talking about the folks that are actually going to be in the Presidentelect’s Cabinet, you know, the billionaires that he is going to put in the Cabinet. We are talking about those guys—oh, roughly a $200,000ayear tax break. But after all, they are hurting. They need a few more hundred thousand dollars along the way. So the trilliondollar tax break that is the foundation of the repeal, if you eliminate the money, the program is not working. There will not be annual visits for seniors so that they can stay healthy, so that they can control their blood pressure, diabetes, mammograms, and all the rest that go with it. There won’t be money for the 3.7 million Californians that presently are able to get coverage under the Medi Cal program. There won’t be money for the almost 2 million Californians that are in the subsidized pool called Covered California. That money won’t be there. Those folks are going to be out. And by the way, the repeal will remove the insurance for 30 million Americans all across the country. But who gets the real benefit here? The superwealthy, the top 1 percent will get 57 percent of that trilliondollar tax break, and the rest of us will share in the 43 percent remaining. Another way to look at it, folks. It will be great, but for whom? Well, if you break the American public into the five sectors, the first 20 percent, next 20, next 20, next 20, and then the top 20—so these are the real poor down here in the lower 20 percent, and these are the superwealthy in the top 20 percent. So what happens? When you repeal the Affordable Care Act, as is now happening in the Senate—and it will be over here either this week or early next week; and then this House will take it up and it, too, will vote on that very same budget bill that will create a trilliondollar tax cut over the next decade—who will get the money? There you go. The top 20 percent will wind up with a full 74 percent of that. b1930 Despite that little advertisement that I heard on the radio, which said, ‘‘Oh, the poor and the middle class are going to get it,’’ really? Let’s see. Of the bottom 20 percent— 6.7—oh, and the next will get 5.9 percent of it—do you have any idea what they are going to lose? They are going to lose the subsidies on their insurance programs. They won’t be able to afford it. They will lose their insurance. For some of them, they are on the Medicaid or the Medi Cal program in California, and they will be out of luck unless, of course, the State of California can find $16.8 billion to replace the money that just disappeared with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and that money is then transferred to the top 20 percent. These folks down here, the bottom 20 percent—actually, the bottom 60 percent of the American public are the losers. Who are the winners? The ones who are already able to buy insurance. I love this trick. I was the Insurance Commissioner in California. I loved this little trick: ‘‘Not to worry. We are going to give an opportunity for people to buy their own insurance and give them a tax break.’’ Do you mean these people down here have enough money jingling around in their pockets that they are going to be able to go out and buy the insurance and get the tax break? Uhuh. It is the folks up here on top who will, once again, benefit. This really is a massive shift of $1 trillion from those people who are now insured, for those people who are now able to get care in the clinics that have been established across America—in outlying areas and in rural areas in my district. It is a massive shift from the ability of those people to get health care, for those people who are on the exchanges and are able to get subsidized insurance so that they can afford it, for those people who are seniors and are able to get their free annual checkups and have their drug costs reduced as the doughnut hole shrinks. It is a massive shift of money being taken directly out of their benefits and their pockets and going to the wealthy of America. That is what is happening. That is what this repeal of the Affordable Care Act is. Then you look at the implications of that. What about the hospitals that have been able to ramp up their services? What about the reforms that were in the Affordable Care Act—the insurance reforms—that said to the insurance companies: ‘‘Oh, no, no, no, you can no longer discriminate because that person happens to be a woman or has a preexisting condition’’? This is important, Mr. Speaker. If you are scratching your head and wondering what is going on here, listen carefully because this super rapid train is about to come into the House of Representatives and sweep through here, wiping out the healthcare benefits of 30 million Americans. For those who are not directly affected, they, too, are going to wind up in a very precarious situation because the reforms will also be repealed. Joining me tonight to discuss this and Social Security—oh, by the way, Social Security is also on the chopping block—are two of my colleagues: M ARCY KAPTUR from Ohio, who has been an extraordinary leader on the issues of manufacturing, of making it in America, of looking out for seniors, and for people who are in need of help and support. Congresswoman KAPTUR , would you care to join us and share with us your thoughts on what is happening in Washington? Ms. KAPTUR. Thank you, Congressman GARAMENDI . You are such a rare and talented Member. I thank the people of California for sending you here. You serve them every day of the week, 7 days a week—24/7. It is a privilege to appear with you tonight and also with Congressman PAUL TONKO , one of our most talented Members from upstate New York—a region like my own that has just been battered by the global economy and the outsourcing of jobs. We all are just honored to serve in this Congress, and we respect it and its history and its potential. Mr. Speaker, as I travel my own district and State, I am finding I have to reassure people. Anytime there is a change, I guess, in public life, people need to be bolstered that everything is going to be okay. We are here to be that squad and to say to the American people that they have power, too, and that it isn’t just the super rich of this country or the billionaire class. We can label them ‘‘wealth power.’’ And that has power; yes, it does. Sometimes extraordinary power. But there is also ‘‘people power.’’ I consider myself having been lifted here by people power over many years, and I appreciate the people of my region for allowing me to serve our country and to learn every day, to learn from them, to learn how to make the instruments of the Nation work better for them. There is also ‘‘spiritual power.’’ I am amazed at how people’s spiritual groundings help them through difficult situations and transitions. Then there is ‘‘intellectual power.’’ We hope to use some of that here once in a while. That is a power in and of itself. We think about the power of liberty of a free people to improve their Nation, to heal their Nation, to expand opportunity in their Nation. We are aided and abetted by a very curious media—sometimes more ridiculous than it needs to be—but also of people digging, trying to find that elusive truth that should lead us all forward. So we find ourselves helping to heal our Nation by being Members here, and we all hope for the best for our people and for our country. I think the Members here are very well motivated. I rise to defend, really, and to support two foundational programs of our society: Social Security and Medicare. I will try to be brief so others can comment. I am very proud to say that our family is one of those families who would have been completely destroyed had it not been for Social Security and Medicare. Those didn’t exist when my parents were born and grandparents were 
living in our country. But in 1935, after our country crashed economically and there were major bank failures and the stock market crashed and wiped out the savings of millions of Americans, the Nation turned to the Federal Government, to the President, to guarantee for a large segment of our society—senior citizens—decent incomes. The Social Security Insurance Act was enacted at the urging of Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was regarded as a saint in our household because what happened around our country was that seniors before that time—many of them—were living in what we called poorhouses. They were dying in terrible circumstances, and there was no security as a person aged. Can you imagine how revolutionary it was at that time to create a social insurance program—probably the largest insurance program America has ever had—to ensure that as people aged or if workers became disabled in the workplace or if they died that their children would have sources of income? The program did all of that. In thinking back, gosh, over 70 years, how transformational was that? As for our grandpa, who died in a county hospital in Ohio before the enactment of Medicare, I know the conditions that he died under. And I know that, when our mother died, it was a different situation. She had Social Security and Medicare, and we were able to take care of her. The same was true with our father. Intergenerationally, I see our country getting better. I am proud of that. I am also proud to be a Democrat and a member of a party that has created Social Security, which has become an indispensable part of our way of life. As I have said to seniors and to workers, it is an earned benefit. People pay for it every time their paychecks are nicked, and their employers match it. Obviously, to survivors—and, obviously, I have neighbors who have lost spouses, whose children then benefit from the survivor benefit—what an incredible gift this idea is to the American people. There are 35 million people today in our country who depend on Social Security—one out of every six Americans. Every day, Social Security lifts 20 million people out of poverty— people who used to live in poverty. Can you imagine what that was like? We don’t ever, ever want to go back to that world. In 2014, the latest data show us that more than 6 million children under the age of 18 live in families who receive income from Social Security, lifting more than a million children out of poverty. Social Security has never been a welfare program. It is an earned benefit, and all Americans who contribute to it during their working lifetimes receive benefits. Social Security is a compact of trust between generations. It is the everpresent sentry at the economic security gate for retirees, for those hurt on the job, or for their survivors, and it is America’s greatest insurance program ever. I happened to be living when Lyndon Johnson helped to create the Medicare program, which provides health insurance coverage now to over 55 million people in our country—essential health security for seniors. Today, only 2 percent of the elderly in our country lack health insurance compared to 48 percent—half the people of this country— in 1962, after World War II, before Medicare even existed. That seems sort of modern times, the 1960s; yet it really was not. I would say that that is a ‘‘wow’’ by any measure. Yes, people are living longer. Thank God the program is working. People are getting free preventative healthcare screenings and are lowering the longterm costs of care because of early diagnosis. Seniors don’t have to pay for mammograms or diabetes or cancer screenings, thanks to the Affordable Care Act; so we keep trying to make the system better. Since House Republicans won the majority in 2011, every House Republican budget has tried to end the Medicare guarantee and turn Medicare into a privatized voucher program. Do you know what that is going to do? It is going to shut out millions of Americans who are elderly—or who are about to be elderly—from insurance. The reason we have Medicare is that insurers weren’t insuring seniors—that is the reason it exists in the first place—or they will make the price so high that people won’t be able to pay for it; or they will cherrypick only the healthy people. Then those who have diabetes, those who have had prior cancers, those who have multiple sclerosis, those who have Parkinson’s will be cast aside. What kind of a country would this be, for heaven’s sake? The American Association of Retired Persons and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare completely opposed the Republicans’ plan to voucherize and let every senior go out there in the market and try to find a plan of his own, because they know what that means. These two programs are the most prolife programs this Nation has ever created. We should be so proud of what we have been able to do as a country over the last century. The Republican attacks on Social Security and Medicare need to stop. They are America’s bulwark for millions and millions of people, and they have proven themselves to be America’s most important, lifetime security programs. I thank Congressman GARAMENDI and Congressman TONKO for being down here tonight. I know how passionately you care about the people of our country way beyond just your districts and why we are here. We are here to stand with them. Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you very much, Ms. KAPTUR . I loved your talk of the history and how it came to pass that we have Social Security and Medicare and what happened when we did not. It was really profound. It reminded me of my own history. I remember, as a young kid, that my father took me to the county hospital where the neighboring rancher was—we were out on a ranch in California—and it was horrible. That is where he was sent to die because there was no Medicare. Ms. KAPTUR. If the gentleman would yield, I can remember the stench. Mr. GARAMENDI. Oh, the stench was unbelievable. Ms. KAPTUR. I can remember that. Mr. GARAMENDI. I am sorry your father endured that. Ms. KAPTUR. My grandpa. Mr. GARAMENDI. Your grandfather. Ms. KAPTUR. Our father had to fight to get him in there because there wasn’t enough space for people who were ill and dying. That was before hospice and that was before Medicare. I remember, as a young girl, that that was a hard thing to experience, but our mother and father never protected us from the inevitable. Mr. GARAMENDI. I was just thinking that I have got more stories to tell, but I really want to turn to our colleague from New York. Mr. TONKO and I are often on the floor—with you also—to discuss jobs in America, how to enhance our American economy with research, economic development of all kinds, transportation infrastructure, Make It In America. Mr. TONKO , tonight we are on a somewhat different subject, but I know it is one that you are very familiar with, one that you have spent your entire career addressing in trying to help seniors and others who have been on the short end of the stick. Thank you so much for joining us, Mr. TONKO . b1945 Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative GARAMENDI for bringing us together in this Special Order format to talk about some key critical components that address American families significantly. Representative GARAMENDI and Representative M ARCY  KAPTUR , who both do their homework, are a great addition to the House because they challenge us with facts, not fiction. They care deeply and passionately about improving and enhancing the quality of life. So to stand with both on this issue is a good feeling for me. Just a couple of observations: I think it is okay for government to have a heart. We speak to the heart and soul of working families across this country by understanding that health care is not a privilege; it is a right. So let’s begin with that fundamental basic observation, a right. What we have seen with this right is that over 30 million Americans have been added to the rolls of the insured over the course of the Affordable Care Act. Now, Representative KAPTUR did a great job of speaking to history of 
Medicare, of Social Security, and of the Affordable Care Act, as did Representative GARAMENDI . I remember being at the 75th anniversary celebration of Social Security, and people were talking about the discrediting going on before Social Security was enacted into law. There were those who demonized it before it became law. There were those who have fought it ever since. They don’t want that right for working families. I would suggest that Social Security, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act are rock solid elements of a foundation upon which to grow quality of life and longevity. It is a basic fundamental additive that, when brought to our working families across this country, we are providing a service and we are addressing them with dignity. That is what this is about. The demonization of the Affordable Care Act is interesting. Because if you look at polling, you will find that people say that ObamaCare is destroying the Nation. Well, what about the Affordable Care Act? That is working. My friends, it is the same issue, it is the same concept, and it is the same program. So what we have tried to do is discredit a program that took on a major challenge, took on major industries, and needed to provide a balance and an actuarial outcome that is providing a goforward and accomplish what you have enacted as a mission. The actuarial science has got to be precise. So for those who want to repeal, they are talking about, in cases, pulling a brick out of the foundation and having it get wobbly, and it is going to crash the marketplace. We are going to have all of these people who have been enrolled or have been forever enrolled in health care impacted by rising costs and disruptive outcomes that will put them at risk. So like the Social Security Program before the ACA, like Medicare before the ACA, as you floated these boats, as you went forward with time, you learned where you needed to tweak, and you adjusted, by amendment format, to make the program stronger. That is what we have been asking for in a partnership here in the House and with the Senate. Let’s work on those areas that may need improvement, but do not repeal because repeal without replacement is a disaster. It is a disaster waiting to happen. We have provided hope for working families across this country. We have had the testimony presented to us, anecdotal evidence, that this is working, that for the first time families have enjoyed a connection to a system, a standardized approach. What was the program? People say: Well, I don’t want to pay for someone else’s health care. You have been paying for it before the ACA. It was called the emergency room. It wasn’t standardized because whoever you got at that emergency room in whatever location, as you traveled looking for assistance, didn’t provide a steady flow. It was a wasteful outcome for taxpayers and an insufficient outcome, a cruel outcome for those consumers who were impacted by being underinsured or uninsured. So let’s set the record straight. We have had a program up and running for 8 years now. The Republicans have chastised this program saying it needs to be repealed. We have taken over 65 votes, or 65 votes, I believe, to repeal, but there has never been a replacement plan. So what kind of gimmick is this to pull away a program that is working for tens of millions of families added to the rolls but not replace? That is disaster waiting to happen. So we challenge our colleagues here in the House and in the Senate down the hall to be academic about this, to be compassionate about it, to be passionate in our resolve, and to make a difference by putting together the improvements that we require and not repealing. Now, we look at the Affordable Care Act and what it means to our health care. But if you repeal, you will wreak damage on the budget. You will destroy our economy. You will have a huge workforce displacement, and you will slash care for America’s working families. Is this the outcome that we want? Remember, we were the last industrialized nation to come to the table and provide guaranteed health care for our families. That is not something of which we are proud. That was destructive. That was insensitive. It was not effective. It was a waste of tax dollars the way we did it. So now we go forward with a program that allows us to now take a look at the history, albeit brief, on the Affordable Care Act, but understanding where we need to fine tune. We do that, and the challenge is there for all of us: take the cost out of the system for a stronger future and provide at least the same level of quality, if not enhanced quality, as we go forward. That should unite us in a common cause, cutting the cost of the program and enhancing the quality of services provided. What a great mission for all of us to embark upon. So let’s not play politics with the health care for tens of millions of people who are new to the system and for all of us who have been covered routinely by the system. We can do better than that. Let the lessons of Social Security and Medicare, which, as my colleagues indicated earlier, address the American public with dignity, improvement, enhancement, and hope, the best commodity we can deliver as a government to her people. So I thank Representative GARAMENDI for the opportunity for us to speak to these issues. Frankness is required right now. The lack of theater would be an improvement. No theater on this. Let’s settle for facts, not fiction, and working together to bring about what is a sound resolve that allows us to provide stability and success for the American public. That, I don’t think, is too much to ask. So I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) for bringing us together. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure for me to be on the floor with Representative TONKO because of his passion, his knowledge, his ability to articulate with clarity, in this case, the importance of the Social Security program, Medicare, as well as the Affordable Care Act. The gentleman makes a compelling argument. I want the public of America to really grasp the importance of what is happening here in Washington. Yes, we are going to have a new President, and there will be an inaugural and all of the celebration that goes with that. Let me put it this way: When that is done, there is a majority of the Congress and the Senate, together with the President, that fully intend to embark on unraveling the very critical safety net for more than 30 million Americans. And for everyone else who has insurance at every age—Medicare all the way down who has insurance—they will also see a dislocation and an unraveling of their insurance benefits because this market could seriously unravel. So as the gentleman said so clearly, be academic, study the facts, and study the pros and the cons of the various alternatives that are out there. I know, as an insurance commissioner and having been dealing in the issues of health care for many years now, that there are improvements needed in the Affordable Care Act. There is no doubt. We have been saying that since shortly after it became law. And even when it became law, I said this should be done this way or that way a little differently. We are 8 years into this and, as you say, millions, tens of millions actually—around 30 million directly—are involved and benefiting from the program, either through Medicaid, through the exchanges, or through the various benefits that are out there. So it is really, really important. I want to also pick up on something that Representative KAPTUR brought to our attention. I am going to put one more chart up here. I was surprised and a little bit appalled, just before we broke for Christmas, that the new chairman of the subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee who deals with Social Security introduced a piece of legislation. We looked at it. It was just before the Christmas holidays, so I picked it up and started looking at it. I go: whoa, wait, wait, wait. This is a major step to unravel the Social Security system. Remember, back in the George W. Bush administration, in the first 3 years of his administration, he tried to privatize Social Security. He failed miserably at that. Thankfully, he failed. Congress wouldn’t stand for it. At least, the Democrats in Congress wouldn’t stand for it. 
I see this piece of legislation introduced in the last session, in the last days, and I am going: Whoa, what does this mean? This man becomes the chairman of the subcommittee that deals with Social Security, and I am going: oh, no, they wouldn’t; they wouldn’t go after Social Security again. But the bill does. It does it in a way that, once again, gives enormous benefits to the wealthy and not so much for the others. This is a little chart about what happens if that piece of legislation by Mr. JOHNSON actually becomes law. These are the benefits that would be received today. In 10 years, these would be the benefits. This is the top 20 percent rather, and right here is the middle. That is about a $3,000 a year reduction. Keep in mind that, I think, well over 50 percent of the seniors in the United States depend upon Social Security as their principal source and, in many cases, their only source of income. So you get a decline. What do they want to do? They want to increase the age to 69 before you could apply for full Social Security. They want to radically change the costofliving index. I know what I heard from my constituents when there was no cost of living over the previous 2 years—and a very small one this last year—the cost of care for seniors continues to rise because they are on the expensive side of things. There are some other provisions in it. So this is a wakeup call. This is a wakeup call. Clearly, the majority party here in the House and in the Senate have promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which we have talked about. They have also made it clear that in the past—and we believe in the months ahead—they will attempt to privatize a large portion of the Medicare program. So Medicaid will be largely gutted, and the increases that we have seen through the Medicaid program will be wiped out. The Medicare program will have significant benefit reductions, and, if they intend to voucherize it, which they have talked about, then as Representative KAPTUR said, they will throw the seniors to the mercy of the insurance companies. My basic point tonight was to raise the alarm and to begin to discuss here amongst our colleagues the reality of what is being planned for America. Don’t look at this as a partisan issue, Republican or Democrat. Look at this as a personal issue. Look at this as an issue that was given to me by a woman who is a farmer in the community I represent north of Sacramento who never had insurance. She was an entrepreneur, a self employed farmer. She never had insurance. If she needed care, she would go to the emergency room. That worked when she was young, but then she became a little older, and then cancer. b2000 The treatments for her cancers were unaffordable. She would go bankrupt. The Affordable Care Act came along with guaranteed coverage and an insurance policy through the exchange in California that she could afford that would provide her with unlimited medical services for the rest of her life. No cap, no annual cap, no lifetime cap. She got her cancer treatments, and she has moved along. She said: I still need care. And if they repeal the Affordable Care Act, I won’t get it and I will die. That story is repeated across America. It is repeated in my district. I can give many more examples. So this really is, in her case and in many others, a lifeordeath situation. So, yes, we will be academic as Mr. TONKO has said. We should be. We should understand the implications of one policy versus another. We should understand when you start with repealing a trillion dollars of taxes, that will have a profound impact on health care in America. And the benefits will go to the wealthy. That is academic. But it is also this woman, a small farmer who developed cancer. She had no hope. The Affordable Care Act comes along, and she is able to get insurance and she is able to get the chemotherapy necessary to save her life. She is back on the farm. Repeal the Affordable Care Act and this woman, along with millions of Americans, are in serious jeopardy. So be aware. Social Security on the chopping block; Medicare on the chopping block; the Affordable Care Act is on the chopping block. Tax reductions for whom? Yes, mom and pop would get $130 a year from the tax cuts. The billionaires in the Trump administration would get $200,000 a year in tax cuts. Mom and pop are likely to lose their insurance. I now yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ). Mr. TONKO. Thank you, Representative GARAMENDI . As you talk about public sentiment about Social Security, the Affordable Care Act, and hearing the evidence you have provided from your constituent within your district, it becomes very apparent where the American public is. When polled recently, only 20 percent of the American public is in support of efforts to repeal without replacement— 20 percent. So the great, great majority understands what is going on here. We have also seen during the recent campaign season, which probably went a year and a half to 2 years long, a lot of talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, undoing the act. That happened in the same timeframe as 11.5 million people were added to the rolls for 2017. So there is an appeal here that is drawing the American public toward the coverage provided by ACA. So the sentiment here is to get things done and provide, again, the stability. I am also a cosponsor of legislation entitled Strengthening Social Security Act that would improve how we calculate the benefits for Social Security. We are not advancing reducing those benefits or raising the retirement age to 69 or whatever level; we are talking about enhancing benefits. When you talk to seniors, they will say we either have got nothing or we got just a bit of an increase that was taken away with the other hand for some other purpose. So, yes, we need to revisit just how we give that green light to a COLA adjustment, and we need to calculate that approval with items that are truly essential for the senior citizens, not big screen televisions or certain items that are adding to a luxurious note, but one that speaks to their basic core needs to live day to day. So the Strengthening Social Security Act does just that. It takes into account all of the essentials in that calculus that will determine whether or not a COLA adjustment is given that given year. So that is important. I also believe it is time for us to look at that cap that we have created, that we have placed on contributions to Social Security. You know, some people by February 12 or 14, whatever date it is, are done paying. They are done contributing by that point in the year. Well, the standards of $118,000, or $127,000 coming this year, are just capturing most of those revenues. The hardship is placed on the working, middleincome community, those looking to ascend the middle class. There could be a far greater contribution from other income strata that we ought to look at to provide stability. A point needs to be made that Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act are all intertwined. There were strengtheners that were provided for these programs. There was a partnership of revenue stream that was calculated and assumed that again provides for the quality of response to the consuming public, and especially those in senior years. I have a large percentage of senior citizens in the makeup of my constituency. It is important to recognize that many who are on Medicare end up getting Medicaid assistance because of situations that are called upon where they are perhaps placed in nursing homes, adult homes, or the like. So we have to be cognizant here of the public sentiment, where is their thinking, and we know exactly what they want. They want stability for these programs. They want strengthening of the programs. They want to make certain that all of these efforts that have lasted for decades, or were introduced as late as 2010, will continue so they have a future that is that more secure, that more certain. So tonight we talk and implore our colleagues to please help improve the Affordable Care Act. Let’s not repeal, and certainly do not repeal without a replacement plan. That is a disaster that will really cause havoc in the marketplace. It is one that doesn’t prove to be actuarially sound. Also, let’s make certain that we don’t have these efforts again to voucherize Medicare, to privatize Social Security. These are programs that have provided stability. 
When I came into the House in 2009, it was at the lowest point of the recession which President Obama was handed upon his entering into the Presidency. There were 700,000, 800,000, 900,000 jobs lost a month in the deepest, darkest moment of the recession. What did we see? We saw individuals who took their lifetime’s worth of savings and entrusted them to a marketplace, and they lost everything for which they had ever worked, and others realized they didn’t lose a single cent of Social Security. Therein lies a tremendous bit of testimony as to the meritorious achievements of a Social Security system, one that provided that safety net for all families, one that made certain there was some sort of continuous flow, a backup, a reinforcement, as you went into retirement years. We are reminded of Medicare and what the results were for retirees, how long they were expected to live and what their quality of life was like. It was tremendously, favorably turned around with the benefits of Medicare. So with an impassioned plea, I encourage this House, the Senate, to do the right thing: stand for the American public and allow them to be addressed with dignity with these programs that have proven themselves. And where there is a need to further assist, as there has been time and time and time again with Social Security, as there has been time and time again with Medicare, let’s provide that same approach to the Affordable Care Act. I thank the gentleman from California for bringing us together and being able to share our thoughts and advocacy to do the right thing. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. TONKO very much. It is always a pleasure and learning experience to be on the floor with Mr. TONKO . I now yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ). We are about to wrap it up as we are nearly out of time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join Mr. GARAMENDI and Mr. TONKO , and I want to place in the RECORD , since both of you have talked so eloquently about the Affordable Care Act, you know how you will be walking through your district, maybe at a parade or some public event, and someone will break from the crowd and run toward you. I am thinking about one particular woman who came up to me in one of my smaller communities. She was in tears. This was during the summertime. She has cerebral palsy, and she never was able to get care. I don’t know why she didn’t qualify for insurance, I don’t know all of that, but she hugged me and thanked me. And then around the corner from where we live, there is a little produce market that I go into all the time. I am friends with one of the women who works there. This little business couldn’t afford insurance, so their employees, when the Affordable Care Act passed, went to the private marketplace to get a plan. This particular woman who works long hours and lost her husband to cancer told me: MARCY , why are people complaining about the Affordable Care Act? Guess what, now I have cancer. She said: I was able to go and get all of the tests, and now they have me on chemotherapy. So, with cancer, this woman is working. She was only able to get insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Multiply that times 10,000, 20,000, 1 million, 20 million, whatever the number is. Think about the number of people in our country who were without insurance. Sometimes I am speechless when I meet these citizens because I think: Where were you hiding before? Where were you? Another place I was, a woman was mixing up. She said: Well, I have health insurance, right? I pay car insurance. I said: No. Car insurance doesn’t cover health insurance. People sometimes don’t act in their own selfinterest. She didn’t even know that because she had auto insurance, that didn’t cover health insurance. Can you believe that? So she was in a job where, with the Affordable Care Act, she could go out to the exchange and buy a plan. It is amazing to me some of the things that have happened and how I see the Affordable Care Act off to a very good start. As Mr. TONKO said, don’t just repeal it until you have something to replace it with. You cannot pull the rug out from under these people’s lives. It would be unconscionable to do that. We have several Christians, several other denominations in this House. It would be very unChristian to do that, for those who are Christian. And for those of other denominations—pick your denomination—I just think it would be very cruel. I thank the gentleman for allowing us to speak out this evening on behalf of citizens who can’t speak for themselves and to try to help perfect what we as a Republic can do for our citizenry. b2015 Mr. TONKO. Representative GARAMENDI , if I just might, I am listening to Representative KAPTUR talk of the interaction she had with her constituents, and I would just add my similar experience. Some of the most cherished efforts of the Affordable Care Act are about preexisting conditions. Being a woman, being a pregnant woman, or being a woman or a man fighting cancer made it very difficult for people to get that insurance, and lifetime caps. You know, people being rolled into surgery, wheeled into surgery, and being told that they were discontinuing their plan. So these are elements of the Affordable Care Act that could be at risk if we start playing around with the actuarial balance that has been achieved. And preexisting conditions, they rang right up there as one of the biggest concerns people have about repeal. Ms. KAPTUR. On that point, another woman came up to me, I was over at the medical hospital with my brother, and she has epilepsy, and she has another condition. She told me, she said: You know, MARCY , I have to cut my pills in half. Can you help me try to find pills so that I can afford to pay for all the medicines that I need to take care of myself? Rather than repealing, can’t we find a majority of Republicans to help us, to help our citizens be able to get medicine at prices they can afford? Why can’t we have competitive bidding for pharmaceuticals? Why can’t we have that? We have it for the VA. We have it for the Department of Defense. Why can’t we have it for the rest of our citizenry so that we can get the best price? But I thought: Cutting your pills in half? And so what happens to her is, if she doesn’t take enough of the medicine, then she has a seizure. But she has got other things wrong with her, so she is trying to cut this pill and cut that pill. And I thought, this is crazy. This is crazy. Can’t we do better as a country than this for our people? I have never understood why the price of pharmaceuticals has shot up so much. I can’t tell you how many cases we get in our office where we have to call these companies and beg, you know, do you have some foundation where we can get a few more pills from Lilly or a few more pills from this company or that company in order to help people in our district. It shouldn’t be our job to turn into a medical dispensary because the system isn’t working. There ought to be a way to take care of this. Mr. GARAMENDI. As we look at this issue, this conversation puts before us and the American people really two paths to travel. The Presidentelect recently said: We’re going to repeal ObamaCare, and it’ll be great. And our Republican colleagues have bought into that and are now processing legislation to do that. The discussion today from my two colleagues here indicates another path, and that is, make it better. Make the Affordable Care Act better. The drug issue, there is no reason in the world that the pharmaceutical companies should be prevented from price competition. They are. It is the law of the land that prevents the government and other purchasers—the government from negotiating prices. That is a law that can be changed. There are many things that we could do to improve the health care of America. But two paths: one, working together to improve the Affordable Care Act and Medicare and Medicaid, and the Veterans Administration, the programs that provide the health care and the insurance for Americans; or another one, a path that is going to be extraordinarily destructive. 
The repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which is already underway in the Senate and will soon be over here in the House, promises Americans not just the 30 million that have insurance but all Americans with a very serious health problem in the future. Final comments, and then we will be out of time. Mr. TONKO. Just a quick comment. We have talked about much here this evening. I joined you a bit after you started. I don’t know if you mentioned the hospital situation. Mr. GARAMENDI. Very briefly. Mr. TONKO. But representing a number of hospitals, from standalone clinics to some very specific specialty type of health centers, they are all concerned about the impact of repeal. And certainly, being a major employer, if not the major employer in some of my counties, as you reduce that care, you are reducing the workforce. So now we are creating another impact, and it is why the ripple effect of repeal is so strong and devastating, and will raise our deficit. Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ) for joining us. I can assure you, we will be back. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
