Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with you an inspiring story about a community rallying to honor one of our Nation’s heroes. On September 12 of this year, Thomas Edward Hunter passed away at the wonderful age of 93. He was a World War II veteran who served in Normandy and fought with our troops to liberate Europe from the Nazis. Unfortunately, Mr. Hunter spent his final years mostly alone in a nursing home, and died without much close family. He literally outlived all of his siblings. He never married, nor had any children. As a result, he had no one to serve as pallbearers at his funeral. Word of Mr. Hunter’s passing reached the folks at Winnfield Senior High School, which is in a small community in rural north central Louisiana that I had the privilege of representing. After learning about Mr. Hunter’s fate, six Winnfield football players—Matthew Harrell, Brett Jurek, Justin Lawson, T.J. Homan, Christian Evans, and Lee Estay—stepped up to serve as pallbearers for Mr. Hunter. In addition, the folks at Southern Funeral Homes arranged for military honors, along with the flag and the playing of taps. I am so inspired by the actions of Matthew, Brett, Justin, T.J., Christian, and Lee, as well as others in the community, who gave Mr. Hunter the hero’s sendoff that he so deserved. They didn’t know this man, but they knew that every veteran deserves to die with dignity and to be honored for the sacrifices they made for our great Nation. Mr. Speaker, I think the actions of these men that you see in the photo to my left here speaks volumes of what is so truly important in our country: community, country, family, God. Our flag and the Nation it stands for is special because of veterans like Thomas Hunter who answered the call to serve without question. Thousands have given their lives for that flag and this Nation, and they deserve our respect for their ultimate sacrifices. These young men in Winnfield, they get that. They got that at this funeral. I think others in this country will learn from their wonderful example. SENATE PROPOSED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS INSANE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, Albert Einstein is reported to have once said: The definition of insanity is trying to do the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Using that definition, the men in the white coats with large butterfly nets have plenty of wacky patients to catch in the Senate, where this week—tomorrow, in fact—the Republican leadership is once again, for over the 60th time, trying to jam through a socalled healthcare bill which will repeal the Affordable Care Act without a coherent replacement. Once again, the Republican leadership will force a vote without analysis by the Congressional Budget Office of the CassidyGraham bill, no hearings at the healthcare committee; and in the face of a tidal wave of opposition from the healthcare world, patient groups, healthcare givers, and even Republican Governors have had one message over the last week, which is to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Speaker, just to give you a small sample of some of the patient groups that have spoken out over the last week in opposition to this measure, they include the ALS Association, the American Cancer Society, The American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the Arthritis Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the National Kidney Foundation, the Down Syndrome Caucus, the American Foundation for the Blind, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Amputee Coalition of America, the Autism Speaks group, the Coalition to Stop Opioid Overdose, and AARP. These are mainstream, trusted organizations, which all of us have donated 
to, done walkathons, done everything we can to help their missions, which is to help America’s patients. They are unanimous that the Senate should reject this measure and that we should move on to a new approach—following Mr. Einstein’s advice—to try and fix the American healthcare system. Incredibly, American provider groups, who at many times are at each other’s throats in terms of different healthcare legislation, have also taken the same position: the American Medical Association; the American Nurses Association; the Association of American Medical Colleges; the American Hospital Association; the Catholic Health Association of the United States; and the American Health Care Association, which represents thousands of nursing homes like the one that just cared for that gentleman that we heard such kind words about a moment ago from Louisiana. Again, incredibly, the National Association of Medicaid Directors from all 50 States—Republican States and Democratic States—issued an extraordinary letter last week. Again, these are folks who run the system. They are actually on the ground. They are in the real world, not in the political bubble of Washington, and they have unanimously begged the Senate to vote ‘‘no,’’ and to stop this rush to undermining and creating a catastrophic damage to America’s healthcare system. The RAND Corporation issued a report just a couple of days ago that talked about the impact of this measure on America’s veterans. 1.75 million American veterans use the Medicaid program; many in nursing homes, maybe like Mr. Hunter, who we just heard about. The RAND Corporation has told us that passing this measure will undermine our promise to America’s veterans, the people who wore the uniform of this country, that they would have access to coverage through the Medicaid program. That is what this bill does. Mr. Speaker, in the real world, at the end of this week, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, a bipartisan measure that passed a couple of decades ago, expires its authorization. The law that provides authorization for America’s community health centers, that expires at the end of this week. The National Health Service Corps, which allows young Americans to get the opportunity for affordable medical education, that expires at the end of this week. That is what we should be focused on; not another mindless rushed judgment to satisfy a political promise that the American people don’t want and we know, from all the folks who are out there in the real world of America’s healthcare system, won’t work. Vote ‘‘no.’’ RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF THE GUARDIANS OF THE WASHINGTON CROSSING NATIONAL CEMETERY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my admiration for a dedicated group of individuals in my community who tirelessly work to ensure every veteran receives the recognition they deserve. This organization is the Guardians of the Washington Crossing National Cemetery. Through rain, sleet, extreme heat, and excessive cold, conditions that would make others seek shelter, these dedicated members have not missed a single veteran’s funeral since the opening of the Washington Crossing National Cemetery. Over 10,000 of our Nation’s veterans have received their final honors provided by this devoted patriotic group of citizens. It is with deep gratitude that I share their efforts on this floor. Mr. Speaker, in recognition of their humble service, I include their names in the RECORD . 
Bob Craven, Gabe Masico, John Heenan, Dan Worden, Mel Benson, Joe Hogan, Joe Longmore, Marge Weiner, Jerry Byrnes, Gene Hamilton, Hugh Bell, Les Walters, Randy Seitter, Ken Myerson, George Sweet, Tom Hauserman, Ron Lyons, Gene Teece, Bob Miles, Terry Schweikert. Bill McKenna, Walter Elsperger, Bob Sundling, Sal Castro, Tom Molnar, Bob Davis, Jan Becknell, Bob Greenwood, Bill Tuttle, Bill Kratz, Harry Magrisi, Harold Shultz, Rich Bender, Tim Ward, Ken Fox, Skip Munday, John D’ascenzo, Fred Ameel, Joe Darwalk, Frank Adams. John Morgan, Walt Jerdan, Dennis Cudnik, Joe Fonde, Steve Whiteman, Terry Sherk, Jim McDevitt, Bob Castor, Jim Kuhn, Tom Lyons, Bob Boccuti, Jim Hartman, Kathleen Mcall, Marc Wilard, Victor Teat, Ned Cooney, Dick Lima, John Lee, John Wharton, Jim Frawley.

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, we can never truly thank our Nation’s veterans enough for their service and their sacrifice. But the work of the members, past and present, of the Washington Crossing National Cemetery Honor Guard is an example we should all follow. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance of raising awareness of mitochondrial disease this month of September. Mitochondrial disease is a chronic genetic disorder that occurs when the mitochondria of the cells fail to produce enough energy to keep them functioning. This disease affects 1 in 4,000 Americans of all ages, including my constituent, Bettemarie Bond. It can have severe consequences. Symptoms of mitochondrial disease are poor growth, loss of motor function, and an increased risk of infection. For more than 25 years, Bettemarie has relied on continuous infusions of parenteral nutrition, saline, and pain medication to help manage the effects of her conditions. As a patient advocate, she raises awareness of the importance of access to home care. Home infusion care has allowed Bettemarie to go to college, work as an occupational therapist, and buy her home in my hometown of Levittown. This month we highlight the importance of coming together to support those with this disease, as well as educate the public about its effects. We can and must spread awareness for this disease through social media awareness, spreading the word in our communities, sharing stories of those afflicted, wearing green in support, and holding events to help gain recognition of this disease and its repercussions. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak with all those impacted by this condition, including my constituents, as we work to find a cure. f 
40TH ANNIVERSARY OF FOOD STAMPS ACT OF 1977 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this Friday marks the 40th anniversary of the Food Stamps Act of 1977, landmark legislation that expanded the reach of the Food Stamps program and made it more effective and efficient. The bipartisan legislation came as a response to the severe hunger and malnutrition that plagued our country in the 1960s. In 1968, a CBS documentary called ‘‘Hunger in America’’ turned the Nation’s focus to this terrible problem, making us all aware that even in the United States of America, the richest country in the history of the world, kids were going to school hungry and families couldn’t afford nutritious meals. For the next decade, my friend and mentor, Senator George McGovern, the Democrat from South Dakota; and Senator Bob Dole, a Republican from Kansas, led the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. This bipartisan panel worked to examine the issue of hunger and malnutrition in the United States. They held field hearings to witness firsthand how devastating the curse of hunger was across this country. They worked together to educate the public and other Members of Congress on hunger, and worked together to find common ground on how best to tackle this terrible problem. Out of this work came important updates to the Food Stamps program. The Food Stamps Act of 1977 established national standards of eligibility for the program and eliminated the requirement that recipients pay for their 
stamps. It was revolutionary and it helped to dramatically reduce extreme poverty and extreme hunger in the United States. Since the 1970s, Congress has worked to strengthen the program, making it even more effective and efficient. We have modernized benefit processing, and replaced the paper food stamps with EBT cards. We have added incentives for the purchase of healthy foods, and improved access to fresh fruits and vegetables. We have updated benefit calculations to exclude combat pay for military families, and allow childcare deductions to assist families with young children. In 2008, we renamed the program SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The modern SNAP provides millions of children, seniors, and other vulnerable adults with food assistance each year. It helps families lift themselves out of poverty, and improves health, educational, and economic outcomes for its recipients. As I hear from families in my district, I learn how powerful SNAP is in transforming lives. Just last week I heard the story of a graduate school educated constituent who became disabled and was unable to work and was resistant to applying for SNAP. She didn’t think she fit the profile of someone who needed food benefits, but she did. She applied for and received benefits, and now she no longer panics about where her next meal is going to come from. b1215 This constituent wanted us to know that people who use SNAP are not lazy. She said: ‘‘SNAP helps people at least not to have to worry as much about going to bed, school, or work hungry.’’ Another constituent shared that she and her husband rely on SNAP to eat healthier meals. Prior to receiving benefits, they had peanut butter and jelly for almost every meal. Now, with modest assistance, they are able to buy fruits and vegetables. While they still continue to struggle, they are able to enjoy more nutritious meals, and they have seen an improvement in their health. These are just a few stories of how important it is to maintain—and increase—these lifesaving food benefits. Still, as 42 million Americans continue to struggle with hunger and food insecurity, more needs to be done. In preparation for the 2018 farm bill, the House Agriculture Committee has conducted a thorough review of the program. We have held 23 hearings and received testimony from dozens of expert witnesses—both liberal and conservative—who all agree that the program is working. Based on this testimony, we have learned that there is no reason whatsoever to undermine the program through structural changes, block grants, further restrictions, more onerous requirements, or cuts, as some of my House colleagues have proposed. Instead, we should be focused on making the program even better. We need to make sure that anyone who needs modest food assistance benefits has access to them. We need to support and expand innovative programs that help to increase the purchasing power of SNAP, and we need to increase SNAP benefits which currently average a mere $1.40 per person, per meal, in order to provide families on the program with access to more nutritious food that will last them through the month. Mr. Speaker, SNAP works. It is our Nation’s first line of defense against hunger and one of the most important tools we have to help lift our neighbors out of poverty. In the spirit of Senators McGovern and Dole, it is time for Congress to renew their bipartisan commitment to ending hunger in this country once and for all. As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the landmark Food Stamp Act of 1977, I urge my colleagues to join me in strengthening SNAP and working to end hunger now. 
FIRST PRINCIPLES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, on the question of race, we clearly have come a long way in America, but we still have a long way to go. There are some in this country who want to sugarcoat the AfricanAmerican experience in the great United States of America, but the facts are the facts. In this country, the African American community has been forced to endure slavery, rape, kidnapping, lynchings, Jim Crow, segregation, mass incarceration, and a police brutality epidemic that continues to this very day. It was in this context that athletes like Colin Kaepernick bravely chose to kneel down so that others may have the courage to stand up. There are some who have criticized these athletes as unpatriotic, but their actions are uniquely American. Liberty and justice for all is an American value. Equal protection under the law is an American value. Freedom of speech and expression as embedded in the First Amendment is an American value. Yet there is criticism coming even from folks in the White House. I find this ironic because this is the same group of people at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who regularly refuse to criticize Vladimir Putin and defend Russia’s interference with our election, undermining American democracy for the first time in our Nation’s history. How dare you lecture us about what is patriotic. So I just came to the House floor to make it clear to all of the athletes across this great country who have chosen to stand up and confront injustice in our society that there are Members of the United States Congress who have your back. Steph Curry, we have your back. LeBron James, we have your back. Coach Mike Tomlin, we have your back. You stand on the shoulders of giants like Joe Louis, Wilma Rudolph, Jackie Robinson, Jim Brown, Bill Russell, Muhammad Ali, and so many others who throughout the annals of time chose to confront injustice in America to make us a better place. Now you have taken the baton, and, thankfully, you are doing the same exact thing. We should be grateful. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. f 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. FOXX) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Dear Lord, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We come to You as a nation in the midst of significant, imminent transition, even as important disagreements on policy promise vigorous debate in the days to come. As people look for causes and solutions, the temptation is great to seek ideological position. We ask that You might send Your spirit of peace and reconciliation, that instead of ascendency over opponents, the Members of this people’s House and all elected to represent our Nation might work together, humbly, recognizing the best in each other’s hopes to bring stability and direction toward a strong future. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House her approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. PITTENGER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
EXTRAORDINARY MILITARY LEADERSHIP (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I was grateful to participate in a congressional delegation last week to Japan, the Republic of Korea, Guam, and Hawaii. We visited troops on the front line who are defending American families and promoting peace through strength. In the shadow of North Korea’s latest missile launch over Japan, it was reassuring to meet with leadership of the highest competence and integrity. We were inspired by the leadership from Vice Admiral Phil Sawyer, Commander U.S. 7th Fleet; General Vincent Brooks, Commander, U.S. Forces Korea; Lieutenant General Tom Bergeson, Commander, 7th Air Force; Lieutenant General Tom Vandal, Commanding General, 8th Army; Rear Admiral Shoshana Chatfield, Commander, Joint Region Marianas; Lieutenant General Bryan Fenton, Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Command; Admiral Scott Swift, Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet; General Terrence O’Shaughnessy, Commander, Pacific Air Forces; General Robert Brown, Commander, U.S. Army Pacific. The delegation was professionally coordinated by Captain Scott Farr and Lieutenant Commander Victoria Marum. Many thanks to staff Craig Collier and Brian Garrett for accompanying the delegation. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers are with those in Mexico City, Puerto Rico, and all in the path of Hurricane Maria. 
THE MEDIA BIAS BEAT GOES ON (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, the media bias beat goes on. Last week on PBS, columnist Mark Shields criticized Senate sponsors of the new healthcare bill. He said that no Republican Senators have credentials for working on healthcare, and added that Senator CASSIDY got to the Senate a year ago and is not exactly a long term legislator. In two clicks online, Mark Shields could have learned that BILLCASSIDY  and his wife are both doctors who have provided healthcare for people around the world. Those are called credentials. Senator CASSIDY also served in the State senate, three terms in the U.S. House, and is now in his third year in the United States Senate. He is obviously an experienced legislator. Where is the balance? Where is the truth? And the liberal national media wonder why their credibility with the American people is at a record low. f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today during National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. Madam Speaker, our Nation’s veterans are 22 percent more likely to commit suicide than their nonveteran peers. This trend is troubling, and we all must work to reverse it. The Department of Veterans Affairs started a new campaign this month called Be There. The campaign emphasizes small actions, such as calling an old friend, checking on a neighbor, or inviting a colleague to go for a walk. These small gestures may have a real impact on someone who is struggling or feeling alone. Suicide rates are especially high in rural areas, where veterans may experience isolation or limited access to VA care—often for mental health concerns. That is why I introduced the VETS Act, which seeks to build on the VA’s existing telemedicine program. It allows veterans to receive mental healthcare from anywhere. This will give our veterans greater access to the care they so desperately need. Madam Speaker, our servicemen and women answered the call of duty. When they return home, it is our turn to be there for them. 
COMMENDING THE MOSER GROUP AND WINGATE UNIVERSITY ON HURRICANE ASSISTANCE EFFORTS (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PITTENGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of The Moser Group and Wingate University for their extraordinary organizational and grassroots efforts to help victims of Hurricanes Irma in Florida and Harvey in Texas. This week, these two organizations will load two 18wheeler trucks to deliver supplies directly to the affected areas. Commitment to charity and compassion for victims of national disasters is truly what makes America great. In North Carolina, we know all too well about the consequences of hurricanes: 98,000 homes and 19,000 businesses were destroyed by Hurricane Matthew, from which we are still recovering. Organizations like The Moser Group and Wingate University are key to recovery efforts across the country. They are to be commended. Madam Speaker, God bless them as they continue to help people in need. f 
HOW THE FIRST AMENDMENT WORKS (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. TROTT. Madam Speaker, over the weekend, I spent a little time watching football. I am happy to say that my Michigan Wolverines won their game; sad to say that the Detroit Lions lost to the Falcons, but, hopefully, they will have a good season. There was also quite a bit of controversy this weekend about who was standing and sitting for our National Anthem at sporting events. We do not need to concern ourselves with this issue, and the reason is because the First Amendment works. Here is how the First Amendment works: A little over a year ago, a quarterback in the NFL chose not to stand for the National Anthem. I personally disagree with that statement, but it was his choice under the First Amendment. The fans booed. The fans could have clapped; they could have booed. Many fans booed. The owners listened, and now that quarterback is not employed in the NFL. That is how the First Amendment works. What we should concern ourselves with is how soon 3 million people in Puerto Rico are going to get water and electricity, why millions of Americans are uncertain regarding their healthcare, and what we are going to do about North Korea. Madam Speaker, that is what we need to focus on in this House. That is what we were sent to do. 
b1504 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. BARTON ) at 3 o’clock and 4 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. First, I thank our chairman, who always conducts himself in such a bipartisan fashion. I thank him for including everyone and thank him for the work that he does. I also thank the bill’s author, our former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. ROSLEHTINEN from Florida. I am pleased to join her as the Democratic cosponsor of this legislation. She authored an earlier version of this bill, which is a testament to how long she has been working to shine a light on the daily horror of so many living in North Korea and to bring American leadership to bear, to ease their suffering. We have been focused on North Korea a great deal lately because of the Kim regime’s increasingly provocative behavior and our own administration’s inconsistent and irresponsible rhetoric. North Korea poses a great threat to our national security and the security of our friends and allies. We need a smart, coherent approach that combines diplomacy, pressure, and deterrence to halt North Korea’s progress in developing nuclear weapons. At the same time, we cannot lose sight over what the North Korean people are enduring. This is a country where people don’t have rights, and anyone who dares speak his or her mind may find themselves subjected to beatings, torture, brutal imprisonment, or even death. The United States Commission of Inquiry found that Kim Jongun’s regime is very likely committing crimes against humanity. Mr. Speaker, I visited North Korea twice. When I was there with a few of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, our North Korean minders were very careful to make sure we only saw what we were supposed to see. b1515 But we could sense that beneath the surface, something was terribly, terribly wrong. First of all, they wouldn’t let us go out of Pyongyang; that just out of sight, it was amazing that there were so many people living under the most brutal conditions imaginable and that no one dared shatter the illusion that the North Korean authorities had just created. When you go into North Korea, it feels like you are stepping back into 1953 Berlin. Everything was gray and dark and drab, and you could just see something was wrong. We know better. We have seen year after year of disturbing reports and stories from defectors who have told us exactly what life is like for most North Koreans, and we haven’t forgotten them. The law that we are reauthorizing today first became law in 2004. This legislation will preserve funding for American assistance to North Korean refugees, for humanitarian assistance inside the country, as well as information efforts by our government, and to try every means possible to get the message out to regular North Korean people that we are not their enemy. I will say that I am greatly concerned that the latest iteration of the President’s travel ban, which now includes North Korea, sends exactly the wrong message to defectors from that country. By closing our door to them, we reinforce the paranoia that the regime perpetrates. We have to be careful not to get caught in the middle of that. An earlier version of this law created a senior State Department position to focus on human rights in North Korea. It is a big job, Mr. Speaker, and in recent years, there has been someone to do this important work full time, but it has been reported that the administration plans to combine this position with the Under Secretary for Democracy. I think that would be a mistake. The Under Secretary position already oversees the bureaus and offices that deal with a huge range of issues from counterterrorism, to refugees, to narcotics, to human trafficking. It is a pretty full agenda, yet the administration on the one hand says North Korean human rights should be combined with that job, and on the other hand has not yet nominated anyone to fill the position. So I think there is a lot of work to be done on both sides, and that is what we are doing on the Foreign Affairs Committee. We are working together. This reauthorization reaffirms Congress’ view that we should have a senior fulltime diplomat dealing with North Korean human rights. I ask that this provision be included once again. I am grateful to Chairman ROYCE and Chairman Emeritus ROSLEHTINEN that Congress will continue to speak out on the importance of this role. It is also my view that we need to stop neglecting our diplomacy and get these positions filled. We cannot expect the State Department to deal with these challenges—whether North Korea’s nuclear program or North Korea’s human rights record—without leadership in place, but I am glad that Congress is continuing to do its job in helping to promote human rights for the North Koreans. I am, again, grateful to my friend from Florida and the chairman. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Among a number of amendments that he has contributed to this bill, there is one in particular that I think is very important, and that is increasing the number of tools that can be used here, to include new technologies to North Korea, like USB drives. It is a lot easier for people to watch on USB drives as well as, of course, mobile phones and DVDs. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2061, the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2017. I commend Chairman Emeritus ROS LEHTINEN for leading this reauthorization effort, and Chairman ROYCE and my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee for their support of this legislation. The horrific human rights abuses committed by Kim Jongun are an integral part of his power structure. Countering these unspeakable crimes, however we can, is both a moral imperative and a sound strategy. As amended, H.R. 2061 includes my Distribution and Promotion of Rights and Knowledge Act, which will improve U.S. efforts to broadcast outside information into North Korea, weakening Kim Jongun’s regime by eroding his stranglehold on information. It will provide light to the North Koreans; not just light to read by, but shine light on those innate basic beliefs of liberty and freedom. Specifically, this language updates the means in which information can be disseminated, helping to find new ways to end the Kim regime’s monopoly on information. The two bills are natural partners and, together, they can meaningfully advance human rights and free flow of information in North Korea. Mr. Speaker, I again thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the Kim regime poses a grave threat to global security, and it is critical that the United States move ahead with a coherent strategy to help meet this challenge. At the same time, the Kim regime’s treatment of its own people represents one of the worst human rights situations in the entire world. We cannot lose sight of that human suffering that is going on every day. For years, the United States has made it a priority to do what we can to help those living under this brutal dictatorship and to assist those who have escaped it. This legislation will ensure that the United States continues this important work in the years ahead. I want to say that Chairman ROYCE  has made it a mark of his to travel the region, to speak with South Korea, to speak with the leaders in Asia. I am pleased that we are well represented when he goes there and lets the regimes know that we in Congress have a lot of things to say and that we want to stand by our allies and let North 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Congressman JOAQUIN CASTRO and Congresswoman ANNWAGNER for introducing this timely measure. This is an important but, frankly, often overlooked part of the world. This is Southeast Asia. Mr. Speaker, Southeast Asian nations came together 50 years ago to promote regional cooperation. Their goal was to achieve greater stability and peace and prosperity by creating the Association of South East Asian Nations. We know this as ASEAN today. This year marks their 50th anniversary and the 40th anniversary of relations between the United States and ASEAN. This year, President Trump will visit the region for the first time in November for the East Asia and ASEAN summits in the Philippines, and the local leadership are going to be meeting in Vietnam. Today, ASEAN is a force for peace and prosperity in the world, and the relationship the U.S. has with ASEAN has benefited both sides diplomatically, economically, and in global security. ASEAN is the fourth largest goods export market for the United States, and we are ASEAN’s fourth largest trading partner. As the second fastest growing economy in Asia, with a combined economy of $2.5 trillion, the importance of the ASEAN market for the United States is considerable. Mr. Speaker, we are working with ASEAN to address security challenges and threats, especially in the fight against terrorism, with the recognition now of the emergence of ISIS fighting forces in the region. Last month, Secretary of State Tillerson voiced support for increased cooperation on border security, information sharing to track individuals, and routing out and finding the source of terror financing networks, finding their safe havens. With so many challenges in the region today, as we look at the democratic backsliding in Cambodia, the plight of the Rohingya in Burma, it is more important than ever that we engage Southeast Asian nations in the ASEAN grouping to solve regional problems. We must also cooperate with ASEAN on the threat of North Korea and have better coordination on maritime activities with regard to security, environmental impact, and border and fishing regulations. For all of these reasons today, the House of Representatives reaffirms the importance of the U.S.ASEAN partnership and recommits to continuing engagement and cooperation. Passage of this resolution demonstrates our support for ASEAN as an institution and the United States’ strategic relationship with Southeast Asian nations. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1530 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking the authors of this resolution, two valued members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. CASTRO from Texas and Mrs. WAGNER from Missouri. In addition to bringing this legislation forward, these two lawmakers established the first ever Congressional ASEAN Caucus. I am grateful for their leadership helping to advance American interests in the Asia Pacific. Part of ensuring America’s strong role in that region is our work with ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations. This organization has worked to promote stability, prosperity, and peace among the countries of Southeast Asia. It is in our own strategic interest to see stronger countries, closer partnership, healthier economies, so our own success in Asia is closely tied to the success of ASEAN and its members. This resolution underscores the accomplishments of ASEAN as it marks its 50th anniversary. It sends a signal to our partners and friends in Southeast Asia that the United States is committed to peace and prosperity in the region, and it puts Congress on record saying that, in this challenging time, the United States must remain engaged around the world, particularly in the Asia Pacific. The administration’s budget proposed a 46 percent cut to assistance in East Asia and the Pacific. I think this would be a grave mistake. What kind of impact would that have on American backed initiatives that are having a positive impact? What message does it send to the countries that we depend on as partners? Rather than drawing back, America should be even more engaged in the Asia Pacific. This measure reaffirms our commitment to America’s leadership in the region. I want to end by thanking the authors, and I want to compliment Chairman ROYCE , who knows more about this region of the world than virtually anybody in Congress, and has been to that part of the world—I have gone with him many times—and the United States Congress has shown the ability to work with countries for the betterment of their people, for the betterment of our relationship with them. Mr. Speaker, this measure reaffirms our commitment to America’s leadership in the region. I thank the authors, I thank Chairman ROYCE , and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ), an esteemed member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the primary cosponsor of this resolution. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership and support. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 311, the resolution I was honored to introduce with my colleague Representative CASTRO , to commemorate the Association of South East Asian Nations’ 50th anniversary, and the 40th anniversary of U.S.ASEAN relations. We intend for this resolution to raise awareness within and outside of Congress about Southeast Asia’s critical role in the global order. Southeast Asia has tremendous cultural, political, historical, and religious diversity. The Association of South East Asian Nations, known as ASEAN, was formed in 1967, in part, to create a bulwark against communism in the region among the five founding nations. Today, ASEAN’s goals have evolved, and the region is experiencing tremendous growth. ASEAN now includes 10 major countries in Southeast Asia, which together have established a major regional economic integration agenda. ASEAN is our fourth largest goods exports market. $102 billion of U.S. goods and services are exported to ASEAN, meaning this market rivals our $113 billion market in China. According to the ASEAN Matters for America report, 20 U.S. States send over $1 billion in goods exports to ASEAN annually, and over half of the U.S. congressional districts export over $100 million to ASEAN each year. These numbers are astounding, and they will only grow, Mr. Speaker. In January, I cofounded the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on ASEAN, along with my partner Representative CASTRO . The caucus acknowledges America’s strategic partnership with ASEAN and attests that America must be the foremost trade and defense partner for ASEAN countries. H. Res. 311 was one of the caucus’ first initiatives. The resolution encourages the enhancement of economic and defense cooperation with ASEAN. It reaffirms the U.S. commitment to continue joint efforts with ASEAN to halt human smuggling and human trafficking and urges ASEAN to improve assistance to refugees and migrants. Standing alongside our ASEAN peers is important this fall, given the rise of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea; the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims in Burma; the need to seriously engage ASEAN leaders on our North Korean efforts; the typhoon and flooding affecting the region; the enormous investment opportunities; and 
the upcoming ASEAN summit that the President will attend in November. I am grateful that the Speaker and the chairman, Chairman ROYCE , support our efforts to engage ASEAN, and I look forward to watching H. Res. 311 pass the U.S. House of Representatives. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO ), who is the author of this legislation. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member ENGEL for yielding me this time and also thank Chairman ROYCE for all of his work in this region of the world. Representative WAGNER and I cofounded the Congressional Caucus on ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, earlier this year to deepen the United States’ and Congress’ engagement with Southeast Asia. H. Res. 311, the resolution we are considering here today, commemorates the 50th anniversary of the founding of ASEAN. It also marks 40 years of relations between the United States and ASEAN. This measure highlights the work ASEAN has done towards improving stability, prosperity, and peace in Southeast Asia. It also speaks to the importance of continued security cooperation, economic partnership, and cultural engagement between the United States and ASEAN. ASEAN serves as an example of successful regional cooperation. The nations of Southeast Asia, despite distinct histories, cultures, and religions, have placed their faith in cooperation rather than conflict. U.S. security interests in Southeast Asia are wideranging and supported by many regional partners. Members of ASEAN have worked closely with the United States to address our mutual concerns. The member states of ASEAN also hold significant economic promise, and our economic relationship underpins much of U.S. engagement in the region. My home State of Texas, for example, exports over $13 billion worth of goods to ASEAN countries every year. These exports support over 70,000 Texas jobs and over 500,000 jobs across the United States. The U.S.ASEAN relationship is also built on history and cultural exchange. Millions of Americans can trace their family roots to countries of ASEAN, including 400,000 Texans. Language, literature, food, and music link our cultures across the ocean, set roots, and enrich both our societies. Mr. Speaker, for these reasons and many more, it is important that we recognize and commemorate the impact of ASEAN across the years. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I also want to echo Chairman ROYCE ’s support of H. Res. 311, and I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. ENGEL ; my colleagues, Mr. CASTRO and Mrs. W AGNER , for bringing this resolution up, recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Association of South East Asian Nations and the 40th anniversary of U.S. ASEAN ties. As chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, the block of 10 ASEAN members, we had a meeting earlier in the year. They said the primary reason ASEAN is successful is because of U.S. involvement. I think that speaks highly of U.S. foreign policy. The 10 members of ASEAN are some of the most dynamic nations in the world, and Southeast Asia’s economic and strategic importance grows every day. As the chairman noted, ASEAN is our fourth largest trading partner and is the second fastest growing in Asia. With a combined population of over 600 million people and an economy of $2.5 trillion, the opportunity for U.S. industry is immense. As a security partner, ASEAN also is invaluable, recognizing that for the 50 years the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, has worked towards stability, prosperity, and peace in Southeast Asia. The grouping is strategically located astride some of the world’s most critical sea lanes and shares the U.S. pursuit of regional stability through rules, order, and peaceful dispute settlements. This resolution rightly highlights enduring U.S. interests in Southeast Asia and conveys our commitment to stay engaged. Mr. Speaker, I again thank Representatives Wagner and Castro for introducing this measure. As the founding members of the ASEAN Caucus, their work on this bill underscores the centrality of ASEAN to Congress’ foreign policy for Asia. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. The Asia Pacific presents the perfect case of what might happen if the United States withdraws from the world. In recent years, our focus there, especially working with ASEAN and its members, has really helped to promote growth and stability in that region of the world, to enhance human rights, and the rule of law. It is important for us to stay engaged. If we draw back, it is pretty clear that China would be happy to fill the void, and I guarantee the values we consider critical to foreign policy, democracy, justice, and equality would not be part of the agenda in Beijing. We need to stay engaged in Asia and around the world. We need to demonstrate that American leadership is a sure thing. The resolution before us today will provide much needed reassurance to our partners and friends in Southeast Asia. Even Vietnam works with us. I remember, and others here remember, when we had the Vietnam war. Now we have so many Vietnam Americans in our country, and they help to really be good citizens and really help to show why it is important for us to keep engaged in that part of the world. We will underscore the important role ASEAN stands to play, just as it has in the last 50 years. Again, it is important to reassure our partners and friends in Southeast Asia—I mentioned Vietnam, but all the other countries that belong to ASEAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this measure. I thank Chairman ROYCE , I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. The first point I would make is I think our ranking member, Mr. ELIOT ENGEL , makes a very strong point about the importance of engagement. I think, as a second point, U.S. ASEAN engagement has trended up in recent years. I think it remains strong. I think it has a bright outlook. In 2015, the U.S.ASEAN relationship was elevated to a strategic partnership, an important step by the U.S. 2016 marked two important firsts: the first U.S.ASEAN summit at Sunnylands, and the first ever visit of a sitting U.S. President to Laos. As an important economic and security partner, ASEAN shares the U.S. pursuit of regional stability through rules, through order, through the peaceful dispute settlement process, as our ranking member pointed out. This resolution signals our resolve to maintain and deepen our collaboration with our friends and allies in Southeast Asia. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues here to join us in support of this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 311, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1545 WOMEN, PEACE, AND SECURITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1141) to ensure that the United States promotes the meaningful participation of women in mediation and negotiation processes seeking to prevent, mitigate, or resolve violent conflict. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1141 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1141. Now, this is the Women, Peace, and Security Act. This is the Senate companion to the bill H.R. 2484 that the House passed earlier this session. That bill was authored by Representatives KRISTI NOEM and J ANSCHAKOWSKY , and I want to thank them; and I, of course, want to thank, also, Ranking Member ENGEL . I want to thank them collectively for their leadership on this important issue. I also want to thank Senators CORKER , CARDIN , SHAHEEN , and C APITO  for working so well with us in the Senate. I want to thank our assistant staff director, Jessica Kelch. I want to thank her for her essential work on this important legislation. I am happy to say that, with House passage today, this legislation will go to the President’s desk. As I noted when this bill passed the House in June, this moment is really a culmination of years of bipartisan work by Members of Congress, including JANSCHAKOWSKY and K RISTI NOEM. It is also the work of prior and current administration officials and the many advocates who want to see better, more sustainable solutions to ending wars, to combating terrorism, and to improving human rights around the world. What we are saying today is that women’s participation is essential to confronting these fundamental challenges. Last Congress, the Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing, part of its series of women in foreign affairs, where we heard powerful testimony about the importance of including women in the peace processes around the world. It is an obvious point that many are aware of that, without the participation of women, peace would not have come to Northern Ireland in those discussions nor would the peace have held. So now it may seem obvious that women should have an opportunity to represent their communities as a matter of right; they make up half the population. And what negotiation or agreement can claim to represent women if their very participation is barred? But our hearing also emphasized why women’s participation in the peace processes is important if we care about the likelihood of the success of that process. Simply put, when women are at the negotiation table, peace is more likely. Compelling research shows that peace agreements are likely to be reached and are likely to last when women’s groups are meaningfully involved. Women peacemakers often press warring parties to move beyond mere powersharing agreements, which benefit only a small percentage of fighters, to more comprehensive and longer term accords, which benefit the civilian population as a whole, which benefits the next generation of that country. We have seen this play out. We saw it play out, as I said, in Northern Ireland. We saw it play out in Colombia; we saw it in Rwanda; we saw it in Sri Lanka, where women’s groups have pushed for practical solutions to deescalate and resolve the conflict. In fact, later today, I will be speaking with Liberia’s President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, whom I am proud to call a friend of many, many years. Of course, President Sirleaf and the women of Liberia represent what can be accomplished when women become involved in ending conflict. After many failed attempts by politicians, combatants, and the international community, it was the women of Liberia who forged an end to one of West Africa’s longest running and most brutal conflicts. We must learn from history. Efforts to ‘‘keep the peace’’ through policing and peacekeeping missions also benefit from women’s participation, which leads to better crime reporting and higher levels of trust within the communities they serve. And women are essential to confronting one of the greatest national security threats of our time: the spread of violent extremism around the world. When we look at who confronts jihadists and who teaches their children—if they have access to education, they can teach their children—women are truly on the front lines of this fight. They often possess unique insights into their families and communities and are capable of gathering information that men cannot, yet their input is frequently overlooked. We must acknowledge women as partners in this fight, and that is why the legislation before us today recognizes that it is in our national interest to promote women’s participation in resolving violence and conflict. This concept has been building support for some time: the Bush administration pressed hard for women’s participation in peace negotiations and the political process in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and elsewhere; the Obama administration expanded on these programs to require a governmentwide approach to women’s inclusion in conflict resolution overseas; and the current administration has said that the State Department’s Office of Global Women’s Issues will continue to focus on these issues. I am eager to see an Ambassador nominated to lead that office. The bipartisan legislation before us today builds on these efforts. It will continue to require a governmentwide strategy to promote women’s participation, along with specific goals and benchmarks and reporting to Congress in order to gauge progress. And it also requires that appropriate State, USAID, and Defense Department personnel receive training in how to facilitate women’s participation in conflict resolution, security initiatives, and efforts to protect civilians from violence and from exploitation. I urge all Members to support passage today, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of this measure, and I am glad we are taking up this bill from our colleagues in the other body, Senators SHAHEEN and C APITO, and I want to thank our colleagues who have worked so hard on the House version of this bill, Representatives JANSCHAKOWSKY and Representative NOEM. JANSCHAKOWSKY has brought forward a version of this bill for the last few Congresses. The House passed a version of this bill last year, and I am glad we are finally moving a version of it forward. 
One of the hallmarks of the Obama administration foreign policy was the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security. It was based on a wealth of research that showed very clearly, as the chairman said, getting women involved in conflict prevention and resolution leads to more successful outcomes. Since the launch of this plan, the United States has promoted efforts to enhance the physical and economic security of women around the world. We have sought to break through the barriers that have stopped women from being full participants in peace processes. This bill would make these policies permanent. It would build on the Obama administration’s achievements, making sure State Department, USAID, and Pentagon personnel fully understand just how important it is to get women involved in conflict prevention and resolution. It would also require annual reporting so Congress can stay apprised of these efforts. Now, we have been working a few years to get this legislation across the finish line, and, frankly, I don’t think we can wait another moment. The administration’s budget proposal would slash funding for diplomacy and development to dangerous levels, and a current redesign effort at the State Department might strip out initiatives like Women, Peace, and Security. I hope that won’t happen. I got assurances today that that won’t happen. I hope that is right, but we have to still fight for this. Congress has a role to play in foreign policy and, by passing this bill, it will be clear that we support efforts to expand opportunity and participation for women around the world. I am pleased to support this measure. As always, Chairman ROYCE has been a bulwark of helping to push this through. I thank the Members who have worked so hard on it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ), a leader on this legislation. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member ENGEL  for yielding to me, and I rise in strong support of the Women, Peace, and Security Act. I first want to thank my Republican colead on this bill, KRISTI NOEM, for her hard work; and I want to express my gratitude to Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their robust support for this legislation. I want to thank Senator SHAHEEN  and Senator CAPITO for their work in the Senate on this, as well as Senators CORKER and C ARDIN . I want to thank the staff who has put in a lot of hours on this, last session and this session, including my staff, Cassandra Varanka. Around the world, women are disproportionately affected by conflict and violence. At the same time, women are acting as some of the most effective advocates for peace. Again and again, women have proven their ability to advance peacemaking efforts where others have failed. Look at Syria. In the town of Zabadani, women have been leading efforts to save their city from violence. Over 470 women signed a public petition, calling for a ceasefire. Their town had been under siege, experiencing daily shelling and barrel bombings. As the formal negotiations between the rebelcontrolled local council and the Assad government constantly broke down, the war prevented the town from planting crops. A group of women peace activists came together to found a group called Damma, and they facilitated negotiations between the local council, the Free Syrian Army, and the Islamic brigades. Where the traditional actors had failed, these women moved through five rounds of negotiations, ultimately achieving a ceasefire. Now, the cease fire only lasted 40 days, but those 40 days gave the town critical time to plant crops and address its food shortage. The power of women to advance peace and aid in postconflict reconciliation is not limited to Syria. Women in Liberia played a crucial role in bringing warring parties to the negotiating table, as the chairman said. When the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front signed a major peace agreement in 2004, women made up 50 percent of the government’s negotiating team and 25 percent of the signatories. In Ireland, women helped ensure that the Good Friday Agreement included social issues, reconciliation measures, and compensation for victims of violence. Women around the world are actively working to advance peace talks and ensure successful transformation from conflict to peace. Passing the Women, Peace, and Security Act will ensure that the United States actively supports these incredible women as we work toward ending conflict around the world. When women are involved in the negotiations, peace is more likely to last. In fact, the International Peace Institute found that, with each 5 percent increase in women’s participation in the political process, a nation is five times less likely to use violence when faced with international crisis or conflict. Despite the strong evidence in favor of women’s political participation, women remain underrepresented in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and postconflict peace building efforts around the world. We need to change that. This legislation establishes women’s participation as a critical element of U.S. foreign policy. It would encourage the United States to assist women mediators and negotiators by addressing barriers to their equal and secure participation in peace processes. b1600 It would institute comprehensive training modules on the protection, rights, and specific needs of women in conflict, and require the administration to evaluate the impact of U.S. foreign assistance on women’s meaningful participation. In addition, the Women, Peace, and Security Act would require the administration to report to Congress its strategy to promote women’s participation in conflict prevention and resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of New York). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. It would empower Congress to exercise oversight of that strategy’s implementation. As countries around the world are struggling with conflict, the United States should be empowering anyone and everyone who can help achieve lasting peace. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the Women, Peace, and Security Act. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will close now since there are no further speakers on either side. I want to start again by thanking Chairman EDROYCE for all of his work and for all of his collaboration working together with us; as well as Representatives SCHAKOWSKY and N OEM, who worked very closely together, for their really hard work and really good work. Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons I always support a strong investment in development and diplomacy is that we get such a good bang for our buck. Diplomacy and development efforts help to build stability. They defuse crises, they prevent conflicts, they help lay the groundwork for a more secure and more prosperous world. History and research have shown us that when women are involved in these processes, they work even better. So it is smart policy. It is not a matter of being condescending. It is a matter of smart policy. Think about the alternatives, about when we don’t have diplomacy to help spread peace. Conflicts grow into wars—sometimes wars that American men and women will be required to fight. Populations are driven from their homes, triggering humanitarian crises. And the cost of dealing with these problems down the road is far higher than the cost of investing in diplomacy and development right now. So this legislation is a piece of that puzzle. It isn’t the whole thing, but it is an important piece. It is an important part of making sure American diplomacy can succeed, and I am glad to support it. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. I thank Chairman ROYCE for his hard 
work, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, whether we are talking about Liberia, or Northern Ireland, or anywhere else where this world is in conflict, we have watched women play pivotal roles in advocating before governments, or before combatants, or in front of politicians, to bring an end to conflict. In recent years, we have seen armed conflicts flare around the world, producing the largest number of refugees that we have ever seen on record. Efforts to negotiate an end to these conflicts are more important than they have ever been. We know that when women are included in these discussions, we are more likely to see an enduring peace as a result. As a witness at our hearing on women’s participation explained to us, including women is not only the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. The legislation before us today will strengthen U.S. efforts to promote the inclusion of women in peace negotiations in order to create more sustainable agreements and more stable partners for the United States and for our allies. Again, I want to thank Representatives NOEM and S CHAKOWSKY and the bill’s Senate sponsors for their bipartisan work on this measure; and, as always, Ranking Member ENGEL , for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1141. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NAISMITH MEMORIAL BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1235) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in recognition of the 60th Anniversary of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1235 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GONZALEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1235, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act. Basketball was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Dr. James Naismith in 1891. I have the privilege of representing the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, home of the University of Kentucky Wildcats. We affectionately know the University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball team as the greatest tradition in the history of college basketball; the winningest program in college basketball; eight national championships; and, of course, the greatest fans in the history of college basketball. We call them the Big Blue Nation. While it may be to the surprise of many that a Kansas Jayhawk and not a Kentucky Wildcat invented the game, there is no doubt that this sport has helped many Americans learn the value of teamwork, sacrifice, and hard work. Today, by some estimates, basketball is considered the fastestgrowing sport in the world. With current megastars like LeBron James, Steph Curry, Candace Parker, and Brittney Griner, we don’t have to wonder why we are in the Golden Age of basketball again. And while the sport is wildly successful today with rising stars like former Kentucky players John Wall, Anthony Davis, Devin Booker, and KarlAnthony Towns, the future is in good hands. I could talk all day about the upcoming NCAA basketball season, but instead I want to turn my attention to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Established in 1959, the Basketball Hall of Fame has honored players, coaches, referees, and other basketball icons for their contributions to this great American sport. From Larry Bird, Bob Cousy, Charles Barkley, Bill Russell, Jerry West, Patrick Ewing, Oscar Robertson, Pete Maravich, Bill Walton, Yao Ming, Shaq, TMac, A.I., the Millers, Swoopes, Coach Summitt, Coach Calipari, Magic Johnson, Dr. J., Wilt Chamberlain, Coach Adolph Rupp, Coach John Wooden, to Coach Dean Smith, the Basketball Hall of Fame allows fans, young and old, to reminisce or even discover the rich history of the game they love. To the basketball lore of Chamberlain scoring 100 points in a single game, to the athletic heroics of Michael Jordan, to Lisa Leslie’s dunk, to the UConn Ladies’ streak of 111 wins, to Curry and company revolutionizing the game with a constant barrage of 3 pointers, the Basketball Hall of Fame is helping fans relive the greatest moments in basketball history while teaching important life lessons to youngsters through educational programs. To honor 60 years of excellence in 2020 by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, it is with great pleasure that I am on the House floor today encouraging my colleagues to support the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act. This legislation requires the U.S. Mint to produce commemorative coins for fans to collect and enjoy in celebration of this momentous occasion, in denominations of $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and halfdollar clad coins. Importantly, these coins would be produced at no cost to the taxpayer, and surcharges on the sale of these coins would go to support programs at the Hall of Fame after raising matching funds from the private sector. I especially want to thank Congressman RICHARD NEAL from Massachusetts, home to the Springfield location of the Hall of Fame; and Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY from California, for their hard work on this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation honoring this great American sport. Go Cats, go Big Blue. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 1235, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act. First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to read into the RECORD a letter written by president and CEO of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, John L. Doleva, in support of what we are doing here today. He says: 
To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019, the House of Representatives has introduced a bill to mint an exclusive commemorative coin. The bill is sponsored by Congressman Richard E. Neal and Thomas Rooney. Senators Elizabeth Warren and John McCain support the venture by sponsoring the same legislation in the Senate, S. 2598. I am respectfully requesting your support and cosponsorship of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act. This endeavor and legislation is of deep interest to me because of my professional career—primarily the last 16 years—has been fully embedded in promoting basketball through my passion for the game as president and CEO of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. It has been an honor to help the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame provide a home for the greatness of the game’s past, its exciting present day and brilliant future that continues to touch all parts of the globe. The game’s immortals, through their stories and achievements, are contained here through their legacy as players, coaches, teams, officials, and legendary contributors to the game. More than 6 million visitors have educated themselves through the enjoyment of exploring the rich history. My passion for this sport is not solely rooted in the game itself or its traditions, but, rather, my love for basketball centers on its ability to develop character. One example is the outreach of the Hall of Fame’s MVP’s of Character program, an initiative that has involved thousands of youth in the cities across the country, like New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Lawrence, Kansas. The program centers on the belief that ‘‘teaching youth about good character—both on and off the court—helps them understand the impact of it and their lives . . . character traits like honesty, respect, responsibility, integrity and cooperation create a foundation for success.’’ Support of Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin bill has no taxpayer cost, is your opportunity to help grow the game of basketball and the educational and outreach programs provided by the Basketball Hall of Fame. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1235, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act, a bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue a commemorative coin in honor of the 60th anniversary of the Naismith 
Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, located in the birthplace of basketball. b1615 Located in the ‘‘birthplace of basketball,’’ the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is entrusted with recording and disseminating the history of this great American pastime and recognizing and honoring the achievements of the sport’s greatest players, coaches, and contributors. With the ability to reach millions of Americans through its educational programs, events, exhibits, and online presence, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame plays an important role in celebrating and promoting the positive core values demonstrated by basketball’s heroes, who have inspired Americans from all quarters. Passage of the legislation also provides an opportunity to highlight the creative ways in which the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame has leveraged America’s love of the game and to develop basketballrelated educational programs that teach our youth about a wide range of topics, such as financial literacy, math, civil rights, leadership of character, women’s and men’s history, and geography. In addition to raising awareness of its important work and honoring its 60th anniversary, surcharges associated with the sale of the unique basketball themed coins provided for in the bill will also enable the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to increase its operations and educational programming, all at no cost to taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, basketball is one of the games that unites all Americans across party lines, across racial lines, and across geographic lines. That is who we are. The bipartisan legislation before us already has the support of more than twothirds of the House, and I hope all Members will join me in supporting this bill to honor and support the important work of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Mr. Speaker, I will read into the RECORD a letter from Kareem Abdul Jabbar to the House of Representatives: ‘‘After 20 years as a player in the National Basketball Association with the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers, which included winning six NBA Championships as well as an equal number of Most Valuable Player awards, I had the honor to be inducted in 1995 into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. ‘‘To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Congressmen RICHARD E. NEAL, ANDY BARR, and M IKEKELLY  have sponsored legislation to authorize the U.S. Mint to issue limitededition commemorative coins for sale to the public in 2019. Proceeds from the coins’ sale will go to help continue the impressive archival and educational efforts of the Basketball Hall of Fame for years to come, all at no cost to the taxpayer. ‘‘The Basketball Hall of Fame preserves the history of the game and celebrates the very best of the sport at all the levels it is played. The museum in Springfield, Massachusetts, honors women and men players who have achieved greatness, exemplary coaches, referees, and other major contributors to the sport. It attracts 6 million visitors a year, who see hundreds of thousands of historic artifacts and memorabilia spanning the past 125 years of basketball. ‘‘As a Hall of Famer, I am very passionate about the work they do to not only preserve and honor, but also grow the game of basketball. It is because of this I am respectfully requesting your support and cosponsorship of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act, H.R. 1235.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Texas and, as I said before, the gentleman from Massachusetts for their advocacy of this bipartisan piece of legislation, again, honoring a great American tradition: the great sport of basketball. Whether at the high school level, the collegiate level, or the professional level, it is true—the gentleman from Texas is absolutely right—this great sport unites our country. There is friendly competition—sometimes vigorous competition—in the rivalries that we see, whether it is Kentucky playing Louisville or North Carolina versus Duke, or if it is the Lakers and the Celtics from the 1980s or the Pistons and the Bulls in those great games in the 1990s. There are a lot of people behind this legislation that deserve thanks and appreciation. I want to thank, in particular, Jim Host, who is credited for coining the phrase the ‘‘Final Four,’’ and Coach Calipari of the University of Kentucky, who has been a tireless champion of this effort. Without his leadership, I don’t think this would have happened. I want to also thank all of the members of the Hall of Fame who have come to Washington to talk to us. Jay Bilas came down here in the Ways and Means Committee and talked about the importance of this, and many of the other former players. I have to thank the players because the Hall of Fame recognizes their amazing skills and their talents, and if it weren’t for their advocacy, this wouldn’t have happened as well. Finally and probably most important of all, the Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act that we are enacting here today is in honor of the fans who make this great sport possible, the American people who have fallen in love with this great American sport. We have to thank the fans for creating such excitement. Whether it is the McDonald’s All American Basketball Game at the high school level, or if it is the Final Four in the national title in the NCAA in both men’s and women’s basketball, or if it is Game 7 of the NBA Finals, there is nothing more electric than this sport at crunch time. Again, I urge my colleagues to come together and support the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1235, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
THE AMERICAN LEGION 100TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2519) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative coins in recognition of the 100th anniversary of The American Legion, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2519 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as ‘‘The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GONZALEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2519, The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, which would require the Department of the Treasury to mint and issue commemorative coins in recognition and celebration of the 100th anniversary of The American Legion. For nearly 100 years, The American Legion, which was formed for veterans and by veterans, through the support of Congress, has helped to provide services to wartime veterans and the communities in which they live across the United States and the globe. On March 27, 1919, Theodore Roosevelt sent a telegram to Mr. William Marshall Bullitt of Louisville, Kentucky, and many more respected military wartime veteran leaders across the country which announced: ‘‘A conference will be held at St. Louis about May 1 for the purpose of organizing an association composed of those who 
have been in the land and naval forces of the United States in this war. A convention held in France has already organized forces there in an association called The American Legion and will have its representatives at this convention.’’ Shortly after this first national gathering of unified veterans held in St. Louis, Missouri, the United States Congress officially chartered The American Legion on September 16, 1919. Since this charter, The American Legion has grown to be one of the most influential, nonpartisan, nonprofit, and the largest veterans service organization in the United States, with a standing membership of over 2.4 million veterans in 14,000 posts worldwide. The Legion annually raises millions of dollars in donations at the local, State, and national levels to help veterans and their families during times of need and to provide college scholarships and other opportunities for deserving students. Even in the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, which I proudly represent, The American Legion continues to be a strong and aggressive advocate for wartime veterancentered issues. Just yesterday, I met with many of The American Legion Nicholasville Post veterans right there serving and honoring the Gold Star families at Camp Nelson in Jessamine County, Kentucky. The American Legion Department of Kentucky has established 139 posts, 3 areas, and 11 districts in our Commonwealth of 120 counties. The American Legion continues to strive to achieve what has always been held as a sacred duty to every good American since General George Washington’s vision to promote the importance of providing provisions for the adequate care for war disabled veterans and their families. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 2519, legislation that calls for the issuance of a commemorative coin in honor of the 100th anniversary of The American Legion, a distinguished organization that works tirelessly in communities across the Nation to serve our veterans and those still in the Armed Forces. Since being chartered by Congress following the First World War, The American Legion has played a pivotal role in the lives of so many servicemembers and their families, always stepping up and lending a hand to those who need it most. For example, The American Legion provides key services, such as healthcare claims assistance for veterans and job fairs. They support targeted efforts to meet the needs of homeless veterans. The American Legion also supports military personnel and their families through the provision of financial assistance and comfort items for hospitalized veterans and, also, dedicated funds to support the needs of youth at risk. Over its history, The American Legion has also advocated and played a leading role in securing the passage of key laws that better the lives of our servicemembers, such as the landmark GI Bill, as well as the Veterans’ Reassurance Act and the Post911 Veteran Education Assistance Act. In addition to honoring and raising awareness of the important work of The American Legion, the legislation before us will also help raise small sums that will help it carry out its tremendous work and advance American values. Specifically, surcharge proceeds raised through the sale of the coin provided in this bill will allow The American Legion to advance the interests of those who have served in uniform and ensure they receive the proper healthcare and disability benefits earned through military service; promote the importance of and caring for those who are still serving in the Armed Forces; promote the patriotic values, morals, culture, and citizenship of the United States; and provide support for atrisk children and activities that nurture their development. This overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation has the support of more than 350 Members of the House and has already received the unanimous support of the United States Senate, where the legislation passed by voice vote. For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in the passage of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL). Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 1235, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act, which I introduced along with my colleague from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). People in Kentucky think that they invented basketball. It was actually invented in Massachusetts. But I want to thank him personally, as well as professionally, for the good work that he has done in helping to bring about this day. As the Hall of Fame celebrates its 125th anniversary of the invention of basketball, this commemorative coin symbolizes all the sport has accomplished since its humble beginnings in a YMCA gymnasium in Springfield, Massachusetts. This truly American game continues to be played by men and women at every level and on every continent. In December of 1891, a physical education professor named Dr. James Naismith created a game with a simple objective: throw a round ball into a peach basket that was suspended 10 feet above the ground. While only one basket was made available during those first games, it would soon become quite popular with students. Thanks to the network of YMCAs throughout the country and the game’s success on various college campuses, the sport soon became a national phenomenon. By 1894, basketball was being played around the Nation and in dozens of countries around the world. During the 1920s and 1930s, teams like the Original Celtics and the New York Renaissance carried professional basketball to the national conscience for the first time. b1630 Internationally, popularity of the new sport from America led to the formation of the International Basketball Federation, which was pivotal in adding basketball to the Summer Olympic Games in 1936. Eventually, the National Basketball Association was founded in 1946, and continues to enjoy great success. The Basketball Hall of Fame inducted its first class in 1959, despite the lack of any physical structure. They would get their first home on the campus of Springfield College in 1968, just a short way from the game’s first site. Thousands of visitors came to the campus to see memorabilia and be inspired by the stories of the sport’s early days. As the game skyrocketed in national popularity in the 1980s, with icons like Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan, the Hall of Fame found the need to expand. As the mayor of Springfield at the time, I helped to ensure a location on the banks of the Connecticut River. In 1985, the Hall reopened with a threelevel museum with hundreds of pieces of memorabilia and displays. The admiration for the sport forced the Hall to expand once again, in 2002, with a stateoftheart structure just steps away from the old facility. Today, the Hall welcomes 6 million visitors annually. They are dazzled with its interactive displays and exhibits. As of this year, the Hall has inducted 365 of the greatest players, coaches, and referees. Players like Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem AbdulJabbar, Bill Bradley, and coaches like John Wooden and Pat Summitt have been honored for their contributions to the sport. The Basketball Hall of Fame commemorative coin is the ideal way for the legacy of these great athletes and coaches to be remembered for decades to come. With no cost to the American taxpayer, the surcharges on these coins will go to further the museum’s curation efforts. The proceeds will also go toward educational programs to promote good sportsmanship and respect on and off the court. Mr. Speaker, I have worked with the Hall of Fame on multiple projects for more than 30 years. It is a terrific tax exempt organization that works tirelessly to preserve the history and educate people about this truly American game. 
I believe that basketball instills the virtues that this country was built upon and gives Americans someone to aspire to be. As former NBA player and United States Senator Bill Bradley put it: ‘‘Sports is a metaphor for overcoming obstacles and achieving against great odds. Athletes, in times of difficulty, can be important role models.’’ For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1235, and a special note of thanks to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GONZALEZ ) for keeping the debate open so that I could actually speak on this. Again, as I close, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). He was terrific in his help on this bill. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts and his leadership. I do recognize the great game of basketball was, in fact, invented in Massachusetts. That is okay, because Massachusetts gave us Coach Calipari along the way. We really appreciate his leadership. This would not have happened without the leadership of the gentleman from Massachusetts. It is my honor to work with him on this bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ‘‘yes’’ on The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ). Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in honor of the first woman to be national commander of The American Legion. Her name is Denise Rohan. She knows that this is a milestone. Therefore, she is very proud to have been named to this position. She says: ‘‘It is about time.’’ From Ms. Rohan’s perspective, women have always been leaders in the Legion. I am sure most of us didn’t even know that. She says: ‘‘If you look back, women were post commanders early on. We have been in leadership positions. If we weren’t leading from the front, we were still there, helping the organization along.’’ She says she doesn’t think of herself as a female legionnaire. She says: ‘‘I want to be known as a great American Legion leader who happens to be a woman. I have been working hard for the Legion for more than 30 years and am humbled’’—that the Legion— ‘‘chose me to be national commander. It is an honor.’’ She was elected at the Legion’s 99th national convention in Reno, Nevada, in August. She herself, of course, is an Army veteran and the second national commander from Wisconsin. She and her husband, Mike, belong to Mason Lindsay Post 385 in Verona. I am sure she would want that known here on the floor. They have lived 30 years in Sun Prairie. Members have supported Ms. Rohan for a long time and are excited to see her at the top. She is regarded as very capable, outgoing, friendly, and able to bring people to a consensus. Her parents, Joe and Dorothy Hulbert, set a strong example for three daughters. Both were volunteers and active in the local United Church of Christ. She first encountered the Legion as a girl at Memorial Day services in a Catholic cemetery near her home. She waited patiently to receive a spent brass shell casing from the honor guard to use as a whistle. ‘‘The town always had a parade that started at the cemetery, came down the hill, went across the bridge and ended up at another cemetery on the other side of the river,’’ Ms. Rohan said. ‘‘There was only one parade I remember going the other way, when they brought home the body of someone killed in Vietnam. It began at the high school and went up the hill. That memory stayed with me.’’ Still, the idea of serving in the military herself certainly didn’t occur to Ms. Rohan until a high school friend asked her and another girl to accompany her to Des Moines for an Army physical. Her friend failed, they passed, and Rohan had a choice. Unsure what she wanted to do with her life and reluctant to ask her parents to put a third child through college, she joined under the buddy system in 1974. For a person who struggled with homesickness—that is what she called it: homesickness—she got along just fine. ‘‘Somehow my mother lived through me sobbing on the phone every single call for a couple of weeks,’’ Ms. Rohan said. ‘‘Then I started realizing that I had another family: the women in basic training with me. They had my back, they made sure I was taken care of, and we became sisters.’’ At Fort Lee, Virginia, she completed quartermaster school and was the outstanding graduate of her class. Needing female instructors, the Army sent Ms. Rohan to more training. That is where she met Mike, who was working as a television production specialist. ‘‘I had to have some time in the studio,’’ she said, teasing him. ‘‘My roommate at the time was a runnerup for Miss West Virginia the year before she joined the Army, so here is this beautiful blonde who probably did really good on camera because she was used to that kind of stuff. He doesn’t remember meeting me that day.’’ By Mike’s recollection, they met through a mutual friend a couple of months later. He soon realized this girl had the qualities his mother told him to seek in a woman—and more. ‘‘She never once told me to look for someone who could shoot an M–16, or crawl under barbed wire with live fire going on, or run 2 miles with a rucksack on her back, but that is what I found,’’ he says. ‘‘Denise has all those abilities of a soldier but is also a loving wife and mother.’’ They started dating, fell in love, and Mike got orders to go to Korea. About the same time, Rohan was up for reenlistment. Wanting to stay together, they were married by a justice of the peace during one of Rohan’s morning breaks. Their reception was at McDonald’s. ‘‘That is our romantic place we go every year, on May 21,’’ she says. Women are veterans, too. In the end, the Army couldn’t guarantee Rohan an assignment overseas, so she left the service and became an Army wife. Of course, that would not be the case today. Over the next few years, the couple lived in Korea, Texas, and, finally, Wisconsin. Mike spent the first half of his career as enlisted, then became a warrant officer in the National Guard. Meanwhile, Rohan built her own career at the University of Wisconsin Madison, starting as a program assistant in the student loan office. She eventually rose to the position of assistant bursar, managing a $120 million loan officer portfolio and helping to develop a computerized system to manage it all. She retired in 2012, after 29 years. She is missed a lot, say those who worked with her and under her. Ms. Rohan’s American Legion career has had a similar trajectory. She joined in 1984, when the new commander of Post 333 in Sun Prairie, a friend of Mike’s, recruited her to join so she could serve as adjunct. She laughs when she recalls an older veteran who was flustered by a woman’s presence at the meetings. He was saying something, swore, and then he took his cap off and said: ‘‘I am sorry, I didn’t mean to be disrespectful.’’ Later, he did it again. He said: ‘‘I just don’t know how I am going to do this.’’ She told him: ‘‘Hey, I was in the Army, too. I have heard those words before.’’ Ms. Rohan really found her spot in the Sun Prairie Post when she was coordinating community blood drives: four a year, for two decades. ‘‘Each pint of blood can help three people, and we collected hundreds at each drive,’’ she says. ‘‘The volunteers kept coming back, the donors kept coming back. It makes you feel like you are making a difference.’’ From there, Ms. Rohan’s reputation for hard work and willingness to serve opened door after door: district adjutant and commander, department historian—she is a fourtime winner of the National American Legion Historian contest—and department commander. On the national level, she is a former chair of the Veterans Employment and Education Commission, as well as the National Membership and Post Activities Committee. Along the way, she volunteered for dozens of smaller jobs that have cemented the Legion’s place in her community, like chartering a Boy Scouts 
troop, organizing children’s Christmas parties, and assembling troop care packages. None of it would have happened if Ms. Rohan was the sort to hold grudges, however. When the couple lived briefly in Marshall, Wisconsin, a member of the local American Legion came by to recruit Mike. b1645 Rohan identified herself as an eligible veteran, but the Legion recruiter told her that women could join the auxiliary only. Years later, the Marshall Post realized its mistake and hung a photo of Ms. Rohan, then district commander, behind a sign that says: ‘‘Remember, women are veterans, too.’’ Today, the Marshall Post is one of her biggest supporters. ‘‘I promised they would get one of my first national commander photos to put in that frame,’’ she says. ‘‘We can do that,’’ is what Rohan has become known for. Her name is known in more than just Legion circles. At the Wisconsin National Guard Armory in Madison, she and her husband are Aunt Denise and Uncle Mike. Since 2006, they frequented drill weekends so often that young servicemen sometimes assumed they are part of their unit. Facing a rough situation with a soldier fresh off deployment and needing resources fast, Staff Sergeant Dan Killam was told to talk to the Rohans at the Legion. That call led to an unbelievable amount of care for troops and their families. When soldiers needed satellite phone minutes to call home after a battle, the Wisconsin Legion family raised $50,000. At a spur run for the 105th Calvary, Legionnaires fed nearly 500 people. I think after this lengthy—but I think much deserved—report on the first woman to head The American Legion, we understand why the bill that comes before us is much deserved. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 14 minutes remaining. The time of the gentleman from Texas has expired. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, once again, in support of The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, I want to share a story from just yesterday in Nicholasville, Kentucky, where The American Legion was there, as they always are, supporting our veteran families. We were at Camp Nelson—which was originally a Union Army cemetery, but since the Civil War, has become a final resting place for many of our heroes— yesterday to honor many of the Kentucky Gold Star families who had lost loved ones, heroes, in the war on terror. The first one was a U.S. Naval officer killed on September 11, 2001, in the Pentagon. And most recently, Captain Matthew Roland, a captain in the United States Air Force, was killed in action in August of 2015 in Afghanistan. And the families of these fallen heroes were there. We were there to honor those fallen heroes and unveil a dedication, a memorial to those Gold Star families who had sacrificed so much. Not only did those heroes sacrifice everything for this country, but those families have sacrificed because they have lost their loved ones, and they are missing anniversaries, birthdays, and their children growing up and walking down the aisle. But who was there to honor those Gold Star families? The American Legion. And The American Legion was there holding those American flags high, and they were there to deliver the threevolley salute in honor of those fallen heroes. The American Legion is, first and foremost, a local organization. They pride themselves in that, and that is what they were in Jessamine County, Kentucky, honoring those Gold Star families. Yes, they represent a country of heroes and servicemembers and veterans, but they are local, and they showed that yesterday in the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, and they show that all over this country. I would just note also, Mr. Speaker, that when we think of how to honor our veterans, we have to remember what General George Washington— who, of course, was the Founder of our country, and who, of course, was that famous general during the American Revolution who arguably was the first veteran—said. And what General Washington—President Washington famously said about our country and veterans was that the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of earlier wars and how they were treated and appreciated by our Nation. The American Legion embodies that. They are a group of patriots, of veterans who know that it is critically important to instill in other Americans the importance of patriotism, love of our country, love of the American flag, so they help us and future generations respect our veterans and their service and their sacrifice. We appreciate the fact that we have a piece of legislation before this body today that honors that great organization—The American Legion—that provides that level of patriotism and support to our men and women in uniform and veterans who have served this country so heroically and patriotically. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ), the legislation’s sponsor. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time and, more importantly, for his eloquent words. I appreciate the support both for The American Legion and for this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, thank you for bringing the bill to the floor, H.R. 2519, The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, for a vote today. For nearly a century, The American Legion has worked tirelessly day and night to improve the lives of veterans and their families. For that reason, words cannot express the gratitude that we have for the men and women of The American Legion. As both a veteran and a legislator, I see firsthand the results they achieve for veterans on a daily basis. This bipartisan piece of legislation has the support of over 370 of our peers, including the entirety of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, the Financial Services Committee, and the majority and minority leaders. The Senate has passed a similar piece of legislation, and I look forward to continue working to get this to the President’s desk. These commemorative coins are just a small token of thanks to show the millions of American Legion members that we appreciate what they do for our servicemembers, for our veterans, for our national security, and for our local communities. In full disclosure, Mr. Speaker, as a longtime member of The American Legion, I am proud to stand here sponsoring this piece of legislation. I look forward to it being signed into law, and then I look forward to Americans getting a piece of this history that we should all be proud of. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2519, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FACILITATING CONSTRUCTION OF A BRIDGE ON CERTAIN PROPERTY IN CHRISTIAN COUNTY, MISSOURI Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 810) to facilitate construction of a bridge on certain property in Christian County, Missouri, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 810 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 810. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 810 would allow the community of Ozark, Missouri, to finish the Riverside Bridge project, which spans the Finley River. After repeated major flooding in the area, the community purchased the land next to the existing bridge. As a condition of the Federal funds used to purchase this land, FEMA prohibits the building of any structures on the property. Replacing the current onelane bridge is essential and will alleviate traffic for families, small business owners, and emergency responders traveling in the region. I would like to thank the entire Missouri delegation for their work on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support its passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 810. This bill authorizes construction of a bridge on property acquired for open space under section 404 of the Stafford Act. Riverside Bridge in Christian County, Missouri, is a 100yearold onelane bridge that currently frequently closes due to flooding. Local transportation officials have agreed on a plan to replace the existing onelane bridge with a wider bridge that has a larger footprint. However, expanding the bridge involves building on land that has received FEMA disaster mitigation funds in the past. After repeated flooding, FEMA provided funding to Christian County in 2009 to demolish a structure adjacent to the bridge, the Riverside Inn, and to purchase the land. As a condition of providing the funding, FEMA required that the land be maintained for open space, recreation, or wetland management. Unless Congress removes the restriction on construction on that site, the county cannot replace Riverside Bridge. S. 810 provides that Christian County must ensure the bridge replacement project does not result in flood damage and is liable for any flood damage that occurs. No further disaster assistance from any Federal source may be provided for the property or the structure. This bill provides a narrow exemption from existing FEMA rules that will allow Christian County, Missouri, to solve a transportation problem. I am not aware of any opposition to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 810. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DISASTER TAX RELIEF AND AIRPORT AND AIRWAY EXTENSION ACT OF 2017 Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3823) to amend title 49, United States Code, to extend authorizations for the airport improvement program, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the funding and expenditure authority of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, to provide disaster tax relief, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3823 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, since Hurricane Irma hit south Florida earlier this month, my staff and I have been on the ground in the Florida Keys and South Dade helping our district with immediate recovery efforts and listening to what our constituents need going forward. In the lower and middle Florida Keys, it is hard to find someone who hasn’t been affected financially by this storm’s devastation. From restaurant workers who have been without a paycheck to fishermen whose boats or traps were damaged, small businesses and the families that depend on them are really struggling. In South Dade, crops and agricultural structures critical to daily operations were devastated by wind. Some small farms that were already struggling to make ends meet have now exhausted their cash on hand to pay for cleanup, leaving them little to pay workers or keep up with their planting schedule. Mr. Speaker, my district and similar communities throughout Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands need relief, and this bill is a great start. Through the business tax credit for wages, smallbusiness owners like Owen, a lobster and crab fisherman whose traps in the middle Keys were destroyed by Hurricane Irma, will be able to claim a tax credit for 40 percent of employee wages. That is money Owen can use to get his employees back to work as soon as possible. The bill will also allow taxpayers to refer to earned income from the immediately preceding year for purposes of determining the earned income tax credit. That is over 415,000 hurricane survivors in MiamiDade, and nearly 7,500 in Monroe County, who will be able to keep more of their paycheck when the time comes to pay taxes next year. We are also going to make it easier for individuals and businesses, like farmers struggling in South Dade and fishermen in the Keys, to deduct more of the costs from the extensive property damage these storms left behind. This legislation would also give anyone struggling with initial recovery immediate access to their retirement savings, without penalties, so they can make ends meet and take care of their families. Lastly, this legislation will lift caps on charitable giving to qualified hurricane relief organizations, encouraging more American businesses and individuals to continue generously supporting their fellow citizens. Mr. Speaker, Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico need Congress to act. My constituents and those in other communities like my district don’t have time to wait. They certainly don’t have time to play political games. The Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 will give them the means to recover faster and rebuild their communities better and stronger than before. This tax relief package we are considering deserves bipartisan support from my colleagues. I thank Chairman BRADY and the Ways and Means Committee for allowing me to shape this legislation for the benefit of south Florida residents, especially those in Monroe County who were hardest hit by Hurricane Irma. I hope we can get this done today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to H.R. 3823, the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act, for one simple reason. This is an anemic response to these disasters, whether they occur on the mainland of the United States or within American possessions. This should have been done on Friday afternoon with the two parties working together. Instead, once again, this was put together by one party, with minimal input from our side. These are all 
members of the American family that have been impacted by what has happened with this terrible weather. The chance here for us to work together to make this an expanded package, where we could be talking about a host of opportunities for these folks who have been put in such a precarious situation, is now being missed. There are 90 Members of this Congress who actually voted against direct aid in the past for relief for members of the American family, where we should have taken the position here, clearly: Let’s try to figure out what we can do for a robust tax package, what we can do for immediate aid, and highlight the role that FEMA plays. And I certainly have expressed to Mr. CURBELO time and again I am there on board. I just think this needs to be more, and I think that is the position that we are offering today. Furthermore, a partisan position had to be taken in terms of many priorities that we should have been consulted on, and even those could have been turned into bipartisan moments. I support the disaster relief that is in this bill, but it is clear that the package is woefully inadequate. I would hope that we could work together on these provisions. The disaster relief package included in this bill does not provide the comprehensive package of incentives and relief that will drive investment and speed up recovery in the American communities that include Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Without the fix that we want on this side, the effect of lost revenue is going to mean that money is lost that otherwise would be needed for normal operations and the response effort. It is going to take years to adequately respond to what has happened and the devastation that these folks are up against. We need to be sitting here, both parties working together, to say: They are all members of the American family. Let’s get it done. I consider this a missed opportunity, and I hope that we can do more in the next few days to get back on track to help them bounce back from these, indeed, tragedies. We should be sitting down here in the next 48 hours and putting together a massive package of relief for these States and for these possessions and making sure that they have what is necessary, rather than doing a piecemeal fix on what is sure to be a very tormented time for members of these communities and these States and these possessions. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, briefly, I want to first convey my gratitude to the gentleman from Massachusetts because, indeed, the first day I returned after being back home helping my community recover, the gentleman expressed his disposition to work together. That really meant a lot to me, and I know it meant a lot to all of our colleagues who represent areas that were hit hard by the storm. We should work more closely together. We can always do better. However, let’s not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The bottom line is that there are a lot of provisions in this legislation that are supported by Members of both parties, and there are millions of Americans who are suffering, especially in south Florida and especially in Puerto Rico that was hit hard by Maria just a few days ago, and they are counting on us to deliver something. We can always do more later, but this is a good package that will help people get back up on their feet. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. S HUSTER ), the chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me time. I rise today in support of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017. This extension provides stability to our aviation system and extends the funding to the FAA over the next 6 months while Congress continues to make progress on a full FAA reauthorization bill. This extension is absolutely necessary to prevent a shutdown in FAA programs, delays in airport construction projects, and the possible furlough of thousands of FAA employees across the country. I will be the first to admit I am disappointed we have not passed a longterm bill yet. Unfortunately, this is not a new problem for Congress. Between 2007 and 2012, Congress passed 23 extensions before approving a full reauthorization. These shortterm stopgaps, while necessary, create longterm budget instability, and they contribute to the FAA’s overall inability to effectively manage the modernization of our antiquated air traffic control system. Congress has passed numerous piecemeal reforms over the years to try to help the FAA act more like a business and efficiently modernize the system. These reforms have not worked, and passing the same kind of reforms again is not going to change the simple fact that the Federal Government is not an innovative, hightech service business. It is time to face the truth that, without transformational reform, the American people will not get the most modern and efficient air traffic control system that they have been promised and deserve. For too long, we have been trying to manage the symptoms of the problem instead of finding a cure. Thankfully, we now have that cure. H.R. 2997, the 21st Century AIRR Act, and progress is being made every day on this bill to provide longoverdue reform of the FAA. While we have made progress, I believe we will move this bipartisan bill through the House in the next few weeks. In the meantime, we have to pass this extension today to provide 6 months’ worth of certainty and stability to the FAA, the aviation community, and the flying public. Without it, starting this Sunday, October 1, the FAA programs will face a shutdown, thousands of FAA employees could be furloughed, airport projects across the country will come to a halt, and approximately $40 million a day in aviation trust fund revenue will go uncollected. That is funding for air traffic control, airport development, and other safety and modernization programs that will never be recovered. I want to remind my colleagues again that the very fact that we have to pass this bill today is one of the many reasons we need fundamental, comprehensive FAA reform. In order to ensure America remains the world leader in aviation, I look forward to bringing the bipartisan 21st Century AIRR Act to the floor in the coming weeks. Until then, I urge my colleagues to support today’s bill. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman BRADY and Chairman H ENSARLING for their work on this bill, and I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ), a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, we have a problem here. My record is very, very clear. I am providing assistance to any place in this country. In fact, my record is 100 percent. So I have some credibility to come to the floor to discuss this with my friend from Florida, and I hope he will listen. My heart goes out to those impacted my Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria the past several weeks. I am committed to providing for Federal response and recovery. I was pleased to support aid to those affected by Harvey and Irma, and I will continue to do so. We urgently need to deliver relief and assistance to those currently impacted by Hurricane Maria in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, where the entire island has lost power or many are without water. However, this bill today does not provide that needed relief. Let’s be clear: we in New Jersey are not some Johnnycomelately on disaster tax relief. This is not a question of you got yours and I want mine. We have been working on disaster tax issues since 2012, based, in part, on how we addressed helping victims of Hurricane Katrina more than a decade ago. Let me remind you: Hurricane Sandy devastated the northeastern United States in 2012, cost 233 lives, and caused $75 billion in damage. At the time, it was the costliest storm after Hurricane Katrina. While Congress, until then, had routinely provided tax relief to communities in the wake of our worst storms—tax relief, I am talking about—Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, victims of Hurricane Sandy did not receive the same treatment. In fact, we had to wait 3 months. We just 
did it in 3 days. We seem to have short memories. 179 Republicans in this body and 36 Senators voted against aid to victims of Hurricane Sandy in 2013—that many. And today, those same Members asked us to support not only aid for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but tax relief provisions, which they never even considered after Hurricane Sandy. I was a ‘‘yes’’ vote a week before last for your aid, unequivocally. Why should I take out on your citizens the foolishness that happened in 2013? That would be wrong. And I think you feel the same way, through the Chair. This whole debate smacks of a certain hypocrisy, and I know I am not the first to point it out. In the weeks after Sandy, I worked in a bipartisan manner to draft a tax relief bill that would make permanent the most commonsense tax relief provisions to take politics out of the equation when it comes to disaster relief. b1715 Over the years, I worked with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and from both Chambers of the Capitol. Our bill, the National Disaster Tax Relief Act, led also by Congressman TOMREEDfrom New York—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding additional time. The bill provides tax relief to victims of Hurricane Sandy and puts in place permanent provisions for all disaster areas going forward. I am ready and waiting to debate these provisions and go through regular order. Let’s have hearings, let’s have a markup, let’s have regular order on something that should be as noncontroversial as helping those in need. Instead of taking a bipartisan approach, some in the majority have chosen to sneak in a few provisions taken from our bill and tack them onto an unrelated aviation bill and apply them to only this year’s hurricane victims, leaving out all of the disaster victims that been have waiting for support over the years. A frontpage story in the papers in New Jersey today says people are still not back in their homes from Sandy, 2013. That is not fair. It is not the American way. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding additional time. The specific provisions Republican leadership put in from our bill include biggerthanusual property casualty loss deductions, penaltyfree retirement withdrawals. He may smile, but think about those people who are out of their homes since 2013. That is no laughing matter, Mr. Speaker. An increased threshold for charitable giving, a tax credit for impacted employers, and flexibility in applying for the earned income tax credit and child tax credit. I would note that Puerto Ricans, despite being American citizens, are ineligible for the earned income tax credit, and I have a bill to correct this. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, no one was laughing at anything that the gentleman said. We were listening intently. The reason that we are all here is because the people of Florida, the people of Texas, the people of Louisiana, the people of Puerto Rico, and the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands need our help. They were hit in the last few weeks, and they need our help. There are people struggling in all of these communities. Is this bill perfect? No. I have never seen one. Can we do more? Yes. We must do more, but this is an important first step. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ), the distinguished chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding. Mr. Speaker, it is so obvious to all as we have looked in horror on our television screens to see the devastation of Harvey, Irma, and Maria. There have been lots of tragic stories, harrowing tales of survival. I have been to Houston. I have met with a number of the victims. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you about one tragic story. One tragic story is that there are people who are living in homes that repeatedly flood five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, even twenty times. Something is fundamentally wrong in America and something is fundamentally dangerous in America when people are living in harm’s way. Many of these people are ready to move. Mr. Speaker, last week I made a comment about these repeatedly flooded properties that was clearly inartful. It was not meant to be taken literally, but it was. I regret the comment because it diverted from a very important point that needs to be made, and the point is this: if we care about our fellow citizens, if we wish to be compassionate, then Federal aid and Federal policy will help move these people to safer ground. It is time to either help mitigate these homes or to help move these homes. For this small set of properties, we must help. Otherwise, I fear that the fatalities and the economic carnage will continue. If we simply rebuild the same properties in the same manner, in the same place, and expect a different result, we are not helping our fellow citizens, we are not helping our first responders, and we are certainly not helping the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, another tragedy of these storms is how many people needed flood insurance but didn’t have it. Many of them had no idea that they actually needed it. In Houston, by some reports, 80 percent of the damaged homes didn’t have flood insurance. Why? One of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, is because we have a government monopoly in flood insurance. Many people don’t understand that flood is not included in their typical homeowner’s insurance policy. Many people, unfortunately, took false security from living outside the governmentdesignated 100 year flood plain. Many have seen no options. But help is on the way. Bipartisan help is on the way with the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act, known as the RossCastor bill. It is a critical piece of legislation to give more people more affordable options for flood insurance. In the small part of the national market where we have competition, particularly in Pennsylvania and in Florida, people are saving hundreds of dollars, if not thousands of dollars, in many cases on their flood insurance premiums. The very respected firm of Millman, which studies insurance matters, said that half of policy owners in Florida, twothirds in Louisiana, and 75 percent in Texas—my native State—could all save with private flood insurance. Think about it, Mr. Speaker. If we had a real competitive market with multiple companies advertising and selling multiple policies, more people would become educated about the need for flood insurance and have that rolled into their normal homeowner’s policy. This is vital. Mr. Speaker, last year this bill passed this House 419–0. You can’t get any more bipartisan. It recently passed the Financial Services Committee 58–0. If there is one thing that we need to do—and it is urgent that we do it now, with the National Flood Insurance Program, which is in debt, facing another bailout and an uncertain future, which we must remedy—as folks begin to rebuild, let’s get them more affordable flood insurance policies. I appreciate the bill included in this package, and for the sake of all the victims of the hurricanes, I urge its adoption. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I think that there is a sufficient opportunity here going forward, as the previous gentlemen has spoken, to discuss the whole issue of flood insurance. I just don’t think this is the moment to be discussing the flood insurance initiatives. Instead, I think that ought to be subject to a fullthrottled debate in this 
institution about getting those things done. This is not, I think, the appropriate forum for accomplishing that. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, this is purportedly an absolutely essential extension of authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration to continue to operate after October 1. Unfortunately, it has devolved into other issues because it has turned into a Christmas tree on the Republican side of the aisle. We need to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. The last time Congress failed to do this—and the ticket tax, which is what pays for air traffic control in America, expired—almost every airline in America raised their rates 7.5 percent, got a $400 million windfall, which the government lost, with the exception of two: I understand, Alaska and Spirit. So if we fail to reauthorize, we can expect that that will happen again. Actually, their longterm plan is to privatize the FAA, do away with the ticket tax, reap a $10 billion windfall, and then impose a new perhead fee to use our national airspace, which, by the way, Congress will have nothing to say about that. No elected official will have any authority over what new fees they charge. That is extraordinary. That came out of the Republican side of the Ways and Means Committee. What a bunch of losers. Come on. Give me a break. You are going to allow the airlines to have the authority, a private corporation, to tax people in America, and then say: Oh, it is not a tax; it is a user fee. It sure feels like a tax to me, and it is going to feel like that to your constituents. But when they complain, you will say: Oh, go talk to the private corporation. That is why we are here today, because the chairman of the committee has stubbornly persisted in attempting to privatize the air traffic organization of the United States of America, the most complex, the most efficient, and the safest system in the world. Yes, there are a few reforms that are needed there. Most of them have to do with us. Congress sequesters their money. Even though there is enough money raised in the ticket tax and other taxes to pay for the system, we sequester their money, we shut them down. We do dumb things like that. So I introduced a bill to take care of those problems, to exempt them from sequestration; to exempt them from budget shutdowns; and to require reforms in their personnel procedures, their policy procedures in terms of acquisitions; and to enhance the role of their coordinating committee, which has been doing a great job coordinating between the government and the airlines and all the people who use the system, not just the commercial airlines; and authorize funds to rebuild some of the major air traffic control centers, which are falling apart. Instead, the chairman has insisted that we must privatize because Canada did it, which is kind of a tiny fraction of what we are. Then the airlines have this fake group called the Citizens for On Time Flights, who say: 
We have to fly zigzag routes, which are World War II radar. 
No. Actually, we have deployed a system where you could fly all the planes in America closer together with GPS, but the airlines haven’t bought the equipment, so they are blaming the FAA. That kind of stinks. So that is why we are here today. We have a bill that otherwise is totally agreed upon. If we were voting today on an FAA bill to give them a 6 year extension without privatization, with the reforms we need, we would be pressuring the Senate to get something done. Now, the Senate is hung up over whether or not you should have 1,500 hours of experience to sit in the copilot’s seat. After the tragic Colgan accident, reforms were adopted that made these requirements. So they are hung up on that. On this side, we are hung up on privatizing the system. So it is sad that we have come to this point today. My hope is that we will move forward soon in the bipartisan tradition of my committee, and we will move an FAA bill and any amendments that are allowed, or any riders or anything that is in it will have only to do with aviation, not to do with flood insurance, not to do with any of all these other miscellaneous things that are being thrown in here today. We are here with the Ways and Means Committee on a bill that should be a transportation bill. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ). Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise and want to make comments actually echoing a lot of the comments that were made already. The gentleman from Massachusetts talked about this needing to be a bipartisan bill, and I agree. The gentleman from New Jersey talked about Hurricane Sandy tax relief, and I agree. The gentleman from Florida talked about the need to ensure that we are responding quickly and appropriately in response to the devastating disasters that have affected his State of Florida and the State of Texas. I also support the gentleman from Pennsylvania’s comments regarding a shortterm reauthorization to the FAA so we can continue to move forward on reform. But you may be wondering why, Mr. Speaker, groups like the Association of State Floodplain Managers and the Consumer Federation of America have expressed opposition to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I include these letters in the RECORD . ASSOCIATION OF STATE  FLOODPLAIN MANAGERS , INC., September 24, 2017. Re Private flood insurance in H.R. 3823, Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017. DEAR LEADERSHIP OF THE U.S. H OUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES : Early this week, the House will consider legislation promoting development of private flood insurance as part of a bill to reauthorize the FAA for 6 months and provide hurricane tax relief. The bill is scheduled to be taken up under suspension this week. ASFPM strongly objects to consideration of private flood outside the reauthorization of the NFIP. The proposed bill does not insert HR 2901 from the 114th Congress as mentioned in press reports, but inserts HR 1422, the RossCastor bill from the 115th Congress as Title 4, with provisions that as written could substantially weaken and undermine the critical functioning of the National Flood Insurance Program,. The NFIP not only provides flood insurance, but is a comprehensive flood risk management program. Although we understand the potential benefits of more flood insurance options, we point out that the private market has been readily expanding since BiggertWaters 2012 was passed authorizing private flood insurance. ASFPM cannot support authorization for private flood insurance as written in HR 1422. The temporary extension and reauthorization of the NFIP expires on 8 Dec 2017, giving Congress ample time to consider the full scope of the NFIP, into which private flood must integrate, without causing irreparable damage to the other 3 fundamental elements of this comprehensive flood risk management program. Those are floodplain mapping, implementation of local floodplain ordinances to protect new development, and hazard mitigation grants to reduce damage and loss of life from flooding. ASFPM has stated that three modifications of that HR 1422 language must be made to ensure continuity of the comprehensive flood risk reduction aspects of the NFIP that exist today. A federal policy fee on all NFIP policies pays for almost half the cost of floodplain mapping and all of the costs of floodplain management including technical assistance to over 22,000 communities that have joined the NFIP. Hazard mitigation grants are funded by premium income to the program. None of these functions are provided by private flood insurance policies. Yet private insurance companies acknowledge that mapping (i.e. identification of flood risk areas and areas of mandatory purchase of flood insurance) and floodplain management (i.e. reduced risk due to local requirements for hazardresistant construction) help them to target their marketing and to price premiums lower where floodplain ordinances exist. First, private policies must also carry the federal policy user fee to support the mapping and floodplain management functions. Private flood policy holders, private insurance companies, as well as the NFIP and its policy holders, benefit from these functions by identifying atrisk areas, ensuring building construction standards which facilitate lower flood insurance premiums, and targeting areas and structures which could benefit from mitigation actions leading to lower premiums. As policies migrate to the private sector, millions of dollars in revenue to support those floodplain management and mapping functions will be lost unless there is an equivalent policy user fee on private policies. Second, private policies to satisfy the mandatory purchase requirement for properties in floodplains must only be sold in communities that participate in the NFIP (meaning 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, extraneous provisions on flood insurance that should not be pasted into this legislation were included. These provisions actually undermine the very solvency of the program. They are establishing a private market at a time when the National Flood Insurance Program—the Federal program—is going to need the resources to pay claims. Establishing a private market within 60 days is going to divert resources from the Federal program to private insurers. It is going to divert these dollars to where they don’t have the resources to make the payments. Private insurance companies are already involved in flood insurance, and once we authorize them to step into these markets, they are going to be able to cherrypick low and moderate risk policies, leaving the National Flood Insurance Program with only highrisk policies, leaving them with the burden of flood mapping and leaving them with the burden of a $24.6 billion debt. I don’t understand how the program is going to have the resources to pay the claims it underwrites. Next, Mr. Speaker, one of the other big problems we have is that this shows floods in Texas, floods in Louisiana, and gutting homes in Louisiana here and in Texas there. b1730 These were both 1,000year flood events. I don’t understand the difference on why we choose these folks get tax relief and these don’t. We introduced nearly identical legislation to address this. We shouldn’t be discriminating against folks in New Jersey and New York and Louisiana in exchange for the others. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER ). Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CURBELO for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I just heard the ranking member get on the floor and call me stubborn. I am pretty committed to what we are doing here because this week will be the second year anniversary of this quote by the ranking member in debate on the floor on H.R. 3614. ‘‘The FAA is the only agency in government worse at procurement than the Pentagon. Congress has tried to reform it; it didn’t stick. We have got to try something different to get it more agile, to give us the 21st century equipment and software that we need.’’ That is exactly what we are trying to do in the 21st Century AIRR Act. We 
have tried for the last 40 years to get it modernized. We spent somewhere around 40 to $50 billion, and we haven’t been able to get it done. This is a true transformational reform. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ). Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I support the 21st Century AIRR Act, H.R. 2997. This is something that needs to get done. We need to solve our problems for America’s airlines and our passengers who are traveling across the country. This is a shortterm extension, but we have got to get our job done. As well, we have got to get our job done on teaching hospitals. While we continue to debate the healthcare of this Nation, we have got areas like mine that have a lack of access. If you can’t see a doctor today, you have no healthcare. I think it is important that our Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program gets extended long term. We have a bill to do that. Just expanding it 3 months, if you are graduating from medical school right now, you want to be able to have the certainty that you are going to have a residency program long term. I support this extension, but we have got to do a lot more. It is time for both Houses to come together. More importantly, it is time for both parties to come together to solve our issues for the FAA, for modernization, making sure that we actually have an aviation system that works. It is ridiculous that I can look at the Waze app on my phone, yet we have got the airlines getting stalled across the entire country. We can do better. We have got to come together to do that. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me reassure the gentleman from California that when you talk about graduate medical education, believe me, in Massachusetts, we are for graduate medical education. Be assured of that. Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say that we all support reauthorization of the FAA. What has happened here again is a breakdown in the conversation that used to meld this institution together. There was a chance on Friday for Republicans to consult with us in the minority, put together a bipartisan package of many very important provisions that are important to Mr. CURBELO , important to certainly Texas, important to the Virgin Islands. It is certainly important to Puerto Rico. Let me give you a quick example of how this institution used to work. We used to call this the national principle. The national principle essentially said if there was an earthquake in California, we all rose to the support of California. If there were forest fires in Alabama, which there were, we would all come to the aid of the people of Alabama. If there was a horrific, torrential downpour in Texas, we simply said: We don’t ask if it is a red State or a blue State, or if they are Libertarians or Socialists or Democrats or Republicans. We said: They are members of the American family. We said: Do what has to be done and then send us the bill. We believe that there will be ample opportunity to debate and discuss the size of the portionality at that moment. Instead, where we had this opportunity right here to provide a robust package to the people of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and Texas, we decide to come back with an anemic proposal. We are coming up short on our responsibility. We had a tornado in my hometown 5 years ago. Those Federal employees did a spectacular job everywhere in eight communities, and nobody said: Too much government. They said: Let’s fix this for, again, the American family to get this straightened out. I have said to Mr. CURBELO , and I will repeat it, we will put up 195 Democrats immediately for a bigger package for the people of Florida, Texas, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, not to piecemeal this together. By the way, let me use this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, for those of us from the Northeast, the idea that 90 Members of this institution voted against direct relief just a couple of weeks ago looking for a payfor, I wonder if they are going to use that same application of consistency when we get to the tax proposals that are about to consume our time. We want to provide adequate relief to these families and the communities that need it. We could do this in the next 48 hours without any problem whatsoever. Mr. Speaker, at this time, because this is not big enough and not supportive enough of the American family, I am going to urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman BRADY and the Ways and Means Committee staff for their work on this legislation. It has been a tough couple weeks in the State of Florida, especially down in my community. Again, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Mr. NEAL. As I said earlier, when I came back here, the first conversation we had was about helping south Florida, and he said he was willing and certainly able to do it. Here today, we are trying to take that first step to help the people of Florida, to help the people of Texas, of Louisiana, of the Virgin Islands, of Puerto Rico. But as often happens in the House, if something isn’t perfect, then we get nothing. That is wrong. That is wrong, because there are people out there who need the help, people who don’t have a roof, people who don’t have a home, people who have been without power. I visited the Marathon Emergency Operations Center, Mr. Speaker. It was replete with people buzzing, everyone working hard, full of energy, even though they hadn’t slept in days. The emergency operations manager there told me that a third of the employees there who were helping their fellow residents, conchs in the Florida Keys, had lost their homes. This is about them, and we can help improve their lives today, and we can work together to do more later, and we should. But why should the perfect be the enemy of the good? Why, when we have the opportunity to help people, because some think we should be doing even more, we are going to give them absolutely nothing? I think that is a major mistake, and it sends the wrong message. Throughout this debate, we have seen everything from posturing to name calling, and we wonder why so many Americans reject this institution and are disappointed by it. We have to do better, and we can do better. It would send a strong message if we all voted for this legislation to take this first step to helping the people of the Florida Keys, of south Florida, of Texas, of Louisiana, of the U.S. Virgin Islands, of Puerto Rico, help them get back up on their feet. Mr. Speaker, this is very important, and on behalf of my community and a lot of people who have, quite frankly, lost their lives, I ask all of my colleagues to join together and to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the funding authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently set to expire on Saturday, September 30. The FAA depends heavily on reliable and longterm funding provided through the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and the spending levels set in a corresponding authorization bill. This consistent and reliable funding is the mainstay of the FAA’s success in managing the safest and most complex airspace in the world. Absent access to this funding through a longterm authorization for FAA programs, we are threatening the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of our airspace. Sadly, Congress is yet again backed into a corner of taking up a shortterm, sixmonth measure that would extend this funding authorization through March 31, 2018. This is simply unacceptable. Congress needs to pass a longterm authorization bill so that the FAA can focus on the important tasks of maintaining public safety, staffing air traffic controllers, and bolstering our airport infrastructure through the timely distribution of Airport Improvement Program (AIP) dollars. A sixmonth extension poses new challenges for each of these important aspects of managing our airspace. The extension being debated today also adds several extraneous provisions that run counter to regular order in the House and threatens the success of passing an everimportant reauthorization. The bill selectively extends the authorization for certain public health programs, while leaving out other critical programs such as the State Children’s 
Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The bill also includes language that would encourage the creation of private flood insurance markets, while stripping important consumer protections such as the 45 day of cancellation provision that prevents private insurers from cancelling cover Just moments before a devastating storm. Mr. Speaker, allow me to be clear: I suppose a clean, longterm reauthorization of the FAA’s funding authority. However, the underlying bill not only includes a host of extraneous provisions that I could not support, but it was done so without the input of me or any of my Democratic colleagues. If Republicans are serious about maintaining the safest and most complex airspace in the world, they will pass a clean reauthorization that authorizes FAA programs for several years, not several months. We cannot politicize this issue with provisions related to healthcare, or flood insurance, or privatizing our air traffic control services. It is far too important and time is quickly running out. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CURBELO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3823. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS EXPIRING AUTHORITIES ACT OF 2017 Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3819) to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend certain expiring provisions of law administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3819 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of title 38, United States Code. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory PayAsYouGo Act of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest statement titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage. TITLE I—EXTENSIONS OF AUTHORITY RELATING TO HEALTH CARE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3819, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017. H.R. 3819 would extend a number of authorities impacting veterans’ benefits, health, and homeless programs. Swift passage of this legislation today would ensure that many programs that veterans, their caregivers, dependents, and survivors rely on continue. We must continue these programs. Mr. Speaker, the programs include nursing home care, support services for caregivers, transportation, child care assistance, adaptive sports programs, and housing and home loan services, to name just a few. So important. Again, these are not new programs, but they are so very important to our true heroes. The costs associated with them have been assumed in the Housepassed appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 and 2019 advance appropriation. One program that has been extended for just 5 additional months, until January 6, 2018, is the assisted living pilot program for veterans with traumatic brain injury. That short extension would allow extra time for the VA to fully transition the veterans currently participating in that program into other existing programs more suitable for their ongoing support and rehabilitation. H.R. 3819 would also make a number of technical corrections to the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. This bill was drafted by and has full bipartisan support of both the majority and the minority Veterans’ Affairs Committee members of the House and the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3819 today, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3819, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida for his hard work on this, as the entire committee did. H.R. 3819, as the gentleman said, makes sure that some of the vital programs we have in place to provide for our veterans continue past the end of the fiscal year and continue to help our veterans. Included in this bill are provisions related to their healthcare, their benefits, homeless veterans, and other related issues. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support extending programs related to the support for caregivers, childcare for certain veterans receiving healthcare, and the pilot program on counseling in retreat settings for women veterans newly separated from service. It also has provisions to extend the authority related to rehabilitation and vocational benefits to members of our Armed Forces with severe injuries or illnesses, homeless veterans reintegration programs, homeless women veterans, and homeless veterans with children, and providing housing assistance and counseling to homeless and atrisk veterans. Also included are extensions of authority for programs to help disabled veterans as well as authority to enter into agreements with the National Academy of Sciences to review the research on links between diseases and dioxin exposure. This is a critical step in creating any new Agent Orange presumptions that still may be there. Both of these provisions are critical in helping our aging Vietnam veterans as well, as we move forward. The final section contains, as the gentleman said, a technical fix to the Forever GI Bill, an important piece of legislation once again crafted in a bipartisan manner with the help of our veterans service organizations and passed earlier this year. The correction will simply help make VA implement the law correctly, and all sides agree it must become law as quickly as possible. Mr. Speaker, in short, this bill that both the majority and the minority support, we all agree it must be signed into law as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge my fellow Members to support its passage, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1745 Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST), a true American hero and a combat veteran. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Florida for the time. Without action from Congress, the authority for the VA Secretary to carry out many essential activities that are critical to helping our veterans will expire. I get my healthcare from the VA. I get it alongside a great number of my best friends in life, and I can tell you, my favorite part about going to the VA in West Palm Beach, Florida, is when I meet one of my fellow veterans in the lobby. It might be a veteran from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf war, Iraq, or Afghanistan, and the first thing that we do with one another is we jab at one another about the different branch that the other person served in: Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard. But after that, it gets back to the very serious work that we are all at the VA to have completed. The heroic men and women that I have had the honor of fighting alongside have earned—they have earned; that is the most important word, they have earned—the very best care that our country has to offer. But without this immediate action from Congress, veterans could lose those benefits— healthcare, support for the homeless, and many other provisions—and this is absolutely unacceptable. This bill, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017, does everything that was already mentioned, which is extremely important. It extends the number of expiring authorities to include nursing home support, support for our caregivers, support for transportation, childcare assistance, adaptive sports programs, housing and home loan services. This legislation also makes some important technical changes that will aid the VA’s implementation of the Forever GI Bill, a critical priority for ensuring that as many veterans as possible can use that important program. This is the definition of mustpass legislation. I urge my colleagues to pass this commonsense legislation. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his strong words, for his commitment and service to this country, and I appreciate his support on this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), my good friend, the vice ranking member of the full Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3819, which reauthorizes several essential veterans’ programs that support the men and women who have served our Nation. These programs include assistance and support services for caregivers who so often make profound sacrifices to support their loved ones, grants to our vital veterans service organizations so they can continue providing transportation for rural veterans to help connect them with the services they need, and programs to reintegrate homeless veterans which offer opportunities for meaningful employment and address the complex challenges they face. This bill reauthorizes specialized counseling for women veterans. This is particularly important in light of the stunning VA report released this month which showed that female veterans are six times more likely to die by suicide than any other women. These programs are fundamental to the wellbeing of our veterans and their families, and they are a reflection of our gratitude to those who serve. In addition, this legislation makes important technical changes that will allow us to follow through on the promises of the new GI Bill, which we passed unanimously earlier this year. Specifically, H.R. 3819 allows us to correct the perverse incentives that discourage veterans from attending local community colleges and universities, which is a provision I worked on with my Republican colleague, Congressman PAULCOOK. It also allows for the restoration of benefits for veterans left stranded by the abrupt closure of forprofit colleges, which I championed with Republican LUKEMESSER . After the closures of ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, student veterans in my district and across the country were left with nontransferable credits, depleted benefits, and none of the job opportunities that they were promised. By restoring their tuition and housing benefits, we are restoring a measure of justice for these veterans and restoring their opportunity to get the education they deserve and earned. Taken together, the reauthorization of vital programs and the technical fixes included in this bill should earn the support of every Member. I want to thank Chairman ROE, Ranking Member WALZ, and my colleagues on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee for ensuring that veterans can continue to rely on these critical programs, and I am once again grateful for the bipartisanship that has defined our work on behalf of America’s veterans. In closing, I want to note that yesterday was Gold Star Mothers and Families Day, and while today we are taking action to support our veterans, we must also remember the men and women who never made it home. Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support this must pass legislation. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ), who is also a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act. This muchneeded legislation will drastically increase access to healthcare and support services for our veterans. Most importantly, this bill will help ensure continued access to proven programs to address veterans’ homelessness, healthcare, and benefits. It also includes provisions to assist veteran caregivers, husbands, wives, parents, and children of veterans who righteously dedicate themselves to the care of their loved ones. Veterans and their families have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, and we must uphold our promises to them. For too long, Congress has ignored the needs of today’s veteran population. It is past time we focus on supporting our veterans, no matter when they served. The Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act addresses the priorities of today’s population and ensures that the money follows the veterans. As a member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee and a cosponsor of several of the standalone bills included in this package, I am proud to see the committee and the House of Representatives come together on behalf of these patriotic Americans who risked their lives for our safety. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his support and work on the committee. Once again, the old saying is you shouldn’t get a pat on the back for what you are supposed to do; but around here, it is harder than you might think, and I am incredibly grateful and proud. I want to thank the majority staff for their work on this piece of legislation, always including the minority staff, always including us in decisions, so that when we get to the floor, we bring a piece of bipartisan legislation that we can all support. It is mustpass legislation, and that is why it will pass today. I thank the gentleman from Florida for his continued leadership. We have been on this committee for over a decade together, and it seems like it is always that way, so I am grateful for that, grateful we are able to move this forward. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3819. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his leadership and working in a bipartisan fashion always, and we always put our veterans first, so I appreciate that very much. Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3819. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2824, INCREASING OPPORTUNITY AND SUCCESS FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS THROUGH EVIDENCEBASED HOME VISITING ACT; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2792, CONTROL UNLAWFUL FUGITIVE FELONS ACT OF 2017; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES Mr. BURGESS, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–331) on the resolution (H. Res. 533) providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2824) to amend title V of the Social Security Act to extend the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2792) to amend the Social Security Act to make certain revisions to provisions limiting payment of benefits to fugitive felons under titles II, VIII, and XVI of the Social Security Act; and for other purposes, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove Representative CARLOS CURBELO as a cosponsor of H.R. 2299. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. 
PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE MONTH (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, September is Peripheral Artery Disease— or PAD—Awareness Month. PAD is a vascular disease that impacts as many as 18 million Americans. Narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to your limbs, like your legs, and in very serious cases leads to amputation, which dramatically alters a patient’s life and significantly increases healthcare costs. There are 180,000 amputations performed in the United States every year, and too many of them are unnecessary. More than 30 percent of patients who experienced an amputation had no arterial testing before their limb was removed. Studies have shown that diagnosing and treating patients with PAD with early intervention is directly associated with lower rates of amputation. By supporting screening for atrisk populations and promoting multidisciplinary care with arterial testing, we can prevent amputation. It will improve lives, reduce patient mortality, and save billions of dollars in healthcare spending. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to learn more about the impact of PAD and recognize the need for a comprehensive strategy to eliminate nontraumatic amputations. 
SENATE MUST REJECT THE GRAHAMCASSIDY BILL (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, once again, Senate Republicans are trying to pass a healthcare bill without serious hearings or a proper CBO score. But the process is not the only issue with this proposed legislation. The GrahamCassidy bill would allow States to end critical consumer protections established in law by the Affordable Care Act. These protections ensure that patients with preexisting conditions can access affordable coverage and won’t face lifetime caps that force families to choose between lifesaving care and bankruptcy. Regardless of whether you receive insurance through your employer or the individual market, this bill, the GrahamCassidy bill, endangers access to quality, affordable health coverage for every American. 
Senators have proposed changes to this bill, but they cannot change the underlying fact that it would be unconscionable to rip healthcare away from more than 32 million Americans. I implore the Senate to reject this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to work in a bipartisan manner to reduce costs and expand coverage. 
TEXAS COACHES FIGHT HURRICANE HARVEY (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, undaunted by the massive 50 inches of hammering rains and devastation of Hurricane Harvey, Texans quickly volunteered to help other watersoaked neighbors. Bay City High School Secretary Linda Leissner was manning the city’s emergency operations call center when she realized the city needed school buses and drivers to help in the rescue because of Harvey’s quickly rising floodwaters, so she called the coaches. The coaches quickly manned the high school’s buses, and in the torrential rain they began rescuing and evacuating residents of the town, including some of their very own students. One of the coaches, Nathan Janak, put it best: ‘‘It was just people helping people. It was one of the greatest displays of human kindness I have ever seen.’’ Madam Speaker, stories like this make us Texas Proud and give us the determination to recover from one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history. Harvey will not defeat us. As we say, ‘‘Don’t mess with Texas.’’ And that is just the way it is. 
VIRGINIA INSTITUTE FOR PASTORAL CARE (Mr. MCEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Virginia Institute for Pastoral Care, also known as VIPCare. In 1967, 12 concerned citizens founded VIPCare and built a unique, unprecedented organization that continues to serve our community, and several Virginians, today. VIPCare is a notforprofit, interfaith institution that provides marriage, family, and substance abuse counseling, as well as training and support for the clergy. They are the oldest pastoral counseling center in the United States. VIPCare proudly serves more than 900 children, teenagers, adults, older Americans, families, and couples every year at their two locations in Richmond and the six other locations throughout Virginia. VIPCare does not turn people away, regardless of the cost. For 50 years, they have provided thousands with a community space for compassion, hope, and comfort. Madam Speaker, today, and every day, I am so proud of VIPCare and the work they do to care for Virginians. f 
RECOGNIZING ELLIOTT ROOT (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent from the 22nd District of New York, Elliott Root. Elliott was born with a single left ventricle and has prevailed over tremendous odds in his short life. At the young age of 10 years old, Elliott will undergo his fifth openheart surgery this week. Today, I wear the Red Balloon pin in honor of Elliott’s courage and strength. Throughout the Red Balloon Campaign, Elliott and his mother, Amy, have worked tirelessly to raise awareness and create an atmosphere of connectivity for all impacted by heart defects. Congenital heart defects are the most prevalent birth defect, affecting 1 in 100 newborns, leading to the death of more children each year than all forms of pediatric cancer combined. Despite these staggering statistics, congenital heart defects continue to be underrecognized and underfunded. Our thoughts and prayers are with Elliott and his entire family as he undergoes his fifth openheart surgery. Elliott’s enduring spirit and bravery are an inspiration to all of us. Please join me in celebrating the life of this courageous young man. 
REPUBLICANS SHOULD WORK WITH DEMOCRATS TO CREATE BETTER HEALTHCARE (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to express my opposition to the newest TrumpCare bill that will result in 21 million fewer Americans having healthcare insurance. Once again, Senate Republicans, like House Republicans, are rushing to pass a hurtful bill that every major healthcare group, from the American Medical Association to Kaiser, is opposing. The latest heartless version of TrumpCare is no different than the previous plans because it still leaves many in the cold. As the old saying goes, it is like putting lipstick on a pig, as the bill still allows States to eliminate essential healthcare benefits like ER visits, preventative screenings, and prescription drug coverage. This misguided plan also guts Medicaid, at a loss of $4 billion in Federal funds to Ohio—my State—and allows insurers to charge seniors and people with preexisting health conditions more money for less coverage. Now it is time to stand together and hold strong with Senator JOHNMCCAIN and the Governors of Ohio, Nevada, and other States. Republicans should work with Democrats to create a better deal, better jobs, better healthcare, and a better future for all Americans. 
CONGRATULATING ABBOTT HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, today, I would like to recognize and congratulate the Abbott High School baseball team on being this year’s Division 1A State champions. Located in Abbott, Texas, this small town high school has defied the odds. Since opening its doors in 1886, this is the first time the baseball program has earned the title of State champions. Just last week, I visited the Panthers, as well as Principal Pustejovsky and Head Coach Crawford. It was an honor to meet them and these young Americans and be able to congratulate them on a hardearned victory. As a former baseball player myself, it is inspiring to watch a new wave of students become interested in America’s favorite pastime. These boys are bright and eager to do their best by giving 110 percent at all times, and that is the kind of spirit we need in this country. In a time when we are finally recovering from the last 8 years of turmoil, kids like these are exactly the driving force behind what will make this country great again. Madam Speaker, as long as I am up here in Washington, I am committed to continuing to fight for our Nation’s future generations. I am proud to represent the black and gold in the 25th Congressional District of Texas, and I look forward to watching their baseball careers unfold. And, remember, keep your head over the plate, swing as hard as you can, and always look fastball. In God we trust. 
b1915 HELEN HUYNH FIGHTING LEUKEMIA (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, last week, people across the Nation and around the world heard the heart wrenching story of my constituent, Helen Huynh. Helen is bravely fighting leukemia. She desperately needs a stem cell transplant, which requires a compatible match. Helen’s sister, Thuy, is a 100 percent match, but she lives in Vietnam. She has been denied a visa to come to the United States for this potentially lifesaving procedure. She has been denied now three times. 
This is outrageous, and I am doing everything I can to make sure this wrong is corrected. Mark my words: it will be corrected. I am working with Helen’s family, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security to make sure that we are successful in bringing Thuy to Helen as soon as possible. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL DANIEL FRANCIS KELLY (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Corporal Daniel Francis Kelly, who, after being listed as missing in action in Korea for 67 years, is finally home. Danny was the youngest of nine boys of Irene and John Kelly from Pittsburgh’s north side. Seven of his eight brothers served in World War II, one of whom was Medal of Honor recipient Chuck ‘‘Commando’’ Kelly. Danny idolized Chuck and wanted to be a war hero just like him. With Chuck’s help, Danny enlisted in the Army in 1950, at the age of 17. By November of that year, as part of the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, he found himself at the Battle of Ch’ongch’on River, where he was captured on November 26. It is believed he died at the POW camp known as ‘‘Death Valley’’ in March 1951. Corporal Kelly, this week, your country gives you the funeral with military honors you have long deserved. Like your brother Chuck, you are a hero. A grateful nation says ‘‘thank you.’’ Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. 
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER FUNDING (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise to remind my colleagues that we have just 4 days to authorize mandatory funding for our Nation’s Community Health Centers. If Congress fails to act before September 30, the Community Health Center program will suffer a 70 percent cut to its funding. Our constituents and our economy will suffer the consequences. Without this funding, an estimated 2,800 health center facilities will be forced to close, 51,000 medical professionals will lose their jobs, and 9 million patients will lose access to the care they rely on. The critical role Community Health Centers have in serving patients is beyond dispute, and it should be beyond partisanship. While our Senate colleagues are scrambling to meet a selfimposed deadline, they are ignoring real deadlines that we must meet. We must fund these health centers this week, or we will be responsible for the economic and human cost of our inaction. f 
THANKING THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my home team, the Seattle Seahawks, for joining nearly 200 NFL players across the country who exercised their First Amendment right to protest during the national anthem. I fully support their right to do so. These players used their platform to draw attention to the racial and social injustices of our time and to condemn the racism and divisive rhetoric coming from President Trump. Athletes practice unity in a way that few others do, coming from every walk of life and pulling together to model unity every single game. Let us be very clear: these protests are not about disrespecting the flag or our country’s brave men and women in uniform. They are about the oppression of people of color, the number of black men gunned down by police, and the schooltoprison pipeline. These protests are about speaking out about unacceptable behavior and rhetoric and fighting for justice. I thank our players and the Seahawks for addressing these issues with unity, compassion, and truth. I thank Colin Kaepernick for starting this important conversation. 
STANDING WITH DACA RECIPIENTS (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, September 5, 2017: that is a day that will forever be ingrained in the minds of immigrants and DREAMers as the day that Donald Trump crossed a moral line. The President is playing hot potato with a group of young people who, like me, came to this country ‘‘with heart,’’ ‘‘con corazon;’’ ‘‘with humility,’’ ‘‘con humildad;’’ and ‘‘with a desire to do more,’’ ‘‘con el deseo de hacer mas.’’ DREAMers are ‘‘fighters,’’ ‘‘luchadores.’’ They are fighters, and so we will not rest until the Dream Act is the law of the land and until DREAMers and their parents can go to sleep without the fear of ICE knocking on their door and showing up in their place of worship, school, or at a hospital. To my colleagues, we urge you to stand with us, stand with 800,000 DACA recipients, and stand with their parents in passing the Dream Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f 
HURRICANERIDDEN PLACES (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. In hurricaneridden places, DREAMers are extraordinarily scared for their families, for the ability to recover from damages; and I see it every day. It is imperative that Republicans sign this bill to save and protect our DREAMers, who are, in fact, Americans. Do it for all of those who are suffering. Then, Madam Speaker, let me explain to you that FEMA needs to address the poverty of my constituents, individuals who are calling me in their apartments when their 84yearold mother and themselves have lost everything, and they cannot get a FEMA inspector to that apartment. I will be addressing this with FEMA Director Brock Long, but we cannot go this route. People are still in uninhabitable housing. Over the weekend, seniors were evicted from their housing with no place to go. I am engaged with our public housing authority, but we have got to have a system that is orderly for those who are living in uninhabitable housing. And, FEMA, you have got to enhance the inspectors. These people are waiting for over a month for you to come to their apartment or home to inspect, because they have no resources at all, and they are depending upon the FEMA dollars based upon your inspection for the loss of personal items. The hurricane is still on for my friends in Puerto Rico and Florida and the Virgin Islands and Texas. 
REPUBLICANS NEED TO JOIN DEMOCRATS IN BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I associate myself with the concerns expressed by Congresswoman JACKSON  LEEabout those who have been affected by the hurricanes. They need not only our compassion but our help as soon as possible. I thank Congresswoman JACKSON LEEfor her leadership. I also associate myself with the remarks of others who have talked about the discharge petition here. This discharge petition will not only discharge a bill, it will discharge the realization of hopes and dreams and aspirations of so many hundreds of thousands of young people in our country. Just to put it in historic perspective, we did pass a Dream Act in 2010, in the House of Representatives. We couldn’t pass it in the Senate, because it required 60 votes, but it did receive a majority of the vote in the Senate. President Obama, as people know, issued an executive order. President 
Trump has rescinded that, but he said he would sign the Dream Act if it came to his desk. So we are asking our Republican colleagues to join us in this bipartisan legislation. Just to put it in historical perspective, the President said: I can’t act. Congress must act. But even when Congress acted, President Reagan said: You didn’t go far enough. So he instituted a Family Fairness initiative, which protected many more people than Congress did. President George Herbert Walker Bush continued that leadership and that courage, as did President Clinton; President George W. Bush, one of the best Presidents we have ever had in terms of his advocacy for newcomers to our country, realizing that they make America more American by invigorating our country with hope, aspirations, and dreams; and President Obama, of course, a great President in this regard as well. So this is the first President we have had who has put doubt as to whether we respect the contribution of newcomers to our country. He has said he would sign this bill. We trust his word. We just need our Republican colleagues to join in the discharge petition, and to appeal to the Speaker, with or without a discharge petition, take the initiative, take the lead, make America more American by unleashing the power and the patriotism of our DREAMers. 
WE MUST CONTINUE TO ROOT OUT RACISM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to anchor tonight’s CBC Special Order hour. I first want to thank the coanchors, Representative VEASEY and Delegate STACEY PLASKETT , for their work on coanchoring the Special Order hour for the caucus. Our thoughts and our prayers are with those in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, as well as those in Louisiana, Texas, and Florida, and others who have been impacted by the devastating hurricanes. We also pray for our brothers and sisters in Mexico, who are recovering and rehabilitating after the devastating earthquake that rocked their country. We encourage all to do what they can do to help our brothers and our sisters. Tonight, we are here to talk about how we must continue to root out racism. We are here to talk about how we should bring our neighborhoods, our Nation, together and not drive Americans apart. What took place in Charlottesville, and the dialogue with the NFL players, the NBA players, President Trump continues to highlight how our President does not seem to understand what is at stake and how his actions are undermining the strength and the stability of our neighborhoods. You have heard me say, as I have said it again and again two summers ago when speaking to members of an AfricanAmerican community at a rally in Philadelphia, President Trump says: ‘‘What do you have to lose?’’ He actually said: ‘‘What the hell do you have to lose?’’ That is right. What do you have to lose? Everything, Mr. President. We have everything to lose: good schools for our children, safe neighborhoods, reliable healthcare, quality jobs, peace of mind, and that the next generation will be better off. President Trump has been in office for almost 250 days, and all we have to show for it is division, division, division. He has divided our country in ways we didn’t even think we wanted to acknowledge are still happening in 2017. For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congress, and the constituents we represent. Madam Speaker, I would like to yield to the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Honorable CEDRIC  RICHMOND from the Second Congressional District of Louisiana. Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Congressman EVANS , for leading this Special Order and for yielding to me, especially on a matter this important. As I reflect on the last 200 or so days in this country, I am saddened. b1930 The truth of the matter is I always thought this country was better than this. I thought that we had so many people, not just African Americans, but we had people of like mind, like Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner, who gave their lives and who sacrificed blood, sweat, and tears so that this country could be a more perfect Union, so that I could go to some of the best schools in the country, so that I could dream the impossible dream, so that I could stand on the floor of this House and speak my mind, introduce legislation, but, more importantly, fight for the ideals that make this country an exceptional country. It is so easy for our President and our colleagues to say America’s exceptional. Well, it is, but you have to understand how it got to be exceptional, because it didn’t start off that way. In fact, we came here on boats. We survived middle passage. We built this Capitol as free labor. We have given as much blood, sweat, and tears as any people in this country. To see the President of the United States call people who would walk with neoNazis and the KKK and white supremacists, some of them are fine people—but young AfricanAmerican males are taking a knee not to disrespect our country, but they are taking a knee because they want a better future for their sons. They want better community police interaction. What they want is that people who are with the color of law with misconduct against AfricanAmerican men and women, sons and daughters, parents, grandparents, what they want is a better country for them. They didn’t choose violence. They chose peaceful protests just like Martin Luther King. When Dr. King chose peaceful protests, what the President doesn’t realize is that the country wasn’t accepting of his ways either. ‘‘Letter from Birmingham Jail’’ was all about Dr. King responding to people of like mind who shared the cause of freedom and equality and justice. They just didn’t like his tactics. And the question was: We should wait. His letter was addressing people of like mind. The problem here is I just can’t address someone of like mind because I don’t think that this administration has the maturity, the sensitivity, or the understanding, whether it is willful or unwillful, to understand what is going on in this country. Instead of doing the Presidential thing, instead of doing the right thing and bringing this country together, I am afraid that this country is being torn apart at its very core, and for that I know that we are a better country. Let me just say in closing that, in order for us to move forward in a more responsible and more perfect fashion, it is going to take ordinary citizens like you out there watching us at home, it is going to take you all standing up and speaking out. It doesn’t matter if you are African American or if you are Hispanic or if you are Black, injustice is injustice. The words ‘‘no justice, no peace’’ are not a threat. It is that it is hard to accomplish peace when there is no justice in the land. I would just ask that we all come together and that we not only look at words, but we look at policies, so when we now look at the opioid addiction through a loving mental health medical crisis standpoint, we don’t forget the young people who were addicted to crack and who got involved in drugs back then that we have now decided that, with opioids, we are going to take a nurturing approach and with crack we locked everyone up. We should come in, take the approach that we are doing with opioids, which is the exact correct approach, and we should apply it to crack, and we should apply it to all of those millions of people who are incarcerated for drug crimes. When you start talking about root out racism, it has to be in policy, it has to be in our rhetoric, but it has to be in our daily lives. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Congressman EVANS , for yielding to me. 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, who, under his leadership, has clearly demonstrated that he understands and gets it. Look at the President’s actions just this past week. He is involved in an incredible, misguided, thoughtless, careless Twitter fight with the NFL, the NBA, and other athletes, while people in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands need emergency housing, electricity, clean water, and other Federal aid. When Americans think of big things, they think of the Office of the President of the United States. Let me repeat that. When Americans think of big things, they think of the Office of the President of the United States. In these times, Americans—and the rest of the world, for that matter— think of the U.S. President as a person who takes time to think over the great ideas of the day, works to fix the biggest problems and find ways to make the world come together, no matter the party, no matter the person. Madam Speaker, I want to yield to a gentleman whom I have known for a long period of time, and I knew his father, who was a real leader, and he has definitely come along and carried that. As a matter of fact, we are neighbors. He is from the great Garden State, the honorable DONALD PAYNE , Jr., of the Tenth Congressional District. Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I first want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Congressman EVANS , for hosting tonight’s Special Order Hour on rooting out racism in the United States. He has a long history of legislative accomplishments back in the Keystone State and has brought his understanding and talents here to the House of Representatives, and we appreciate him being a Member of this body. Before I begin, I also want to let the Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands know that we stand with them as they rebuild. Madam Speaker, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees to all people in this country the freedom to speak out against injustice. When Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the National Anthem last year, he joined a long list of patriotic athletes who used their fame to do just that. Muhammad Ali was convicted of draft dodging because he refused to drop bombs and bullets on Brown people in Vietnam while the socalled Negro people in Louisville, Kentucky, were treated like dogs. Jackie Robinson, the great Baseball Hall of Famer who integrated baseball, admitted in 1972 that he no longer could stand and sing the National Anthem. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution endows all of us with the freedom of speech, the freedom to speak out our own truths. Muhammad Ali would not fight an unjust war; Jackie Robinson would not salute a flag that he believed symbolized his oppression; and Colin Kaepernick took a knee to bring America’s attention to the fact that Black Americans are twice as likely as White Americans to be killed by police officers, to bring attention to the fact that 1 in every 10 Black men in his thirties is in prison or in jail on any given day, to bring attention to the statistic that tells us Black people are twice as likely as White people to be in poverty in the wealthiest country on Earth. It is easy to keep quiet, to do nothing in the face of injustice. But just like the muscles in our bodies, our Constitution will wither if we do not exercise our rights. To speak out against injustice is to exercise the constitutional right of free speech. What is more patriotic than exercising the rights our Nation stands for? When the President uses his right of free speech in an attempt to silence athletes, he is undermining the freedom for which patriotic Americans have fought during our 241year history. When the President calls for men and women to be fired from their jobs because they dare use their public platform to combat injustice, he fuels the viciousness he claims that he wants to despise. As Langston Hughes put it: ‘‘Let America be America again—The land that has never been yet—And yet must be—the land where every man is free.’’ Madam Speaker, I talk about the Constitution because it talks about all people. There are times where I have been disappointed and let down by this Nation not holding up its creed because, you see, I believe in America, but I am waiting for that day when all men are created equal. I am still waiting for that day. We are here tonight to bring attention to this matter. We are exercising our right to free speech, the right that has been given every American in this country, supposedly. But if the President of the United States can stand up somewhere in this country and call a section of this country, a certain people in this country, SOBs, then what does that say about where we are? This is the leader of the United States of America, the land of the free, the home of the brave. But is it that for everyone? We have a ways to go in this country. Yes, we have come a long way, and some people will say: Well, you know, why are you still talking about those old issues? And, you know, things are different now and better for you. And, look, come on, get over it. And then we see what we have seen over the last several years with African Americans constantly getting shot and there being no ramifications. It tears at your heart, Madam Speaker, to understand why, why, in the greatest nation on the face of the Earth, we still have these situations of such inequity. So we will continue to raise the issue until one day this country can live up to its creed that all men and women are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights. With that, Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding to me. Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, the gentleman from New Jersey is spot on, as usual. He has a very quiet demeanor, but he is someone who, when he speaks, is very clear and concise with his thoughts and his comments. In the short period of time that I have been here, I have watched him in action; and I think when you just heard his comments, you heard that he really understands, as he said, that we all do believe in America, but we know there is an awful lot of work to do, and he has certainly expressed that. Madam Speaker, professional sports is a system built on unity and bringing people together. As civic leaders, we should take our cue from them. Teams, coaches, players, spectators, football, basketball, ice hockey, tennis, they are all great unifiers in our country. It is disappointing to see players attacked in their effort to shed light on inequality in our neighborhoods. b1945 We know division and inequality exists in our neighborhoods. We should be shining a light, as the gentleman from New Jersey just did, on how to change this and make it better. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of Illinois (Ms. KELLY ), someone who I have watched a great deal, and she just did a fantastic job over the weekend. I watched her in action. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank him for leading this important hour tonight. Madam Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus and with Americans from our great country because it is time to root out racism. While racism has, tragically, been a part of the American story—from Jamestown to Jim Crow; to the Little Rock Nine, whose 60th anniversary is today—in 2017, we are seeing it rise in new and disturbing ways. Right now, there is a sham, ‘‘Presidential voting commission,’’ plotting to turn back the clock on our voting rights. Right now, African Americans live in fear that they will be stricken down, unjustly, because of the color of their skin. Right now there is an unAmerican and unconstitutional Muslim ban preventing families from reuniting. Right now the Attorney General is undoing consent decrees and pouring billions of tax dollars into the forprofit prison industry. Right now there are rabid racists, White nationalists, and White supremacists that this administration won’t denounce. 
And right now our President refuses to blame White supremacists for racially motivated killings in Charlottesville. The individuals, who inspired this bigoted violence, he called ‘‘some very fine people.’’ Just this weekend, we saw President Trump attack athletes for exercising their First Amendment rights; using terms like ‘‘you people’’ and ‘‘those people’’ in an effort to further divide us. Our Commander in Chief is uniting those who hate, while ignoring millions of Americans facing a humanitarian disaster in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida, and Houston. Madam Speaker, if we want to root out racism, we need to start at the top. Let’s start with this White House. Racism is a cancer. You don’t ignore a cancer. You don’t let it fester and grow. You cut it out. You purge it. You remove it. That is what we must do with racism: remove it, stop it before it grows further and consumes us. America’s greatest strength has always been our diversity. It is the source of our economic innovation that made us the world’s largest economy. It is our ability to stand shoulder to shoulder and face down any threats that have been made to America, from the Contrabands and the Red Tails to Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez. It is our ability to see ourselves and our families in one another that makes America great. It is our compassion and belief that we all share a higher purpose, as Americans, that propels us to higher heights. It is our capacity to come together and break bread, help someone with a flat tire, even give our own lives for those of others. These are the things that make America great, not some idealized, grayscale image of a misremembered past. It is all Americans who make America great, and that greatness comes in all colors, all genders, all faiths, all orientations. When we stand together, we are stronger. When we are divided, we will fail. That is why it is imperative that we call out racism, decry racism, and, most importantly, root out racism. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois, who was very succinct, and added points that she needed to. She was very potent in what she just said. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COMER ). The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 38 minutes remaining. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ). She and I had the chance to travel together during the summer, and she has been a fantastic friend. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman EVANS  for giving me an opportunity to speak and for hosting this Special Order hour. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, behind a podium adorned by the Seal of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, once again, sank even further in disgrace through remarks that were attacking peaceful American private citizens. It should not be lost on us that when referencing White supremacy and neo Nazism, Donald Trump saw fit to speak with calculated language, unlike the phrases he used to describe the Black men and their mothers who used their platform to highlight longstanding injustices. His behavior continues to demonstrate that he is unfit to serve as the leader of this free world, and surely unfit to represent the American rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We have witnessed 9 months of discriminatory policies and proposals emanating from the Trump White House; baldfaced and bumbling attempts to reverse the progress made not only by President Obama, but progress won decades ago, fights that we thought we had already won, issues that had already been settled, from a woman’s right to choose, to environmental protections, to civil rights, to workplace safety, and beyond. In January, Donald Trump assumed the Presidency and made rescinding the freedoms of people of color, the poor, and the sick his first priority. We look at the establishment of the fraudulent Voter Suppression Commission; the appointments of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, Betsy DeVos, Sebastian Gorka, and Stephen Miller, a group of people whose ideology directly stands against the advancement of an equal and more perfect union; his support for discriminatory voter ID laws; reinstatement of the failed war on drugs; attacks on affirmative action at colleges and universities; rollback of consent decrees that keep police accountable; the now extended Muslim ban; the transgender ban in our armed services; the rollback of our civil rights enforcement across Federal agencies; reinstating the use of private prisons; refusing to protect Americans and the Nation from White supremacists; all under the slogan of ‘‘Make America Great’’ under the guise of patriotism. Make no mistake about it, the world is imperfect, and a long view of history shows evil triumphing more often than we would like. But here in America, in the space in which I work, I will continue to stand with my colleagues here in the Congressional Black Caucus and in the Chambers of Congress to root out racism, sexism, bigotry, and hatred because it cripples this Nation. I will continue to gather in solidarity with my brothers and sisters of color, the Muslim and the Jewish communities, the LGBTQ community, the immigrant community, and every person that is targeted by those who seek to divide us, as this President is doing. I will take a knee, I will reclaim my time, I will raise my fist, I will stay awake, I will stay alert, and I am ready to mobilize. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, as usual, I am speechless as the gentlewoman gives her comments because she definitely lets people know where she stands, and I thank her for her comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ), another person who also is what I consider a wordsmith. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for leading this Special Order. Mr. Speaker, in 1971, thenPresident Richard Nixon declared the war on drugs, which he labeled as ‘‘public enemy number one in the United States.’’ Now, at the time of this declaration, America’s prisons and jails held fewer than 200,000 people. Today, that number sits at over 2 million people. In fact, the United States incarcerates 25 percent of the world’s prisoners, but we have only 5 percent of the world’s population. In fact, shamefully, my State of Wisconsin has the highest incarceration rate of AfricanAmerican men on the planet Earth. Now, John Ehrlichman, thencounsel and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs under President Nixon, admitted, Mr. Speaker, that the war on drugs was an effort to vilify African American leaders and to disrupt the AfricanAmerican community; admitted that the war on drugs was contrived to diminish the reputation of African Americans. Indeed, they were successful because the burden of this failed war has fallen overwhelmingly on AfricanAmerican communities. In 2014, AfricanAmerican adults accounted for just 14 percent of those who used drugs, but close to onethird of those who are arrested for drug possession. And although African Americans and Whites consume drugs at a similar rate, African Americans are significantly more likely to be arrested. Now, this disproportionate enforcement of drug laws in a nation in which racial groups use drugs at the same rate points to one fact, Mr. Speaker. It can only be explained that race has played an inappropriate role in law enforcement’s priorities and tactics. It is worth noting that in the face of the 1980’s crack cocaine epidemic in Black communities, the public policy response was incarceration. Here in 2017, in the face of our current opioid epidemic in predominantly White communities, public officials on both sides of the aisle have banded together to pass landmark legislation to provide drug treatment assistance to those victims. In recent years, fortunately, leaders on both sides of the aisle have found common ground on the need to reform our broken criminal justice system. Stakeholders from the ACLU to the Koch Institute recognize the crisis of 
overcriminalization in this country and the need for immediate action. Both the House and the Senate have made strides toward the passage of bipartisan criminal justice reform in the 114th Congress, but, ultimately, a bill never made its way to the President. Now our U.S. Attorney General of the United States, Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, a most ardent opponent to bipartisan criminal justice reform, sits there and does not inspire hope that those fighting to address this obviously harmful and racebased status quo will do anything. And although our President has dubbed himself the ‘‘Law and Order President,’’ he has not taken the initiative to end this unfair policy. Just very briefly before I close, Mr. Speaker, I want to list three things that this bipartisan group found would be helpful: One, we should eliminate Federal mandatory minimum sentencing requirements. We should ensure true sentencing parity among crack and cocaine offenses, and deprioritize nonviolent drug offenders and seek medical treatment. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, as usual, Congresswoman MOORE really gets to the point, and I have watched in the short period of time and knew her on the State level as we dealt in the legislature. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ), someone who is very sharp and quick with his tongue. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Congressman DWIGHT EVANS , for anchoring this Special Order hour, the subject of which is Root Out Racism, #rootoutracism. It is a sensitive topic, somewhat uncomfortable for people, both Black and White, or shall I say darkskinned and lightskinned. b2000 It is an uncomfortable subject, and no one wants to be accused of being a racist. It has all kinds of emotional connotations and negative connotations, as it should. Because what racism actually is, is a belief, or a doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievements, usually involving the idea that one’s own race is superior, and has the right to rule others. So in other words, what racism is, is a concept that one believes that their race is superior to the race of someone else. And how racism manifests itself in America, historically, has been that if you are a racist, you are a White person, and you believe that your race is superior to that of a darkskinned person, a Black person. That has been how racism has unfolded here in America since the White man came to America. Of course, when Christopher Columbus, an AngloSaxon from Spain, came to America and discovered America, America was populated, at that time, by what we called the Red man, the Indian, a darkskinned individual—darker than the AngloSaxon. And so this country has a history of mistreating people severely who are of a different color than white. First, it was the Indians. The feeling was that the European was superior to the Native American. That is the bottom line. Now, also, on that ship coming over in 1607, landing at Jamestown, Virginia, were some indentured servants, some of whom were darkskinned people. Racism was not necessarily a part of slavery, or indentured servitude, but racism was used to ensure that the multitudes of darkskinned people who were brought over here from Africa, who outnumbered in the South the number of Europeans, or White people there, racism was used to keep those Black people in their place. In other words, it was not indentured servitude. It was racism based on the subjugation of one group of people, or one race of people by another race of people because the race of people doing the subjugation impressed upon themselves and their children that those darkskinned people are beneath us. And so slavery became an institution, as did racism. Those ideas of racial superiority still exist today, but it is so sensitive for people to talk about the fact that racism still exists, and even more uncomfortable when someone is accused of being a racist. What is a racist? A racist is a person who believes in racism; the doctrine that the human race is superior, and that one’s race is superior to that of another. That is a racist. The problem is, when we don’t understand that we are racists. Now, some even say that folks like Black Lives Matter are racists. But that cannot be further from the truth because Black Lives Matter activists are not saying that Blacks are superior to Whites. They are, in fact, saying that all lives are equal; that Black lives matter. So you can’t call a Black person a racist when they are not proclaiming their race to be greater than the White race. No. Racism tends to rear its ugly head in America when White people use it to preserve their position on top, superior. And that is what Make America Great Again was all about. It really wasn’t make America great again. It was make America White again. That is what the message was. The message was a racist message. It began 4 or 5 years ago when our President started this rumor that President Obama was not an American; he was not one of us; he was from Africa. That is appealing to the subliminal messaging, that subliminal messaging that has been implanted in each one of us since we were born. White folks have been led to believe that they are superior. Now, I am not accusing all White people of being racists, but I think it is a question that all White people have to ask themselves, whether or not they harbor feelings of superiority. Because I do know that when we look at the mass media, the images that Black folks get of themselves by looking at the media are that we are inferior. That is what is implanted in us. That is the legacy of slavery, the legacy of racism and slavery, and it has implanted in our minds that we are inferior. And we have to fight feelings of inferiority just to feel equal. White people, on the other hand, have been implanted with the theory that they are superior. And so this is the American society that we live in. When President Trump, 4 or 5 years ago, accused President Obama of not being an American, not being one of us, and being from Africa, it was code to provoke the racist instincts in people who harbor them. And not all White people harbor that. That is not the point that I am making. But the point is, there was an appeal made to those instincts. That instinct was further aggravated by the insinuation that President Obama was a Muslim; he is not one of us. It is almost dehumanizing. And so that was the code word. Then, when he descended those steps at the Trump Tower and said that all Mexicans were racists and murderers, that was another appeal to the racist instincts in people—in White people, not Black people, not Hispanics, but in White people. And so playing the racist game is what got President Trump elected, bottom line. And so now that he is in office, we see all kinds of racist policies coming back to fruition. My colleagues who have spoken before me have talked about it: criminal justice, drugs in society, the prison industrial complex. They have talked about it. I am not going to point out or go over what they have said, but I will say that racism is alive and well in America. We will never be able to root it out until we all have a conversation with ourselves to ask ourselves, and to probe our own minds and souls to determine whether or not we feel that we are superior, whether or not we place ourselves in line before others just because that is the way it has always been, and we want to make America great again. It is something that we have to think about. It is something that we have to discuss. I, for one, love my fellow man regardless of color, and I know that even many people who don’t know that they are racists love their brothers and sisters, and so they will at least sit down and talk. That is what I have to do as a Black man, is to talk with as many people of different colors as I can to show them my humanity, to let them know that I appreciate their humanity, and that I love them. Maybe through love, we will be able to overcome the scourge of racism that is historical here in America and that is alive, well, and in living color today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman because he speaks truth to power. He does not bite his tongue. 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, the next person is a rare blend of poise, grace, and elegance. In the short period of time I have had the pleasure working with her, she has been a gentlewoman, but she has been a very powerful voice. Those who watched her in the last month, she has fought for Hurricane Harvey funding, but she has also done her job. She has been extremely sophisticated. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of Texas and city of Houston (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for guiding us and providing us an opportunity to really speak from the heart. I, likewise, want to acknowledge the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus for his leadership as well, Chairman RICHMOND , and, of course, Congressman EVANS , Congressman VEASEY , and Congresswoman B EATTY , who are conducting this CBC Special Order. I would also like to ask for them to beg my pardon for I wish to start with a commentary on those who are suffering and to bring attention to our friends in the Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico. Before I came on the floor, the cable news was reporting again the kinds of vision—or the kinds of visions and scenes that we had in the early stages of Hurricane Harvey: Come help me; but also a reminder of those in Katrina with the big, large sign: Is somebody going to help me? Now, in Puerto Rico, where I am understanding in many parts of Puerto Rico, no government help has come, probably the same in St. Croix. The picture I have here is a picture in my congressional district where we were attempting and did rescue about 60 people who were surrounded by water and certainly concerned, as others were, having to flee for their lives and looking for high ground. I am going to leave this picture up, because I would not want my comments going forward to suggest in any way that we are not concerned about those who are unhoused in Houston, Harris County, Port Arthur, Beaumont, and beyond; of course, in Florida; of course, in the Virgin Islands; and the cry for help in Puerto Rico. So I want to simply say that we in the government have to do our job. We have got to move faster, and we cannot move by Republican proposals for tax relief. We have to do this Democrats and Republicans. Work with us to craft the kind of language and relief that will provide these people with immediate housing resources. These are people without liability insurance. These are people in apartments where apartment owners are moving slowly to restore their apartments. b2015 They need cash. They need the distribution of the millions of dollars that all of this representation of people raising money. There needs to be a pool for housing. We need to give a cash allotment so that someone can get into a clean apartment or they can begin to get their items out of the stores—I don’t want to call names—that you go and get wood and begin to fix your homes. This becomes a race issue. My colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus are really the ones who are going to be—along with a bipartisan effort, and our leader and our whip in the Democratic Caucus and working with the Speaker and the whip and the majority leader, let’s get on with it. They actually need direct funding. This is a backdrop of the words that I want to be able to speak of as I talk about the tragedy of which brings us to the floor. Here is another example of people under water. This is happening all over in these stormravaged places. Yet we have to come to the floor to speak about an unnecessary distraction. While there is a fastmoving target toward North Korea by the boisterous words that have been coming out of the White House so that we might enter into an accidental war with North Korea, all I will say about that is: I don’t know if the White House, the Commander in Chief, has been to the DMZ, but I have. I have looked a North Korean soldier in the eye, and that is what our soldiers do every day on that DMZ standing in the gap. Boisterous attacking and credulous language only will lead us into an accidental war. I further want to indicate that if there is ever a bill among others that continues to speak to Americans from all backgrounds, minorities in particular, that you are not prepared to address the healthcare of people who are in desperate need who have preexisting conditions. It is, though well meaning, the GrahamCassidy bill, another false attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act. Having met with health professionals today, I will tell you: between diabetes, sickle cell anemia, kidney disease, and prostate cancer, they cannot afford the GrahamCassidy bill. Get on with it. Support the Affordable Care Act, because it becomes a race issue. The predominant number of individuals impacted by prostate cancer and diabetes are African American. So I want to ask: What is going on in this atmosphere of the Commander in Chief? I try to understand it because, from my perspective, this is dangerous ground. It is particularly dangerous in setting the tone on the whole issue of race in America. Who is the guiding force of setting the tone for race in America? It is, in fact, the leader of this country. It is disappointing that the words that were said by the White House, this President, does not recognize that African Americans have been in the United States military. It does not recognize that, in fact, we are the most patriotic group. And in being patriotic, we take no backseat to the respect we have for the flag. I came down to the floor so that I could be standing behind the flag. My back is to the flag. Am I protesting the flag? Am I burning the flag? I abhor burning the flag. I abhor the destruction of the flag. But I respect silent protests. It bothers me that the one who is so boisterous would have top advisers and Cabinet picks that have histories of prejudice. A person who leads the country denied responsibility of racist incidents that followed his election. He launched a travel ban on targeting Muslims. He attacked the Muslim Gold Star parents. He claimed a judge was biased because he was a Mexican American. The Justice Department sued his company twice for not renting to Black people. This is not a mirage. This is not a rumor. These are facts. In fact, discrimination against Black people has been a pattern throughout this leader’s life. He refused to immediately condemn the White supremacists who advocated for him. He questioned whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States not for 1 year, but year after year after year, to the point that I was embarrassed for the former President of the United States, not him. He treats racial groups as monoliths. He trashed Native Americans and encouraged the mob anger that resulted in the wrongful imprisonment of five young minority boys in the tragedy of the Central Park rape. They were not guilty. He took out a fullpage ad in The New York Times wrongly and asked for their execution, the death penalty to those who are not guilty. He condoned the beating of a Black Lives Matter protester. He called supporters who beat up a homeless Latino man passionate. He stereotyped Jews and shared an antiSemitic image created by supremacists. So now we defend him even more. Now we suggest that he is playing to his base, that it is okay, and that there are people who believe in what he is saying. There is a percentage of Americans who believe that we should not kneel during the national anthem. These are nothing but things that represent democracy. Democracy is living 
and breathing. It is in your heart, your mind, and your soul. I am an American because of her values. The national anthem was written by a man, and we sing it with pride. But it is not God. The flag is not God. It is a symbol of the democracy, the Constitution, and the freedom of speech that is given. Let me be very clear: none of those football players and others desecrated the flag. They did not spit on it. They did not burn it. They did not desecrate it. So I came tonight to suggest that there are still two Americas, because it does not seem that there is any understanding of the heroism of people of color. And I have to talk particularly about African Americans who served in the United States military. Crispus Attucks was an iconic patriot engaging in a protest in 1770. He was shot by royalist soldiers in the Boston Massacre. Does the White House know Crispus Attucks? Does he know those who have come through the ages, who fought for the Union in the Civil War? Yet, in doing so, the treatment of African Americans continued to be dastardly violent into the lynchings of the 1900s. Yet we remain patriotic. All we ask is the doors of opportunity be opened and that our leaders respect us. So let me say to those who don’t understand that the First Amendment does not in any way define ‘‘do not stand for’’ or ‘‘do stand for the national anthem and the flag.’’ There is nothing in the law that indicates that these individuals are desecrating the flag. I join with the statements of Commissioner Roger Goodell. I join with the statement of the Texans by Bob McNair. I join the Seattle statement— the most potent statement—that talks about the facts that these individuals have a right to express themselves. But I do not join with the President, who would say: Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, Get that son of a B off the field; out; he is fired; he is fired? I join with our NFL. Do you know what you are saying? You are talking about AfricanAmerican mothers. You are calling them a son of a B. You are calling those children’s mother—single mothers sometimes; mothers who have fought to overcome to get their children where they could be—and these boys—and I’m going to call them that—who have gone out to the community and tried to be of good conscience, you have said that their mother is a son of a B. That is racist. If you don’t understand that that is racist—as a mom, I come to this floor and I say to the mothers of those children: I love your sons. Thank you to the NFL and the owners who stood up. Thank you to those who are not African American, who joined with their fellow brothers on the field and knelt— not in desecration of the national anthem, not in desecration of the blood that was shed by the soldiers who are on battlefields; some of them supporting and shouting for those NFL in terms of the brotherhood. We will never dishonor our military. How can we? We are the military. We are everything. We are integrated into the American society. We simply ask for the dignity of respect to not call our mothers a son of a B. If they kneel—I heard a young man who is an NFL player say that he will kneel from now on, and the only reason he is doing it is because someone has the lack of judgment to provoke the situation and call their mothers a name. I refuse to accept that as a standard of leadership for the highest office in the world. Even if you never understand it, sir, if you think you are playing to your base, if you are not the unifier, then we will continue to stand in the gap, and racism is going to be under our foot. Do you know where else it is going to be? It is going to be under our knee because we in the Congressional Black Caucus have always stood for what is right. There is no basis in the First Amendment that says that you cannot kneel during the national anthem or in front of the flag. Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of press. Prohibition against abridging freedom of speech applies to Congress and State and local governments through the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. Speech may be abridged in two distinct ways: directly by regulating content of speech; indirectly by regulating time, manner, and place. So you cannot abridge by standing up with tweets. You cannot abridge without law and regulation. There is no regulation that says that these young men cannot stand against the dishonoring of their mothers by saying: Fire the son of a B. You tell me which of those children’s mothers are a son of a B. That is racism. You cannot deny it. You cannot run from it. I kneel in honor of them. I kneel in front of the flag and on this floor. I kneel in honor of the First Amendment. I kneel because the flag is a symbol for freedom. I kneel because I am going to stand against racism. I kneel because I will stand with those young men, I will stand with our soldiers, and I will stand with America. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee; Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, and the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus, I rise today to express my views regarding the President’s most recent racially inflammatory statements and actions. On Election Night the PresidentElect pledged to the nation that he would be a president to all Americans. The President has failed spectacularly to keep that promise and his pledge rings hollow to tens of millions of Americans. Last Friday, in Huntsville, Alabama, a state that was a capitol of the Confederacy, and the locus of some many seminal events in American history and the Civil Rights Movement, that one of his fondest wishes, saying: 
Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out. He’s fired. He’s fired!’’ You know, some owner is going to do that. He’s going to say, ‘‘That guy that disrespects our flag, he’s fired.’’ And that owner, they don’t know it. They don’t know it. They’ll be the most popular person, for a week. They’ll be the most popular person in this country. 
The President’s remarks are wrong and display a shocking lack of understanding of the U.S. Constitution, the role of nonviolent civil disobedience in bringing about social change, and the latest example of him falling short in upholding the honor of office. These are the subjects I will address in my remarks this evening. Trump Racial History 1. African Americans in military; 2. Name Trump called NFL players is offensive 3. Nonviolent protest is protected speech under the 1st Amendment GrahamCassidy Is Worst Obamacare Repeal Attempt Yet Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me share with our colleagues 5 Ways the GrahamCassidy healthcare repeal bill puts Medicaid Coverage At Risk and is a disaster for Americans. The GrahamCassidy proposal goes beyond the American Health Care Act (AHCA) passed by the House in May and the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) that failed in the Senate in July. The GrahamCassidy proposal revamps and cuts Medicaid, redistributes federal funds across states, and eliminates coverage for millions of poor Americans as described below: Ends federal funding for current ACA coverage and partially replaces that funding with a block grant that expires after 2026. The proposal ends both the authority to cover childless adults and funding for the ACA Medicaid expansion that covers 15 million adults. Under GrahamCassidy, a new block grant, the ‘‘MarketBased Health Care Grant Program,’’ combines federal funds for the ACA Medicaid expansion, premium and cost sharing subsidies in the Marketplace, and states’ Basic Health Plans for 2020–2026. Capped nationally, the block grant would be lower than ACA spending under current law and would end after 2026. States would need to replace federal dollars or roll back coverage. Neither the AHCA nor the BCRA included expiration dates for ACArelated federal funds or eliminated the ability for states to cover childless adults through Medicaid. Massively redistributes federal funding from Medicaid expansion states to nonexpansion states through the block grant program penalizing states that broadened coverage. In 2020, block grant funds would be distributed based on federal spending in states for ACA Medicaid and Marketplace coverage. By 2026, funding would go to states according to the states’ portion of the population with incomes between 50% and 138% of poverty; the new allocation is phased in over the 2021– 2025 period. The Secretary has the authority to make other adjustments to the allocation. 
This allocation would result in a large redistribution of ACA funding by 2026, away from states that adopted the Medicaid expansion and redirecting funding to states that did not. No funding is provided beyond 2026. Prohibits Medicaid coverage for childless adults and allows states to use limited block grant funds to purchase private coverage for traditional Medicaid populations. States can use funds under the block grant to provide tax credits and/or costsharing reductions for individual market coverage, make direct payments to providers, or provide coverage for traditional Medicaid populations through private insurance. The proposal limits the amount of block grant funds that a state could use for traditional Medicaid populations to 15% of its allotment (or 20 percent under a special waiver). These limits would shift coverage and funds for many lowincome adults from Medicaid to individual market coverage. Under current law, 60 percent of federal ACA coverage funding is currently for the Medicaid expansion (covering parents and childless adults). Medicaid coverage is typically more comprehensive, less expensive and has more financial protections compared to private insurance. The proposal also allows states to roll back individual market protections related to premium pricing, including allowing premium rating based on health status, and benefits currently in the ACA. Caps and redistributes federal funds to states for the traditional Medicaid program for more than 60 million lowincome children, parents, people with disabilities and the elderly. Similar to the BCRA and AHCA, the proposal establishes a Medicaid per enrollee cap as the default for federal financing based on a complicated formula tied to different inflation rates. As a result, federal Medicaid financing would grow more slowly than estimates under current law. In addition to overall spending limits, similar to the BCRA, the proposal would give the HHS Secretary discretion to further redistribute capped federal funds across states by making adjustments to states with high or low per enrollee spending. Eliminates federal funding for states to cover Medicaid family planning at Planned Parenthood clinics for one year. Additional funding restrictions include limits on states’ ability to use provider tax revenue to finance Medicaid as well as the termination of the enhanced match for the Community First Choice attendant care program for seniors and people with disabilities. Enrollment barriers include the option for states to condition Medicaid eligibility on a work requirement and to conduct more frequent redeterminations. Much is at stake for lowincome Americans and states in the GrahamCassidy proposal. That is why I strongly urge our Senate colleagues to reject this latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  articles, statements, and tweets regarding this topic. 
[From the Huffington Post, Aug. 14, 2017] HEREARE16 T IMES TRUMP EMBRACED RACISM  
CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS  (By Lydia O’Connor, Daniel Marans) Examples of Trump’s racism dating as far back as the 1970s. 1. Some of his top advisers and cabinet picks have histories of prejudice 2. Trump denied responsibility for the racist incidents that followed his election 3. He launched a travel ban targeting Muslims 4. He attacked Muslim Gold Star parents 5. He claimed a judge was biased because ‘‘he’s a Mexican’’ 6. The Justice Department sued his company—twice—for not renting to black people 7. In fact, discrimination against black people has been a pattern throughout Trump’s career 8. He refused to immediately condemn the white supremacists who advocated for him 9. He questioned whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States 10. He treats racial groups as monoliths 11. He trashed Native Americans, too 12. He encouraged the mob anger that resulted in the wrongful imprisonment of the Central Park Five 13. He condoned the beating of a Black Lives Matter protester 14. He called supporters who beat up a homeless Latino man ‘‘passionate’’ 15. He stereotyped Jews and shared an anti Semitic image created by white supremacists 16. He treats AfricanAmerican supporters as tokens to dispel the idea he is racist MILITARY HISTORY OF AFRICAN AMERICANS  The Military history of African Americans spans from the arrival of the first black slaves during the colonial history of the United States to the present day. In every war fought by or within the United States, African Americans participated, including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the MexicanAmerican War, the Civil War, the SpanishAmerican War, the World Wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as other minor conflicts. 
TEXANS RELEASE STATEMENT  ‘‘The NFL specifically, and football in general, has always unified our communities and families. The comments made by the President were divisive and counterproductive to what our country needs right now. I hope the reaction from our players results in positive action for our league, our communities and our country as a whole to make a positive difference in our society. Texans players are caring, intelligent men who do so much good, as was shown in the past month when our city was devastated by Hurricane Harvey. I have never been more proud of our players and our team than during this time. It was a display of what is truly possible when we all work together. We will continue to support our players to work together to promote the values of respect and unity.’’ 
COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL  The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture. There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we’ve experienced over the last month. Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities. 
NEW YORK GIANTS CO OWNER ’S JOHN MARA AND  
STEVE TISCH  ‘‘Comments like we heard last night from the president are inappropriate, offensive and divisive. We are proud of our players, the vast majority of whom use their NFL platform to make a positive difference in our society.’’ 
INDIANAPOLIS COLTS OWNER JIM IRSAY  ‘‘I am troubled by the President’s recent comments about our league and our players. Sports in America have the unique ability to bring people from all walks of life and from different points of view together to work toward or root for a common goal, and the Indianapolis Colts are proud to be a part of that tradition in our home city and state. The vast majority of players in the NFL—especially those who have worn and continue to wear the Horseshoe—have donated millions of dollars to charities, raised money for 
those affected by recent hurricanes, created charitable foundations, visited schools, mentored students, worked in homeless shelters, cleaned up parks, and put in hours of their personal time toward improving their communities and the lives of those around them. That’s the spirit in which this nation was founded, and we all need to work tirelessly to bring people together to take on the challenges that face us and give back to the people of our communities. More so than any result on the field, that is a common goal worth rooting for.’’ 
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS HEAD COACH PETE CARROLL  ‘‘In this incredibly polarizing time, there’s no longer a place to sit silently. It’s time to take a stand. We stand for love and justice and civility. We stand for our players and their constitutional rights, just as we stand for equality for all people. We stand against divisiveness and hate and dehumanization. We are in the midst of a tremendously challenging time, a time longing for healing. Change needs to happen; we will stand for change. May we all have the courage to take a stand for our beliefs while not diminishing the rights of others, as this is the beating heart of our democracy. As a team, we are united in a mission to bring people together to help create positive change. We can no longer remain silent. I will stand with our players.’’

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President, and to direct their remarks to the Chair. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, back in March, the Congressional Black Caucus met with President Trump to deliver a 130page policy document which highlighted a host of issues facing the black community in America. From voting rights to criminal justice reform, and economic justice to education and the workforce, there are many areas of society that still experience elements of institutionalized racism and discrimination against people of color and other vulnerable segments of the population. The undermining of the Voting Rights Act in the wake of the Shelby County Supreme Court decision paved the way for countless states, including Texas, to adopt discriminatory voting laws that were aimed at disenfranchising entire segments of the population. Participation in our elections and the inalienable right to vote are fundamental pillars of our democracy. Our democracy does not function properly without the successful and unimpeded participation of the voting public. Yet, these discriminatory voting laws have been found to do exactly that, while disproportionately affecting minority populations, the elderly, and the poor. The criminal justice system is another area that is ripe for reform as we consider the fact that African Americans make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population, yet account for 37 percent of prison inmates. In some instances, harsh mandatory minimum sentences condemn relatively minor criminals to a life behind bars. In other examples, we see nonviolent drug offenders facing decades in prison over a crime that is better addressed by health professionals, not the criminal justice system. The use of private prisons in states such as Texas has also created a dangerous profit motive behind keeping individuals incarcerated. These toxic conditions are a recipe for disaster that has propelled the United States as the world leader for its prison population rate. Mr. Speaker, there is much that we can do as a nation to root out any last remnants of racism in our country and address many of these issues. However, it requires the participation and cooperation of a wide range of stakeholder, regardless of party affiliation or background. Restoring Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act through legislation would help address many of the discriminatory voting laws that we have seen emerge, thereby restoring full access to voting for every American. Eliminating mandatory minimum sentencing and treating nonviolent drug offenses as a health issue instead of a criminal matter would help reduce the prison population while giving law abiding citizens a welldeserved second chance. These are tangible steps that we can take today to lessen the racial disparities that exist in our society. I encourage each of my colleagues to work cooperatively to achieve this end. The American people demand it, and we will be a better nation for it. f
