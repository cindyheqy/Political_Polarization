Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise and note the celebration that we will be having not only for the birth of Christ for the month of December, but on December 10, this coming Sunday, I will celebrate the First Baptist Church in Rock Hill, South Carolina, under the leadership of Reverend Steve Hogg. b1015 Let me give you a little background on the church and on Reverend Hogg. Reverend Hogg was born on January 14, 1958, in Roxana, Kentucky. I think his birthday will signify his 60th in January. He married Monieca on March 27, 1982. They have two children, Steven and Jacqueline. The history of his service began in February of 1977 to November of 1977, where he was bus minister of the First Baptist Church in Whitesburg, Kentucky. From there he went to the Summer Missionary, First Baptist Church, from 1977 to 1980 and 1983. He was pastor of the Colson Baptist Mission from November of 1977 to March of 1984. He then went and served as pastor of the Bethel Baptist Church from March of 1984 to December of 1987, where he began his ministry in the First Baptist Church in Rock Hill, South Carolina, in December of 1987. Let me just give you a couple of milestones for the church. First Baptist Church relocated in April of 2004 to an 84,000 squarefoot phase 1 facility on 52 acres of land near I–77. Let me tell you, as a developer, we were involved in that area, and there were no shopping centers when the church moved out there. There were no hotels when the church moved there. There were no gas stations where the church moved. They literally moved out in an area of town on faith that this area was going to be where the church wanted to grow, and grow it has. The church budget has increased from $490,000 to $2,637,000. They have had over 1,500 baptisms. They sponsored the first AfricanAmerican congregation for membership in the York 
Baptist Association. They sponsored a second AfricanAmerican congregation for membership in the York Baptist Association. Reverend Hogg has had a long and distinguished service to our State and country. He has served as president under the South Carolina Baptist Convention in 1993 to 1994. He served as the second vice president in 1992 to 1993. He has been chairman of the United Christian Baccalaureate Planning Committee. He has served on the executive committee of the Billy Graham Carolinas Crusade. He is a charter member of the city of Rock Hill No Room for Racism Board. He is the cofounder and State codirector of Changing South Carolina which led a movement to ban video poker. The activities of the church that he has started include many contemporary worship services, the intercessory prayer ministry, and a ministry for the deaf. He started the television broadcasts of morning services, and he has livestreaming of the worship services. He has conducted eight capital fund campaigns. I could go on and on. It has been such a pleasure seeing this church grow. I forgot to mention that when they decided to move to this new area of town, he didn’t go with just a simple majority for the board of directors of the First Baptist Church. It had to be 80 percent or greater. How democratic is that? It has been said that to be successful, you must have three things. You must have a self worth living with, you must have a work worth living for, and you must have a faith worth living by. Reverend Hogg has demonstrated he has had a successful life, and he continues to have a successful life. Godspeed for the First Baptist Church in Rock Hill, South Carolina. 
DACA RECIPIENTS LOSE THEIR PROTECTION FROM DEPORTATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, every day that Congress does not pass the Dream Act, 122 DACA recipients lose their protection from deportation. That is 122 every day—young people who arrived in the U.S. as children, have gone through multiple background checks, and have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years. Every week that passes, nearly 1,000 DACA recipients lose their protection from deportation. By Christmas, the number of DACA recipients who will have lost protection will reach 13,492. But now we are hearing that we may have a shortterm CR or a series of CRs and that the whole budget and funding debate may get kicked down the road to next year when all 800,000 young immigrants who signed up for DACA begin losing their status. Mr. Speaker, with Republicans in control of the House, Senate, and White House, I am pretty sure you will not need my vote to pass the next budget. So I will vote against any shortterm CR because I assume you have the votes to govern as you see fit no matter how much I and other Democrats disagree with your priorities on women, on children’s healthcare, the environment, or DREAMers. Now, if Republicans decide they do need help from Democrats to approve a budget, they know where to find us, and we are more than willing to help if what we are voting on meets minimal standards of priorities for the American people. For me and a lot of my colleagues, that means a vote on the Dream Act right now this year. The votes are here, the legislation is here, and the American people are already in support. So, Mr. Speaker, at some point, Republican leadership should just get out of the way and let America vote. That is what leadership, compromise, and bipartisanship look like. Now, we certainly know what it doesn’t look like. In the middle of the night last weekend, Republicans voted to give a tax cut to the richest Americans. They dressed it up as a tax cut for all of us—for everyone—but we all know that it is an obscene tax cut for the obscenely wealthy and rich in America. Not a single Democrat in either House supported it. This chart explains part of the reason. It is tremendously unpopular with the American people as the small slice in red on this chart shows us. According to a Gallup poll, just 29 percent of Americans support the Republican tax cut for billionaires and the multinational corporations. That is what partisanship looks like. So what does bipartisanship look like? It looks like the Dream Act. Overall, 86 percent of Americans support the Dream Act, a bill to legalize immigration status of immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. Yes, 86 percent. That is a big slice of red on the chart. That number comes—get this—from a FOX News poll, just in case you think I was using a partisan poll where they put their thumb on the scale to show things in my favor. Sixtythree percent of Trump voters back citizenship for the DREAMers. So here is a proposal supported by an overwhelming number of people, an overwhelming number of Republicans, and an overwhelming percentage of Trump voters. But we can’t get a vote. Yesterday, 34 Republicans in this body wrote to the Speaker asking him to please allow a vote and something to protect the DREAMers. Clearly, all 34 percent of those Republicans can read the chart in red. They want to do something that is both politically popular and the right thing to do from a moral standpoint. The reason Republican leaders will not allow a vote on the Dream Act, or at least are acting like they won’t, is because they know it will pass. So you take 34 Republicans who wrote the Speaker and add 194 Democrats, and do you know what you got? A majority of the House. For all of those Republicans who oppose the Dream Act, they get a Christmas present. They get to vote against it. What better way to associate yourself with the comments of your President on Mexicans, on Muslims, and on everything else than to vote against the Dream Act? So, Mr. Speaker, I urge you to let your Members vote against the Dream Act as an act of charity in the Christmas spirit. Republicans will get what most of them want: an opportunity to send a message to their base voters by voting on something the rest of us agree on—just like the tax bill—but this time, with the passage of the Dream Act, at least a majority of the American people will get something out of it, too. f 
THE DEVASTATION IN PUERTO RICO The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago, I was privileged to travel to Puerto Rico to meet with residents of the hardest hit areas of the island and to stand by them and serve them on Thanksgiving Day. The extent of the damage, Mr. Speaker, is vast and heartbreaking, and the road to recovery will be long and filled with challenges. I cannot begin to describe the devastation, but what I can describe is the enduring spirit and the shining optimism of all the people whom I met. I was inspired to see the way the community came together to help one another and the generosity with which people shared what little they had in order to make sure their neighbors were taken care of. I was fortunate to have the advice and counsel of constituents of mine, Pastor Harry Torres, from the Arriba P.R. Project, and Karen Rosado, from the Latino Alliance of Bucks County. With their help, I reported back to our community the needs of our fellow citizens to better tailor our community’s efforts to provide relief to the people of Puerto Rico. The people of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States of America. Let this Congress not forget that. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, I was honored to welcome a group of passionate, well spoken, and civicminded young constituents to our Nation’s Capitol. Along with the Bucks County Chapter of the NAACP and the Peace Center, these students spoke to me on the floor of the House of Representatives testifying about their experiences battling discrimination in all forms as they work to create a more inclusive society. Our team was deeply moved by the stories of these young people. In the 
IMPEACHMENT BEGINS TODAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, again, I am honored to be accorded the privilege of standing in the well of the Congress of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, the American poet, Robert Frost, penned a poem with the words: ‘‘Two roads diverged in the woods, and I took the one less traveled. ...  ’ ’  Mr. Speaker, in a metaphorical sense today, sometime after noon, shortly after 12 p.m., I will take the road less traveled. Mr. Speaker, I ask that no one take this journey with me. I am absolutely convinced that this is a road worth traveling, but I have not asked that others travel this road and will not. Mr. Speaker, after noon today, I will present Articles of Impeachment. There are many who want to know: What is next? What will happen after there is a vote? Mr. Speaker, I will satiate those concerns after the vote. But I will take the road less traveled, and I believe that it will make all the difference. 
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, several times over my 29 years in Congress, I have wondered whether there are any fiscal conservatives at the Pentagon. It seems that the Defense Department is just like every other gigantic bureaucracy. When it comes to money, the refrain is always more, more, more. On November 14, the House passed what one Capitol Hill paper described as a $700 billion compromise Defense bill. It was $80 billion over the budget caps and many billions more than even President Trump had requested. I opposed almost all the major initiatives of the Obama administration, but it was false to say that the Defense Department had been depleted or eviscerated during those years or that now we must rebuild the military. In fact, public relations experts in future years should conduct studies about how the Defense Department has been able to convince the public it has been cut when it is now getting more money than ever. b1030 Defense Department appropriations have more than doubled since 2000. In addition, the Department has gotten extra billions in several supplemental or emergency appropriations bills. The military construction bill is a separate bill that has added another $109.5 billion over the last 10 years. It would be hard to find any U.S. military base anyplace in the world that has not had several new buildings constructed over the last few years. In fiscal year 2016, we spent over $177 billion on new equipment, tanks, guns, et cetera. We have spent similar amounts for many years. Most of this equipment does not wear out or have to be replaced after just 1 year. It is ironic that the only President in the last 60 or 70 years who has tried to rein in defense spending is the only President in that period who spent most of his career in the military. In Evan Thomas’ book, ‘‘Ike’s Bluff,’’ when told by his top staffer that he could not reduce defense spending, President Eisenhower said if he gave another star to every general who cut his budget, ‘‘there would be such a rush to cut costs, you’ll have to get out of the way.’’ The book also quotes Eisenhower as saying: ‘‘Heaven help us if we ever have a President who doesn’t know as much about the military as I do.’’ Therein lies an explanation for a big part of what has caused much excessive and/or wasteful defense spending and the willingness, even at times eagerness, to go to war and support permanent, neverending wars. Only 18 percent of the current Congress has ever served in any branch of the military. Members are afraid that if they do not vote for an increase in defense spending or if they question waste by the military, some demagogue will accuse them of ‘‘not supporting the troops.’’ It would be a huge understatement to say that I usually do not agree with New York Times editorials, but the editorial board, on October 22, published an editorial entitled ‘‘America’s Forever Wars,’’ pointing out that ‘‘the United States has been at war continuously since the attacks of 9/11’’ and now has ‘‘troops in at least 172 countries. . . .’’ The board wrote that so far, the American people have ‘‘seemed to accept’’ all this militarism, but ‘‘it’s a very real question whether, in addition to endorsing these commitments, which have cost trillions of dollars and many lives over 16 years, they will embrace new entanglements. . . .’’ The New York Times added that ‘‘Congress has spent little time considering such issues in a comprehensive way or debating why all these deployments are needed.’’ Backing these words up was a cartoon in the October 25 issue of Politico, a Capitol Hill newspaper. The cartoon showed six Senators sitting at a hearing. The first Senator, reading a newspaper, says: Who knew we had troops in Niger? The second says: Heck, we don’t even know how the military budget gets spent. Finally, the cartoon shows a Senator saying: War is hell. I say we just give the Pentagon an extra $80 billion and call it a day. Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen, himself a veteran, as am I, wrote on October 23: ‘‘But there is something else at work here: the slavish veneration now accorded the military. You can see it every time someone in uniform testifies before Congress.’’ Since now that less than 1 percent of the people serve in the military, it may be that many people who never served feel, perhaps even subconsciously, that they must bend over backwards to show their patriotism. However, it is not unpatriotic to oppose wasteful defense spending or very unnecessary permanent, forever wars. President Reagan once said: ‘‘Our troops should be committed to combat abroad only as a last resort, when no other choice is available.’’ We have far too many leaders today who seem to want to be new Winston Churchills and who are far too eager to send people to war. No true fiscal conservative could ever justify spending many billions more than even President Trump requested. Our national debt recently went over the $20 trillion level. A few days ago, it was reported that the deficit for fiscal year 2017 was $666 billion. This fiscal year, it may be even higher. Conservatives used to be against huge deficit spending. They also used to be against massive foreign aid. Much of what we have been doing in both Iraq and Afghanistan, training police and farmers, repairing electrical and water systems, even making small business loans, is pure foreign aid. Many of our foreign interventions have been done under the auspices or authority of the United Nations. Conservatives used to be the biggest critics of the U.N. and world government. Most of our socalled ‘‘coalitions’’ have been funded almost entirely by American taxpayers. Most interventionists at some point resort to a slur referring to their opponents as isolationists. This is so false. Traditional conservatives support trade and tourism and cultural and educational exchanges with other countries and they agree with helping during humanitarian crises. They just don’t believe in dragging war out forever, primarily so defense contractors, think tanks, and military bureaucrats can get more money. One last point: We have far too many officers. In Scott Berg’s biography on Woodrow Wilson, it says during World War I, we had one officer for every 30 enlisted men. Eisenhower once said we had too many officers when there were nine enlisted for every 
officer. Now we have one officer for only four and a half to five and a half enlisted (varies by branch). This is very expensive, both for active duty and retirement, but it also makes it much more likely that we will get involved in every little conflict around the world and/or continue basing troops in almost every country. We simply do not have enough money to pay for defense of so many countries other than our own nor the authority under our Constitution to try to run the whole world. 
NAFTA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD) for 5 minutes. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, the American economy stands today at a crucial moment. With globalization and advancement in technology, the world economy continues to become more intertwined than ever, as countries trade goods and services at rates never seen before. It is easy to look at this change and turn inward in an attempt to shore up America’s position in the world economy, but that will only set us up for more struggles down the line. Here in America, we make and produce the best goods in the world, but tariffs and regulations put American goods at a disadvantage in too many countries. That is why it is so crucial we continue to support free and fair trade, working to better our trade agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, to help American businesses and families. In my district, Illinois’ 18th Congressional district, agriculture remains the largest portion of our economy. In fact, we are the eighth largest agriculture district in the country. Some of the most fertile farmland in the entire world is located in the 18th District. As great as the products we grow may be, our farmers and agriculture industry must have markets to sell their goods. That is why free trade agreements like NAFTA come in, removing barriers that allow our corn and soybeans to be sold all over the world at competitive prices. Since the implementation of NAFTA, American agriculture exports have more than quadrupled from $8.9 million to $38 billion annually, bringing more money back to our rural and agriculture communities. It is so important that this amount of money comes back to our district and it is the reason why our agriculture sector now supports over 21 million jobs here at home. Other sectors of our economy are just as affected by trade, especially in manufacturing. With 95 percent of the world’s consumers living outside of the United States, protectionist tariffs and policies in other countries put American goods at a disadvantage. Since NAFTA’s implementation, we have seen these barriers come down and more markets opening up to our exports. That is why our trade agreement partners receive half of all exports of American manufactured goods. The benefits of this are passed on to hardworking families, with jobs linked to trade paying 15 to 20 percent more and accounting for more than 38 million jobs across our country. While NAFTA and free trade have allowed for this kind of prosperity and growth, we must also be mindful of the problems that can arise. For example, recent Canadian policies creating quotas for American poultry and dairy have threatened those industries here at home. That is why it is time to take a fresh look at our trade agreements, not with an eye to withdrawing from the global economy, but with the goal of making our trade fairer and better. As President Trump and his team continue to renegotiate the terms of the NAFTA deal, it is my hope that they can keep in mind the businesses, farming operations, and families of districts like Illinois’ 18th. Free trade is a winwin for our Nation, and it is vital that we work hard to make these agreements fairer to keep America at the forefront of the world economy. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky) at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving God, thank You for giving us another day. We thank You on this day for the example of St. Nicholas, who fed the hungry, brought hope to the imprisoned, gave comfort to the lost, and taught the truth to all. May all who work here in the people’s House strive to imitate him by putting You first in all we do. Give us the courage, love, and strength of St. Nicholas so that, like him, we may serve You through our service to all our brothers and sisters. May all that we do be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. O’HALLERAN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in continued opposition to the Republican tax plan. Earlier this week, the House of Representatives agreed to go to conference with the Senate on H.R. 1, which gives breaks to the wealthy and corporations at the expense of the needs of the American family. This bill eliminates deductions used by those who need it most: students, teachers, veterans, the 
sick, and families that are struggling to make ends meet. Yet, despite this elimination of numerous vital deductions that millions of families across this country rely on, the House and the Senate bill retained a deduction for golf course owners. If you own a golf course in America, your deductions are kept; but if you are a student and you get a scholarship, you are going to have to pay taxes on that. So if I were a student, I get it twice. We are looking at cutting the Pell grants and we are looking at taxing what students get, yet if you own a golf course where this game is played, you get a deduction. I am sorry, but I don’t think that is fair. 
AMERICANS DISAPPROVE OF MEDIA COVERAGE (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, according to a new Quinnipiac poll, 58 percent of Americans disapprove of the media’s coverage of the President. Only 38 percent approve. It is no surprise why the American people disapprove of the media’s coverage. A few weeks ago, CBS Evening News ran a lengthy story mocking President Trump for taking a sip of water during the middle of a speech. To date, the broadcast networks of ABC, CBS, and NBC have spent over 12 hours on an unproven TrumpRussia connection while only devoting 4
1⁄2 minutes to the Clinton uranium scandal involving Russia. Newsweek published a headline accusing Ivanka Trump of plagiarism because she used a sentence from a previous speech. Newsweek should check the dictionary. It is not plagiarism if you use your own words. These are only three of many examples that account for why 58 percent of Americans disapprove of the media’s coverage. Their liberal bias is on display for all to see, and Americans are tired of it. 
PAYING RESPECTS TO GEORGE WILLIE, SR., OF LEUPP, ARIZONA (Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to a hero. George Willie, Sr., of Leupp, Arizona, passed away this week at the age of 92. He was a highly decorated Navajo Code Talker who served with the Second Marine Division from 1943 to 1946. According to his family, George delivered and received coded messages using the Navajo language at the Battle of Okinawa. His love for his family was unwavering and his commitment to his country was steadfast. Pat and I are keeping George’s wife, Emma; his 10 children; and his grandchildren in our prayers as they mourn his passing. A celebration of his life is scheduled for Friday at the First Presbyterian Church in Leupp, and George will be laid to rest with honors at the Veterans Memorial Cemetery at Camp Navajo. f 
PRESERVING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. Our bill allows lawabiding citizens who are qualified to carry concealed firearms in one State to also carry in other States that allow residents to do so. Constitutional rights do not end at State lines, and this must include an individual’s ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights. A recent survey shows that 73 percent of Americans agree and support concealed carry reciprocity. The current system is simply too confusing and, unfortunately, results in some concealed carry permit holders to unknowingly break the law and suffer arrest while preventing others from carrying across State lines at all. Our bill corrects this infringement on Americans’ Second Amendment rights and allows concealed carry permit holders the ability to travel freely between the States, just like a driver’s license. As a lifelong gun owner and fervent supporter of the Second Amendment, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill and empower law abiding citizens with the ability to exercise their constitutional rights as they travel across State lines. 
PRESERVING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads: ‘‘ . . . the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.’’ That right is a fundamental freedom guaranteed by our Bill of Rights. That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which protects the Second Amendment rights of all Americans. This legislation says that if you are qualified to carry a gun in your own State, then you can carry a gun in any State that has a similar law. This bill will eliminate significant obstacles to the right to keep and bear arms for millions of Americans in every State. Hoosiers get it. Lawabiding gun owners have a right to defend themselves, and that right should not end at the State line. I urge support for this legislation and I ask my colleagues to join me in doing more to uphold our Second Amendment rights. f 
PRESERVING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act as well. This commonsense legislation protects the constitutional right to bear arms by allowing qualified individuals to carry a concealed firearm across State lines. Our First Amendment rights to free speech don’t change when we cross State lines, and neither should our Second Amendment constitutional right to protect ourselves. Unfortunately for Marylanders, our right to bear arms is still heavily restricted by guncontrol liberals in our State legislature. Restricting the right to own firearms only hurts a lawabiding citizen’s right to defend herself. Cities like Baltimore and Chicago, with their outofcontrol murder rates despite their highly restrictive gun laws, are proof of that. Concealed carry reciprocity will make our country safer. Selfdefense is the top reason cited for owning a firearm, and concealed carry permit holders are certainly not to blame for our Nation’s violent crime problem. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 38 and protect our Second Amendment rights. 
TAX REFORM (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to praise the progress the Senate and the House has made toward passing tax reform for the American people. Our tax plan would roughly double the standard deduction, a deduction that 71 percent of Missourians use. When our tax bill passes, the simple truth is that it will allow Missouri families and families everywhere to take home more of their paychecks. Our tax plan will also be more fair, eliminating special interest loopholes and making it easier for average Americans to file taxes. Currently, our country spends a total of $378 billion per year filing tax returns. Our tax plan will change all that. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the final version of this bill so we can give Americans a great present by Christmas and watch our economy thrive. 
REMEMBERING ALFRED EARNEST PELLOW, FOUNDER OF VETS HONOR GUARD IN FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor Alfred Earnest Pellow, a resident of Franklin, Pennsylvania, who passed away last week at his home. Ernie, as he was called by family and friends, was involved in founding the Veterans Coalition and the VETS Honor Guard in Franklin. He was also deeply instrumental in bringing the Veterans Administration clinic to Franklin to care for our military men and women. The 79yearold was a U.S. Army peacetime veteran who served 37 months in Germany. In 1960, he married his wife, Joyce, with whom he spent 57 years of wedded bliss. He was a family man: a loving husband, brother, father, and grandfather. Ernie was a selfemployed building contractor. He received the Pennsylvania Builders of the Year Award in 1996 and Pennsylvania Builders Distinguished Achievement Award in 2014. A member of Masonic Blue Lodge and the York Rite, Ernie received his Masonic 50 year pin in 2015. Mr. Speaker, Ernie Pellow lived a life of service: service to his country, service to his community, and service to his family. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him. 
A RESOLUTION OF IMPEACHMENT (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, once again, I am accorded the preeminent privilege of addressing the House. I consider this one of the great honors of my life to be able to address the House of Representatives. Today, after this 1minute speech, Mr. Speaker, I will present a privileged resolution. I want to thank the many persons, especially my staff, who have assisted in the drafting and crafting of this resolution. I am grateful to the many persons who have supported me in many ways. 
b1230 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 38, CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 645 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on House Resolution 645, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit. Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from my fellow Judiciary Committee members, Chairman GOODLATTE , Ranking Member NADLER , as well as Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEEand others. Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEEhappens to be the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. Last month, the Judiciary Committee rigorously debated H.R. 38 and considered 22 amendments to this legislation. The committee also marked up and discussed H.R. 4477, the Fix NICS Act, which is incorporated into the Rules Committee print. I thank my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ), for introducing this legislation, which takes a commonsense approach and reflects our constitutional right to bear arms. Mr. Speaker, all of us in this body took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, and, as we all understand, the Constitution enshrines our right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment. Over the years, this right has been challenged in the courts and, in some cases, by public opinion. However, lest there be any question about the constitutionality of our right to keep and 
bear arms, let me remind my colleagues that the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, recognized, in a 2008 opinion, that ‘‘the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.’’ As the son of a Georgia State trooper, I learned to respect firearms at an early age, and I have shared that respect with my boys and daughter. As a Member of Congress, I believe I have a duty to uphold American liberties for current and future generations. I am a cosponsor of the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act because I believe constitutional rights extend past State lines. Mr. Speaker, the Bill of Rights isn’t a philosophical exercise; it is a document that protects the practical expression of liberties that our forefathers recognized as essential elements of our democracy. I, myself, have a concealed carry permit; and, as a husband and father, I have prioritized being able to defend my family and my home should the unthinkable happen. I am also a sportsman, a hunter, and an ardent defender of the Second Amendment; but, like many others, the primary purpose of owning and keeping a concealed carry permit is selfdefense. I don’t think that right should be undermined simply because I travel to another State. This bill upholds and recognizes State laws, while ensuring that driving across State lines to run an errand, go to work, or visit a relative doesn’t blot out an individual’s rights. Mr. Speaker, I will tell you a very recent story about how firearms can play a critical role in selfdefense and promote public safety. Just yesterday, in Dawson County, in a part of my district in northeast Georgia, a woman witnessed an individual attacking a sheriff’s deputy at a local gas station. The woman was in possession of a firearm and fired at the suspect. While details are still unfolding at this point, it highlights the benefits of a citizenry that is reasonably and responsibly armed. Contrary to the claims of Second Amendment detractors, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is not about expanding access to firearms or putting guns in the hands of criminals. On the contrary, the bill includes protections to uphold laws surrounding firearm possession and safeguards individuals’ ability to protect themselves and their neighbors. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act supports the Second Amendment rights of lawabiding Americans, and, importantly, it offers a solution to the current patchwork of State laws affecting concealed carry permits. Currently, all 50 States issue concealed carry permits in some capacity, but these laws leave citizens traveling across State lines to decipher a variety of State laws or risk inadvertently breaking the law. It is also worth noting that, of the States that have adopted rightto carry legislation, no State has repealed it. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, we simply have no evidence to indicate that concealed carry permit holders pose a risk to public safety. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act upholds States’ rights to establish their own permitting requirements, but it takes the commonsense step of allowing individuals who meet the criteria for concealed carry in their home States to bear arms in other States as long as they follow the local concealed carry laws of the State they are in at any given time. This bill doesn’t allow individuals who currently would be prohibited, under Federal law, from possessing firearms to obtain those weapons, and it doesn’t tell States how to regulate the use of firearms. It does, however, ensure that lawabiding citizens can protect themselves and exercise their Second Amendment rights when crossing State lines. Thirty States, including Georgia, already have ‘‘shall issue’’ permits, which require States to issue permits to individuals who meet the legal requirements for a concealed carry permit; eight States have ‘‘may issue’’ laws, which allow for discretionary permit laws; and 12 States allow for the carrying of a concealed weapon without any permit or license at all. Many States have some type of reciprocity whereby they mutually recognize permits from other States or may honor permits or licenses issued by other jurisdictions. However, there are some States that neither recognize outofState concealed carry permits nor issue permits to nonresidents, resulting in a complete ban on the concealed carry rights of nonresidents who find themselves in those States. The legal landscape of these State laws and their terms for recognizing concealed carry permits is complex. Yet, Mr. Speaker, we must recognize and remember that, at a practical level, our Union functions by acknowledging the necessary reciprocity of certain State functions, this being one of them and should be. But the current patchwork of State laws means that these lawabiding individuals have to stop and think about their rights, where they are located at the time and whether they recognize their Second Amendment rights, or they risk breaking the law. Also, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 38 includes the text of the Fix NICS Act. The Fix NICS Act ensures individuals who are prohibited from receiving firearms are properly documented in the NICS system, and it would require Federal agencies to report relevant records in accordance with the law. Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us upholds a constitutional right to keep and bear arms and recognizes the fact that the Bill of Rights isn’t limited to certain jurisdictions. Our Founding Fathers carved certain foundational rights into our democracy, and today’s bill simply upholds the spirit and letter of the Second Amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, this is the 54th closed rule brought by the Republican majority to the floor. Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, I pointed that out, as well as the fact that there were 25 Members of this body who offered amendments that were not made in order. Significant numbers of them were germane, and they were bipartisan. We cannot continue to ignore the importance of allowing full membership to participate on behalf of their constituents. Today’s bill combines two bills: one, a bipartisan supported approach to strengthening background checks; the other, a disgraceful handout to the powerful gun lobby and gun manufacturers. I also pointed out last night that the NRA, in many respects, is two bodies: those at the top and the rankandfile members. Many of the rankandfile members, for example, support universal background checks that we could be talking about in this measure if an amendment seeking to have that made in order had been made in order. A month ago yesterday, this country grieved with our brothers and sisters in Sutherland Springs, Texas, as they reeled from one of the worst mass shootings this country has ever suffered. A man walked into a house of worship as churchgoers prayed and sprayed bullets throughout the building. He killed an 18monthold baby; he killed eight members of one family; he killed the pastor’s 14yearold daughter—a total of 26 people—and he was able to do so in a matter of minutes. We learned later that this man had served in the Air Force and, while there, had been courtmartialed for committing acts of domestic violence against his wife and infant child. As part of his sentence, he was prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. Tragically, this information was never put into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and we call that NICS. He was able to pass a background check and come into possession of several guns he would use to murder 26 innocent people in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on November 5, 2017. This tragic event is instructive to the bill brought by us today. Clearly, our background check system must be strengthened. The problems with our background check system are more grave than we previously could even imagine, as recent reports indicate that the FBI has sought to retrieve guns from thousands of people that the background check system should have blocked from buying a weapon but who ultimately were allowed to do so. I think we can all agree that, if we have a system through which people 
like the murderer in Sutherland Springs can buy a gun or one in which thousands of people who should have never been allowed to buy a gun in the first place are able to do so, then we really have no system at all. Today’s bill, in part, would have been a good first step in addressing those weaknesses. But, Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues, in a fashion so common for their majority of this Congress, have decided to sabotage a commonsense, bipartisan bill by combining it with a reckless piece of legislation that will allow guns to be carried all over this country. Let us remember that the gunman in Texas was a known domestic abuser. He abused his wife and he abused his child. Under today’s concealed carry bill, all we would have to do is change ‘‘wife’’ to ‘‘girlfriend,’’ and in some States he would be able to obtain a concealed carry permit for a handgun. Should today’s bill become law, he would then be allowed to bring that concealed handgun into your State, even if your State does not allow convicted domestic abusers to have concealed weapons. For example, Mr. Speaker, the State that I am privileged and proud to represent, Florida, stops abusive dating partners from carrying loaded, hidden handguns in public. However, my friend from Georgia’s State, right over the border, does not have that same restriction. Under this legislation, Florida would be mandated to allow abusive dating partners with concealed permits from Georgia to carry their weapons in Florida. b1245 Under H.R. 38, violent offenders and people with no firearms safety training would be able to carry hidden loaded guns even if they could not otherwise legally purchase a gun in the State. Footnote right there: like my friend from Georgia, I, too, have a concealed carry permit in the State of Florida, and I am a firm believer in the Second Amendment and a person’s right to own a weapon, but I also think we should be discussing today matters such as the bump stock, and there were amendments that dealt with that that were not made in order. I think we should be discussing assault weapons in the hands of the public. I, for the life of me, do not understand how anybody, other than people in law enforcement and the military, need an AK–47 or a multiplefiring gun. Mr. Speaker, this idea that we are presented with here is so terrible, so anathema to common sense and decency, that one has to wonder aloud, where did such an idea come from. Well, we have an answer, and it is probably not too surprising. Today’s concealed carry bill is brought to you by the Republican Party via their very influential friends in the powerful gun lobby. Footnote right there: the gun lobby does the bidding of gun manufacturers, who benefit immensely. Why don’t we just pass a mandate that every woman, man, and child in America must buy a gun, and maybe that would satisfy or satiate gun manufacturers with reference to how they continuously cause us to do things that are not commonsense matters as it pertains to guns. In fact, this bill, which will allow domestic abusers to carry concealed weapons across State lines, is the top priority for the gun lobby. Well, happy holidays, fellows, but we here on this side of the aisle are going to do everything that we can to make sure you don’t get it. When this matter gets to the other body, I can assure my friend from Georgia, and all of the speakers on either side today, that it is going nowhere. So what are we doing by bringing this measure in the first place? Is it a distraction? Is it an absolute necessity that we do this? Mr. Speaker, just so we are crystal clear, what is happening right now in the people’s House, let me reiterate, just over 2 months after a gunman killed 58 people and wounded nearly 550 people in Las Vegas, and just over a month after another gunman killed 26 people in their church as they prayed, this Republican majority, in response to those atrocities, saw fit to bring to the floor a bill that would allow violent offenders to carry concealed weapons all across the country. Let that sink in. This isn’t the only time that we have done something along these lines. After Sandy Hook, after children were killed and their teachers were killed, we did nothing. After Virginia Tech; where people were killed in significant numbers at a military base; in Colorado in a theater; in Orlando, Florida, in a nightclub, repeatedly we have seen these multiple shootings, or mass shootings as they are referred to, where three or more people are killed, 330 times this year alone we have had mass shootings, yet we come here with a bill talking about carrying concealed weapons. Every day in America, 93 people on average are killed with a gun, seven of them children, but in the midst of this gun violence epidemic, and that is what it is, what do my Republican colleagues do? Did they bring to the floor legislation to close the gun show loophole, or did they close loopholes to prevent domestic abusers from purchasing guns, or are they considering a ban on socalled bump stocks that do turn semiautomatic weapons into illegal automatic guns, most recently used to rain carnage down on innocent concertgoers in Las Vegas? One country music singer pointed out that his band had legal guns, but they were afraid to bring them out in Las Vegas because the authorities couldn’t ferret out who was doing the shooting. We had that in a WalMart that all of us saw posted, the shooting where people with guns caused confusion among the police. A footnote there: this bill proposes to study the issue of bump stocks. Mr. Speaker, we don’t need a study. As my colleague, Congresswoman DINATITUS, who represents the city of Las Vegas, said last night at the Rules Committee, the only study we need is to go look at the 58 crosses in her district. That is what bump stocks do. That is your study. Did my Republican colleagues bring to the floor a bill that would have addressed any of these commonsense proposals? Of course not, because even though those proposals have the support of an overwhelming majority of American people when it comes to guns, that is not what motivates my Republican friends. What they care about is the gun lobby and gun manufacturers and their wish list. That is why we are here today. Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle like to compare a concealed carry permit to a driver’s license, but let me set the record straight, because that comparison is nothing but a gross exercise in false equivalency. A driver’s license must meet stringent, uniform Federal criteria established under the REAL ID Act. This includes a photo of the license holder and data including their date of birth and their State of residence. There are absolutely no such uniform standards when it comes to concealed carry permits. In some States, they could look like a paper library card. In others, they may have photo identification. There is no national database, no hotline that contains permit information from all 50 States, so law enforcement would be in a position of having to find each individual issuing agency to verify that a concealed carry permit is valid, and that is impossible. My Republican colleagues often tout their support for our first responders. Well, I urge them to heed the warnings of those brave men and women. Major law enforcement groups understand how dangerous this bill would be, and that is why so many of them oppose what the majority is trying to do here today. Organizations like the Major Cities Chiefs Association, Police Foundation, and Police Executive Research Forum all stand in strong opposition to today’s bill. To make matters worse, this piece of legislation even exposes members of the law enforcement community to personal litigation if they mistakenly question someone’s ability to carry a concealed weapon. Mr. Speaker, this is not just some small issue limiting a law enforcement officer’s ability to carry out their job; this limit on challenging concealed carry permits will cost lives. In fact, a recent study conducted by Stanford University found that when States weaken law enforcement’s authority to deny a permit to those who pose a danger to the community, violent crime goes up by 13 to 15 percent. This research is clear, convincing, and not at 
all difficult to fathom. When you lift limits on who can carry a concealed weapon, gunrelated crime goes up. It is that simple. Mr. Speaker, among the many important issues this body must address, the following stand out: as of this moment, we are roughly 72 hours away from a government shutdown; we have 800,000 persons whom we refer to as DREAMers who continue to wait for us to do the right thing and bring them fully into the only country that they know as home; and we have 9 million children and their parents facing an unconscionable lapse in lifesaving funding for the incredibly important Children’s Health Insurance Program. Given all that, what does the Republicancontrolled Congress do? They bring a bill to the floor that will make it easier for domestic abusers to cross State lines with concealed weapons. This is shameful and no way to run a government. Last night, I thought actively too long trying to go to sleep about the acronym GOP, Grand Old Party, the conservatives, the States’ rights conservatives, the fiscal conservatives who are about to dump serious debt on our children should be called now by their acronym, rather than GOP, in light of the choice that they make with reference to guns, perhaps GOP should stand for ‘‘Guns Over People.’’ Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ). She has some language in this bill. I also would like to thank her for her support for this legislation. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. This bill, which reaffirms the Second Amendment rights of all lawabiding citizens to keep and bear arms in every State, includes a provision I introduced earlier this year as the Police Officers Protecting Children Act. My provision would help protect our children from school shootings and empower local law enforcement to respond rapidly in the case of an emergency. As many of you who represent rural areas know, in these sparsely populated regions, our local law enforcement is stretched thin. My bill would amend the GunFree School Zones Act to allow school boards to permit offduty and retired police officers to carry their firearms on school campuses so they can respond quickly in the event of a crisis. The legislation would expand the reach of local police officers, decrease emergency response time, and put more choice back in the hands of our local school districts. It is a winwinwin. As we have learned over and over, localities are much better equipped to know what works for their district rather than the Federal Government. In fact, the idea of my bill came from a constituent who is a retired police officer and served his community for 30 years. This gentleman came to me because he wasn’t allowed to use his weapon to protect his grandchildren at school even though he had decades of experience and continued to pass an annual recertification test. Additionally, the sheriff of Laclede County in my district said: Not allowing current law enforcement officers, or qualified retired law enforcement officers, to carry weapons at schools simply puts children’s lives at risk. I agree. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Judiciary Committee for including my legislation in this important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ), a very good friend of mine. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. This dangerous bill is an attack on commonsense gun laws across the country. It will force States like mine in New York, with carefully crafted gun laws, to recognize the concealed carry permits from all other States. This bill doesn’t create a national standard. Instead, it lets the States with the weakest laws dictate the safety of everyone else. Thirtyone States require safety training, 35 States prohibit domestic abusers from carrying concealed weapons, 27 States prohibit people convicted of violent misdemeanors from carrying concealed weapons. All of these States’ laws will be overridden if H.R. 38 passes. It is unconscionable, in the wake of two of the worse mass shootings in modern American history, Republicans are still trying to dismantle gun laws. It is like ‘‘Alice in Wonderland.’’ We must fight on behalf of the safety of all Americans and pass comprehensive gun safety laws, not this dangerous bill. b1300 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING), a fellow member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the underlying bill, H.R. 38; or maybe that is the lead bill and there is an underlying bill that has been attached to it. I want to speak a little bit here about this process. First of all, though, we have a concealed carry bill before us that is a good and an excellent bill, that has been hardworked and wellvetted, and I want to thank Mr. HUDSON for his diligent work on this for a number of years. A year and a half or more ago we had this bill about ready to go before the Judiciary Committee. I raised an issue. My concern was that it didn’t allow for the proper respect for the States—7 then, 12 now—who have legitimate constitutional carry, which is: Since you have a Second Amendment right, you have a right to carry a weapon. Under this bill now, having incorporated an amendment that I had prepared a year and a half or so ago that allows then for the residents of the States who have constitutional carry to then travel into other States; if they are legal in their home State, they are legal in another State, under this bill, without having to require the States that respect full constitutional carry to produce permits for their citizens and their residents to travel into neighboring States or anywhere in the country. I think that is a significant improvement, and I thank Mr. HUDSON  for his cooperation and work on that. Like I say, this is a good and solid bill. I am, however, concerned about this process. When I hear the gentleman, Mr. HASTINGS , speak about this is the 54th closed rule that we have seen, I am for a lot of open rules. I am for open debate. I want to fight it out in committee and I want to fight it out here on the floor. Our Founding Fathers understood that. They set this system up this way. They said to all of us: Go to your district, pull the best ideas you have there, generate your own good ideas, bring them here, and let them compete in this marketplace of ideas. But if we don’t have the window to compete with ideas, if we don’t have that opportunity to have the debates, if we don’t have the opportunity to force votes on amendments, then the best that America has to offer eventually doesn’t show up in the law or to the President’s desk. This is one of those circumstances where we learned a bill that didn’t have a number the morning that we marked this up in committee is now the Fix NICS bill. It got a number sometime that same day. There was not a full opportunity to vet the Fix NICS bill. I am very apprehensive about what it might do to this country. I would like to have had hearings and learn what kind of American citizens, lawabiding citizens, will be disadvantaged by the Fix NICS bill. Whose names get on that and why? How do you get those names off when you need to be cleaning up the list? I want to have everybody on the list who belongs on the list, but I don’t want anybody on the list who doesn’t belong on the list. I want to protect American people and I want to protect constitutional rights. We didn’t get an opportunity to look into this, and anybody who brought an amendment to the Rules Committee, it came to the floor under a closed rule. So I am concerned and I am apprehensive about this. In fact, as I look through these provisions, I strongly support section 103, VICKY HARTZLER ’s section in the bill. Section 104—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. I support also the section of the judges, but offered an amendment in committee—too many Members weren’t there; at least 10 Republicans were gone—to protect congressional Members of Congress in the same way as the judges. We didn’t have that opportunity to actually have a hearing on it in the committee—a legitimate one—and we didn’t have an opportunity to bring that amendment to the floor, so I have this apprehension. Mr. Speaker, I urge that we get back to regular order. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Iowa, Mr. KING, had two amendments that were rejected last night in the Rules Committee. I join him in saying that we need to get back to regular order. Mr. Speaker, would you be so kind as to inform me and my friend from Georgia how much time we have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 11
3⁄4minutes remaining. The gentleman from Georgia has 18 minutes remaining. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. Our country is still reeling, Mr. Speaker, from two of the worst mass shootings in modern American history. From the 58 people murdered in Las Vegas to the 25 killed in a Texas church, how can we face the families of these people and say that this bill is the best we could do? Studies show that States with laws permitting concealed carry experience an estimated 13 to 15 percent increase in violent crime than there would have been without the right to carry laws. But we don’t need academic studies, Mr. Speaker, to know that this bill is wrong. We just need to look at real people. One of my constituent’s sisters was shot in Las Vegas and survived. She is one of the lucky ones. They won’t have any empty spots at the holiday table this year because they lost someone to gun violence. Over 14,000 Americans, including parents of nearly 700 children, are not as fortunate, and my heart goes out to them, especially as we enter the holiday season. Today, we have a critical opportunity to say enough is enough, and I strongly urge my colleagues to stop this heinous bill from moving forward. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ), a fine member whose strong support of this bill is appreciated. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, and the underlying rule. The Second Amendment right to bear arms must stand resolute, as should all our constitutional rights. This legislation simply affirms the right of lawabiding citizens to effectively exercise their right in other States as they do at home. Fortytwo States broadly recognize the right of lawabiding citizens to carry concealed handguns, and most States allow some form of concealed carry. State recognition of concealed carry licenses from other States is not uniform or consistent. Those who wish to carry a concealed weapon across State lines are subject to a confusing patchwork of State laws that make it difficult for lawabiding citizens to travel with a firearm without fear of prosecution. Mr. Speaker, contrary to what critics would have you believe, this legislation does not upend State laws or expand access to firearms. States will still have the right and the ability to set specific conditions for residents to conceal carry, and individuals from other States must abide by those laws and rules when they carry in other States. This legislation does not lessen limitations on gun purchases. If you are prohibited from purchasing a firearm now, they will continue to be prohibited from purchasing a firearm if this bill is passed. If you can’t legally own or carry a firearm today, this legislation will not allow you to do so after it is passed. This legislation is about respecting our Constitution. Our other constitutional rights, like free speech, do not expire when you cross State lines. They are not restricted by State lines. So why should we also allow the Second Amendment to be limited by State lines? Indeed, the core of the Second Amendment is selfdefense, and the ability to carry a firearm outside your home is a critical component of that constitutional right. That is why 24 State attorney generals, including Michigan’s attorney general, Bill Schuette, submitted letters supporting this legislation. They know, like I do, that this legislation is common sense. It prioritizes the rights of lawabiding citizens to conceal carry and the ability to travel freely from State to State without worrying about conflicting State laws and prosecution. Mr. Speaker, each of us are required to take an oath of office here. In that oath, we swear to uphold and defend our Constitution—the Constitution of the United States. That is what this legislation exactly does. It makes sure our exercise of constitutional rights applies throughout the United States. My colleague on the other side of the aisle questions proceeding with this legislation while funding for the Federal Government hangs in the balance in the next 72 hours. I agree. We must keep the lights on. We are all responsible for keeping the lights on. It isn’t as if it is one side of the aisle or the other, and in the past, it has been a bipartisan agreement to do so. Suddenly, the other side of the aisle says: If we don’t get exactly what we want on terms we have, including on DACA, we will take it to the precipice. A solution on DACA is there if my colleagues wish to take it. At this point, so far, they haven’t. But there are some things that aren’t malleable. There is right and there is wrong in this. I suggest we solve it in the next 72 hours and we keep the lights on because we are all equally responsible for that. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ), my good friend, who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, why should the United States of America be the only rich country in the world that cannot protect our families from gun violence? It doesn’t have to be this way. In fact, there are a number of States that have enacted gun safety protections. And in those States that have done so, there are fewer gun deaths and there are fewer gun injuries. My State of Oregon is one of those that has enacted them, in part, because of votes of the people, not politicians. This proposal would strip away protections of Oregonians because there are 12 States that, basically, if you are 21 and have a pulse, you can carry a firearm. Others have much lessrestrictive proposals. This eliminates the ability of States to protect its own citizens. It is shameful. It is wrong. Someday, Congress will come to its senses and enact reasonable gun safety legislation for the country. But until we do, for heaven’s sake, don’t punish States that have accepted their responsibility to protect their families. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ). Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. As a lifelong gun owner and staunch advocate for protecting our Second Amendment rights, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. H.R. 38 would protect lawabiding gun owners with concealed carry permits, like the single mother, Shaneen Allen, from Pennsylvania. Many of you have heard this story. I know the author of this bill, Mr. HUDSON , has told this story many times, where Miss Allen was arrested in New Jersey during a routine traffic stop because her valid Pennsylvania concealed carry license had no legal standing in New Jersey. Our constitutionally protected Second Amendment rights should not stop at a State line. This commonsense bill would ensure that concealed carry permit holders’ rights to carry firearms across all State lines will exist. The legislation would allow Georgia’s 600,000plus concealed carry permit holders to remain protected while traveling. The bill would also incentivize 
States to report individuals prohibited from owning guns to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, better knows as NICS, and it gives States the resources they need to follow this law. This would not put an additional burden on lawabiding gun owners or make it more difficult for them to purchase or carry a firearm. It simply ensures that agencies and bureaucrats are following the existing laws. I appreciate Mr. HUDSON ’s hard work to advance this commonsense legislation to protect Americans’ constitutional rights, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule and the bill. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), my good friend. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us creates a dangerous race to the bottom, forcing States to accept concealed carry permits from all other States, regardless of their training standards, their background check system, or their safety requirements. Make no mistake, this bill would make it easier to cross State lines with hidden, loaded weapons, threatening local communities by making it harder for law enforcement to determine who is lawfully caring a firearm. No wonder sheriffs, police chiefs, and other law enforcement agencies oppose this bill. What a shame it is that, after the terrible mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas, the first gunrelated bill this House considers would actually make it easier for dangerous people to carry concealed weapons in more places. Mr. Speaker, these tragedies aren’t inevitable. They are the result of policy choices. We could be working together to enact commonsense measures to respond to the gun violence epidemic facing our country. But as long as Republicans are beholden to NRA extremism, these proposals, I am afraid, will fall on deaf ears. I urge my colleagues to reject this shameful proposal and to work, instead, to address the root causes of gun violence in this country. b1315 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN ). Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. Since I was elected to Congress in 2014, I have been devoted to preserving the constitutional rights of Americans, including the inalienable right to bear arms. Despite our Second Amendment protections, many States have laws restricting the ability of citizens to carry concealed weapons, principally outof State residents. This is particularly confusing and burdensome for lawabiding citizens who choose to conceal carry and live near a State line. For example, the district I represent borders South Carolina along the Savannah River. For many of my constituents, the closest grocery store, bank, and even their work may be in South Carolina. Thankfully for my constituents, Georgia and South Carolina already have firearm permit reciprocity. But this is not the case everywhere. As the law currently stands, Americans in other States are losing their right to bear arms on a daily basis simply because they live near a State line. Just as your First Amendment right to free speech does not change from one State to another, neither should your right to protect yourself and your family. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will see this and will join me in voting for this commonsense legislation to solve this problem. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise as the cochair of the Law Enforcement Caucus in the Congress of the United States. This bill is terrible. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act should not be voted on. As a mayissue State, New Jersey allows local law enforcement the discretion on issuing concealed carry permits. In order to receive a permit, applicants must demonstrate an urgent need to carry a concealed weapon and pass a safety course on par with firearms training required of police officers. H.R. 38 would undermine the good regulations New Jersey has in place by forcing New Jersey and other States to recognize the concealed carry standards from every other State, even if their regulations are weak or nonexistent. Allowing States with the weakest concealed carry requirements to set the national standard creates a race to the bottom. Aside from the outrageous fact that House Republicans are pushing a bill to weaken States’ rights, this bill makes it harder for local law enforcement to do their jobs. This bill does not establish a process for officers to easily verify that someone is carrying lawfully, because officers would be essentially required to know the permitting standards of every State, a heavy and unnecessary burden, Mr. Speaker. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ). Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for consideration of H.R. 38 and the underlying bill, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Mr. Speaker, protects the individual rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms. This is a fundamental right to our great Republic. In Wyoming, Mr. Speaker, we know that this is a Godgiven right enshrined in our Constitution, which is why Wyoming is a constitutional carry State. Wyoming is not alone in this Constitutionbased conviction. Across the country, Mr. Speaker, 42 States broadly recognize the right of lawabiding citizens to carry concealed handguns. Further, all 50 States allow some form of concealed carry. Many States, but not all, Mr. Speaker, already recognize the gun laws of other States. However, Mr. Speaker, those traveling through or living on the border of a State that does not recognize their home State’s laws could have their gun rights stripped when they cross State lines. That is wrong, Mr. Speaker. This puts otherwise lawabiding citizens in a situation where they may be criminally liable for simply carrying out their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. The constitutional rights of United States citizens should not change or end at State lines, Mr. Speaker. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act ensures the rights of lawabiding citizens to travel across State lines without worrying about the conflicting patchwork of State concealed carry laws or regulations. This bill is crucial to protecting our constitutional rights. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ). Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, 26: that is how many people were gunned down in a Texas church. Fiftynine: that is how many were murdered at a concert in Las Vegas. And 489: that is how many lawabiding Americans were injured in that same attack. Mr. Speaker, it has been weeks after those shootings, and we haven’t taken a single action in the United States Congress to stop the gun violence epidemic plaguing America. Instead, Republican leadership is pushing a bill with blood money from the NRA that will create a race to the bottom where States with the weakest concealed carry requirements will rewrite the laws for everyone else. Meanwhile, we all know there are bipartisan bills that will reduce gun deaths, including my bill to ban bump stocks. Those bills have been denied a vote. Mr. Speaker, we have lived through too many massacres. At this rate, I guarantee we will live through more. Let’s stop this nonsense and work together on commonsense solutions the majority of Americans want. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ), my good friend Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 38, which unconscionably combines a needed reform to improve background checks 
with a wholesale abandonment of sanity with respect to gun permitting. The Fix NICS Act would improve notifications about criminal activity for background checks, which I strongly support. A system, by the way, that tragically failed prior to the Sutherland Springs shooting. Unfortunately, this reform is tied to the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would endanger millions of Americans and undermine wellestablished State laws with respect to concealed carry. My home State of Rhode Island has strong, sensible procedures for getting a concealed carry permit. In Rhode Island, you must be at least 21 years old, trained in gun safety, and must have just cause to carry a concealed weapon. Domestic abusers are not eligible. H.R. 38 would override these commonsense laws, putting our residents at risk. It would allow anyone denied a permit in Rhode Island to permit shop in States with weaker laws, and it would allow residents of States with weaker requirements to carry freely in our neighborhoods. Mr. Speaker, gun violence is an epidemic in this country. We should not be taking steps to put more guns on our streets. I urge my colleagues to heed the warnings of law enforcement officers and reject this dangerous bill. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER ). Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I can’t think of a more breathtaking display of nerve or brass than what the Republican majority is doing with this bill. After the tragedies we have suffered in Las Vegas and in Orlando, in Aurora, Colorado, that I represent, to race to the bottom to have the easiest laws— and no offense to Georgia, but Georgia has no business and no right to tell Colorado what its laws concerning the health, safety, and welfare of Coloradans should be under the 10th Amendment. Instead of taking up real legislation on assault weapons or bump stocks that make those assault weapons machine guns that mowed down all those people in Las Vegas, we are saying: No. Whatever State has the weakest, most lax gun laws, then that State is going to control all the other States. That is wrong, that is unconstitutional, and this bill should be rejected right here and right now. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. Mr. Speaker, a group of 34 of my Republican colleagues sent a letter this week to Speaker RYAN urging a vote before the year’s end on legislation that would protect DACA recipients. I include in the RECORD that letter. CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , Washington, DC, December 5, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: We write in support of passing of a permanent legislative solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients before the end of the year. DACA recipients—young people brought to America through no fault of their own—are contributing members of our communities and our economy. For many, this is the only country they have ever known. They are American in every way except their immigration status. Since DACA’s inception, the federal government has approved approximately 795,000 initial DACA applications and 924,000 renewals. Since being approved for DACA status, an overwhelming majority of these individuals have enrolled in school, found employment, or have served in the military. Studies have shown that passing legislation to permanently protect these individuals would add hundreds of billions to our country’s gross domestic product (GDP). That is why the business community, universities, and civic leaders alike support a permanent legislative solution. We agree with President Trump that executive action was not the appropriate process for solving this issue, as was done under the previous administration, and we believe Congress should act. We are compelled to act immediately because many DACA recipients are about to lose or have already lost their permits in the wake of the program’s rescission. Not acting is creating understandable uncertainty and anxiety amongst immigrant communities. While we firmly believe Congress must work to address other issues within our broken immigration system, it is imperative that Republicans and Democrats come together to solve this problem now and not wait until next year. We all agree that our border must be enforced, our national security defended, and our broken immigration system reformed, but in this moment, we must address the urgent matter before us in a balanced approach that does not harm valuable sectors of our economy nor the lives of these hardworking young people. We must pass legislation that protects DACA recipients from deportation and gives them the opportunity to apply for a more secured status in our country as soon as possible. Reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients before the holidays is the right thing to do. Sincerely, Scott Taylor; Dan Newhouse; Mia Love; Mark Amodei; David G. Valadao; Dave Reichert; Brian Fitzpatrick; Mike Coffman; Charlie Dent; Frank A. LoBiondo; Peter T. King; Carlos Curbelo; Ileana RosLehtinen; Ryan A. Costello; Fred Upton; Jeff Denham; Rodney Davis; John J. Faso; John Katko; Chris Stewart; Susan W. Brooks; Adam Kinzinger; GT Thompson; Mike Simpson; Mimi Walters; Leonard Lance; Pat Meehan; Elise Stefanik; Tom MacArthur; Chris Smith; Jenniffer Gonza´lezColo´n; Joe Barton; Will Hurd; Bruce Poliquin. 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) to discuss our proposal. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed colleague for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, each day that Congress delays action on the Dream Act, 122 people lose their temporary protected status granted by DACA. Since the Trump September 5 announcement, 11,182 young people have lost their DACA status and face the daily threat of being detained and deported. Time and time again, House Democrats have pleaded to Republicans and their leadership the urgency of finding a legislative solution that would permanently protect DREAMers. We have pleaded and explained the economic benefit, $23 billion yearly contributed by DREAMers to the GDP of this Nation. We have pleaded with the Republican leadership to bring a Dream Act to the House floor that is just and fair without the trappings of xenophobia, division, or hate. We have pleaded that the DREAMers have not committed a crime. It was not an act of volition on their part as children. We must move beyond the political calculations about race, usversus them divisions in this country, and scapegoating. The House has an opportunity and the authority to vote on a clean Dream Act and embrace the shared values and humanity of this Nation, while rejecting the politically manufactured hysteria. Mr. Speaker, I ask a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question so that H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, can come to the House floor. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I have watched this year as members of the Republican majority have worked diligently to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would have been a failure for the American people but great for special interests. I have watched members of the Republican majority work relentlessly to push a tax scam bill through this body that will certainly be a failure for the American people but great for corporate America and the ultrawealthy. I have watched members of the Republican majority here today and yesterday in the Rules Committee champion a bill that will be a failure for the American people, especially survivors of domestic violence, but great for the powerful corporate gun lobby and gun manufacturers. I sense a theme for my friends across the aisle, and it is a shameful one. Mr. Speaker, our country faces a gun violence epidemic, and we here in Congress should be doing all that we can to put it to an end. The opportunity to pass a bipartisan measure to strengthen our background 
check system has presented itself, but apparently the majority, without hearings, would rather drown bipartisanship in the dirty waters of the corporate gun lobby and gun manufacturers. I have said it before, and I will say it again here today: Those who stand in the way of legislation that will address our country’s gun violence epidemic are increasingly culpable for its needless continuation. That is why I dubbed and gave the acronym GOP, ‘‘Guns Over People,’’ but I guess I should have used the acronym ‘‘Good Old Puppets’’ of the gun lobby and gun manufacturers. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule and underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1330 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I do appreciate my friend from Florida. We have many lively debates on the floor and many lively debates in the Rules Committee. But if you really want to see things going in really a tone and tenor misspeak on this floor, let’s at least get back to saying there are ideas that we agree with and disagree with. There are ideas of actually just taking a constitutional right and being able to apply that in the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which is what we are talking about here, regardless of who might find that appealing, what groups or nongroups. That is a constitutional right that we are fighting for. But in this regard of saying that puppets—the moment that the group who enjoys killing babies says, ‘‘You need to make sure that right is available,’’ then my friends across the aisle are quick to jump to their strings to say, ‘‘Yes, I want to do that.’’ When they wanted to have more governmentcontrolled healthcare, they also said: Oh, but our insurance companies, we need to have a position for them in which they are taken care of. I guess that was another puppet string, Mr. Speaker. I think the bottom line is, let’s quit, knowing that many of us on both sides have our positions, and we have people who like our positions on both sides, whether they be Democrat or Republican. But one of the reasons that the American people are very frustrated with this body is because the tone and tenor is not on policy, which we can disagree on. It is who controls the other. If we wanted to lay out a laundry list of supporters of the Democratic Party and maybe supporters of the Republican Party and say, that is all that matters, then fine, Mr. Speaker. If we have degenerated to that, then so be it. But shame on us. Whether you want reciprocity or not, good. Argue it. Whether you want to have another thing in our tax reform and you believe tax reform can be done in a different way, argue it. But when we separate out who is a puppet and who is not, then we are also racing to the bottom. We are racing to the bottom of the civil discourse that the American people are tired of. Look at the last election. So when I look at this today, Mr. Speaker, I look at a bill—and we have also heard interesting things that have been said, like: Officers will be in trouble and possibly can be sued. Look at the language that is put into the bill, a Terry stop, that they could ask, and that they are protected from suit. What they are not protected from is unlawful arrest. Then they will be held liable. Or maybe, it has also been said that we are going to turn all of these concealed carry permit owners, like myself and my friend from Florida, loose on the country and terrible things are going to happen. May I remind us here on the floor that Florida, which has issued nearly 2 million permits, has only revoked 168 due to gun crimes committed by permit holders. That is 0.008 percent. The fight that concealed carry permit holders are generally more lawabiding citizens than the general public, we can disagree, Mr. Speaker, and that is part of this body. We can come to different conclusions. That is the reason we have a debate floor. But when we start to try and bring in other things, and who is controlled by whom, then I just simply, Mr. Speaker, ask that the other side cut their strings first. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 3524 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 3524. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. f 
CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 645, I call up the bill (H.R. 38) to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a means by which nonresidents of a State whose residents may carry concealed firearms may also do so in the State, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 645, in lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–45 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
H.R. 38 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017’’. TITLE I—CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY ACT OF 2017 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Fix NICS Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 38. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, throughout my career in elected office, I have believed in and adhered to two fundamental principles regarding firearms policy: first, the right guaranteed to lawabiding Americans by the Second Amendment must be aggressively protected and preserved; second, the laws we have on the books need to be enforced to the fullest extent possible. The bipartisan bill before us today does both. H.R. 38 ensures that lawabiding citizens’ Second Amendment right does not end when they cross State lines. The bill allows lawabiding gun owners with valid Stateissued concealed carry firearm permits or those who live in so called constitutional carry States to carry a concealed firearm in any other State that also allows concealed carry. We know that citizens who carry a concealed firearm are not only better prepared to act in their own selfdefense, but also in the defense of others. Take, for instance, an incident that occurred just last November on a highway in Florida. Lee County Sheriff’s Deputy Dean Bardes had just concluded a highspeed chase just off Interstate 75. As Deputy Bardes approached to apprehend the suspect, the suspect, Edward Strother, violently attacked Deputy Bardes. A witness on the scene told reporters that the attacker ‘‘just started punching him and hitting and hitting and hitting. I was afraid for the police officer. I thought he was going to kill him.’’ Fortunately for Deputy Bardes, Ashad Russell, a Florida concealed carry permit holder, was also watching the attack unfold. Mr. Russell pulled his gun and approached the altercation. He told Strother he would shoot him if he didn’t stop beating the deputy. The State Attorney’s Office said Strother ignored Russell’s commands to stop beating the deputy, so Russell fired his gun three times, hitting and fatally wounding the assailant. Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott has hailed Russell as a hero. Importantly, this bill also contains the Fix NICS Act of 2017. This is a bipartisan and bicameral measure. The Fix NICS Act takes steps to ensure that State and Federal agencies enter all relevant records into the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. This bill will help ensure people who are legally prohibited from having guns, like those with violent felony convictions, do not obtain them. The shooting at Virginia Tech and the church shootings in Charleston, South Carolina, and Sutherland Springs, Texas, are tragic reminders of what can happen when all relevant records are not entered into the system. Our NICS system is only as good as the information within it. This important piece of legislation will ensure that more of the information already required to be uploaded to NICS under current law is actually placed in the NICS system. Taken together, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act and the Fix NICS Act preserve and protect the right guaranteed to us by the Second Amendment and ensure that those prohibited by existing law from receiving a firearm are prevented from doing so. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I want to thank the lead sponsor, Mr. HUDSON of North Carolina, for his hard work on this bill. I would also like to thank the authors of the Fix NICS provisions, Mr. CULBERSON and Mr. CUELLAR , for their important contributions to the legislation before us today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. This bill would not protect us from gun violence, but it would make us far less safe. Under current law, each State makes its own determination about who may carry a concealed firearm in public, including deciding which other States’ concealed carry permits to recognize. This bill would eviscerate the core public safety determinations that each State makes concerning the concealed carrying of guns in public based on the unique circumstances of each State and the desires of its citizens. In fact, the standards and requirements adopted in the States vary dramatically: Thirtyone States and D.C. require gun safety training to carry concealed guns in public, and 21 of those States require livefire training; 27 States and the District of Columbia prohibit individuals convicted of misdemeanor crimes of violence from concealed carry; 28 States and D.C. prohibit convicted stalkers from carrying concealed guns; 34 States and D.C. prohibit those under 21 years of age from carrying concealed guns. Many States prohibit gun possession and concealed carry by abusive dating partners, exceeding Federal protections against abusive spouses. All of these States would have their carefully considered laws governing concealed carry overridden by this bill. The obvious solution to the varying State laws is to continue to do what is currently done by many States, which is to choose which other State permits they will recognize. Some States, including my State of New York, have chosen not to recognize permits issued by any other State. Most States, however, have chosen to recognize permits from at least some other States, basing the choice on the strength and standards employed by the other States. b1445 We should not disregard these determinations, which is what this bill would do. Instead, this bill would say that every State must honor the concealed carry permit of every other State. About 10 States don’t have any requirements and issue a concealed carry permit upon request to anyone. What this bill would do, in effect, is to say that if New York or Illinois have strict requirements for concealed carry, if someone comes in from a State that doesn’t, they have to let that person have concealed carry in their State. In effect, it uses the power of the Federal Government to import the laws of one State and make them enforceable in the other State. In addition, I am deeply disappointed that the version of this bill before us today includes the bipartisan Fix NICS Act, a measure that should be enacted as a standalone bill without delay, and that was reported as a separate bill by the Judiciary Committee. That bill would take steps to address shortcomings with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or what we often call the NICS. As the recent mass shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, illustrates, we must do more to ensure all relevant prohibiting records are submitted to the databases that comprise the NICS. No one should pass a firearm background check that he or she should have failed simply because their record of a felony conviction, or domestic violence record, or some other prohibition under Federal law was not included in the system. There is broad bipartisan support for the Fix NICS bill here in the House and in the Senate. That proposal, which would actually save lives, should not be tethered to the forced concealed carry reciprocity provisions of this bill, which would only serve to endanger our citizens. The answer to our national problem of gun violence is not that we need more people carrying concealed firearms on our streets. More than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence every year, while, in some other countries, this figure barely exceeds 100. In 2011, the United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, over 30,000. A study in The American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other highincome countries, the gun related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher. The common factor in all of these other countries is the lack of such easy availability of guns. Our country, however, is awash in guns, and we have the shameful death toll to show for it. Sadly, this bill will only increase it. We must change our approach to gun violence and adopt meaningful legislation that strengthens our gun laws instead of weakening them; and we must not undermine the efforts of States to defend their citizens against these arms. Unfortunately, the dangers posed by the concealed carry reciprocity portion of this bill greatly outweigh the benefits of the NICS improvements; therefore, I oppose H.R. 38, and urge my colleagues to reject it today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ), the lead sponsor of the legislation. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you a story. It is a story about an AfricanAmerican single mother, two kids, living in south Philly. After twice being the victim of muggings, she decides to go out and legally purchase a firearm to protect herself, gets trained with her weapon, and applies for a concealed carry permit. Sometime thereafter, she crossed the State line into New Jersey and, at a routine traffic stop, did exactly as she was trained; handed her driver’s license and her concealed carry permit to the police officer and let him know that she had a pistol in her purse. What she didn’t know is that the State of New Jersey doesn’t recognize the concealed carry permits of their neighbor in Pennsylvania. And so this poor single mother, who has never had a brush with the law, spent almost 50 days in jail and was looking at 10 years in prison. Are you serious? We have to make sure that never happens again. The other side today is going to argue that we are violating States’ rights with this legislation; but Article IV, section 1, the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, says very clearly that every State should give the full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings and documents of every other State, and that Congress has a responsibility to determine how those documents will be recognized. That is why a driver’s license is recognized in every State. That is why, if I get married in North Carolina but I move to Arizona, I am not a single man again. They recognize that marriage. That is why divorce decrees are recognized in every State. The concealed carry permit should be recognized the same way. But this is not trampling States’ rights, because States can still determine what can be carried, where it can be carried. They can set any kind of limits they want about how weapons are carried in their municipalities or their States. For example, if you visit the State of New York, they have a limit on the size of a magazine on a pistol. You have got to follow that law. If they want to set restrictions about places where you can’t carry, even with this legislation, that law would have to be followed. The States retain this right, just like a driver’s license. The other side is also going to stand up and claim all kinds of doomsday scenarios about how we are going to increase crime; we are going to increase the number of weapons out there; we are going to turn the cities into the Wild West. I find it ironic that we are being lectured to by people from big cities with a lot of gun control measures but have some of the worst crime in the Nation. They are worried about people coming from other places where we don’t have crime. I think that is ironic. But the truth is, over half the States already recognize permits from every other State; 19 States, in fact, already do this. States and municipalities, as I mentioned, retain the right to restrict where guns are carried in their communities, even under this legislation. And if you look at the empirical evidence, places where you have concealed carry, even constitutional carry, when you instituted this right, violent crime went down. Gun crime went down. You have seen less crime, not more crime. 
There was actually a study done in Florida and Texas, and it showed that offduty police officers commit crimes more than concealed carry permit holders. Think about that. Police officers don’t commit crimes very often, but even they commit crimes more than concealed carry permit holders. These are not the people we are worried about. These are not the violent criminals that we are worried about in our cities. This is a commonsense measure that upholds our constitutional right. It makes sure that a lawabiding citizen, trying to do the right thing, doesn’t become a criminal simply because they cross that line. So for every freedomloving American who exercises their Second Amendment right, today is your day. To the 73 percent of Americans who support concealed carry, today is your day. To the 15 million concealed carry permit holders out there, today is your day. And finally, to the single mothers out there who just want to protect themselves and their families, today is your day. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense legislation. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), the ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me say that the problems that my good friend just mentioned on the floor can be solved by real, sensible gun safety legislation. Unfortunately, H.R. 38 is not that, and it is not that because it has ignored the pleas of law enforcement, and it has ignored the rational addition of amendments that would save lives. H.R. 38 is dangerous, it is reckless, and it is secretly packaged as a fix to gun violence, but, instead, it is laced with lethal elements of catastrophic proportion. Then, in the midnight hour, it matches the NICS Fix, dealing with the background checks, with the concealed carry reciprocity. That is patently unfair, Mr. Speaker. Then it would not allow reasonable amendments, exposing victims of domestic violence, an amendment that I had, it will expose them, victims of domestic violence, to stalkers, and those who have been involved in domestic violence to gun violence or death. It will entice those who perpetrate hate crimes. It will add to the current alarming death rate. Unfortunately, where we could have fixed the NICS, it does not do that. 556 women have been murdered this year alone by intimate partners with firearms. My amendment would have made this bill safer on the concealed carry bill. Didn’t want to have it. Fourteen other sensible amendments were blocked. 4.5 million American women alive today have been threatened by abusers. Hate crimes, those worshippers in Charleston, South Carolina, were killed by a person who came there with hate. My amendment dealing with not allowing someone convicted of a hate crime—even though they say that that is the Federal law, why not have it in this underlying bill where so many people are killed? Let me give you an example. Under the Brady Campaign, 114,994 Americans are killed by guns. They include those in Las Vegas; they include those at the Pulse nightclub; in Charleston; those who marched in Charlottesville, with all the violence that they had; and of course, Sandy Hook. Seventeen thousand children are gunned down by guns. The laws of different States, 12 States, have an open carry law with no rules. That means that if you are in Washington, D.C., where heads of state and other dignitaries come, then recklessly someone can come on the streets. Do we even listen to police officers? The Major Chiefs Association has indicated that they are opposed to H.R. 38 because it will require those making legitimate legal stops as law enforcement officers, seeking to come home to their families, being subjected to individuals whose documents they may not know are credible, or whether they are fraudulent or whether, in fact, these individuals legitimately should have a gun. I can’t understand why this is not understood. So let me just say that it is usually understood that we respect the constitutionality of States. This is a bad bill. It ignores sovereignty, and we should vote it down because too many people are murdered by guns without safety regulations. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 38, the ‘‘Concealed to Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017’’. I oppose the bill for the following reasons: H.R. 38 is dangerous, reckless and secretly packaged as a fix to gun violence, but instead, is laced with lethal elements of catastrophic proportion. It will expose victims of domestic violence or stalking to gun violence or death. It will entice those who perpetrate hate crimes. It will add to the current alarming death rate. The majority has elected to combine this dangerous measure with a more sensible and bipartisan measure, the Fix NICS Act, which we all supported as a standalone bill at markup. This trickery tactic is both disappointing and deadly, of which, neither approach is welcome, for this reckless effort will negate any protections offered by the Fix NICS Act. My Amendments would have remedied these glaring defects in H.R. 38, which is a recipe for disaster because it authorizes anyone who is allowed by one state to carry a concealed handgun to do so in any other state, even if other states have higher standards than the state where permit was granted. This bill would endanger many more lives when dealing with domestic partners by exposing victims to gun violence. Approximately, 556 women have been murdered this year alone by intimate partners with firearms, as statistics show that guns are the weapon of choice for domestic violence homicides. My domestic violence amendment is an important public safety measure. Had it been made in order, it would have provided that States not be required to allow an individual to carry where such person is convicted of an offense of domestic violence or stalking as defined under the law. Despite this sensible measure, my amendments along with 14 other germane democratic amendments were all blocked by the majority. A 2016 metaanalysis found that approximately 4.5 million American women alive today have been threatened by abusers with firearms; of those, one million had either been shot or shot at by their abusers. Stalking is also a strong indicator of lethality, with one study of female murder victims in ten cities finding that 76% of women who were murdered by an intimate partner were stalked the previous year. My second amendment would have prohibited any person convicted of a hate crime, as defined under section 249 of title 18 United States Code, or any substantially similar offense under the law of any State, from carrying under this bill. We all remember the vicious church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina where a white supremacist opened fire in a historic black church, killing nine people, including a pastor, during a prayer meeting. Again, recently, in Charlottesville, VA, white nationalists invoked violence during a march by plowing a car into a group of antiprotesters, killing 32 year old Heather Heyer of Charlottesville. This event prompted Attorney General Sessions to call the fatal attack ‘‘domestic terrorism’’ and said you can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation toward the most serious of charges that can be brought. Imagine if this killer from Ohio was allowed to cross state lines freely at that time under this bill with a gun; the additional loss of life on that day could have been catastrophic. New analysis of National Crime Victimization Survey data by the Center for American Progress reveals that between 2010 and 2014, roughly 43,000 hate crimes were committed in the United States that involved the use or threat of a gun. Under federal law and the law in most states, individuals who have been convicted of hate crimes remain free to buy and possess guns. And now, under this bill, they can take their guns with them to inflict mayhem beyond their home states. Hatemotivated individuals such as violent extremists and hate criminals often use guns as a tool to terrorize, threaten and intimidate members of historically vulnerable or marginalized communities. My amendment therefore, was a sensible and practical measure. Mass shootings and carnagefilled classrooms, churches, workplace, concerts and clubs should not be the new normal because Congress can and should do better. Every day on average, 315 people are shot, of which 93 die from gun violence, daily. And of the 315 shot, 46 are children and teens between the age of 0–19 and at least 7 of our children die daily from gun violence. 
Every year on average, 114,994 people are shot, of which 33,880 people die from gun violence and of those shot, 17,012 of those victims are children and teens. Therefore, we lose at least 2,647 of our children a year to senseless gun violence. These numbers are alarming and we should be devoting our efforts to saving lives, not opening up the flood gate to more carnage by snuffing innocent lives in passing H.R. 38. This bill will amplify tragedies such as Sandy Hook Elementary, Charleston, SC, Florida’s Pulse night club, San Bernardino, Las Vegas bump stocks killings, Texas recent church massacre, and the countless lives lost on our streets across this country daily. Although the NRA argues that the United States is a dangerous place and that owning and carrying a gun is the only way to protect oneself and one’s family, there are over 30,000 dead. Removing safeguards intended to protect the public against potential harm or deadly force by private individuals jeopardizes universally recognized human rights—including the right to life. H.R. 38 prohibits Congress’ ability to address gun violence in a constructive and realistic manner? Adding more guns to our streets and loosening existing laws is extremely dangerous and counterproductive to ensuring public safety. Disguising the danger in this bill, by wrapping it in the cloth of H.R. 4477, a more sensible measure, does not negate the toxicity level of H.R. 38. In response to the TX recent church shooting, my amendment strengthened H.R. 4477 by requiring DoD to conduct a more comprehensive review of the procedures used by each branch of the Armed Forces to ensure that the Department is in substantial compliance with the DoD instruction 5505.11 entitled, ‘‘Fingerprint Card and Final Disposition Report Submission Requirements’’, dated December 1, 1998. But again, these amendments were blocked. Unlike H.R. 4477, the Fix NICS Act, a bipartisan measure and good first step, which aims to improve key elements in the submission of information by federal and state agencies to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and which I supported, H.R. 38 as is and combined is lethal. For the reasons stated above, I oppose this Rule and the underlying bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds, and I include in the RECORD an article entitled, ‘‘‘Good Samaritan’ Kills Active Shooter in Texas Sports Bar,’’ in which a shooter with two guns and two knives entered a sports bar and was shot by an individual that the police labeled a Good Samaritan who happened to be eating at the restaurant with his wife. He was a concealed carry permit holder. He told his wife to get down on the ground, and then he shot the assailant. 
[From nbcnews.com, May 4, 2017] ‘GOODSAMARITAN ’ KILLS ACTIVE SHOOTER IN  TEXAS SPORTS BAR: POLICE  (By Phil McCausland) A ‘‘good Samaritan’’ with a gun killed an active shooter who may have been gearing up for a deadly rampage at a Texas sports bar Wednesday night, police said. When 48yearold James Jones walked inside the Zona Caliente Sports Bar, started yelling and then allegedly shot and killed Cesar Perez—a 37yearold restaurant manager who’d attempted to calm him down— Arlington police said witnesses were afraid they would be next. In addition to the gun used to kill Perez, police say Jones had another semiautomatic pistol and two knives on him. The serial number on the second gun had been scratched off, and Jones did not have a gun license, police said. ‘‘He definitely had the capacity, if he wanted, to commit further violence and potentially kill other patrons in the business,’’ Arlington Police Lieutenant Chris Cook told NBC News, adding that it did not appear that the shooter knew his victim. An armed ‘‘good Samaritan’’—as the Arlington Police labeled him—happened to be eating at the restaurant with his wife. A concealed carry permit holder, he told her to get down on the ground and then shot Jones in the back. ‘‘I don’t think the shooter even knew where the rounds were coming from because he started shooting at the front door,’’ Cook said, who described the scene as ‘‘chaotic.’’ Police reviewed video surveillance and pieced together the incident via witness interviews, but it remains unclear how many shots were fired by either individual. Police were looking into Jones’ background to see whether he suffered from any mental illnesses and were awaiting test results to find out if he was under the influence. The man who took down Jones wished to maintain his anonymity, police said, noting that he felt overwhelmed but relieved that he prevented further violence. ‘‘We’re thankful that the good ‘Samaritan’ acted quickly and decisively to end the threat,’’ Cook said. ‘‘We never recommend people get involved. That’s a personal decision that a citizen has to make.’’ Use of force and firearms expert Emanuel Kapelsohn told NBC News that, from his understanding, the man who took down the shooter reacted appropriately. ‘‘I think it’s to be applauded,’’ he said. ‘‘Not everybody in the world ought to own a gun. Not everybody in the world ought to carry a gun. Not everyone in the world ought to engage an armed criminal where innocent people could be potentially injured.’’ ‘‘But this good Samaritan obviously had the ability to do what he did,’’ Kapelsohn added. ‘‘Who knows how many people would be dead if he had not acted?’’ Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER ), the chairman of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that H.R. 38, as amended, includes the Fix NICS Act. I have long supported the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. NICS is about saving lives and protecting people from harm by preventing guns from falling into the wrong hands. It does this without interfering in the timely transfer of firearms to eligible gun buyers. I was the original cosponsor of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 and worked diligently for its passage. I strongly supported this bill because it makes sense to prevent convicted felons and individuals judged to be mentally ill from obtaining guns. At the time of negotiations, I insisted on the inclusion of the NICS program. Under this system, firearms dealers use the FBI’s NICS system to crossreference with a list of known convicted felons, drug users, illegal aliens, and those convicted of domestic violence. As I have stated many times, the NICS system is only as good as the records that are put into it. Too often, people who otherwise would not pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns. After the recent shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the U.S. Air Force disclosed that it had failed to report the gunman’s history of domestic assault to the database, which should have prevented him from purchasing a firearm in the first place. This legislation will provide a much needed push to speed implementation of the NICS system used in conducting instant background checks prior to gun purchases. At the Federal level, it would require Federal agency cooperation and provide relevant records to the Attorney General for inclusion into the NICS. It holds Federal agencies accountable if they fail to upload relevant records to the background check system through public reporting and prohibiting bonus pay for political appointees. At the State level, it will incentivize them to make sure that their reporting is up to date by giving Federal grant preferences to States which comply. b1500 Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. This bill is not about expanding background checks. This is about ensuring that the existing law is working. There is strong bipartisan support for improving what has become the systemic problem of missing information in the database. Accurate reporting is essential to ensuring that the system works as intended. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for a unanimous consent request. (Ms. JACKSON Lee asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  an article by Mark Kelly entitled ‘‘Good Guys With Guns Can Be Dangerous, Too. Don’t Gut Conceal Carry Laws. Why is Congress about to Vote to Loosen Gun Laws Again;’’ a letter from Major Cities Chiefs Association opposing H.R. 38; a letter from the chief of police from the City of Houston; and, finally, a report from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. 
GUN LAWS AGAIN ? (By Mark Kelly) That day in Tucson, amid a gun tragedy, one of the heroes almost got shot. It was Saturday, Jan. 8, 2011, and a mentally ill young man who’d gotten his hand on a gun opened fire on my wife, thenRep. Gabrielle Giffords (D–Ariz.), and her constituents at an event in a Safeway parking lot. He shot my wife in the head at close range, injured 12 others and took the lives of six people. One victim was a 9yearold girl. After Gabby’s wouldbe assassin dropped the full magazine as he sought to reload his gun and continue his rampage, people tackled him, kicked his gun away, subdued him as they waited for law enforcement to arrive and brought an end to the chaos. They were heroes. The chaos nearly continued, though. Because the man who murdered those innocent people wasn’t the only one there with a loaded, concealed gun. Joe Zamudio was shopping at a drugstore nearby when he heard the shots. Allowed to carry a concealed weapon under Arizona law, Zamudio recognized the sound of gunfire and rushed to the scene with his gun in his jacket pocket, his hand on his weapon and ready to fire. But then Zamudio—a good guy trying to do the right thing—almost shot another good guy. As he rounded the corner, he saw a man holding a gun. Zamudio confronted him: ‘‘Drop it, drop it!’’ he yelled. But that man with a gun was a good guy, too. He was one of the heroes who had wrestled the shooter to the ground. And he was moments away from being shot for the wrong reason. To his credit, Zamudio held his fire—just barely. As he recounted to reporters later, ‘‘It was a matter of seconds....  I  was really lucky....  I’ve never been in the military or had any professional training. I just reacted.’’ The situation that played out in the Safeway parking lot that day shows the potential for tragedy and bloodshed when untrained people carrying loaded guns react to a crisis. Even with the best intentions, an armed person without the extensive firearms training that is required to respond under pressure in a crisis will risk making the situation worse, not better. But this week, as we approach the seventh anniversary of the tragedy in Tucson and the fifth anniversary of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School—and after two of the five deadliest mass shootings in modern history happened in the last two months— Congress is working hard to pass one of the bigticket items on the National Rifle Association’s wishlist, a bill that weakens our gun laws and poses serious threats to public safety. The House of Representatives is on the verge of voting to allow people permitted to carry concealed weapons to carry them into any other state regardless of what that state’s law on such guns is. That would make it harder for law enforcement to do their job and allow all permit holders, even if they don’t have a single shred of training, to carry loaded, hidden guns on every street in our country. Right now, each state has the right to determine the extent to which it will recognize the concealed carry laws of other states. Some states have strong laws, preventing dangerous people like domestic abusers and convicted stalkers from obtaining concealed carry permits and requiring training and a thorough evaluation as part of the process. In other states, concealed carry laws have much lower standards. The 12 states with the weakest laws, permitless carry states, do not even require a permit. That means a resident of those states may carry loaded, concealed guns in public spaces without ever having passed a background check. The bill before Congress would allow people who have a permit issued by any state— including permitless carry states—to carry loaded, concealed handguns in any other state that allows concealed carry, even though they might not meet local public safety standards. This would mean an 18 yearold high school student from West Virginia could legally carry a concealed firearm in New York City, where residents must be 21 to even own a handgun. And what would it mean for law enforcement? Nothing good. The bill would impose a threat of personal litigation on all law enforcement officers by allowing anyone whose ability to carry a concealed gun is mistakenly questioned by law enforcement to personally sue the officer. This bill would also effectively require them to be an expert on nationwide gun laws as they work to determine if it’s legal for someone from out of state to be carrying a gun in whatever state they might be visiting. Just as concerning, it will mean that more law enforcement officers will have to confront more people with guns. And think back to the tragedy in Tucson: When law enforcement officers arrive at a crime scene where multiple people are holding guns, how do they even know who the good guy is? We need politicians to show courage and listen to the American people, who want stronger laws to make them safer, not giveaways to gun lobbyists that threaten the safety of our communities. And that’s exactly what this irresponsible bill would do. As members of Congress consider this bill, they have to ask themselves if they want to be remembered as voting to help the Washington gun lobby instead of supporting law enforcement and public safety. And they should know that their constituents are watching their decision closely. 
MAJOR CITIES CHIEFS ASSOCIATION , November 2, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN: On behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs, representing the Nation’s largest metropolitan law enforcement agencies in the country, we are writing to voice our strong opposition to the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, HR 38. Because we are responsible for public safety in jurisdictions across the Nation, we recognize that this legislation would be an enormous mistake. This measure is both impractical and contrary to the rights of States. Moreover, it raises Constitutional questions about the authority of Congress to direct State officers. Concealed weapon permit laws have been tailored to the needs of regions and local communities over a period of many years. An attempt by Congress to preempt these State laws forces States to accept the lowest minimum standard for concealed carry across the Nation, and creates a contradiction between the standards required for State residents and State visitors. The thousands of local permit formats would make enforcement impossible, because police officers would not be able to determine the validity of a permit issued in another State or locality. It would be impossible for law enforcement to distinguish true permit carriers from criminals and illegal guns. We are confident that members of Congress will respect the Constitutional sovereignty of the States and will not act with disregard for the many reasonable and prudent laws already in place across the Nation. Sincerely, J. THOMAS MANGER , Chief of Police, Montgomery County Police Department, President. 
CITY OF HOUSTON , HOUSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT , Houston, TX, November 29, 2017. Hon. CHUCK GRASSLEY , Chairman, Hon. DIANNE FEINSTEIN , Ranking Member, Committee of the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY AND RANKING  MEMBER FEINSTEIN : As the Chief of Police in Houston, I see firsthand the bloodshed and death toll from gun violence. Recent horrible events in Texas and Nevada serve as grim reminders that we have not done enough to prevent gun violence in America. While I am sorry I cannot attend your planned hearing, I serve as the First Vice President of Major Cities Chiefs and ask that you also enter this letter into the record. The mass shooting in Texas is an ugly and tragic example of the need to strengthen our system of background checks. That’s why I am supporting the measure introduced by Senator Cornyn and I urge the Committee to move his bill forward. The proposed legislation seeks to make current law work better by strengthening procedures. But we should not stop there as much more can be done to prevent the public from gun violence. This measure alone does not go far enough to stop what recently happened in Texas and the many, many senseless mass shootings that preceded our own tragedy. Universal Background Check: The mass shooting in Texas represents a renewed call for the Universal Background Check that Congress has failed to adopt in the past. Much has been said about how the Texas gunman would have been precluded from the store purchase if the background system had worked correctly. But what would have stopped him from buying the same weapons at the next gun show? It’s a disservice to the public to conduct background checks only in some cases, but not for all of them. ‘‘Bump Stocks’’: Another commonsense measure is a ban on ‘‘bump stocks’’ and similar accessories that replicate fully automatic weapons fire. Such features result in a number of shots fired that causes the carnage we witnessed in Las Vegas. Like other law enforcement officials, I have studied the Las Vegas slaughter and concluded that there is no reasonable sporting or hunting purpose served by deadly devices that simulate military weapons capabilities. I was seated next to the ATF Director at a recent meeting of Major Cities Chiefs when he advised the Chiefs that new legislation will be required. Concealed Weapons: Each State has carefully crafted its own laws relating to concealed weapons. While Congress has heretofore respected the Constitutional sovereignty of the States, there is legislation now pending that would undermine the authority of State laws relating to carrying of weapons. We strongly urge Congress to reject the misguided and impractical proposal for reciprocity. As police officers could not be expected to recognize legitimate or forged permits from thousands of jurisdictions, it would be impossible to determine which persons are authorized to carry a concealed weapon. Silencers: Legislation to deregulate silencers is illadvised because it would further threaten public safety. These devices were 
invented for killing and stealth. Once widespread, hunters would be unable to hear nearby gunfire and thus be endangered. Gunshot detection systems in urban areas would be thwarted. Worst of all, the proposed legislation would permit criminals to purchase and possess silencers without any screening requirements. There is simply no legitimate justification for a measure that would further endanger the public. Our Duty to Protect: Like those of us who wear a badge, members of Congress share our solemn duty to protect the public. The recent tragedies in Texas and Nevada should be recognized by Congress as cries for help from past and future innocent victims of gun violence. Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs join these victims in asking you to act now to prevent more death and bloodshed. We turn to you for courage and leadership to consider multiple steps and measures to curb the ongoing threat of gun violence in America. Sincerely, ARTACEVEDO , Chief of Police. 
NATIONAL TASKFORCE TO END SEXUAL & DOMESTIC VIOLENCE , December 1, 2017. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. H OUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES : As we enter the winter holiday season, we grieve for the approximately 556 women who will not celebrate with their families—the 556 women who have been murdered this year by intimate partners with firearms. As a country, we can and must do more to prevent the daily mass shootings that plague our nation, most of which are related to family violence. Accordingly, we, the member organizations of the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (NTF), comprising national organizations working to end genderbased violence and representing hundreds of member programs and hundreds of thousands of advocates and survivors, write to you today to oppose the package containing both the Concealed Carry Reciprocity (CCR) Act of 2017, H.R. 38, and the Fix NICS Act of 2017, H.R.4434. While the Fix NICS Act of 2017, H.R.4434, will protect victims of domestic violence by ensuring domestic violence records are properly and expeditiously submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, H.R. 38, undermines the safety of victims of domestic violence, dating violence and stalking by destabilizing protections for victims of abuse and allowing domestic violence offenders to follow their victims across state lines with loaded, concealed firearms. This combined measure is incredibly dangerous and will negate any protections offered by the Fix NICS Act. Firearms are regularly used as tools of power and control. A 2016 metaanalysis of existing literature found that approximately 4.5 million American women alive today have been threatened by abusers with firearms; of those, one million had either been shot or shot at by their abusers. Guns are also the weapon of choice for domestic violence homicides. An abuser’s mere access to a firearm increases the risk of intimate partner homicide of women by five times. Stalking is also a strong indicator of lethality, with one study of female murder victims in ten cities finding that 76% of women who were murdered by an intimate partner were stalked the previous year. Lawmakers have enacted strong, commonsense protections to prevent domestic violence homicides in states and localities across the nation and such protections must not be undermined by federally mandating concealed carry reciprocity. States and Reciprocity Agreements: Currently, each state determines who can legally carry concealed, loaded firearms in public. Many states have enacted strong laws to protect victims and survivors from gun enabled abuse beyond the vital but limited protection federal law provides. States enter into reciprocity agreements at their own discretion. The proposal before the Committee would take away this local control by requiring every state to recognize every other state’s concealed weapons permits, thereby undermining states’ authority to make their own decisions as to what measures will provide the best protection for their citizens. Victim Relocation: Often, victims of domestic violence, dating violence and stalking relocate across state lines to escape their abusers and seek refuge in states with stronger firearms protections. H.R. 38 would require states with strong protections for victims of abuse to accept the permits of states with weaker protections and allow domestic violence offenders to travel across state lines with loaded, concealed firearms. Domestic violence offenders could shop around for ‘‘out of state’’ permits, which are granted by ten states to nonresidents, even if they do not meet the requirements to obtain a permit in their home state. Even if domestic abusers are prohibited from possessing firearms from their state of residence, they could easily obtain ‘‘out of state’’ permits and cross state lines to threaten, harass and harm their victims with firearms. Law Enforcement and Background Checks: The CCR Act assumes that law enforcement need only look at an individual’s outofstate concealed carry license to verify their eligibility to carry a firearm. Twelve states no longer require permits to carry loaded, concealed firearms; individuals from those states would not be able to produce a state issued photo ID license to prove their eligibility to carry a concealed firearm, as required by the bills. The bill also assumes that federal firearms prohibitors apply to all persons asserting the right to concealed carry reciprocity. However, many states do not run background checks when issuing concealed permits, so law enforcement in the travel state is unable to ascertain whether a federal or state prohibitor impairs the traveler’s concealed carry permit or firearm possession. Even when a background check is required before a permit is issued, prohibited abusers often erroneously pass background checks, because the federal background check databases are missing most records relating to federal and many states’ domestic violence prohibitors. The Fix NICS Act of 2017 (H.R.4434): This bipartisan, bicameral bill reauthorizes NCHIP, requires all federal agencies and states to design implementation plans to increase submission of records into NICS, holds states and federal agencies responsible if they do not meet the benchmarks established in their implementation plans, and creates a Domestic Abuse and Violence Prevention Initiative to focus state efforts specifically on domestic violence records. This bill is supported not only by the domestic violence community but also such disparate entities as the NRA, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and a number of gun violence prevention organizations. Although gaps in reporting of records span a range of firearms prohibitors, the gap in reporting of domestic violence records is particularly notable. Approximately 700,000 protective orders reside in state databases that are not in any federal database, and countless more protective orders are issued at the local level but never entered into state databases. Similarly, there are significant gaps in the number of misdemeanor domestic violence convictions and the records submitted to NICS. Poor record keeping often leads to domestic abusers erroneously passing background checks or to ‘default proceed’, in which a background check cannot be completed within seventytwo hours, and a sale is allowed to proceed before the FBI has made a determination about the potential buyer’s ability to legally purchase or possess firearms. In 2013 and 2014, a plurality (approximately 40%) of cases referred by the FBI to the ATF for firearms retrieval after a default proceed were related to a domestic violence prohibitor. An unknown number of prohibited abusers wrongly passed background checks altogether. Simply put, we cannot support any bill that puts the lives of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking at risk. Any bill that includes the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, H.R.38, imperils the lives of victims, survivors, their children, their families, their friends and their communities. We continue to support The Fix NICS Act of 2017, H.R.4434, as a standalone bill because it saves lives. On behalf of victims of domestic violence, dating violence and stalking, we urge you to reconsider combining these bills. These two bills cannot be supported as a package and the CCR Act threatens to erase any progress that could be made by the Fix NICS Act. Sincerely, THENATIONAL TASKFORCE  
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY). Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so called Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. It is outrageous that today, of all days, 1 week before the 5year anniversary of the horrific murder of 20 schoolchildren and 6 educators in my district of Newtown, 2 months after the slaughter of 50 Americans watching a concert, that we are about to act on a bill to put more guns in the hands of more dangerous people. Rather than helping raise the standards nationally for gun safety, this bill would override and lower most States’ concealed carry laws, making it easier for domestic violence abusers, stalkers, and violent criminals to carry across State lines loaded hidden guns. This bill should be called the ‘‘Act to Carry Any Gun Anywhere Anytime by Anyone.’’ The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is an outrage and an insult to the families in Newtown and to the hundreds of families who have lost loved ones to gun violence who are gathered here today at the Capitol for the fifth annual Vigil to End Gun Violence. In the 5 years since Sandy Hook, this is the very first bill we have been allowed to vote on in this Chamber, and it is a reckless giveaway to the moneyed gun interests. Mr. Speaker, since 2012, gun violence has killed over 170,000 Americans. It is time for this House to truly honor the victims of gun violence and their families with action instead of caving in to the gun lobby yet again. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this dangerous bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, history is the great educator. We remember in American history the War of Independence started when the British tried to take away the firearms of Americans, and we had the Battles of Lexington and Concord. That revolution was successful because Americans were able to be armed. The Texas War of Independence started when the Mexican Government tried to take away the firearms of Texans. That started in Gonzales, Texas, and it was successful and we became an independent country. The Second Amendment is a constitutional right that Americans have. My friends on the other side don’t like the Second Amendment. They wish it wasn’t there. They do everything in their power to restrict the privilege and the right that we have under the Second Amendment, and we get it because of our history, to protect us from government and also for selfdefense. My friends talk about gun violence. They have got to remember that gun violence happens many times where people are disarmed, and it usually takes a gun to stop that gun, just like it did at the church in Texas. In another situation, if I were to drive my Jeep to California and I get stopped by the California Highway Patrol, which maybe would occur, I would show them my Texas driver’s license, and then they would let me drive, even though the laws in California are different on a driver’s license. Second, the registration of my Jeep in Texas would pass in California, even though if I had to get it done in California, it probably wouldn’t pass. But they recognize that because we have laws that recognize that. My marriage license would be accepted as well. The right to bear arms, the right to have a concealed carry weapon, is based on the Second Amendment of the Constitution. All this law does is allow us to exercise that right in every State. And that is just the way it is. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. NADLER for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, that is just the way it is. Since the start of 2017, more than 14,340 people have been killed by gun violence in the United States, more than any other country on Earth. That is just the way it is. More than 29,150 have been wounded. More than 680 of those have been children. In October, 58 people were killed and 515 wounded in Las Vegas in the worst mass shooting in our Nation’s history. But we don’t have a bill on the floor to prevent the creation of machine guns, which are illegal, by bump stocks. Just 5 weeks later, a gunman entered a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and killed 26 worshipers, while wounding 20. The majority’s response? Bring to the floor a bill that makes America less safe, more replete with people carrying and concealing weapons in our communities. This bill says: If you want to carry a concealed weapon in a State that doesn’t allow it constitutionally, no problem. Get your concealed carry license in another State that does. In other words, every State, no matter their own judgment, talk about States’ rights, no matter their own judgment, must be subjected to the policies of the least protective State in the Nation. Instead of addressing the very serious problem of rampant gun violence in a constructive way, the Republican majority is bringing to the floor a bill that makes it easier to hide dangerous weapons in public. Newtown, Aurora, Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, and community after community after community. What will it take for this Congress to act? What will it take to face this challenge instead of ignoring it? How many more will not live to see the new year or begin it with debilitating injuries they will carry for the rest of their lives? How many times will we have a moment of silence and a year of no action? Mr. Speaker, defeat this bill. Its rational provision of NICS, making sure people report, does not justify the danger it expands. Support the rights of States to protect their residents from hidden firearms. Do not ignore the crisis that confronts our country. Have a moment of action, a moment of legislating more safety, not less; not simply a few seconds of silence to lament the loss of life, whether it be in Las Vegas or Orlando or in our own communities. Defeat this bill. Come back and do some positive, constructive work that makes America safe again. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to include in the RECORD a letter signed by 23 of those States’ attorneys general who say, in part, in this letter: ‘‘Strong evidence indicates that concealed carry permit holders actually deter and reduce crime.’’ This is taking action by passing this legislation. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, our Founders laid out certain rights in our Constitution, not to empower the government, but to empower the people. Certainly among the most fundamental of those rights we have as Americans is to keep and bear arms. H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, simply ensures all lawabiding citizens who meet the requirements to obtain concealed carry permits in their home State can exercise the right to protect themselves in any State, provided that they obey the local concealed carry laws. Mr. Speaker, some opponents of this bill claim that we are somehow making it easier for dangerous unqualified individuals to obtain and carry guns. That is absolutely not true. If a citizen is currently prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm, this bill does nothing to change that. On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, others will tell you that we are making it harder for lawabiding Americans to exercise their Second Amendment right. That is not true either. H.R. 38 does nothing to infringe upon anyone’s right to keep and bear arms. The bill simply ensures that our current National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, is enforced and working properly. Those of us who respect the Second Amendment and dedicate our careers to defending it will always fight to protect this fundamental right from those who would erode it. Mr. Speaker, we also have a responsibility to uphold and enforce our current laws to ensure dangerous people can’t obtain weapons. In fact, it is precisely because we want to preserve our Second Amendment right that we must ensure our criminal background check system works properly. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill in order to ensure that those who obtain a concealed carry permit in one State are able to enjoy the freedom in any State and to make sure our current background check system is working the way it was intended to work. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ). Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, firstly, the NRA put a bulletin out to urge people to vote for this. They said: ‘‘We must ensure that antigun jurisdictions do not harass travelers.’’ Mr. Speaker, that is the purpose of this bill from the NRA, that nine antigun jurisdictions, State legislatures that have restrictive gun laws, cannot harass travelers, cannot see that their State has the same laws that their citizens have from people out of State. When my friends on the other side talk about being concerned about the Second Amendment and dedicating their lives to it and seeing that irresponsible people don’t get guns, when we tried to bring a no fly, no buy law, they weren’t for it. They talked about due process. But have they brought a due process bill to the floor for people who are on the nofly list? No. People who are on Social Security who can’t manage their own affairs, they passed a law that said they should get guns when they couldn’t before. That is not in keeping with what they are saying. This bill violates States’ rights, puts guns in the hands of people that States don’t want them to have. There are seven States that don’t allow people under 21, unless they are in the military, to have a gun permit. This Federal law would override those seven States. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a bad law. It is the NRA’s law. We should have had amendments considered in committee, but we didn’t because the NRA didn’t want them. b1515 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to support the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which will allow a person who is licensed in one State to carry their firearm to carry it in other States. It works just like your driver’s license. My Texas driver’s license lets me drive in Virginia; it lets me drive in Florida; it lets me drive in California. When I was a child growing up in Texas, my family taught me the importance of marksmanship, gun safety, and the Second Amendment. And I have long said that, when it comes to reducing violence, it is the individual, not the weapon, that we need to be focused on. This bill helps ensure an American’s right to carry is not infringed when crossing State lines, enhancing public safety. In fact, as the chairman stated earlier here today, a peerreviewed study shows that States with more restrictive concealed carry laws had higher gunrelated murder rates. That is why we need an armed citizenry to protect ourselves and each other. As we saw in the terrible Texas church shooting in Sutherland Springs just recently, the death toll could have been much higher had not an armed citizen been there to confront the gunman. There are those who insist the bill will arm the criminals, but those claims are far from true, as gun laws restricting criminals from access to weapons are already there in their home States. They are going to remain undisturbed. I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and the Constitution, as I suspect most of you all are, Mr. Speaker, and I believe gun control is hitting what you aim at and nothing else. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ). Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, it has been almost 5 years to the day that 20 6 and 7year old babies were slaughtered in Newtown. It has been about a yearanda half since 49 people were killed in my home State of Florida, 58 more being injured. In October, 59 people were killed and 500 injured at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. And in November, 26 people were killed and injured as they worshiped in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The response to all of this tragedy is a bill to make it easier for people to carry concealed weapons in every corner of this country. I don’t know whose idea—other than the gun corporations, I don’t know whose idea it was that this would be the way that we honor the memories of those who have been killed, that instead of commonsense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of people in this country support, we get a bill to make it possible to carry concealed weapons in every State, in every corner of this country. When my friends on the other side say this doesn’t override any laws, that is absolutely untrue. In States that have State laws that govern where you can and can’t carry a gun, this bill overrides that and says you can bring any gun into the State, whatever your regulations are about what you can carry. This is a bill that doesn’t make us safer. It doesn’t make us stronger. But make no mistake, it makes the bottom line, the profits of the gun makers in this country, a little bit healthier. As we enter the Christmas season and we think about the 20 6 and 7yearold kids whose lives were taken 5 years ago today, whose parents, whose families suffer every day with that loss, whose kids aren’t there to receive Christmas presents, I ask my friends on the other side: Why is it that we respond to that by giving this enormous Christmas gift to the NRA? Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to include in the RECORD two articles, one from Tennessee and one from Florida, in which concealed carry permit holders stopped dead in their tracks people who were going to commit murder. 
[From www.wsmv.com, Oct. 8, 2017] USHER BEING CALLED ‘‘HERO’’ FORHELPING  
TOSTOPANTIOCH CHURCH SHOOTER  (By Edward Burch) ANTIOCH , TN.—Robert Caleb Engle is being hailed as a hero after helping to stop the accused gunman during the shooting at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch on Sunday. According to police and witnesses at the scene, Engle, who is an usher at the church, confronted the accused shooter, Emanuel Kidega Samson. Engle was then pistol whipped by Samson. The two got into a scuffle before Samson shot himself in the chest. Engle, who has a carry permit, went out to his car to get a gun, despite suffering a head injury. Engle then went back inside the church to confront Samson and held him at gunpoint until authorities arrived. Engle, 22, declined an oncamera interview but did send a statement. When complimented about his heroism, Engle said, ‘‘I do not want to be labeled a hero. The real heroes are the police, first responders, medical staff and doctors who have helped me and everyone affected.’’ ‘‘I’ve been going to this church my whole life,’’ Engle said ‘‘I would have never, ever thought something like this would have happened.’’ ‘‘(He’s) just an outstanding young man, even before today,’’ said Tammy Adcock, one of Engle’s neighbors. ‘‘Today just proved his character.’’ Engle also asked for prayers for not just the victims, but for the shooter and the shooter’s family. ‘‘They are hurting as well,’’ Engle said. Engle and 64yearold Catherine Dickerson were taken to Skyline Medical Center with nonlifethreatening injuries. Both Engle and Dickerson have since been released from the hospital. [From Florida Today, Nov. 27, 2017] SCHLENKER SHOOTING : R OCKLEDGE GUNMAN  RECOVERING , WORKED AT BREVARD ELEMEN TARY SCHOOL  (By J.D. Gallop) The 28yearold man suspected of carrying out a shooting at a Rockledge auto shop last week that left one person dead and another paralyzed, also worked as a parttime custodian at an elementary school, authorities said. Brevard County Public School officials confirmed that Robert Lorenzo Bailey Jr. was employed with the district since 2014, working at Lewis Carroll Elementary on Merritt Island. ‘‘He’s a parttime custodian,’’ said Jennifer Wolfinger, spokeswoman for the school district, adding that Bailey remains on the payroll. Officials are reviewing his employment records. Bailey wandered onto the Schlenker Automotive property on Friday, and using a .40 caliber handgun, started firing on workers, killing 50yearold Schlenker employee Roger Lee Smith, Rockledge police said. Smith had stepped into the parking lot after he heard a shot that paralyzed a 25yearold, unidentified coworker, according to police. Police have not released the identity. Two other workers—both concealed weapons permit holders—confronted the gunman and engaged in a shootout that left the suspect wounded. Bailey continues to recover at Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne. The shooting—which happened the day after Thanksgiving—left family members of the victim, a husband, father and grandfather, devastated. ‘‘He would do anything . . . anything for anybody. It hurts that somebody would hurt him,’’ said Bnickcole Smith, a 27yearold niece of the victim. ‘‘That man took from us a longtime husband, a father figure and a grandfather. He loved being with his family and was such a fun, outgoing person. Personally, it’s just destroyed me.’’ Bailey, known to friends as a bouncer and a regular in the Cocoa Village pub scene, did not have any connections to the autoshop, police said. Police have not yet confirmed any criminal or medical history that might give insight into a possible motive. Others who knew Bailey, including a manager at the Dog and Bone British Pub, said he seemed to be acting differently lately. The manager said Bailey was fired from his job at the pub after Bailey confronted a patron. Another manager suggested Bailey see a doctor after Bailey aired thoughts that he believed the patron had a gun and was attempting to kill him. ‘‘You could tell he had gone through some type of stress or disorder. He kept to himself,’’ said 26yearold Paul Lyal, who learned about the shooting late Sunday. Lyal said he met Bailey at the Dog and Bone British Pub several years ago. ‘‘Sometimes he would be quiet, other times out laughing with everyone. He would even do karaoke or just go upstairs and dance for hours,’’ Lyal recalled. ‘‘I’m just shocked like everyone else.’’ Rockledge detectives did not comment on Bailey’s injuries or surgery over the weekend to treat his wounds. Lou Schlenker, owner of the business that has operated in Rockledge for 36 years, released a statement to Florida Today on Sunday evening: ‘‘In this difficult time of mourning the loss of Roger and the severe injuries that (our other employee) has sustained, we would like 
to thank all of the community for the overwhelming support and prayers we have received. We know there will be a long healing process ahead of us but we want to reassure everyone that this is an organization full of dedicated, courageous, and heroic individuals serving this community,’’ the statement read. 
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know why Democrats are so afraid to allow people to exercise the full extent of their constitutional rights. In my State, we have got 1.7 million concealed carry permit holders. Concealed carry permit holders in Florida are eight times less likely to commit crimes than members of law enforcement. I think the American people see that, if they had their way, we would take the bad acts of people who break the law and we would use that as an excuse to deprive lawabiding people of the full exercise of their rights. So I rise in support of the Constitution and to correct a common mistake. The rights that are enumerated in the Constitution are not granted to the American people by government. These are Godgiven rights, and it is the government’s duty to protect them for all citizens. For too long, the government has failed to protect the Constitution and has stripped lawabiding citizens of their freedom. States recognize driver’s licenses from other States, but nowhere in the Constitution are they mentioned; yet States routinely deny carry permits from other States, including neighboring States, even though the Constitution explicitly states that the right of people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Mr. HUDSON ’s good bill restores constitutional liberty. I am proud to join in sponsoring this legislation and to stand with the Constitution and against those who wish to dismantle it. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to remember the oath that they swore to uphold and defend the Constitution, and I would encourage them to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 38. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle made a number of arguments about how, if everyone has a concealed weapon, America will be safer. Mr. Speaker, I have two studies here which directly rebut that: A 2017 Stanford University study found that in States that adopted the most permissive concealed carry laws, violent crime is 13 to 15 percent higher than it would have been had the State retained a more restrictive law; A 2017 study by researchers at Boston University found that States with shallissue laws had a 10.6 percent higher handgun homicide rate, consistent with the results of the Stanford study. Both of those empirical studies disprove the claim that we make America safer if everyone carries a hidden, loaded firearm. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), the distinguished chairman of the Democratic Caucus. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I must have missed something in my religious training. Were there 11 Commandments by God? I know about the first 10, but I missed that 11th one that thou shall have the ability to bear arms. I missed that one, that God given right. Was it a Godgiven right for someone to take that Godgiven right and execute 58 people at a concert? Was that a Godgiven right? Mr. Speaker, the American people have spoken with nearly a unanimous voice. They want Congress to keep their families safe by passing commonsense gun safety legislation, legislation that will keep guns out of the hands of criminals; protections that will keep those who want to cause terror in our churches, in our schools, at concerts, and in our communities from getting those firearms. The bill before us does the exact opposite. It would force States like New York to weaken their own gun safety laws and allow concealed carry. It puts families like yours and mine at risk. And for what? To appease the NRA? That is shameful. In the 66 days since the Las Vegas massacre, Congress has done nothing, absolutely nothing, to address the clear loopholes in our laws that allowed one man to kill and injure so many. It has been 66 days since numerous Republicans denounced the bump stocks and promised a fix, only to turn around and do this bill. At a time when we have seen one horrific mass shooting after another, Republicans are forcing through a bill that will put each and every American in harm’s way. What is more, this egregious proposal comes days before the fifth anniversary of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook. This will put us in further danger of another Las Vegas, another Orlando, and another Sandy Hook. The American people are sick and tired of this. They want this Congress to protect them, not enable criminals. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining on each side. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa). The gentleman from Virginia has 11
3⁄4minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 13 minutes remaining. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, in my 41 years of law enforcement, 12 years as a sheriff of Duval County, Florida, I can tell you I have seen many, many times where good, lawabiding citizens used legal firearms to stop dangerous people from harming them, their loved ones, and even their neighbors. Mr. Speaker, as a law enforcement professional, I want good people carrying firearms. The Fraternal Order of Police that represents thousands of officers all across the United States of America supports good people carrying firearms. Do you know why? Because we know, as law enforcement officers we understand that, at our agencies, our priority one response time target is 7 minutes. In a lifeanddeath situation, we target getting there in 7 minutes. That is in a wellpoliced community. I want to put Republicans, Democrats, and everyone on notice that, for that 7 minutes, you better be prepared to protect yourself. If an active shooter in a mall, in a school, in a church like we just saw in Sutherland Springs, Texas, is killing people, let’s say to the tune of five people per minute, that is an average of 35 dead, unarmed citizens before the police can even arrive at the scene. Believe me, we want good, lawabiding citizens who are authorized to carry firearms to have the ability to intervene in a violent situation before law enforcement can even arrive at the scene. We need the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act to ensure that these good, lawabiding citizens can retain the constitutional right to bear arms legally across State lines and hopefully be able to stop a violent incident. Mr. Speaker, none of our other constitutional rights stop at a State line. Our Second Amendment rights should not stop at that line either. Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 38 and save lives. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. We just heard some of our other colleagues on the other side of the aisle speak about the Godgiven right to apparently carry a concealed, loaded firearm across State lines. What about the Godgiven right to live, to stay alive, and to be free from gun violence in this country? 
We now have seen the two deadliest shootings in American history, 20 children slaughtered 5 years ago at Sandy Hook, and the list goes on and on. Our Republican colleagues will do nothing about it. They won’t pass universal background checks. They won’t pass no fly, no buy to keep terrorists from being able to buy a gun. They won’t prevent bump stocks. But they are finally rising up to do something, and what is their answer? Let everyone in America carry a concealed, loaded firearm. Even people who are violent criminals, stalkers, and domestic abusers can carry a concealed firearm. Make no mistake about it. This legislation allows someone to go online. You don’t have to be a resident of the State, a State that has no protections. You don’t have to have training. You could be a criminal. You can go online and you get a permit in that State. You don’t have to be a resident. You only have to go there, and you can then travel America with a loaded, concealed firearm and overrule the will of the people of that State through their legislature to impose responsible limitations on it. b1530 It also endangers police officers who can be sued for having the audacity to ask someone if they actually have a permit and detain them. They have a cause of action against the police officer and attorneys’ fees—unprecedented. This is the response to a country that is pleading for responsible gun safety legislation, that is living with the carnage of gun violence and asking this Congress: Do something about it; protect us from this violence. Our Republican colleagues muster up the courage to pay homage to the NRA and make it easier to sell guns so that people can carry concealed loaded firearms all across this country. Shame on you. Shame on you. You have a responsibility to work with us to protect our constituents from gun violence and to enact sensible gun safety legislation that will reduce the incidents of gun violence. This will make it worse. The claim that somehow it makes it safer is refuted by all of the empirical evidence. You know it is. Shame on the Republicans. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman and other Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017. Our constitutional right to keep and bear arms should not be confined by State lines. Yet, currently, a person who has legally obtained a concealed carry permit in one State can be denied that right by simply crossing the State’s border. Consider my own home State of Louisiana. Our laws rightfully allow for licensed carrying of concealed firearms. I am a concealed carry permit holder myself. When a Louisianian leaves the State, however, our valid concealed carry handgun permit becomes void, absent an agreement from the State we may be in or traveling through. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act that we vote upon today ensures that lawabiding citizens with a concealed carry permit are not denied their Second Amendment right simply because they travel to other States. The Constitution should know no such bound. It does so while also recognizing States’ rights by clearly noting that concealed carry holders must follow the law of each and every jurisdiction. As a constitutional law attorney myself, it is critically important to me that the fundamental right of every lawabiding citizen to keep and bear arms is protected; and, yes, this legislation is about preserving our God given freedoms. It is about public safety, and it is about common sense. As noted, our letter by 23 States attorneys general, including my own home State of Louisiana, affirms that concealed carry laws deter crime. As my friend and colleague, Sheriff Rutherford, just said here so well, he reminded us that law enforcement wants the good guys to be armed. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act protects our Second Amendment right, and I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation. I want to thank Congressman HUDSON for introducing H.R. 38 and Chairman GOODLATTE for advancing this legislation through the House Judiciary Committee. I am proud to be a part of this historic legislation. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, there have been 914 cases of nonselfdefense killings by private citizens holding permits to carry concealed loaded handguns in the last 10 years, which translates into 1,119 Americans dead by homicide, mass shooting, suicide, and murder of police officers under concealed carry permit laws in the States. In Florida, for example—I saw my friend, Mr. RUTHERFORD , up there—in August, concealed handgun permit holder, Everett Miller, shot and killed two Kissimmee, Florida, police officers. Now, if you want to give everybody the right to a concealed carry permit in your States, fine. But don’t impose that on the people of Maryland. We have got our own laws, thank you. Since January, we have had 397 gun massacres in America defined as a slaying of four people or more. Two of them—Las Vegas, which left 58 people dead, and Sutherland Springs, which left 26 people dead—are among the 10 worst massacres in American history by gun. The American people want to end this reign of terror. But what do our friends do on the other side? Do they bring us the universal criminal background check legislation favored by more than 90 percent of the American people of every political party to plug the gun show loophole, the internet loophole, and the 7Eleven parking lot loophole? No. Do they bring to the floor the bill to criminalize bump stocks which they promised to us? No. No such luck. Instead, they bring forward a bill that would wipe out the vast majority of concealed carry laws in the United States of America, trampling States’ rights and wrecking all of the painstaking work of legislatures all over the land dragging this down to the most lax and permissive State laws in the country. It is not a race to the bottom, it is a plunge to the bottom they have engineered here. This fraudulently named bill has nothing to do with reciprocity because States already have the power to negotiate reciprocity agreements, and 22 of them have it. Your bill destroys reciprocity. Your bill brings us down to the level of the lowest, most permissive laws in the country. My State doesn’t give concealed carry permits to domestic abusers, to violent offenders, and to dangerously unstable people. Don’t drag us down to the lowest level. Protect States’ rights. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CULBERSON ). Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, the difference of opinion on this bill vividly illustrates the profoundly different world view of Democrats versus Republicans. Democrats instinctively trust the government and instinctively distrust individuals. Republicans instinctively distrust the government and trust the good hearts and good sense of individual Americans to be the best stewards of protecting themselves, their family, their property, and their freedoms. Our Founders understood this, and this is why the First Amendment protects our freedom of conscience and the Second Amendment follows it immediately so that we, as free people, have the ability to protect ourselves—our freedom of conscience—against the overpowering force of the government. We in Texas enacted in 1995, while I was a member of the Texas house, a concealed carry law, and we have had now over 20 years of data. People can go to the Department of Texas Public Safety website and look under conviction rates and see that the concealed carry permit holders in Texas, over the last 22 years, are 21 times less likely to commit a crime than the average Texans. The 7 minutes Sheriff Rutherford just mentioned to us are a lifetime, if you or your family or neighbors are at risk of attack. The individual lawabiding American who is carrying a concealed weapon has had a background check, they have been trained in the 
use of the weapon, and they know the law. We all, as Americans, should work together to preserve the Second Amendment right of every American to keep and bear arms no matter what State they are in. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this important legislation. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ). Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Like so many Texans, I grew up in a household that honored a tradition of gun ownership for hunting, for collection, and for sportsmanship, and also honored gun safety. I was taught to shoot by my uncle, Raymond O’Rourke, jail captain and the chief marksman in the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office. I also live in a State that has a license to carry process which requires safety training, though 18 States do not. Texas requires that someone who has a license to carry be 21 years or older, though 15 States do not. Texas requires that those who abuse their partners not be allowed to have a license to carry, though 14 States do not. Texas does not grant licenses to violent offenders, though 22 States do. Texas does not grant licenses to people convicted of stalking, though 21 other States do. What H.R. 38 does, Mr. Speaker, is it subjects every Texan and every El Pasoan whom I represent to the lowest common denominator in the United States. It will make our State less— not more—safe. That is why I oppose H.R. 38, and I ask all my colleagues to join me in doing the same. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to point out that the attorney general of the State of Texas has signed a letter, along with 22 other State attorneys general, in support of this legislation and pointing out that authorized permit holders to carry across State lines will not result in an increased risk of crime. Further, strong evidence indicates that concealed carry permit holders actually deter and reduce crime. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ), who is the lead Democratic cosponsor of this legislation. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, as one of the lead sponsors for the Fix NICS Act of 2017, I rise in support of this legislation which has been combined with the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which is, again, another section that I support, also. On the Fix NICS Act, I certainly want to thank Senator CORNYN , Representatives CULBERSON , E STY, C OSTELLO , and A GUILAR for their leadership on this particular issue that we have been working on. A few weeks ago, 26 members of the Sutherland Springs community, which is in my district, were killed by someone who should have never had access to firearms. The investigation into the shooter revealed that the shooter had a criminal history. The Defense Department and the Air Force missed six times—six times—where the criminal justice process should have reported the history to the NICS database. As of 2016, the Air Force, which should have entered the Sutherland Springs shooter’s criminal information, entered a total of one active record in the NICS record. If the Air Force would have met the minimum obligations, then the gunman never would have been able to legally purchase a firearm. This is why we introduced the Fix NICS Act of 2017. This legislation ensures that Federal and State authorities comply with existing laws to accurately report relevant criminal history—accurately report these records to the NICS. It also provides consequences for Federal agencies who fail to report the relevant records and ensure that States improve their overall reporting. The Fix NICS Act is an important step to ensure that people like the Sutherland Springs shooter never slip through the cracks of the NICS database again. As to the reciprocity part of it, again, I know that both sides have spoken on that, but, again, as a supporter of the Second Amendment, I believe that the Second Amendment doesn’t stop at political State lines. It is part of the U.S. Constitution and should apply across. So, again, I rise in support of this legislation, and I ask my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. THOMP SON), who is the chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this dangerous bill. I asked my local law enforcement what they thought of folks from out of State who don’t meet our local requirements coming into our communities with loaded concealed firearms. These are the folks who are on the front lines of fighting gun violence, and we should listen to what they have to say. Our Sonoma County sheriff opposes this bill and says it would negatively affect our community and put citizens and his deputies in greater danger. The chief of police from my hometown in St. Helena said: As a lifelong proponent of the ability to own, possess, and carry firearms within the provisions of the law, I am wholeheartedly against H.R. 38. Like many of us, he asks: How long will it take before someone who can’t meet the legal requirements to concealed carry in California goes to some other State with little or no standards and gets a permit from that State? Our chief of police in Martinez opposes this bill and says that it is a race to the bottom. Overwhelmingly, law enforcement in my district strongly oppose this bill. Moreover, there is a reason no major law enforcement organizations have come out in support of this bill. It is dangerous, and it is unnecessary. I think my colleagues should stand with law enforcement—the people that keep us and our families safe—and oppose this bill. Every example that was given from my friends across the aisle doesn’t pertain to this bill. They talk about, in their States, concealed carry. Texas was the last one. In Texas, there is a standard you have to meet to get a concealed carry permit. If this bill passes, you erase that standard. Somebody from out of State who is a violent criminal can come in with a loaded concealed firearm in the State of Texas. Someone who is a criminal in the State of Texas, where there are rules, can go to another State, get a concealed carry permit, and bring that loaded, concealed firearm into the State of Texas. This is bad policy, and it should be opposed. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN). Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. This commonsense legislation ensures that our Second Amendment rights don’t end when we cross State lines. We are all aware of the story of Shaneen Allen, a mother of three who was pulled over in New Jersey after committing a minor traffic violation. She told the police legally that she had a handgun on her person and a concealed carry permit. She was unaware that the permit was not transferable to New Jersey, and she had no prior criminal record. Nonetheless, she spent 40 days in a jail cell. Americans like Shaneen are exposed to real risks of accidentally breaking the law of another State simply by exercising their constitutional right. This bill ensures that valid concealed carry permits from one State are valid in all other States. b1545 It creates legal protections for law abiding gun owners against States that violate this statute. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation and to show the American people the Second Amendment is safe with us. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 6 minutes remaining. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. M ALONEY ). Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, we have a gun violence epidemic in this country. It is glaringly obvious to anyone paying attention that our Federal gun safety laws are pathetically weak and in major need of improvement. 
So what is this House doing about it? Working to pass a bill that completely undermines gun safety laws and puts more guns on the street and more lives at risk. Believe me, if more guns made this country safer, we would be the safest country on Earth. We are far from it. Under this bill, someone who couldn’t get a concealed carry permit in New York would now be able to carry concealed guns into New York State or any State, as long as they have a permit from another State. This completely eviscerates Statelevel gun safety laws and puts us all at the mercy of the weakest gun safety laws in the country. This bill is opposed by major law enforcement organizations across this country. I urge this body to listen to their advice and vote against this reckless assault on State and local gun safety laws. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD). Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Mr. HUDSON ’s Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. As things stand, each State currently determines its own concealed carry reciprocity laws. Some States don’t recognize concealed carry permits from other States. This forces lawful gun owners to sometimes surrender their Second Amendment rights when they are traveling. The current system has created accidental criminals, ruined lives, and punished gun owners simply because they fell victim to complexity and uncertainty in the law. My colleague’s bill addresses this problem by bringing muchneeded clarity to the system. H.R. 38 is a simple proposal, but a necessary one. If enacted, it will allow lawful gun owners to carry their firearm into other States that allow concealed carry. This interstate recognition of concealed carry would be very similar to a driver’s license. H.R. 38 would not create national standards for concealed carry or take away a State’s right to govern their own concealed carry laws, like some might claim. No. This bill simply uses Congress’ 14th Amendment power to protect people’s constitutional rights from State abuse. Samuel Adams said: ‘‘The Constitution shall never be construed . . . to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.’’ This powerful line from Mr. Adams sums up my feelings on this bill much better than I can. I thank Mr. HUDSON for his steadfast leadership on this issue. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ). Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle from Florida talked about the 1.7 million concealed weapons permits that are issued in Florida. Let me make it quite clear that those permits are issued to Floridians for Floridians, not to any person from any State at any time who wants to bring a gun into Florida. Different from my colleague, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for the safety of every American and for the safety of our first responders, who are entrusted with that awesome responsibility. As Members of Congress, our question should be: What can we all do to make living in America safer? Every day, law enforcement officers risk their lives to keep our communities safe. Last week, I was honored that the House passed the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act unanimously. Police officers have a tough job, and I think we can all agree on this point: the job is getting tougher. Mr. Speaker, we must ask ourselves: Why would any Member, Republican or Democrat, support this legislation that would make a police officer’s job harder, more dangerous, and open our officers up to personal liability for simply doing their jobs? This reckless piece of legislation would allow persons from outside your State to bring their firearms anywhere, including school zones, without applying the guidelines, laws, restrictions, or oversight of your State. Mr. Speaker, I want you to envision this situation from the perspective of a law enforcement officer. An outof state, armed individual is stopped by that officer. Maybe that individual’s license is legitimate, maybe it is not. The officer is on the side of the road, facing an armed individual, trying to figure out whether the individual’s permit is authentic, which the officer is obligated to do. If the permit is fake, failing to stop that individual puts the community at risk. If the permit is real, stopping the individual has opened the officer up to potential personal liability. In the last year, I have heard my colleagues on the other side talk about how we should better empower States to decide what is in their own best interest. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Florida. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, this legislation strips individual States of their power and puts our public safety officers in legal and personal jeopardy. Supporting this legislation is reckless and irresponsible. As a former chief of police, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 38. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ). Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, for generations, Maine families have enjoyed the great outdoors. That means hunting, fishing, camping, and hiking. That is part of who we are as a people. That is part of our way of life. Part of that way of life is responsibly and lawfully owning firearms. We are comfortable with them. We have been for generations. Mr. Speaker, Mr. HUDSON ’s bill, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, is a commonsense fix to a patchwork of State laws that will confuse, and do confuse, lawabiding Americans who have valid concealed carry permits issued by their own States when they want to travel to or through other States that have different concealed carry laws. I want to make this very clear: H.R. 38 does not allow travel as long as the holder of a concealed carry license does not obey the laws of the States that he or she is traveling to. I read directly, Mr. Speaker, from the statute: ‘‘This bill shall not be construed to supersede or limit the laws of any State.’’ So the other side of the aisle just needs to make sure they get this exactly right, because they have not been correct on this fact. Mr. Speaker, Mr. HUDSON ’s bill actually additionally strengthens existing regulations by requiring Federal Government agencies to promptly and accurately require a reporting to the FBI someone who is mentally ill, someone who has committed a serious crime, or someone who is in the country illegally and should not have a firearm. This bill is a commonsense bill that will help lawabiding Americans enjoy their Second Amendment right, their outdoor sporting activities, and help keep our families safer. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this bill is advanced I am not sure in the name of what, but what it is going to do is make us less safe and to overrule all our States. Under this bill, someone who lives in New York could go to another State— doesn’t even have to go to another State; just apply to the other State, get a concealed carry permit from that State, never set foot in that State, and then use it in New York; thus, overriding New York’s laws. We have heard it said that this bill is necessary to protect the Second Amendment constitutional rights of gun owners. But the fact is, there is no Second Amendment constitutional right for concealed carry. In the District of Columbia v. Heller case in which the Supreme Court said that the Second Amendment established a personal right, Justice Scalia’s 
opinion held that the Second Amendment was not unlimited, a variety of gun regulations were entirely consistent with the Constitution, and he said: 
The majority of American courts to consider the question have held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment for State analogues. 
So the Second Amendment argument is simply wrong or disingenuous. But let me say also that we are living in an epidemic of gun violence. 33,000 Americans are killed every year, and 30,000 more every year. No other country approaches this. No country—other than those at war—in peacetime has more than 300 or 400, or even 100 or 72, and we have 33,000. It is not because of mental illness. It is because of the presence of large numbers of gun. A 2017 Stanford University study found a direct correlation with the most permissive concealed carry laws and violent crime. General studies have shown a direct correlation of the presence of the number of guns and murder rates by guns. So this is a bill that is a death sentence for many Americans. That is what this bill is. It is a death sentence without trial for many Americans by increasing the danger of guns by overruling States that fear and that we don’t want concealed weapons on the New York City subway or the Chicago metro or other places of great concentrations of people. But no, we, in our wisdom, are going to say the States with the least restrictive, perhaps most rural, maybe sensible restrictions for them, will impose those restrictions on other States. It is wrong. It is a death sentence for many Americans. It ought not pass. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT ) for the purpose of closing the argument. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, we all have subjects that we find fascinating. For 25 years, I have actually kept files of abstracts on this because I actually participated in writing Arizona’s 1993 concealed carry law. I desperately wish this was an intellectually honest conversation about the data, because we all want our communities and families to be safer. I believe I can show you the statistical abstract data. In States like Arizona, adjusted for population, the violent use of firearms is almost onehalf of what it was before the adoption of our concealed carry law. Now, was concealed carry responsible for that? Of course, not. But it is a factor. Some of it is mental health, some of it is law enforcement, some of it is incarceration. It is complicated. But if you actually look at these data abstracts of crime statistics in the United States on the misuse of firearms, it turns out that States that have adopted concealed carry compared to States that have gone other directions, States that adopted have gotten safer. There is actually some brilliant articles when you compare Florida and Illinois: big, populated, demographically complex States. Florida has gotten dramatically safer. Illinois has not. If you really love our families, love our communities, this needs to be an intellectually sound discussion of what factors make us safer as a society. I believe this bill leads us in that direction. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I oppose H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. While I am opposed to restricting law abiding citizens’ access to firearms, I feel that this bill does not adequately address many of the requirements that states have instituted in passing their own concealed carry laws. I am a big supporter of concealed carry and was the lead author of a bill in 1991 in the State Senate to create local concealed carry. The way this bill is written would strip many protections that are currently afforded to Texans. Texas has many requirements for a person to be able to get that license including livefire training. As a state, we also bar convicted domestic abusers and those convicted of violent crimes and stalking. Under this bill, an individual who had committed those crimes could conceal carry their weapon in Texas if they got their permit from a neighboring state that lacked these requirements for concealed carry like Mississippi. It is for these reasons that I do not support this bill as it is currently written. If we are going to create a federal reciprocity standard for concealed carry it should be a standard that takes into account many of the protections individual states have created. I would proudly vote in support of a bill that addressed these standing issues. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. B OST). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 645, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. b1600 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. THOMPSON of California. I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, or the District of Columbia—a vote for this underlying bill is a vote to undermine your own State gun violence prevention policy, because this bill says that, even if your State prohibits its own residents who have been convicted of certain violent crimes, you can’t prohibit someone from another State with the same criminal record from carrying a loaded, concealed firearm if their State allows it. This motion to recommit would state that a person who has been convicted of a violent crime within the preceding 3 years may not possess or carry a concealed handgun in a State that prohibits a person from doing so on the basis of a conviction for that very same offense. This would be people convicted of crimes such as resisting arrest, assault, permitting sexual abuse of a minor, aggravated assault, or violation of a criminal sexual assault protection order—all violent crimes. An ‘‘aye’’ vote on this motion to recommit is a proStates’ rights, pro Second Amendment, and anticriminal vote. I am a gun owner. I have been all of my life. I am not opposed to concealed carry, but I am opposed to violent criminals having guns, and Members should be, too. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this motion to recommit; and if they vote against it, they are voting to allow violent criminals, convicted criminals, to carry loaded, concealed firearms in their community, in their State, and in their district. That is wrong. We should prohibit that from happening. It is a real easy fix. It could have been fixed in committee. It could have been fixed in committee. They could have taken care of the concerns that they have with the restrictions on concealed carry, and they could have stopped criminals, convicted criminals, from carrying loaded, concealed firearms. But the committee didn’t do it. We have a chance now. It is the last chance to do it before this bill comes to a vote. I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to vote for this motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, with this motion to recommit, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying in vain to hamper the passage of this important legislation. H.R. 38 seeks to allow lawabiding citizens the ability to exercise their Second Amendment right when they cross State lines. The Supreme Court held in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as selfdefense. Further, the Court concluded that the Second Amendment guarantees the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation, and that central to this right is the ‘‘inherent right of selfdefense.’’ Additionally, in McDonnell v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court ruled that the right of an individual to ‘‘keep and bear arms,’’ as protected under the Second Amendment, is incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment against the States. An individual’s Second Amendment right is no different than the First Amendment’s protections on speech and free exercise of religious expression and the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure or the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Can you imagine my colleagues’ outcries if any of the aforementioned rights stopped at their State’s borders? Believe me, I can. They would be loud and boisterous about it, and justifiably so. Despite that fact, here they are trying to derail a bill that affords the Second Amendment the same respect. Now, this motion to recommit attempts to extend the law, the Federal law, which already bars people from having firearms if they have been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor domestic violence crimes, by saying any violent crime be covered. And they define violent crime by saying it means ‘‘any offense that involves injury or the threat of injury to the person of another.’’ Well, in my State of Virginia and in most other States, it is up to the police officer in a traffic accident, if you rear end somebody and you injure them, whether or not you are simply charged with a traffic offense or you are charged with a criminal offense. That should not be the basis of denying somebody their Second Amendment rights under the United States Constitution. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit and support the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on: Passage of the bill, if ordered; and The motion to suspend the rules and agree to H. Con. Res. 90. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 190, nays 236, not voting 6, as follows:

CELEBRATING THE BATAVIA BULLDOGS’ ILLINOIS STATE FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Batavia High School Bulldogs football team on winning the Illinois Class 7A State Championship. Holding off the undefeated Lake Zurich Bears and winning the thrilling final in overtime, the team ended the season with an overall 13 and 1 record. Crucial to the victory was quarterback Riley Cooper. The senior completed 28 of 42 passes for 295 yards and 3 touchdowns in the championship game. The final score was a 10yard touchdown pass to Tommy Stuttle in overtime, securing the 21–14 win at Huskie Stadium in DeKalb. Leading the team throughout a great regular season and playoff run was Coach Dennis Piron, who has headed the team since 2010, and who is a 1983 Batavia graduate. This is the school’s first State championship since 2013. Students who cheered their siblings and friends on the 2013 Bulldogs team are now carrying the torch and celebrating their own victory as members of the 2017 team. Congratulations, Batavia Bulldogs, past and present, for your achievements. Your success is well deserved. 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF NAOMI LAUTER (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of my dear friend Naomi Lauter, who died on December 4, in her beloved San Francisco. Naomi lived her life in the spirit of ‘‘world repair,’’ ‘‘tikkun olam,’’ dedicated to making the world a better place by fighting for values, ideas, and issues we all hold most dear. Born and raised in San Francisco, Naomi attended Lowell High School, UC Berkeley, and San Francisco State University. Her parents, Rose and Louis Ets Hokin, were prominent leaders in the San Francisco Jewish community. Their activism, particularly that of her mother, who brought food, entertainment, and joy to America’s servicemembers in San Francisco during World War II, inspired Naomi’s own commitment to the causes of equality and justice. Naomi’s political activism began in the 1950s in the civil rights and labor movements, most prominently by working with Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers. Her grassroots organizing and mobilizing helped in the fight to end segregation and to expand access to quality education for all. Her commitment to upholding the dignity of every person knew no bounds. Naomi and her husband of 61 years, Bob, were fierce supporters of Israel and worked tirelessly to strengthen the U.S.Israel relationship. Naomi was a pillar of the San Francisco Jewish community, where she was dedicated to forging connections between young Jewish Americans and the State of Israel. Her leadership in spearheading the San Francisco Holocaust Memorial and training generations of volunteers around the country will benefit the Jewish community for years to come. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I say that many political and civic leaders depended on Naomi’s wise counsel, and with her passing, they have lost a dear friend. We will all profoundly miss her warmth and wonderful leadership. Above all, Naomi was passionate about her family; her husband, Bob; her four beautiful children, David Jonathan, Sarah, and Sam; and her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. Our families were close neighbors and remain good friends. The Pelosi family was welcomed to many Shabbat and Passover Seder dinners with the Lauter family, and they joined us for Christmas. We celebrated together, just as we organized and worked together. May it bring comfort to the Lauter family that so many share their sorrow at the passing of this much beloved and inspiring woman. POVERTY IN SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES IS ON THE RISE (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, when one thinks of poverty, it is likely they envision poverty in an urban or maybe a rural setting; and it may come as a surprise, but poverty in suburban communities is on the rise. In fact, the number of people living in poverty outside of the Twin Cities’ urban core in Minnesota increased 93 percent between 2000 and 2015. The suburbs are often thought of as places of comfort, if not wealth. However, when considering suburban areas, it is estimated there are more than 187,000 people in poverty in the Twin Cities. Organizations within our community, like People Reaching Out to People, PROP; the Lakewinds Food Coop; Southwest News Media; and Chanhassen DECA students, Mark Self, Brian Taylor, and Alex Walther, are shedding light on the issues of suburban poverty and making a difference. Mr. Speaker, the holiday season that we are in now is a time to come together and think about others who may need a little extra help and generosity. It is the perfect time to start helping neighbors and friends in our communities who are struggling. Awareness is just the first step. Taking action should follow. 
DENOUNCING CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, New Jersey has one of the ten lowest firearm death rates in the country. That is because the people of my State have set the bar high for public safety. The bill my Republican colleagues just passed would undermine the will of the people and make New Jersey less safe. Mr. Speaker, in New Jersey, gun owners who want to carry a concealed weapon in public must meet stringent public safety requirements and have a really good reason to carry a concealed weapon loaded while in public. The people of my State can feel secure because they know that the people licensed to carry these guns in public are carrying their guns safely and responsibly. Mr. Speaker, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is the peak of Federal overreach. It is a special interest bill from the NRA that will overturn laws and undermine the safety of the State of New Jersey. Today’s vote was bad for New Jersey and bad for our Nation. b1700 WATER FOR THE WORLD (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when we turn on the tap, clean water flows out and we hardly even think about it. The same thing happens when we turn on the shower or flush the toilet. But for a lot of the world, this just isn’t true. According to the USAID, over 700 million people lack dependable access to clean water. But it is not just water. One in three people don’t have access to a toilet. Many don’t know the basic hygiene practices. As a result, over 800 children a day die. However, progress has been made. The Water for the World Act that Representative BLUMENAUER and I authored in the 113th Congress made great strides to guarantee safe water, sanitation, and hygiene to everyone. But there is still work to be done. Eighty percent of the countries receiving aid report that water issues remain. The poor still lack water and sanitation. With our Godgiven resources, we have an obligation and a privilege to make sure people receive the basic of life: clean water. And that is just the way it is. 
CONCEALED CARRY (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, next week is the fifth anniversary of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Just over 2 months ago, a mass shooter took the lives of 58 at a concert in Las Vegas; and 31 days ago, Sutherland Springs, Texas, was changed forever. But just minutes ago, my Republican colleagues memorialized those deaths by passing a bill that would increase the risk of this happening in communities like yours and mine. To pass a bill written by the NRA at the expense of the safety and security of residents and law enforcement is an absolute disgrace. To allow people, including those with dangerous histories, to carry hidden, loaded guns anywhere across the country is simply shameful. First, by stripping healthcare and now this, it seems that the Republican agenda is fostering death over life. 
SUPPORTING CONCEALED CARRY (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, which passed the House with a bipartisan vote a few moments ago. As the Representative of a district with a large number of lawabiding 
firearm owners, I know many individuals who have concealed carry permits use their firearm for personal protection. This commonsense measure would also allow qualified lawabiding citizens who have obtained concealed carry permits to carry their firearms across State lines and in other States. Since 1991, the number of concealed carry permits has increased dramatically, while the violent crime rates have dropped nearly 51 percent, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Additionally, the fix on the socalled NICS provision of the legislation would add an extra layer of accountability to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for individuals who are legally prohibited from obtaining a firearm. As one of the leading advocates for Second Amendment rights in New York State, I was the first to introduce a full repeal of Governor Andrew Cuomo’s gungrabbing socalled SAFE Act. I firmly believe that our Second Amendment rights are Godgiven by the Constitution and something we need to defend each and every day.
