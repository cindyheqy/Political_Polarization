Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important efforts of the 126th Air Refueling Wing at Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, Illinois. On June 2, I celebrated the many achievements of this unit when I attended the 126th Air Refueling Wing Day, which was done by proclamation by the Governor of the State of Illinois. The 126th Air Refueling Wing routinely succeeds in its missions of providing immediate, sustained, long range air refueling of both nuclear and conventional aircraft for both the U.S. Armed Forces and NATO allies. The 126th Air Refueling Wing has more than 1,000 Air National Guard Active Duty United States Air Force personnel, who recently received its eighth Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for service provided from December 2014 through December 2016. The servicemembers of the 126th Air Refueling Wing routinely demonstrate their excellence in performance while supporting the United States Air Force operations. The significant awards and recognition the 126th Illinois Air National Guard has received sets the foundational framework for being a strong center of excellence for military aircraft. I am proud of their hard work and dedication to ensuring the best aircraft maintenance and repair work is done at Scott Air Force Base. Our national defense depends on having our military aircraft able to fly in a moment’s notice, so the work that they do every day is critical in keeping all of us safe at home. RECOGNIZING WILBER HESTERBERG ’S 100TH  
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wilber ‘‘Whip’’ Hesterberg of Maeystown, Illinois, who will turn 100 years old on June 24. Whip worked for A&P Food Stores for many years, was a Teamster, and served in the Army for 4 years. He likes to camp, garden, and do word searches. He can also still be seen driving around town slowly, it is reported. Family and neighbors say he is ‘‘loved by everyone.’’ Every Wednesday night, Whip continues to host a family dinner at his house with some of his five children, 17 grandchildren, 24 greatgrandchildren. This year, Whip will be honored as the Grand Marshal of Maeystown Homecoming celebration on June 15 and 16. Whip, southern Illinois wishes you a happy 100th birthday. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today and feel it is very important that we recognize and remember that today is Dday, but also that 100 years ago today was the battle of Belleau Wood in the First World War, where the Marines earned the title of Devil Dogs. It was a very, very hard fought battle. We must remember that freedom is not free. So when we recognize not only Dday, but 100 years since that time on that day, we lost 1,086 Marines. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize today someone who works in my office that everyone looks up to, because he is so tall, is my chief of staff, and it is his birthday, Matt McAuliffe. Happy birthday. 
EPA ADMINISTRATOR SCOTT PRUITT NEEDS TO RESIGN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, in April, I filed a resolution, it is H. Res. 834. It is a resolution of no confidence in the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. We now have over 140 cosponsors to this resolution. This is a resolution that points out that we have high standards for government service and it is unacceptable to have scandal after scandal, the waste of taxpayers’ money, coming out of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Administrator’s office in Scott Pruitt. What we know now, scandal after scandal that comes to light, is that Administrator Pruitt, he has a penchant for luxury travel at taxpayer expense, he likes to fly first class at taxpayer expense, he likes to stay in luxury hotels at taxpayer expense, and this is unacceptable. Federal ethics laws bar public officials from using their position or using their staff to enrich themselves. In addition to his luxury travel and luxury accommodations, we now know that he installed a secret privacy phone booth in his office to the tune of $43,000, paid for by the taxpayers. He has installed biometric locks on his door at the EPA that cost over $5,000. Due to good journalism, we know that the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt rented a condo here on Capitol Hill for $50 per night. The Administrator said that the condo owner did not lobby him, but then it was discovered later that, in fact, that was not true, that was a lie. Just in the past week, it has now been discovered that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has ordered very special fountain pens, paid for by the taxpayers, about $1,500 worth of special pens for him to use and give out. We know that he has received gifts, like courtside seats to a basketball game given to him by a coal baron. It was also reported yesterday that he made from his office an official phone call to the CEO of a fast food franchise to try to secure for his wife a fast food franchise business. That is not acceptable. We know, also due to good reporting, that he asked his staff to go out and find a mattress for his home. You are not allowed, as a government official, to use your government staff to do personal tasks. That is against Federal ethics laws. All of that pales in comparison, however, to his standing up for special interests, the cost to our health, to our clean water and clean air, while the EPA Administrator again and again is siding with special interests, many of whom have lobbied him and are implicated in a lot of these sweetheart deals. The interest of the public, the air we breathe, the water we drink, of simply confidence that our Environmental Protection Agency is going to stand up for us: that is what is really at issue. All of these things are awful, they are a violation of Federal ethics laws, and Scott Pruitt should resign. I am very troubled, and a lot of my colleagues are troubled that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many of them have not called him out, they have not signed on to the resolution. Down at the White House, they continue to say it is acceptable for Scott Pruitt to serve as our EPA Administrator. I am here on the floor today because we simply cannot stand for this any longer. I am asking for all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to sign on to H. Res. 834 and say it is time to stand up for ethics in government. This wasteful spending is undermining the confidence that the American people have in our country and the ability of our government to protect them from air pollution and water pollution and toxic chemicals. But more importantly, this is a time for us to say to our Environmental Protection Agency, we have very high standards, we have high standards for what we believe in: the landmark Clean Water Act, the landmark Clean Air Act, everything that we do to protect the climate and to reduce carbon pollution. It has just gotten that swampy here in Washington, D.C., Mr. Speaker, and it is time for a change at the EPA. The White House needs to take action. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to speak up, stand up, and say we are not going to stand for these lapses of ethical behavior anymore. Scott Pruitt needs to resign. 
FEDERAL OPPORTUNITY ZONES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this Congress and this President made pro growth policies a top priority since day one. My colleagues and I should be very proud that due in part to the policies of this Republican Congress, consumer confidence is at an alltime high, businesses are optimistic, and our economy is booming. Even The New York Times has run out of words to explain and describe how great this economy is. As families across Kansas receive an average tax break of more than $2,000 a year, as well as seeing record wage growth and bonuses, I see the excitement growing firsthand throughout my district. However, today in particular, I want to highlight one specific aspect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Federal Opportunity Zones, which are designed to promote economic development and job creation in communities throughout the country. This is where government meets private sector business in a very positive way. The Treasury Department recently selected 22 opportunity zones in 17 different counties across the First District of Kansas. When a tract is deemed an opportunity zone, it allows taxpayers to defer capital gains tax if they invest and prioritize local projects. This is a winwin scenario for both investors and communities that will spur growth and expansion. My good friend, Ashley Hutchinson, in Cloud County, Kansas, said her community hopes to use these opportunity zones to recruit new businesses to areas in counties like hers that are in great need of investment incentives. In Manhattan, Kansas, home of the Kansas State University Wildcats, the local Chamber is using these opportunity zone programs to revitalize and enhance Aggieville, a beloved and historic social district very near and dear to my heart. In southwest Kansas, municipalities are using the program to spur job growth by updating existing buildings for new retail and commercial space, as well as attracting housing developments for the region’s growing workforce. In Emporia, Kansas, expansion of the growing pet industry is being allowed by these opportunity zones as well. Across my district, community leaders and economic development departments are excited by the new opportunities these zones will deliver to their communities. As the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act continues to help existing businesses grow and expand, opportunities are starting to rise across the country. In Kansas, we are excited about what is to come. As a Congressman, I am often asked: What are you doing in Congress? What is this Congress doing to help save rural America? These Federal Opportunity Zones as well as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are one such example. f 
RAISING AWARENESS OF ALOPECIA AREATA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise awareness of alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the scalp and other areas of the body. Today, close to 7 million Americans live with alopecia areata, including over 1 million children under the age of 12. Alopecia areata is a greatly unpredictable disease and currently has no known cause and no known cure. Sadly, this disease often presents itself at an early age, with small round, smooth patches appearing on the head. With limited treatment options, many individuals use wigs, which come at a significant outofpocket cost. It was one of my constituents, Deirdre Nero, an alopecia patient, who 
first brought to my attention the challenges facing the alopecia areata community. That is why I have been proud to stand with my colleague, Congressman JIMMCGOVERN , and support H.R. 2925, legislation to provide coverage for wigs as durable medical equipment under the Medicare program. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to stand with alopecia areata patients across the Nation and cosponsor this commonsense and bipartisan measure. b1015 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable south Floridian, Mr. Larry Adams. Born in West Palm Beach in 1927 to a family of limited means, Larry understood from a young age the importance of getting an education. Larry also possessed a strong desire to serve his country during World War II. He enrolled at Purdue University as a U.S. Air Corps Cadet and served in the U.S. Air Force in Germany from 1945 to 1946. Upon returning home, Larry attended my alma mater, the University of Miami—Go Canes—where he excelled at both sports and academics, including pitching for our university’s baseball team. In 1949, Larry began a 42year career at Florida Power & Light Company—42 years. Starting from the bottom, he worked his way from being a lineman digging ditches and climbing power poles to being a vice president of the State’s largest electric utility. While excelling at his difficult job duties, Larry reenrolled in school while working for the company and earned a degree from Harvard Graduate Business School’s Advanced Management Program for executives. Never one to limit himself, Larry also devoted extraordinary time and effort to his community, serving in over 36 local, regional, State, and national community service organizations, which earned him many accolades. Larry also played a founding and integral role in the development of management systems to improve the quality and cost of goods and services produced throughout our great Nation. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan requested that certain U.S. corporations provide a team of quality management experts whose mission was to create an American Quality Management Award for Excellence program. Florida Power & Light assigned Larry to work under the direction of the U.S. Commerce Secretary and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where Larry cochaired one of four teams of professional quality improvement management experts provided by American businesses. Together, they developed and secured Presidential and congressional approval to create the Malcolm Baldrige Foundation Award to empower U.S. organizations to reach their goals and become significantly more competitive in national and international trade and commerce. Today, the now popular Sterling Management program is a derivative of the Baldrige program and is managed by the Governors of each of our 50 States. At the age of 89, Larry became the recipient of the 2016 Florida Governor’s Sterling Ambassador of the Year Award for successfully coaching businesses, charitable, and government agencies to learn and deploy Sterling and Malcolm Baldrige management systems during the past 25 years. Larry has had an extraordinary life, which he has enjoyed with his wife of over 65 years, Betsy Gregg Adams. Together, they have three sons: Larry, Jr., an architect; Ron, a trial attorney; and Thad, a commercial realtor. Congratulations to my friend, Larry Adams, for a remarkable life well lived. 
RECOGNIZING SHERBURNE COUNTY VETERAN SERVICE OFFICER BRUCE PRICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a local hero in my district, Sherburne County Veteran Service Officer Bruce Price. County veteran service officers are one of the most important resources for our Nation’s veterans. When our veterans need help filing a claim for disability or arranging transportation to their VA hospital appointments, service officers like Bruce are always there to serve. Bruce and his staff go beyond this call of duty. They see 3,000 individuals every year and field nearly 20,000 calls from veterans experiencing difficulty or seeking resources. While it was no secret to our community that Bruce is a hero, his efforts are now finally being recognized nationally. Bruce received the Life, Well Run Community Hero Award for his outstanding service to others from the International City/County Management Association. We are grateful to have such an outstanding public servant in Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District. Congratulations, Bruce, and thank you for your service. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of one of Minnesota’s most incredible and most successful sports teams, the fourtime Women’s National Basketball Association champions, Minnesota Lynx. The Minnesota Lynx started their inaugural season in 1999 with just 12,000 fans in attendance to watch the first regularseason game. This year, as they celebrate their 20th season, the stands are packed. That is because, with four championships in the last 7 years, the Lynx are a dynasty, one that continues to grow. While they have many incredible individual players, the Lynx are a true team on and off the court. The Lynx are active in our local community in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, but they take their commitment to service even beyond our State’s lines. This week, I look forward to joining the team at Payne Elementary School at an event with the Samaritan’s Feet Shoes of Hope Distribution. I also look forward to many more winning seasons from this group of talented and dedicated athletes. Congratulations to the Lynx on 20 seasons, four championships, and the many more victories that surely lie ahead. You make Minnesota proud. CELEBRATING 21ST CENTURY BANK ’S 100TH  
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible financial institution in my district, 21st Century Bank. Beginning as the Farmer’s State Bank of Cedar in Anoka County in 1917, it served the rural agricultural community and is one of the few banks to come through the Great Depression. Over 100 years later, the bank has expanded across Minnesota, opening locations all over our State, including four banks in Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District. At the helm is Thomas P. Dolphin, who said: ‘‘In the beginning, it was a handshake that sealed the deal, and that is still true today at 21st Century Bank.’’ Having been at the bank for more than 40 years, Tom has been an integral part of transforming 21st Century Bank from a small rural bank with just $3 million in assets to an urban financial network with more than $425 million in assets, allowing them to serve more families across Minnesota. 21st Century Bank brings convenient banking and reliable service; and, indeed, most businesses that work with them are small to mediumsized businesses, making 21st Century Bank part of the foundation of our local economy. After celebrating their 100th anniversary, they continue bringing families and small businesses the services they so desperately need. With respect and gratitude, thank you to the Dolphin family and to everyone at 21st Century Bank for your contribution to our local communities. We look forward to the next 100 years. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, there is no question that exercise is good for the body. Whether it is walking, biking, or playing hockey on a frozen lake, exercise reduces your chances of getting heart disease, helps maintain a healthy weight, improves mood and mental functioning, and so much more. In my State, no place does it better than Carver County in Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District. Carver County has been named our State’s healthiest county by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for the sixth consecutive year. The rankings are based on, among other factors, how people feel and how long they live. 
The walkability of cities and towns in Carver allow its residents to skip the car ride and use their own two feet to get to the grocery store or shop; and with countless parks, playgrounds, and trails, there are plenty of places for Minnesotans to enjoy the outdoors. Congratulations to the residents of Carver County for grabbing the top spot once again and setting a great example for the rest of our State to get out and get active. 
RECOGNIZING BUCKS AND MONTGOMERY COUNTIES’ EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES PERSONNEL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize those in Bucks and Montgomery Counties who serve in emergency medical services. Just recently, we celebrated National EMS Week, a time to honor the contributions and service of emergency medical technicians. All too often, the service of EMTs goes unnoticed, despite the risks of their profession and the lifesaving actions they perform. Late last month, the PenndelMiddletown Emergency Squad hosted an event with local officials to celebrate National EMS Week and to discuss the current issues faced in our community. As an EMT myself, I can say, without a doubt, that this profession truly embodies public service, and I thank all EMTs in Bucks and Montgomery Counties for their dedicated service to saving lives. I would especially like to extend my gratitude to Dr. Gerald Wydro, the medical director of PenndelMiddletown Emergency Squad, and to the PenndelMiddletown Emergency Squad Chief, Andrew Foley, for their leadership. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Central Bucks Rotary Club, who will host its Ninth Annual Ride for the Heroes, where motorcyclists from across Bucks County ride from Lower Makefield to Bedminster Township to raise money for local veterans’ organizations. Organized by Rotary member Mark Glidden, this event has grown from 200 bikers in its initial year to anywhere from 500 to 700 participants, yearly. Originally intended to provide financial assistance to nonprofits in the community, Ride for the Heroes became focused on helping military families at the inspiration of the Travis Manion Foundation in Doylestown. Founded by retired Lieutenant Colonel Tom Manion and his late wife, Janet, in honor of their son, the Travis Manion Foundation’s mission is to ‘‘empower veterans and families of fallen heroes to develop character in future generations.’’ In doing this, the Travis Manion Foundation seeks engagement between veterans and families of fallen soldiers with the local community. The foundation brings young people together with veterans so that they can learn our Nation’s values from heroes who have put those values into action in the United States military. I applaud the vision of the Travis Manion Foundation and appreciate the work of the Central Bucks Rotary Club and those who will ride for those who served. RECOGNIZING STUDENTS OF THE SOUDERTON  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a group of students in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, who recently collected 2,150 pounds of food, paper products, and personal care items for those in need. The Souderton Area School District, comprised of nearly 6,500 students, recently held its annual food drive and quarter collection. This event collects items for the Keystone Opportunity Center, also in Souderton, which operates a homeless shelter and offers literary education classes in Montgomery and Bucks Counties. To diversify the goods donated, each school was assigned a certain item to donate, from peanut butter and jelly at Indian Crest Middle School to detergent and soap at Oak Ridge Elementary School. Additionally, Salford Hills and Vernfield Elementary Schools thoughtfully donated crops from their community gardens to the Keystone food pantry. I would like to commend these students, along with their teachers and parents, for teaching them the virtues of charity and generosity. I would also like to thank the staff and volunteers at Keystone Opportunity Center for their service, especially President Arlene Daily for her outstanding leadership. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 27 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Rabbi Aaron Krupnick, Congregation Beth El, Voorhees, New Jersey, offered the following prayer: Our God and God of our ancestors: On the long road to freedom from Egypt, You led 12 diverse tribes, instructing each to march under their own banner. They did not always see eye to eye, but they could, nonetheless, walk shoulder to shoulder. In spite of their disagreements, they had sworn an oath to You to be one nation under God. Dear Lord, help the Members of this Congress to be ever mindful of the fact that the right to disagree is fundamental to our democracy. Foster in them the art of disagreement that the Jewish people have been practicing for millennia. Enable them to grant their adversaries moral respect; to give those of opposing opinions the intellectual benefit of doubt; to have sympathy for their motives and listen with empathy to their lines of reasoning. Grant all the Members of our House of Representatives insight into this art of disagreement. Endow them with discernment and wisdom, patience and understanding, kindness and compassion. Let them walk humbly before those who they serve and thereby bring us all that much closer to You and to one another. God, bless this great Nation and those who lead it. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. STEFANIK led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING THOSE KILLED OR WOUNDED IN SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY The SPEAKER. The Chair asks that the House now observe a moment of silence in honor of those who have been killed or wounded in service to our country and all those who serve and their families. 
WELCOMING RABBI AARON KRUPNICK The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to welcome our guest chaplain, Rabbi Aaron Krupnick of Congregation Beth El in Voorhees, New Jersey. The congregation has been part of our South Jersey community since 1920, when it was originally founded in Camden City. Now it offers a spiritual home for hundreds of Jewish families in South Jersey. Rabbi Krupnick came to our community in 1994 from Montgomery, Alabama. There, he helped lead interfaith services with leaders like Martin Luther King, III, and Rosa Parks. As you heard in his prayer, he often discusses patience, understanding, kindness, compassion. In a world where religion too often creates so much conflict, Rabbi Krupnick focuses on togetherness. He knows there is more that connects us than divides us. I have been fortunate enough to attend services and seder at Beth El. I have witnessed firsthand how the community is welcoming, loving, and supportive of all. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to welcome Rabbi Krupnick to the House of Representatives and I thank him for his offering of this morning’s prayer. His compassion, his teachings, his strong leadership have helped foster a vibrant Jewish community in our region, and I know it will stay that way for years to come. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the Trump administration’s shameful new policy separating parents and children at our southern border. This policy is even being applied to those legally seeking asylum here while fleeing violence in their home countries. The current system of prioritizing criminal prosecution of those seeking protection rather than assessing legitimate asylum claims has to stop. These are not our Nation’s values. Our country is better than this, our people are better than this. But we have a chance to get something right. We are currently within just a handful of signatures of forcing a vote on a series of immigration proposals, including the bipartisan USA Act, which pairs a resolution for our Dreamers with smart investments in our border security. June, this month, is Immigrant Heritage Month, a time to reflect on the history of immigration that so many Americans share. We must live up to our heritage by ending this cruel policy of family separation, securing Dreamers a permanent future here in the United States, and finally formally reforming our broken immigration system. 
HONORING MAJOR GENERAL JEFFREY BANNISTER (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional patriot and military leader, Major General Jeffrey Bannister, who recently passed away. General Bannister served as the 10th Mountain Division commander and senior commander at Fort Drum in my district. I am proud to have gotten to know General Bannister and his family during my first term in office, when we worked closely together to successfully prevent devastating personnel cuts from taking place at Fort Drum. Whenever I visited Fort Drum, Major General Bannister was always a wonderful host. It was clear he commanded the greatest respect from the men and women stationed on post, and I know his greatest interest was their well being. I remember running into Jeff with his family at the Cream Cheese Festival in Lowville after he returned from a recent deployment. He was casually wearing his baseball cap and eating at a picnic table with his wife, and they both gave me a warm hug. He was truly dedicated to our country and our community. The hearts of our entire Fort Drum community go out to the family of Major General Bannister, his wife Trese and his daughter Lindsey during this difficult time. f 
SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, there is nothing that demonstrates the deeply held American value of living a retirement with dignity than the promise of Social Security and Medicare. These are benefits that America’s seniors have earned after a lifetime of hard work so they can enjoy their retirement years with dignity and economic security. But yesterday we learned the Medicare trust fund will be depleted in just 8 years, 3 years earlier than expected. The Social Security trust fund will run dry just 8 years after that. A few months ago, our Republican friends passed a huge tax cut for the wealthiest Americans and most powerful corporations. And how do Republicans want to pay for it: by cutting Social Security and Medicare. That is a bad deal for the American people. They deserve better. When Democrats take back the majority, we are going to deliver A Better Deal for the American people. We are going to put working people first and we are going to ensure a secure retirement for everyone who works hard in this country. Most importantly, we are going to return the promise of America. 
NORMANDY: JUNE 6, 1944 (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in the cold, damp, dark rain of morning, thousands of young American soldiers sailed across the treacherous English Channel. The day was June 6, 1944; their destination, Normandy, France; the mission, not conquest, but liberation of Europe. Operation Overlord, or DDay, called for a massive ally invasion of the continent during World War II. Securing the brutal Omaha and Utah beachheads inch by bloody inch, our boys finally declared victory, forcing Hitler to begin his long retreat into oblivion. That victory did not come without cost, however. Today, 9,387 white crosses and Stars of David overlook the silent beaches of Normandy, marking 
the final resting place of America’s war dead. The soldiers buried there were part of the Greatest Generation, young men from every State and territory in the United States. We remember them, our warriors, those that were killed, those that returned, and those that returned with the wounds of war, because, Mr. Speaker, the worst casualty of war is to be forgotten. And that is just the way it is. 
IMMIGRANT HERITAGE MONTH (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate our immigrants’ heritage. Over onethird of north Texans in the DallasFort Worth area were born outside of the United States. They live and work in my district: Hondurans in South Irving, Somalians in Stop Six, Mexican nationals in Oak Cliff. Whether they are from Jalisco to Tijuana, El Salvador to Nigeria, they are our fellow Texans. Across the metroplex, they fulfill their own version of the American Dream as teachers in classrooms, engineers who design defense equipment, doctors who care for our families, and soldiers who protect our Nation. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, they are fulfilling a lot of jobs in agriculture and construction and other areas that are simply hard to fill and cannot be filled at home by nativeborn Americans. This administration is attempting to abolish their patriotism and demoralize their American spirit, but we can’t let them win. We need to heal the distrust and fear that comes from talks of border walls, and instead, build community ties that can withstand. Let’s start with the protection of our Active Duty servicemembers and veterans. Let’s celebrate our immigrants’ heritage this month by honoring our country’s legacy as a Nation of immigrants. Let’s pass a clean Dream Act now. 
COMMEMORATING THE 74TH ANNIVERSARY OF DDAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the 74th anniversary of the Allied DDay invasion of France to honor the bravery of our Armed Forces who served in that operation. 73,000 Americans took part in Operation Overlord on June 6, 1944. This operation secured a beachhead on the European continent that began the liberation of France and then the rest of Western Europe. Sadly, the United States suffered more than 6,000 casualties in this operation. Ultimately, thousands more U.S. servicemembers would fall in the coming weeks and months liberating the rest of Western Europe from German control. The courage, bravery, and sacrifice displayed by our military on this day continues to serve as an example for the cost of freedoms that we enjoy in the United States today. Mr. Speaker, I recently had the honor and the privilege of attending a wreathlaying ceremony on Omaha Beach in Normandy at the Normandy American Cemetery in France. This memorial serves as a constant reminder to the world that the United States will fight and die to protect the freedoms of not just American citizens, but for citizens around the globe. f 
b1215 CELEBRATING PRIDE MONTH (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Pride Month. For generations and across industries, LGBTQ Americans have directly contributed to America’s greatness. Chicagoland is home to many of these leaders, like Carol A. Johnson, a union and HIV activist; Kim Hunt, a policy expert; the late Vernita Gray, a community activist; business leaders like Fred Eychaner and Tracy Baim. In the last few years, we have made remarkable progress towards equality. On June 26, we will celebrate the fifth anniversary of marriage equality for all Americans, yet much work still remains. Trans Americans are still too often the victims of violence, harassment, and exploitation. Too many struggling with who they are or whom they love resort to selfharm and suicide. And, sadly, we have a man in the White House who is unwilling to recognize June as Pride Month. Despite these challenges, LGBTQ Americans and their family, including me, stand as united as ever, and we will keep pushing until real, true, and lasting equality isn’t just encoded in law but encoded in our hearts. Happy Pride. 
THE HISTORIC RESCUE OF BULGARIAN JEWS FROM THE HOLOCAUST (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that, 28 years ago this week, I was appointed by the International Republican Institute as an election observer for the first free elections in Bulgaria as it emerged from totalitarian communism. Since that time, I have seen Bulgaria advance to be a vibrant democracy as a member of NATO and the European Union. On the 75th anniversary of the rescue of Bulgarian Jews from the Holocaust, the world recognizes this as a remarkable event in history. Over 50,000 Jewish people were saved by the Bulgarian church, some intellectuals and members of Parliament, but most of all, the Bulgarian people. The Bulgarian Jewish community was the only one in Europe which not only survived World War II, but increased in size. The Bulgarian people should always be appreciated for their courage and action. As cochair of the Bulgaria Caucus, I cherish the mutually beneficial friendship between our two countries inspired by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and Ambassador Tihomir Stoytchev. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. God bless the memory of the Americanled Allied troops who landed at Normandy 74 years ago to begin the liberation of Europe, defeating national socialism. f 
RISE AGAINST HUNGER (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on May 15, I joined several of my colleagues from the House and Senate, officials from USDA, Ambassadors to the United States, and 150 volunteers at a meal packaging event hosted by the nonprofit organization Rise Against Hunger and The Kraft Heinz Company. Together, we packaged 20,000 meals that will be sent to Mozambique and distributed to families through a school feeding program in that country. I admire the incredible efforts of Rise Against Hunger, under the leadership of Rod Brooks, in hosting meal packaging events like this one I attended on Capitol Hill a few weeks ago. Last year alone, Rise Against Hunger served 1.4 million people in 74 countries across the globe as they worked toward the important goal of ending global hunger by 2030. I also applaud the work of Kraft Heinz in advancing its laudable goal of delivering 1 billion meals to those struggling with hunger by 2021. Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees, Board Vice Chairman John Cahill, and Board Member George Zoghbi traveled to D.C. to lead the event, and I am grateful for their commitment to ending hunger once and for all. 
URGING THE ADMINISTRATION TO SANCTION ORTEGA REGIME OFFICIALS (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, it has been 48 days since Ortega began his brutal crackdown on the Nicaraguan people. With over 110 Nicaraguans killed, including one U.S. citizen, the U.S. must take swift action to hold accountable those responsible for the bloodshed. Though I appreciate the administration’s remarks condemning the violent attacks, actions must follow. I sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter urging the administration to sanction two key regime operatives: Francisco Lopez, head of Albanisa, for money laundering and corruption; and Francisco Diaz, who leads the national police, for orchestrating the repression and killing of Nicaraguans. I also urge our Senate colleagues to pass my NICA Act, to condition our vote at international financial institutions until Nicaragua takes significant steps to restore democratic order. The U.S. has an opportunity to lead the way, Mr. Speaker. Let’s do that.

b1230 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania). The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the ranking member of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am excited to be down here with my friend from Massachusetts today, Mr. Speaker. You heard the Reading Clerk work her way through this rule. It is a big one today, and it is a big one because we have got a lot to talk about today. I am going to try not to go over. I appreciate the Speaker starting proceedings a little early today so that we have time to get through all of the material that we have to work through. In this rule today, House Resolution 918, we are providing for three separate appropriations bills to be considered as a single package in addition to two other bills that are very important. First of all, the rule today, Mr. Speaker, provides for concurrence in the Senate amendment to the House passed bill, H.R. 3249. It is the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act. Mr. Speaker, our colleague from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ) has been working so aggressively on this bill. You will remember the House passed this bill by a voice vote back in March of this year. It went over to the Senate. The Senate amended it. They, too, 
passed it by unanimous consent. House Resolution 918 today provides for the consideration to approve those Senate amendments, send this bill directly to the President’s desk, and let it begin to make a difference in these communities right away. The bill supports Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts, Mr. Speaker, to combat gangrelated violence throughout our communities and to get involved in other prevention techniques. We have all seen street gang activities increasing in our communities. If you are from a community that has not yet seen that impact, consider yourself fortunate. According to the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Speaker, we have these crimes on the increase. We have all been hearing about transnational gangs, such as MS–13, as they are becoming increasingly organized and increasingly more violent. Giving our Nation’s law enforcement authorities the ability to keep Americans safe and to have the tools they need to fight these gangs is a priority of all of us in this institution, and approval of this rule today will allow us to bring that bill to the floor and send it to the President’s desk for his signature. House Resolution 918 also provides for a structured rule, Mr. Speaker, for consideration of the first of our fiscal year 2019 appropriations bills. As I mentioned, there are three bills in this package. H.R. 5895 combines the Energy and Water Development bill with the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill and with the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill. It puts them all under one umbrella, maintaining our commitment to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 spending caps. The House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Speaker, has already passed 6 of the 12 annual appropriations bills. I will say that again. Six of the 12 annual appropriations bills have already moved through the House Appropriations Committee. I look forward to the remainder of those bills being on this floor very soon. In fact, the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies is marking up their bill today, and the Defense Subcommittee is marking up their bill tomorrow. So before the end of the week, I would expect we will have 7 of 12 appropriations bills ready for the floor, and we will be well on our way to having an eighth ready for the floor soon. This is only the first week of June, Mr. Speaker, and this is already the progress that the House Appropriations Committee has achieved. I am very proud of their success, and I want to talk a little bit about the bills they have before us today. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill was approved unanimously by the Appropriations Committee. Republicans and Democrats came together to support that bill. You will recall that we decided early on, Mr. Speaker, that thrift would begin here in this House. With this Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, not only are we funding the shared priorities across the Capitol, we are also at a funding level still below the level at which this House was funded the year I was first elected to Congress, Mr. Speaker. Thrift does begin at home. We have avoided being pennywise and poundfoolish. We funded important priorities and were again able to pass this out of committee on a unanimous, bipartisan vote. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill also came out of committee on a unanimous, bipartisan vote, 47–0 in both cases, Mr. Speaker. And, clearly, this type of collaboration, this type of bipartisan activity is something we would like to see more often in this Chamber, but we have it in these two bills today. The third appropriations bill that is bundled together here, Mr. Speaker, is the Energy and Water bill, a bill that is tremendously important to my part of the world there on the Georgia coast, involving Georgia’s water infrastructure. It passed the Appropriations Committee on a slightly less powerful vote. It was 29–20, still a bipartisan vote, but not as big a majority—in fact, not unanimous, as the others were. But it is critically important to so many of our States, Mr. Speaker, and I am confident we will be able to move it across the floor. I will just give a couple of examples. I know everybody has their own story to tell about the importance in their State. In my State, it provides $49 million as a Federal partnership to the more than $300 million that the State of Georgia has already put into deepening the Port of Savannah. The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is one of the largest economic development projects in the Southeastern United States. It has a Corps of Engineers report authorizing this construction. Georgia put all of its money in up front, and now the Feds are coming through with $49 million of their own. Mr. Speaker, the bill includes millions of dollars for operations and maintenance of the Corps of Engineers. If you live in the Southeastern United States, as I do, odds are, the Corps controls your water supply. More than 80 percent of the people who live in the multimillionperson metropolitan Atlanta area, Mr. Speaker, depend on Corps of Engineers facilities for their drinking water. Eighty percent depend on Corps of Engineers for their drinking water. It is tremendously important to families across the district. I am heartened that the Appropriations Committee, even though they could not be unanimous, persisted in moving this bill through committee in a bipartisan way, and I am optimistic of what it is going to do for water and energy infrastructure for years to come. Finally, Mr. Speaker, to a committee that is almost as near and dear to my heart as the Rules Committee is, this bills brings to the floor a bill from the Transportation Committee, H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. Folks often think of the Veterans Affairs’ Committee as being one of the most bipartisan committees on Capitol Hill, and, candidly, I think it makes us all proud to know that is true; but the House Transportation Committee sits a very close second. Infrastructure projects, whether it be safe drinking water, whether it be roads and bridges, whether it be airport facilities, these are issues that we all confront, and these are issues that bring us together in an also unanimous fashion, Mr. Speaker. The House Transportation Committee reported the Water Resources Development Act of 2018, and we have that before us today. If you haven’t gotten to see a good committee chairman and ranking member working in partnership, Mr. Speaker, I would recommend Chairman BILL SHUSTER of Pennsylvania and Ranking Member PETEDEFAZIO of Oregon to you any time. To suggest that these two men agree on everything would be folly, but to suggest that they find a way to work through everything would not be too much said. They never take no for an answer. They always work hard together. In the case of the Water Resources Development Act, Mr. Speaker, that doesn’t just exist at the committee chairman level; it exists at the subcommittee level. On the Republican side of the aisle, we have Chairman GARRET GRAVES  from Louisiana; and on the Democratic side of the aisle, we have Ranking Member GRACE NAPOLITANO from California—again, two Members who work incredibly closely together. They produce a superior work product that you are going to be able to see in the line items in this legislation. We are talking about America’s ports. We are talking about inland waterways. We are talking about locks and dams. We are talking about flood protection. We are talking about water infrastructure and ecosystem protection. Line item after line item, we were able to come together in a bipartisan way. I would argue this is going to be one of the most important bills that the Congress passes in 2018, Mr. Speaker. And, again, it took a lot of hard, bipartisan work to get here. Our Nation’s ports, Mr. Speaker, process about $4 billion in product a day, imports and exports. About 11 percent of everything we buy in the State of Georgia has come through one of our ports. Nearly 440,000 jobs, Mr. Speaker, in my State alone are dependent on ports and waterways, and there is $25 billion worth of State income from that. And that is just a State like Georgia, Mr. Speaker. If you go to Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, California, 
or Washington State, you are going to hear those same stories told time and time again. Now, I would like to believe, because we passed this bill out of the Transportation Committee where transportation experts sit, that we produced a perfect work product out of the Transportation Committee. But wearing my Rules Committee hat, I recognize that other Members of this Chamber may have some good ideas of their own that they would like to make in order for the debate on the Water Resources Development Act. To that end, the rule today, Mr. Speaker, passed by this body will make 52 additional amendments in order to be considered for this bill. That is 19 Republican amendments, 20 Democratic amendments, and 13 bipartisan amendments. I will say that again, Mr. Speaker. Fiftytwo amendments were made in order by this rule for the Water Resources Development Act: 19 Republican amendments, 20 Democratic amendments, and 13 bipartisan amendments. All amendments are intended to make this bill better. This body will decide, if this rule is approved, whether, in fact, they do. We had four subcommittee meetings on WRDA this year, this cycle, Mr. Speaker—two roundtable discussions in Florida and Oregon, and two hearings here in Washington, D.C.—all seeking to involve stakeholders. You may not recall, Mr. Speaker, but there was a while that this Congress was unable to pass WRDA bills. We went through 7 years of this Congress failing to pass any WRDA bills at all. I was not in Congress at the time that began, but I am in Congress at the time that that comes to an end. Beginning with BILLSHUSTER ’s leadership there on the Transportation Committee, we have gotten back in the habit of moving a water resources bill every single Congress. This will be the third in that cycle, and it matters: It matters for certainty to stakeholders back home; it matters for certainty to constituents back home; and it matters that we don’t have to do it all in one giant omnibus bill every single time. We are able to break it down into smaller chunks because we are taking care of it as challenges arise, again, in a bipartisan fashion. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sit on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee where the kind of collaboration and mutual respect that you have heard me talk about exists every single day. I want to thank, again, Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member D EFAZIOfor making that environment one that can exist. I think we brought a very fair rule to the floor today to try to bring not just the Water Resources Development Act to the floor, the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization to the floor, but also the first three appropriations bills in our annual cycle to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I hope all my colleagues can support the rule, I hope they will support the underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1245 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, this rule is a study in contradictions from my Republican colleagues. They have brought up H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act. This is an incredibly important bill to improve our Nation’s ports, locks, dams, and more all across the country. It is a bipartisan bill, and it was the product of a process that shows how Congress is supposed to work. Hearings were held, and thoughtful testimony was given, including from the head of the Army Corps of Engineers. There was a markup. Input and ideas were heard from Members on both sides. Remarkably, a majority of amendments offered were adopted en bloc by a voice vote without much controversy. That is important to note, Mr. Speaker, because Republicans these days aren’t known for their lack of controversy. Just this week the President of the United States is talking about pardoning himself of possible Federal crimes. His lawyer is floating wild theories about how the President could shoot his former FBI Director without facing prosecution while in office. So this bipartisan bill and the mostly collaborative process that got us here came as welcome relief—until this bill got to the Rules Committee. That is when Republican leaders ran into a back room somewhere and took out a bipartisan amendment from the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Congressman DEFAZIO. The amendment would reform the harbor maintenance trust fund to make sure money gets where it needs to go: to actually maintaining our harbors. They did this without any debate and despite the fact that both the chairman and ranking member of the committee supported it. The gentleman from Georgia says he is on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and he voted against his chairman and ranking member. So much for bipartisanship. The majority threw sand in the gears of what was a good process. They just can’t help themselves, and this is par for the course here. Just look at the other water development bill, the Energy and Water Appropriations Act. This could have been another bipartisan measure. It funds most programs at an adequate level. But the majority reverted back to their usual ways: ignoring Democratic ideas and filling this up with one bipartisan proposal after another. It is like a Christmas tree loaded up with bad ideas. More than $400 million was cut from 2018 enacted levels for some of our biggest priorities, things like energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. Even nuclear nonproliferation programs were cut; and for what, Mr. Speaker? So the majority can reward their allies by skewing resources toward the fossil fuel industry. There are controversial riders that are completely unnecessary and would do more harm than good. They have no business being in an appropriations bill. One of the riders would hinder the Army Corps’ ability to protect clean water. Another would kill the Waters of the United States rule. There is one rider that would threaten the Endangered Species Act. There is even language tucked inside this bill that would allow firearms to be carried on all Army Corps lands; and this from a majority that refuses to even consider ways to combat gun violence on the House floor. We can’t even get a vote on anything related to gun violence on this floor. This is outrageous. The majority is also using this appropriations process to fund President Trump’s stupid, ridiculous, offensive border wall. Mr. Speaker, didn’t the President tell us that Mexico was going to foot the bill for this ridiculous wall? It is being funded by shortchanging priorities for the middle class. That includes programs to educate our children, help students afford college, and provide job training to our workers, all for this stupid wall—more red meat for the most narrow parts of the Republican base. I remember my Republican colleague talking for years about the importance of passing a budget resolution. Maybe that was just something they cared about under the Obama administration or something they do only when they are trying to take healthcare away from people or reward the wealthy with more tax cuts, because here they are under a Republican President with a Republican Congress pushing ahead with an appropriations package without passing a budget. That April 15 deadline came and went a long time ago. Mr. Speaker, what happened to doing one bill at a time? We used to consider appropriations bills separately, but the majority’s rule lumps several together to try to speed up the process and I guess limit debate; and for what? Funding the government is one of our most important responsibilities. Two of these bills would probably pass with broad, bipartisan support, but, apparently, bipartisanship is not a priority for some of the Republican Conference. So they had to cram them together with a partisan bill that is filled with harmful ideological riders. 
I would like to think that the majority would want strong, bipartisan votes on appropriations bills. We used to have them in the past. We don’t have any bipartisanship now as a direct result of the choices made by this Republican leadership. Mr. Speaker, why is the majority using a process that makes it harder to pass bipartisan bills? It may please their base, but it is an awful way to legislate. This majority has had 8 years to decide how to run this place. Mr. Speaker, clearly, they haven’t figured it out. There is no budget and not even an attempt to get one. Where are all the Republican budget hawks? Where is their countdown clock with ‘‘days since the last budget’’? This majority can’t even keep the lights on. We have seen two government shutdowns this year alone, and it is only June. My colleague from Georgia again said: Look at all we have done, and it is June. The other thing they did is they broke their own record of now being the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of America. They have brought more bills to the floor under a restrictive, closed process than any other Congress in history. Yes, they have accomplished a lot, it is only June, and it is going to get worse. There is virtually no oversight of the executive branch from this majority. None. Just one example, and this is a beauty: we have an EPA administrator who allegedly got a sweetheart deal on an apartment and spent $43 on a phone booth. You can’t make this stuff up. He asked a Federal employee who reported to him to hunt for a used mattress from President Trump’s hotel. None of this seems to bother my Republican colleagues. How is that possible? Mr. Speaker, it is time for the adults in Congress to stand up, bring sanity back to our government, bring professionalism back to our government, and bring some integrity back to this institution. Make your constituents proud. Make your government great again. You can start here today by voting ‘‘no’’ on this rule. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I didn’t come to the floor today to tell anybody that the process was perfect, and I didn’t come to the floor today to tell anybody that the pieces of legislation before us are perfect. I am certain that they are not perfect, Mr. Speaker, because I didn’t write every line of every one of them. That is my indication that they didn’t turn out exactly right. What I did do, however, because I serve on the committees of jurisdiction, is I worked with my Democratic colleagues to get to a bill that we can all be proud of. Understand what we are talking about here today, Mr. Speaker. We can go back and have a series of recriminations and talk about all the injustices that have happened to each and every one of us over the years or we can celebrate the fact that in a really difficult budget environment we found a way to get the appropriations bills out—two out of three of these bills today unanimously—to the floor. The third one that didn’t come out unanimously still came out with a bipartisan vote, Mr. Speaker. We should be celebrating that, not pretending that we are not making an honest effort with one another to get things done. The Water Resources Development Act, Mr. Speaker, the largest water infrastructure bill that this Congress will produce, and we produced it on a committee that has members from the far left to the far right and produced it unanimously, Mr. Speaker, because we did not take no for an answer and continued to work shoulder to shoulder until we found a place that each and every member could live with. No, these bills are not perfect today, which is why, in the case of WRDA, for example—again, the best work product the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee could produce—we allowed more than 50 additional amendments— more Democratic amendments than Republican amendments, bipartisan amendments as well—to try to improve that language. How does this WRDA bill come to the floor? It comes after a long period of time where this Congress was controlled by both parties where no WRDA bill was produced at all. I will say it again, Mr. Speaker: it comes after a time when this Congress, controlled by both parties, produced no Water Resources bill at all. No bill for ports, no bill for inland waterways, no bill for water infrastructure, and no bill for locks and dams. No bill, Mr. Speaker, at all. Fast forward to today, Mr. Speaker. We are talking about the third consecutive Congress where we have come together and gotten it done—not gotten it done for one party or another, not gotten it done for one Member or another—but gotten it done on behalf of all of our constituents who sent us all here, not to find excuses, not to find things to complain about, but to find a way to make it happen. Support this rule today, Mr. Speaker. I urge all my colleagues to support this rule today, Mr. Speaker, because if they do, we will bring that bipartisan work product to the floor. We will bring that unanimously approved gang violence prevention bill to the floor. And we will bring those three appropriations bills all passing in a bipartisan way out of committee to this floor. It is a day we can be proud of, Mr. Speaker, and I am proud to be here with you to talk about it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am glad the gentleman came here to celebrate. I came here to remind everybody, again, that this is the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of America. I think that is an important fact for people to consider and digest, because process is important. Process equals substance. I am sorry, but that is not something to celebrate. We have no problem with the WRDA bill. We will support that, no problem. The gang violence bill, I think most of us will support that. Where we have a problem is what the majority did with the appropriations bills. The majority took two appropriations bills where there could be virtual unanimity—certainly bipartisan support—and says: If you want those bills, you have got to swallow a poison pill. You have to also vote as part of that package an Energy and Water bill that is filled with antienvironmental riders. I get it. I know where the allegiance of the majority party is when it comes to the environment. It is in the pockets of the oil companies, the fossil fuel industry, and now the coal companies. I get it. But for those who are offended by the antienvironmental record of the Republicans who run this House and certainly by the antienvironmental record of this administration, we don’t want any part of that. That is not a bipartisan process. That is not a good process. By the way, these antienvironmental riders have no business being on an appropriations bill. It is stuff that just was added because the majority could. So we can’t celebrate that process. Yes, we will vote for the WRDA bill, applaud Chairman SHUSTER and applaud Ranking Member DEFAZIO and all the members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. We have no problem with that. But this rule is designed for a purpose, and that is to limit debate and that is to try to put pressure on people to vote for a package that includes some really horrendous riders on it that do great harm to our environment. That is not the way this place is supposed to work. Unfortunately, the majority controls the process. This is a process the majority chooses to embrace. It is not fair, and, again, it is now the most closed process in the history of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, the infrastructure in our Nation is in dire need of repair and maintenance. Reports are that Chairman SHUSTER is hoping to release an infrastructure bill later this summer. This is good news, but given the Republican majority’s recent history, the American taxpayers first need to know where our priorities with that bill lie. The American people have good reason to be worried about whom such an important bill would actually benefit. Just a few months ago the GOP passed a tax bill that skewed nearly all of the benefits to the wealthy and rich corporations leaving working class people behind. We can’t allow this same approach to trickle into an infrastructure 
bill that could skew all the benefits to billionaires and Wall Street banks looking to profit from the privatization of our infrastructure. We need to send a clear signal that our priority in repairing and upgrading our infrastructure is to not privatize these essential resources to enrich a lucky few; but instead will prioritize creating millions of livingwage jobs without selling off our roads and bridges to private investors. Mr. Speaker, here is the Republicans’ chance to prove that they stand with hardworking Americans in fixing our Nation’s infrastructure and not with billionaires, Wall Street banks, and foreign investors. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative LIEU’s resolution, H. Con. Res. 63, which outlines priorities for efforts to enact a bold jobs and infrastructure package that benefits all Americans, not just billionaires. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. b1300 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. TEDLIEU) to discuss our proposal. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding. Since the beginning of this Congress, we have had more infrastructure weeks than I can count, but we have yet to take up a comprehensive infrastructure bill. America desperately needs that. The American Society of Civil Engineers has estimated that for the next 10 years, we need $4.6 trillion of infrastructure funding just to keep pace. Over $2 trillion of that is not funded. So, for example, 53 percent of our public schools need funding to make repairs. More than 18 million Americans drink from water systems that fail to meet Federal lead tests. Forty percent of rural America and those on tribal lands lack broadband access. The President has designated week after week as Infrastructure Week, but this House majority has yet to consider a serious infrastructure proposal. When it comes to infrastructure, the President and this GOP majority has been all talk, no action. America deserves better. We have to fix our roads and highways, water infrastructure, schools, transit systems, and VA facilities. We have to have key principles for this infrastructure. First, we have to create millions of new jobs through investments in 21st century projects. We also need to emphasize public investment over corporate giveaways and the selling of public goods. We need to embrace 21st century clean energy jobs, including expanding solar and wind power, promoting energy efficiency, and modernizing the energy grid. We also need to ensure that investments are not paid for at the expense of Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. We need to not weaken or repeal existing environmental laws. H. Con. Res. 63, which embodies all of these principles, is supported by more than onethird of the House, with 157 cosponsors. We need to bring this proposal up rather than considering partisan appropriations bill that cut funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency and repeal protections that keep our waterways clean without offering a meaningful opportunity for debate. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I support the underlying water resources development legislation. In communities across the country, our infrastructure is falling apart, as colleagues on both sides of the aisle have pointed out. This is evident in the state of our Nation’s dams. In communities like Waterbury, Vermont, dams are rapidly aging and the risk of breach continues to grow. In 2016, Congress took a very positive step to address this issue with the passage of the WIIN Act. Section 1177 of the WIIN Act authorized funding for the Army Corps to rehabilitate some of the Nation’s oldest Corpsconstructed dams that are classified as high hazard potential. As you know, the failure of a dam that is so classified is anticipated to cause the loss of life. While section 1177 was a positive start, its limited authorization and per project cap have hindered its effectiveness. To that end, I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for their willingness to work with me to address this matter. Section 105 of the legislation before us addresses these shortcomings by increasing the provisions in authorization and giving dams greater authority to accrue Federal funds over multiple years. The benefits of these changes to communities like Waterbury, Vermont are very clear. In 2011, Mr. Speaker, Waterbury suffered a devastating flood during Hurricane Irene. Despite the damage that the village suffered—totally flooded—the flooding in Waterbury would have been far more catastrophic if it weren’t for the Corpsbuilt Waterbury Dam, a 1930sera construction in need of significant repair. Section 105 will give the Corps the tools it needs to get work done rehabbing highhazard dams like Waterbury across the country. Both parties agree we need to improve our infrastructure. This bill will take important steps to do that and address some of our most outdated, hazardous dams in this country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the words of my friend from Vermont. He is absolutely right. Fiscal conservatives, as a rule, are out there trying to save money. Occasionally, we find ourselves in those spaces where we end up being penny wise and pound foolish. The flood mitigation projects that my friend from Vermont referenced saved countless dollars, but, more importantly, countless lives. As some of these aging infrastructure projects look to be on the brink of failure, the time to act is now, not later. I am glad to see that we were able to come together to invest needed resources today in a water resources development bill so that we are not spending dollars tomorrow in a disaster relief bill. This is the right time to do it, and I appreciate my friend from Vermont making that point. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman from Georgia how many more speakers he has on his side? Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend that I am prepared to close when he is. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in spite of the fact that this is the most closed Congress in the history of the United States, I believe in giving credit where credit is due. This WRDA bill is a bill that is the product of a bipartisan process. I applaud the chairman, Mr. SHUSTER , and the Ranking Democrat, Mr. DEFAZIO, on working together, and all the members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure coming together to try to come to an accommodation that resulted in this bill. I regret very much that, despite their good work, in some backroom in the Rules Committee somewhere, the majority decided to rip out a bipartisan provision that the chairman and ranking member had agreed on. Then, making that even worse, the chairman and the ranking member had an amendment to try to at least have a debate on the floor and let the Members decide that issue, but the Rules Committee decided not to make that in order as well. Anyway, I don’t want to be too picky. Overall, the WRDA bill is good. It will get a bipartisan vote. Of the three appropriations bills— this new approach where we bunch everything together so we don’t have a lot of time to talk about them—two of the appropriations bills are fine. There would be, I think, a pretty big bipartisan vote. The Legislative Branch Appropriations bill would pass with a strong bipartisan vote. I think that is a good thing. The Military Construction VA bill would pass with a strong bipartisan vote. That is a good thing. But 
my friends are allergic to bipartisanship. So, what they have to say is: You know what? Yeah, that is bipartisan, that is bipartisan, but we are going to bunch it in with a bill that is extremely partisan, that is filled with these horrific antienvironmental riders in it. If you want the good stuff, you have got to take this awful stuff as well. We are not going to do that. You are not going to have a bipartisan vote. I think if we were running this House, we would prefer to see a bipartisan vote than simply a partisan vote on everything. If this is the beginning of an appropriations process that you are going to employ throughout the remaining time, I worry about how this will all end up. My guess is, it will be what it usually is: this massive, gigantic mess at the end where deals are struck behind closed doors and things are put together, and we get a vote on one big, massive bill, take it or leave it. And then we will find out what is in it weeks and months later. I think that we are at a point where we have to really decide how this House should be run. I would just respectfully say to my Republican friends that this is not the way we should do the appropriations process. In general, this is not the way we should run the House. We ought to be debating appropriations bills one at a time. We ought to be encouraging bipartisanship, not trying to make it impossible. We have to be more accommodating. It shouldn’t be a proud day for the majority to be able to break their own record of being the most closed Congress in the history of the United States. That is not the way this place is supposed to run. I think it has become too convenient for my Republican friends to run it in a way where they just put bills on the floor and say: Take it or leave it, my way or the highway. I guarantee you, if you are more accommodating, if you are more open, you will have more bipartisan votes. You will have less rancor in this Chamber. Maybe people will actually like Congress better if they see us working together. So I regret very much that I think my words are falling on deaf ears, but it really is disappointing and I think it is a disservice to the institution. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can bring up Mr. LIEU’s bill. If that doesn’t pass, I would urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule. This is not the kind of process we want to see move forward on appropriations. I think this is the only opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to be able to express that, by voting ‘‘no’’ on the rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first things first. I mentioned earlier I don’t think any of these bills are perfect bills; I just think they are the best we were able to work out together. I do want to mention that in the Rules Committee report in the summary of Mr. NOLAN ’s amendment, we did describe that amendment incorrectly. We have now corrected that for the record, that has been submitted, but I just want to highlight that for the purposes of transparency. I think my friend from Massachusetts is exactly right, Mr. Speaker. It is time for us to decide how we want to run this institution. I don’t question his numbers. He is very good. When he says this is the most closed Congress in American history, I am sure he has some set of numbers that backs up that attestation. But what I know is, when I was running for Congress and Democrats were leading this institution at the time, for the entire cycle that I was running, Democrats allowed less than 1,000 amendments totally for the entire session of Congress. Mr. Speaker, this Congress, we have considered more than 1,000 amendments before the month of May got out. We haven’t even gotten into the appropriations cycle yet. That doesn’t include the 30 amendments made in order on the appropriations bill today. It doesn’t include the 50plus amendments made in order on WRDA today. We have already done more to allow Members to be heard in this Congress than was happening when the other side led this institution. I don’t think that should be the measure of success, Mr. Speaker. I don’t think that should be the measure of success. My friend from Massachusetts was right when he said we are going to get bigger votes and better votes when we bring better bills and a better process to the House floor. Let me tell you what I have brought today, Mr. Speaker. I will tell you what I brought today. I brought a bill that passed this House unanimously before it went to the Senate to be passed unanimously after a few amendments—and I brought it back here so that we can again pass it unanimously—a bill to protect communities, to empower law enforcement to fight gang violence on the front lines. I want to send that bill to the President, Mr. Speaker. And if we pass this rule today, we will be able to send that unanimously agreedupon legislation to the President. That is in this rule. Also in this rule is the Water Resources Development Act, which passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee unanimously. Unanimously. Republicans, Democrats, conservatives, liberals, everyone working together to bring a bill out of committee. We brought it out of committee unanimously. The Rules Committee still made another 50 amendments in order in case folks want to improve upon it—50 plus—but we made those amendments in order to a bill that had already been agreed upon unanimously. What else does this rule do? It brings a third piece of legislation to the floor as a part of our appropriations package, the legislative branch appropriations bill, which passed out of committee how, Mr. Speaker? Unanimously, Republicans and Democrats working together to bring that bill out of committee. We include the Military ConstructionVeterans Affairs bill in this package, Mr. Speaker. It came out of committee how? Don’t tell me. Unanimously, as Republicans and Democrats came together to move that legislation forward. b1315 And then we have a fifth part of this package, the Energy and Water appropriations bill, which I confess—I want to be clear; I want to be transparent— did not pass unanimously. It just received a simple bipartisan vote to come out of committee. So I challenge my colleagues who want a better process, who want to see better bills come to the floor. We are already making more amendments in order than my friends on the other side ever dreamed of doing. We are already bringing bills to the floor that have passed in a collaborative, in fact, unanimous way. If Members support this rule, they will be supporting five things, four of them that passed unanimously, and one that passed with a bipartisan vote. Is that going to get everybody what they want here today? I doubt it. It is a tall order, but is it worth supporting? Is it worth saying it is a step in the right direction? Is it worth celebrating because you know it could have gone a different way, but we committed ourselves to the excellence that we have here? It is. I will finish where I began, Mr. Speaker. I am proud to be down here carrying this rule today. I am the luckiest guy in the world to be able to come down here and talk about it, because folks don’t get to hear it, they don’t get to read about it, they don’t get that around the water cooler back home, Mr. Speaker, that we are working together; that we are working together not only on the easy problems, but on the hard problems; that we are doing things here together that we have not done before, but we are doing them now because we have serious men and women on both sides of the aisle who want to make it happen. Support this rule. Support this rule. Let’s show the American people the work product that has gone into this legislation: the rule and those five underlying provisions. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee report (H. Rept. 115–711) to accompany House Resolution 918 included an incorrect amendment description of amendment No. 14 offered by Representative NOLAN  of Minnesota. 
The correct amendment description should read: Expresses the sense of Congress that the construction of a new lock at the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, is vital to our national economy, national security, and national need for new critical infrastructure. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee report (H. Rept. 115–711) to accompany House Resolution 918 should have included in its waiver of all points of order against amendments to H.R. 8 a disclosure of following violation: Clause 9 of rule XXI, which requires a list of all earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits contained in an amendment to a bill or joint resolution to be offered at the outset of its consideration for amendment by a member of a committee of initial referral as designated in a report of the Committee on Rules to accompany a resolution, or a certification that the amendment does not contain any of those items. While a statement has not yet been printed in the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD for amendment No. 1 offered by Rep. SHUSTER , it is important to note that Rep. S HUSTER filed the required earmark statement on June 6, 2018, prior to floor consideration of the bill and amendment. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 918 O FFERED BY  MR. MCGOVERN  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 63) supporting efforts to enact a bold jobs and infrastructure package that benefits all Americans, not just billionaires. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the concurrent resolution are waived. General debate shall be confined to the concurrent resolution and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. After general debate the concurrent resolution shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the concurrent resolution are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the concurrent resolution for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the concurrent resolution to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the concurrent resolution and preamble thereto to adoption without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the concurrent resolution, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the concurrent resolution. SEC. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H. Con. Res 63. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The question is on ordering the previous question.

Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion. The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. Goodlatte moves that the House concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 3249. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the motion shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 3249. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, gangs are a poison in America. They bring violence, drugs, and death. They paralyze our communities with flagrant acts of violence and flood our neighborhoods with drugs. Gangs tear apart families by prematurely taking the lives of sons, daughters, and parents. Unfortunately, today, some areas of our country have been overrun by gang violence. Homicide rates skyrocketed in St. Louis, Baltimore, and Chicago in 2016. Compared to the previous 5 years, 2016 represented a 15.8 percent increase in homicides in St. Louis, a 12.7 percent increase in Baltimore, and an 11.4 percent increase in Chicago. We must stand up to violent gangs and provide an antidote to their poison. H.R. 3249 is a vital part of the antidote. This legislation reforms and reauthorizes the Project Safe Neighborhoods Block Grant Program. This program operates under four key principles: partnerships, strategic planning, training, and outreach. First and foremost, the program brings all the important actors together. This legislation will foster and improve existing partnerships between Federal, State, and local agencies, community groups, and researchers. Strategic planning is the foundation of the Project Safe Neighborhoods program. Moreover, H.R. 3249 promotes the robust enforcement of existing criminal laws and the development of intervention and prevention programs, such as juvenile justice projects and activities, including streetlevel outreach, conflict mediation, and social services. Intervention and prevention programs provide extensive training and community outreach. Furthermore, in relying on localized and contemporaneous data, this bill strategically prioritizes a focus on individuals or organizations that are responsible for increasing violence in a particular geographic area. This legislation will ensure that 30 percent of Project Safe Neighborhoods funding is allocated to gang task forces in regions experiencing a significant or increased presence of violent crime, firearm offenses, human trafficking, and drug trafficking. As a result, critical resources, such as the deployment of law enforcement and funding, are put to their best use. Altogether, this legislation takes a balanced approach by combining enforcement with prevention to combat gang violence in our communities across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, the comprehensive, coordinated, and communityfocused nature of the Project Safe Neighborhoods program will serve as a key part of the antidote to the poisonous effects gangs have on our country. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Virginia, Congresswoman BARBARA COMSTOCK , for taking the lead on this important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker, the chairman is correct: the protection of our neighborhoods, the protection of our young people, the securing of our schools, the stopping of gun violence, the safeguarding of this Nation, are important responsibilities of this Congress, and certainly of the Nation itself. So I join with that commitment of safeguarding our neighbors and friends and families and our children. So I would certainly like to say of the Senate amendment dealing with the Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2018, it does provide additional resources to help local jurisdictions prevent and fight crime in their communities. It would authorize the Attorney General to establish and implement a program to be known as the Project Safe Neighborhoods Block Grant Program within the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice, thereby providing a formal authorization for the Project Safe Neighborhoods program, which is currently implemented by DOJ. That is an absolutely positive step to protect our neighborhoods. Thirty percent of the funding awards under this program would be, however, allocated to fighting gangrelated crime. While I support authorizing this program, I would like to highlight two major concerns with this Senate amendment. First, a substantial portion of the funding under this bill would be dedicated to antigang task forces. I support preventing and fighting crime no matter who the perpetrator may be, but I must caution against targeting groups of young people who are not engaged in crime, or who are standing around, or who may be, in essence, said to be engaged in crime, or may be from particular neighborhoods or ethnicities or backgrounds. I think all of our children deserve a chance to grow and become contributing citizens. I would want to make sure that we get the gangs and that we get those who are the deadly ones that are killing and maiming, and those names, we know, have been cited, but I also want to make sure that we give our children a chance. 
However, under the current framework, focus is placed on identified subsets of individuals or organizations responsible for increasing violence. This creates a danger where innocent young people will likely become targets, whether by virtue of clothes color or mere acquaintance of someone in light of the various talk, if you will, about gangs like MS–13, which I will acknowledge are in all of our communities from east to west and north to south. Let’s get the bad guys. Let’s make sure we help our children not be destined to be the bad guys. We must not use law enforcement as a means to target individuals based solely on their ethnicity or national origin. Far too often, the rhetoric that we are fighting gangs may be laced with bias toward difference. That is why I wanted to offer an amendment at the Rules Committee to the Senate amendment, which would reflect the original provision offered by Representative COMSTOCK related to targeting groups. That was one that we were able to work with here in the House. That specific provision in H.R. 3249 was a much better provision. If accepted, my amendment would have ensured that funding be allocated justly based on sincere need and not on abuse that may occur to demonstrate a significant or increased presence of criminal organizations; and, number two, prevent funding being used towards a wide range of people that might need help, but labeled as criminal groups, rather than the smaller number of people in communities responsible, as you will hear law enforcement say, for the majority of violent crimes, like concentrated transnational organized crime groups as defined by the statute. This eliminates the sweeping effect this bill will have in application, where groups of people not defined by statute as transnational organized crime groups will become targets based on possible biases or rhetoric launched at particular classes of people. We cannot ignore that unfortunately, in the reality of our times, things may go awry. Therefore, in addition to introducing legislation, we must be vigilant in conducting oversight of the use of program funds and in protecting against such possible abuse. Second, I have concerns about the provision of the bill that focuses on datadriven intervention. I advocate instead for a robust focus on prevention driven initiatives that will save us an enormous amount of money when done effectively. That is why I wanted to offer a second amendment which would amend the Crime Control Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow for strong emphasis on gang prevention programs, which is key to curtailing much of these problems. It is imperative to provide front end mechanisms that would prevent the problems that are often costly, resulting in both human costs and tax dollars for our prisons. b1415 This amendment was practical and inexpensive. Now, let me clarify something. Data is very important because it helps us move toward best practices. But in addition to data, we need to be able to use our good sense to talk about intervention, prevention, and working with youngsters again, who may be categorized as being violent but, instead, may be the right kind of targets for intervention and prevention programs. This Senate amendment authorizes $50 million for each of the fiscal years 2019 to 2021, $150 million. The Senate amendment does not comply with House Republican CutGo requirements so that $50 million may be authorized for the program for this time. I certainly believe where we are trying to help children, we should also take that into consideration, particularly with prevention and intervention or gang violence and antibullying initiatives. They are equally worthy goals. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to look further into how we continue to work together and to work to monitor this legislation to ensure that there is not an adverse impact on individuals clearly because of neighborhoods and backgrounds, because that is what America is all about: an equal opportunity for particularly our young people, to get out of where they are and to be able to surge to be a good and contributing citizen. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Senate amendment to H.R. 3249, the ‘‘Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Act of 2017’’. This Senate amendment would provide additional resources to help local jurisdictions prevent and fight crime in their communities. It would authorize the Attorney General to establish and’ implement a program, to be known as the ‘‘Project Safe Neighborhoods Block Grant Program’’ (Program), within the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) at the Department of Justice (DOJ), thereby providing a formal authorization for the Project Safe Neighborhoods Program, which is currently implemented by DOJ. Thirty percent of the funding awards under this Program would be allocated to fighting gangrelated crime. While I support authorizing this Program, I would like to highlight two major concerns of this Senate amendment. First, a substantial portion of the funding under this bill would be dedicated to antigang task forces. I support preventing and fighting crime no matter who the perpetrator may be, but I must caution against targeting groups of young people who are not engaged in crime. However, under the current framework, focus is placed on ‘‘identified subsets of individuals or organizations’’ responsible for increasing violence. This creates a danger, where innocent young people will likely become targets, whether by virtue of clothes color or mere acquaintance of someone, in light of the administrations’ rhetoric around MS–13s. We must not use law enforcement as a means to target individuals based solely on their ethnicity or national origin. Far too often, the rhetoric of fighting gangs has been laced with racial bias. This is why I offered an amendment at Rules to this Senate amendment, which would reflect the original provision offered by Rep. COMSTOCK relating to targeted groups. That specific provision in H.R. 3249 was a much better provision. If accepted, my amendment would have: 1) ensured that funding be allocated justly based on sincere need and not on abuse that may occur to demonstrate a ‘‘significant or increased presence’’ of criminal organizations; and 2) prevented funding being used towards a wide range of people that need help but labeled as criminal gangs, rather than the small number of people in communities responsible for majority of violent crimes, like concentrated ‘‘transnational organized crime groups’’, as defined by statute. This eliminates the sweeping effect this bill will have in application, where groups of people not defined by statute as ‘‘transnational organized crime groups’’ will become targets based on biases and/or rhetoric launched at a particular class of people. We cannot ignore that unfortunate reality of current times. Therefore, in addition to introducing legislation, we must be vigilant in conducting oversight of the use of Program funds and in protecting against such possible abuse. Second, I have concerns about the provisions of the bill that focus on datadriven intervention and I advocate instead, for a robust focus on preventiondriven initiatives that will save us enormous amount of money when done effectively. This is why I offered a 2nd amendment, which would amend the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, to allow for strong emphasis on gang prevention programs, which is key to curtailing much of these problems. It is imperative to provide frontend mechanisms that would prevent the problems that are often costly, resulting in both human cost and tax dollars for our prisons. This amendment was practical and inexpensive. This Senate amendment authorizes $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2021, totaling $150,000,000. This Senate amendment does not comply with House Republican ‘‘cutgo’’ requirements so that $50 million may be authorized for the Program for this time period. I believe prevention and intervention of gang violence and antibullying are equally worthy goals. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to pursue avenues that will not adversely impact individuals based solely on their ethnic backgrounds. Mr. Speaker, I do not argue against the merit of this Program. It would be but one facet of DOJ’s efforts to address gun and gang violence at the local, state, and tribal levels. We should view it from that holistic perspective, and as an effort to supplement but not supplant alternatives that may employ different, yet, stilleffective approaches. During the Committee’s consideration of the H.R. 3249, we expressed these funding concerns, and urged that these funding prohibitions be eliminated. Today, we also address the concerns in the Senate amendment to H.R. 3249, which states as a purpose: Developing and executing comprehensive strategic plans to reduce violent crimes ‘‘including the enforcement of gun laws, and prioritizing efforts focused on ‘identified subsets of individuals or organizations’ responsible for increasing violence in a particular geographic area.’’ 
For these reasons, I respectfully request serious consideration of these concerns and caution against possible abuse that may occur, which will prove counterproductive. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ), the chief sponsor of this legislation. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the Members of this body to concur with the Senate amendment to my bill, the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2018, so that we may send this bill to the President for his signature. I appreciate all the work that Chairman GOODLATTE and the committee has done and the bipartisan nature in which they have worked with us, as well as the administration and the Attorney General. This bill will help address the problem of the rise of violence from gangs like MS–13 that have threatened my area in Northern Virginia, as well as the entire Washington metropolitan region and other places such as Long Island, Houston, and Los Angeles. MS–13 is actually active in 40 States and the District of Columbia, and their goal is to grow. Gangs like MS–13 have branched into human trafficking as well as drugs and, of course, their murderous rampages. In Virginia, we actually, several years ago, increased the penalties on any of these gang members involved with human trafficking, so we know we constantly need to change how we address these gangs. Now, let’s just look at some of the recent headlines in The Washington Post, our local paper, which they have actually covered the violence, the murders, the trials and more of the approximately over 30 killings over the past several years, and that is the number according to the gang task force. Here are some of the headlines: ‘‘MS–13 Is ‘Taking Over the School,’ One Teen Warned Before She Was Killed.’’ ‘‘He Was Flashing Gang Signs on Facebook. It Got Him Killed by MS– 13.’’ ‘‘Heinous and Violent: MS–13’s Appeal to Girls Grows as Gang Become Americanized.’’ And finally, one: ‘‘She Told the Girl She’d See Her in Hell Before Stabbing Her. Now She’s Guilty of an MS–13 Murder.’’ That particular murder was detailed about a young woman, Damaris Reyes Rivas, and her body was found here, this highway, which is just in Springfield, in Virginia, about a dozen, a little over a dozen miles here from the Capitol. You can see the MS–13 gang signs here, and that is where they left her body. At age 12, Damaris was brought to the U.S. by her mom to escape gangs in El Salvador. By 15, she was dead, killed by those very gangs, numerous gang members, who then sent a video of her killing back to El Salvador because that is one of their goals, to show what they have done here. Just to give you a little detail on this, Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Ray Morrogh played the videos in court, saying he wanted to make clear for the judge the depravity involved in the horrific murder of the high school girl. Her mother was in the courtroom. The prosecutor said: ‘‘Some kids are prodigies at the violin, and some kids are prodigies at violence. This is a prodigy at violence.’’ The first video shows Damaris in the Springfield, Virginia, woods, being interrogated by the gang members, numerous gang members, all of whom were between the ages of 15 and 21. They shout at her as she gets up from the snowdusted ground. At one point, they clicked a cigar cutter, threatening her that she could lose a finger. They made her take off her shoes and her shirt so she could feel how cold it was. They were interrogating her about a previous MS–13 murder. People were wielding knives, and they could hear, ‘‘Just stick the steel in her,’’ another one was telling them. They took her away to another area, then they took her back into the woods, forcing her to crawl through a 3foot tunnel covered in MS–13 graffiti. Then they brutally murdered her, and they left her body, and then they came back that night to take the video of the murder to be able to send it back. As the prosecutor explained, those videos were taken so some of the MS– 13 members could send it back to El Salvador to earn a promotion within the gang, which requires violence to move up the ranks. Now, these are The Washington Post stories, I should add, and they also have written stories about how gangs are a problem in our jails. This is in Maryland. It says: ‘‘‘Our incidents every month are predominantly MS–13,’ said a jail investigator speaking on the condition of anonymity for his safety. ‘They are vying for the control of our jails.’’’ So there is violence going on in our jails as a result of this also. We had another victim, Carlos Otero Hernriquez, in Leesburg, Virginia. His body was dumped in a quarry in West Virginia after a brutal murder. The acting U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia said of the killing: ‘‘The hallmark of MS–13 is extreme violence. . . . This brutal kidnapping and murder is a tragic reminder of the impact MS–13 has on communities here in Northern Virginia.’’ MS–13 gangs prey on their own community, as the example of this young woman. Last summer, I went on a ridealong with the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, which is comprised of 13 local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies working together. They are going to be—they should be— some of the beneficiaries of the bill here today. I do want to assure everyone, they work very carefully with the community. What they do is—their projects are to educate, to prevent, to work with the children in schools. They have Spanishspeaking members of the task force so they can make sure they are working with the kids to keep them safe. In one case, they had an MS–13 member who was trying to recruit his brother to join the gang, and then when his brother would not join the gang, they put a hit out on the brother. Fortunately, the gang task force was able to intervene, protect that brother, sort of a Cain and Abel type of situation. Abel was protected. Cain, we were able to have the task force deal with him. But what I saw in working with the Task Force is their need for more technology, their need for resources. Whenever I talk to them, they talk about how they need to be out in the schools, at the fairs. At one local fair in Herndon, actually, I believe it was in Mr. CONNOLLY ’s district, the task force told me, at a Labor Day fair, they identified up to about 200 suspected gang members, just in there, weaving about among the children. So when we went on the ridealong with them, in one night, they picked up four suspected gang members. One of them turned out to be somebody who, at 16 years old, had committed murder in El Salvador; and then he had already been deported from the country twice and was now back on Sterling Boulevard in Sterling, Virginia, about 25 miles or so from the Capitol. There he was, on a Friday evening, as children and everyone else were playing around. He was covered with gang signs when he lifted up his shirt. One of the tools that our gang task force needs more of is a little device that looks a lot like an iPad where, when you put the fingerprint of that gang member on the pad, his record then came up and we could see the entire record, and the gang task force members knew who they were dealing with. So it is clear that the resurgence of MS–13 is a multifaceted problem that needs a multifaceted solution, incorporating efforts from all levels of government, law enforcement, and communities. Passing the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Authorization Act of 2018 today, which the Senate has now already passed, will really get us back on the path to getting the resources that they previously had in our local task force. They called us today to let us know they aren’t even getting the money that they used to get. Unfortunately, this was State money that they used to get that they aren’t getting anymore that the State attorney general’s office used to provide them, and now they 
aren’t getting it. So this is needed more than ever in regions like ours. I know the gentlewoman in Houston, they have problems there, too, and the beauty of this program is they work with those communities that are being targeted. They work with those children. They protect them. They become their friends. But they also get the MS–13 gang members out. Now, we do have another bill that I know the chairman worked with us to get out, which would make sure that we don’t have MS–13 gang members able to get in the country in the first place; and if they are here, we can remove them more quickly. That still needs to get through Senate passage also. But I am pleased that now, today, we have been able to make sure that we don’t see this proliferating in our communities, this kind of gang activity, and to see these gang signs as we are driving home from work, going to a soccer game, you know, going to see our kids, and seeing that this is going on in our communities. This is something that cannot be happening in our communities. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important legislation to protect our communities and combat gang violence and provide more safe neighborhoods. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Virginia is absolutely right on our commitment to working to protect the children that we don’t want to be the victims. Certainly, gangs like MS–13 are in many places, and that is what my focus is. Those bad guys, those who would do harm, clearly, we stand united on. At the same time, I want to make sure that those who stumble in have alternatives, particularly in this country, to get out of that web. As we protect against them and give law enforcement their tools, I want to make sure that we give to others to find other ways to move away from this so that the bad intent, the murderous intent of those gangs can be separated and handled by law enforcement, while other young people have other opportunities. I might also say that I would hope that the Department of Justice will fund this program and, when I say that, Congress will work with us to fund other programs of intervention. So I might, if I could, engage the chairman in a colloquy. I would be eager to hear the gentleman’s thoughts on this thought. I am concerned that all of the talk of fighting gang violence may be, beyond this august Hall, laced with bias, racial bias, ethnicity, et cetera. The Senate amendment includes a reference to focusing on identified subsets of individuals and organizations responsible for increasing violence in a particular geographic area. I might indicate that that may be some bad behavior kids. Will the gentleman assure me that the intent of this provision referring to subsets of individuals is not to encourage or condone the targeting of anyone because of their race or national origin and that they happen to be in groups? Mr. GOODLATTE. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes. This legislation is intended to help our communities fight criminal gangs and the violence and mayhem they wreak, and the bill is not intended to target anyone because of their race or national origin. b1430 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I just wanted to make a concluding comment. We worked together on this. Would the gentleman also say that intervention and prevention programs are a positive contribution to helping our young people stay away from violence? Mr. GOODLATTE. If the gentlewoman will continue to yield, yes, I do. And I certainly support, at every level of government, making sure that we are doing what we can to intervene and get people headed in the right direction and avoiding some of those problems in the first place. And, certainly, some of that is contained within the programs that are funded by this legislation. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I certainly look forward to working further with the gentleman on these matters, and I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ). Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I think when I was speaking about the ride along that I did with the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, someone said they thought they heard me say they had picked up 14 in one night. I just wanted to clarify. If it sounded like 14, I meant to say 4. So it was four in one night. Nevertheless, it goes to the problem of right in our communities there were four people there that they were able to pick up. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, let me just say, we have a solid and unified commitment to protect our children, our neighborhoods, our families, and to isolate violent gangs, some of whom carry the name MS–13, but also to work with law enforcement as they work to isolate those violent persons, but help find a way to steer other juveniles into a way of redemption, if I might utilize that term. Mr. Speaker, I want to continue working with the Judiciary Committee and my colleagues on that very point. So, Mr. Speaker, I do not argue the merit of this program. It would be but one facet of DOJ’s efforts to address gun and gang violence at the local, State, and Tribal levels. We would view it from the holistic perspective and as an effort to supplement, but not supplant, alternatives that may employ different yet still effective approaches. And that is antibullying, bullying intervention, intervention in gang activity, cyberbullying, and prevention of gang activities from the perspective that we understand in our neighborhoods. During the committee’s consideration of H.R. 3249, we expressed these funding concerns and urged that these fund prohibitions be eliminated. What I want to see is other programs continue to be funded that can help law enforcement and others on the question of prevention. Today, we also address concerns in the Senate amendment to H.R. 3249 which states as a purpose, developing and executing comprehensive strategic plans to reduce violent crimes, including the enforcement of gun laws and prioritizing efforts focused on identifying subsets of individuals and organizations responsible for increasing violence and in a particular geographic area. I want to thank the chairman for what I believe is a clarification on the record, and we will continue to monitor as we work with our law enforcement across the Nation. For these reasons, I am respectfully asking that we continue to express our concerns, that we review it, that we ensure that the DOJ, as it works through these grants, continues to keep our legislative thoughts in mind so that this bill is productive and certainly not counterproductive of what we intend to do. Mr. Speaker, I again indicate a commitment that all of us have to get rid of those who terrorize our neighborhoods through the violence of gangs, like MS–13, and save our children who can be saved—which I know they can be—in our neighborhoods and throughout the Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into passing this very important legislation which will now go to the President’s desk for his signature, and will do a lot of good in fighting gang violence and helping young people steer toward a better future and a better life. Both of those things are the purpose of this legislation. I want to especially thank, again, the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ) for her long dedicated work to fighting gang violence and helping our young people have better opportunities for the future, not only in Virginia, but all across this country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PALMER ). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the motion by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ). The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 8. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROUZER ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 918 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 8. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. PALMER ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1437 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 8) to provide for improvements to the rivers and harbors of the United States, to provide for the conservation and development of water and related resources, and for other purposes, with Mr. PALMERin the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER ) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to bring to the floor today the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. This marks the third Congress in a row that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee of the House will consider a water resources bill, so we are back to regular order when it comes to WRDA. I hope we bring it to the floor today, and I hope we pass a WRDA bill. That is good news for the American people and the American economy, because WRDA works. WRDA works because it ensures that Congress carries out its clear Federal role in addressing infrastructure that is critical to our commerce and competitiveness, and to protecting communities throughout the country. WRDA authorizes targeted investments in America’s harbors, ports, locks, dams, inland waterways, flood protection, environmental restoration, and other water resources infrastructure. This infrastructure, maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is vital to every part of the country and every American benefits from it. You don’t have to live near a port or a major waterway to experience these benefits. The health of this infrastructure directly impacts how efficiently the things we buy get onto our store shelves, and how quickly the goods that we produce get to markets around the world. WRDA improvements originate at the local level. They grow our local, regional, and national economies, and they create goodpaying jobs. Restoring WRDA legislation to a 2year congressional cycle was one of the first goals when I became chairman in 2013. By working together, we passed WRDA into law in 2014 and 2016. Both of these measures attracted broad bipartisan support, and this bill is no different, passing out of our committee unanimously 2 weeks ago. I want to thank Ranking Member DEFAZIO, Water Resources Environment Subcommittee Chairman GARRET  GRAVES , and Subcommittee Ranking Member GRACE NAPOLITANO for working with me to introduce this bill. Our bipartisan legislation follows the fiscally responsible, transparent process for considering Corps activities that Congress established in 2014. It maintains strong congressional oversight and the constitutional authority of the Legislative Branch. It deauthorizes old projects to fully offset new authorizations, and sunsets new authorizations to prevent future backlogs. WRDA also builds on past reforms of the Corps and explores new ways to deliver projects more efficiently. In keeping with traditional WRDAs, my cosponsors and I agreed to narrowly focus our bill on the civil works program of the Corps. Preserving the civil works focus of this bill increases the likelihood of final passage. If we don’t enact a bill into law this year, we will delay necessary water infrastructure improvements and increase project costs. Let’s approve this vital bill today. Let’s build our water infrastructure. Let’s grow our economy, and let’s create jobs. Let’s pass WRDA, because WRDA does work, and let’s ensure that WRDA continues to work for the American people. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to a good debate today and to moving this bill to the Senate, so I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 8. 
U.S. C ONGRESS , CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE , Washington, DC, June 4, 2018. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. Sincerely, KEITH HALL, Director. Enclosure. H.R. 8—WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT 
OF2018 As reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 1, 2018 
SUMMARY  H.R. 8 would authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to construct projects to improve navigation and flood management, to mitigate storm and hurricane damage and to provide assistance for water recycling and water treatment projects. The bill also would authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist states and local governments in mitigating flood risks from aging dams and levees. CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 8 would cost about $1.1 billion over the next five years and $2.5 billion over the 2019–2028 period, assuming appropriation of authorized and necessary amounts. Enacting H.R. 8 also would increase direct spending by $5 million over the 2019–2028 period; therefore, payasyougo procedures apply. The bill would authorize the Corps to convey nine acres of federal land to the city of Nashville, Tennessee, in exchange for the fair market value of the property, which CBO estimates would total about $1 million. The bill also would authorize the Corps to credit the nonfederal sponsor of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project for certain inkind contributions totaling $6 million. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. H.R. 8 would significantly increase direct spending by more than $2.5 billion and on budget deficits by more than $5 billion in at least one of the four consecutive 10year periods beginning in 2029, by authorizing the Corps to spend amounts in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund without further appropriation. H.R. 8 contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). 
ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 8 is shown in the following table. The costs of the legislation fall within budget function 300 (natural resources and environment). 
By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars— 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2019– 2023 2019– 2028 
BASIS OF ESTIMATE  For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 8 will be enacted near the end of 2018 and that the authorized and necessary amounts will be appropriated for each fiscal year. Estimates of amounts necessary to implement the bill are based on information from the Corps and FEMA; estimated outlays are based on historical spending patterns for similar projects and programs. Major components of the estimated costs are described below. 
SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION  CBO estimates that H.R. 8 would authorize appropriations totaling about $2.7 billion over the 2019–2028 period for water infrastructure projects and studies administered by the Corps and FEMA. We estimate that implementing those provisions would cost $2.5 billion over the 2018–2028 period. 
WATER RESOURCES INFRASTRUCTURE  CBO estimates that implementing provisions of the bill that would authorize the Corps to construct and modify water infrastructure projects would cost about $1.5 billion over the 2019–2028 period, assuming appropriation of the specified amounts and accounting for anticipated inflation. Those provisions would authorize the Corps to construct seven new projects and would modify the existing authorization of three projects aimed at mitigating hurricane and storm damage, strengthening floodrisk management, improving the nation’s navigation system, restoring the environment, and providing assistance for water recycling and water treatment projects. Using information from the Corps, CBO estimates that the total cost to complete those projects would be $4.2 billion. H.R. 8 would authorize the appropriation of $2.7 billion to cover the federal share of those costs—of that $1.7 billion would need to be appropriated over the 2019–2028 period (assuming historical rates of spending for similar projects)—and nonfederal entities would be responsible for the remaining costs, totaling an estimated $1.5 billion. The estimated cost of the largest project authorized by H.R. 8 totals $3.3 billion; the federal share would total about $2.2 billion. That project aims to address erosion along the coast in Galveston, Texas, and restore ecosystems including wetlands and marshes to enhance protection from storm surge in the area that was damaged by Hurricane Harvey. The estimated cost for the other projects authorized by the bill total $0.9 billion; the federal share of those projects totals about $0.6 billion. Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that spending on the project to restore the Texas coast in Galveston would total about $940 million over the 2019–2028 period. CBO estimates that construction spending for the other six projects and three modifications would total about $550 million over the next 10 years. To estimate how funds appropriated for those projects would be spent, CBO used information from the Corps about when construction for each project could begin, how long it would take to complete, and what funding would be necessary to complete it over the anticipated construction period. Construction schedules and the pattern of spending for such projects is uncertain and plans are subject to change because of delays in obtaining funding and other unforeseen circumstances. For this estimate, CBO assumed that those projects with greater costs to benefits ratios would be prioritized for funding. Information on cost benefit ratios was provided to CBO by the Corps. CBO also analyzed the historical spending patterns of similar projects. Because of their size and complexity some large Corps projects can take several years to commence and more than ten years to complete. CBO estimates that the federal share of the projects and modifications authorized by this title would require the appropriation of about $1.7 billion over the 2019–2028 period; the remainder of the federal share to complete the projects would be needed after 2028. Finally, the bill would withdraw the authorization for five projects originally authorized more than 70 years ago. Information from the Corps indicates that these projects are complete and no additional construction is planned; therefore CBO expects that deauthorizing them would have no budgetary effect. 
DAM AND LEVEE SAFETY  Using information provided by the Corps and FEMA, CBO estimates that implementing provisions addressing dam and levee safety would cost $590 million over the 2019– 2028 period, assuming appropriation of authorized amounts. H.R. 8 would reauthorize the national dam and levee safety programs operated by FEMA Corps. Those programs provide grants to local and state governments to assist with levee safety and rehabilitation, maintaining databases for the nation’s dams and levees, and implementing a public awareness and education program for managing dam and levee safety. Under those programs the Corps also would provide technical assistance to local and state governments to rehabilitate high risk levees. H.R. 8 would authorize the appropriation of $372 million for FEMA and the Corps to implement those programs. Using information on historical spending patterns for similar projects, CBO estimates that implementing those provisions would cost $365 million over the 2019–2028 period. The bill also would increase amounts authorized to be appropriated each year for the Corps to rehabilitate dams considered to be highly hazardous until the authorization for program expires in 2026. Dams eligible for funding would include those constructed by the Corps before 1940 that have been classified as a high hazard by the state where the dam is located and that are operated by a nonfederal entity. Using information on historical spending patterns for this program, CBO estimates that implementing that provision would cost $225 million over the 2019– 2028 period. NAVIGATION AND NONFEDERAL CONSTRUCTION  
PROGRAMS  CBO estimates that implementing provisions of the bill related to navigation and nonfederal construction programs would cost $203 million over the 2019–2028 period, assuming appropriation of the specified amounts. H.R. 8 would increase the amounts authorized to be appropriated each year by $12.5 million for the Corps to construct small harbor projects to improve navigation. Using information from the Corps, CBO estimates that implementing that provision would cost $108 million over the 2019–2028 period. The bill also would reauthorize a pilot program for the Corps to contract with nonfederal partners to construct projects to manage risk from floods, reduce damage from storms and improve navigation of the nation’s harbors. The program aims to identify opportunities for reducing the costs and the time required to complete construction projects. The provision would authorize the appropriation of $25 million for each year from 2020 through 2023. Using information from the Corps, CBO estimates that implementing that provision would cost $95 million over the 2019–2028 period. 
STUDIES AND OTHER PROVISIONS  Using information provided by the Corps, CBO estimates that implementing the provisions described below would cost $167 million over the 2019–2028 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Those provisions would: Authorize the Corps to credit nonfederal partners for work carried out on projects to protect, preserve, and restore the Louisiana coastal ecosystems; Authorize the Corps to conduct about 20 feasibility studies for projects to reduce risks stemming from floods, to restore ecosystems, and to improve navigation; and Direct the Corps to prepare a report on aquatic invasive species and other management reports, fund a demonstration project aimed at harmful algal bloom, and provide housing support to Indian tribes displaced by the construction of John Day Dam on the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon. CBO’s cost estimate for H.R. 8 excludes the costs of implementing section 108, which would authorize the Corps to restore infrastructure for shore protection damaged by natural disasters to prestorm levels because the number of eligible projects is not available. 
CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING  Using information provided by the Corps, CBO estimates that implementing the provisions described below would increase direct spending by about $5 million. The construction phase of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project in Florida is nearly complete and the Corps anticipates that the final accounting for the federal and nonfederal shares of the project’s cost will occur in about 5 years. The Corps has previously determined that certain inkind contributions provided by the local sponsor of the project were ineligible as a qualifying credit toward the portion of the local cost share. H.R. 8 would reverse that decision by the Corps and reduce any cash settlement that would be required by the local sponsor to reconcile the nonfederal account. The Corps would be required to credit the nonfederal sponsor for the Kissimmee River Restoration Project for those inkind contributions, which total $6 million. The bill also would authorize the Corps to convey 9 acres of federal land to the city of Nashville, Tennessee, in exchange for payment of the fair market value of the property. Using information provided by the Corps, CBO estimates the city would pay the federal government about $600,000 in 2020 when the property is transferred. 
PAYASYOUGO CONSIDERATIONS  The Statutory PayAsYouGo Act of 2010 establishes budgetreporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in outlay that are subject to those payas yougo procedures are an increase in direct spending of $5 million. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues over the 2019–2028 period. 
DEFICITS  CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 8 would increase net direct spending and onbudget deficits by more than $2.5 billion and on budget deficits by more than $5 billion in at least one of the four consecutive 10year periods beginning in 2029. Under the bill, balances in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) would become available to the Corps, without further appropriation, beginning in fiscal year 2029. The Corps would expend those funds on nonroutine maintenance costs and deferred repairs at eligible projects. CBO estimates that the balance in the HMTF would total about $15 billion in 2029. In recent years the annual appropriation from the HMTF has been about $1 billion. CBO estimates that direct spending from the HMTF in 2029 and later years would exceed $1 billion per year. CBO cannot predict whether annual discretionary appropriations from the HMTF would continue at any level after 2028. 
MANDATES  H.R. 8 contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in UMRA.

ESTIMATE REVIEWED BY  Kim P. Cawley, Chief, Natural and Physical Resources Cost Estimates Unit. Theresa Gullo, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. This is the product of many months of hard work by members of the committee and staff, and I particularly want to congratulate the chairman. This will be his last WRDA bill, but until his leadership, water resources bills had languished for, I believe, a decade. So this has been a tremendous achievement. This is a good bill. However, it could be better. In the last Congress, I offered an amendment in committee to take the harbor maintenance trust fund off budget, allow the Corps to spend the proceeds in the trust fund every year, and draw down the surplus that deals with a backlog on all of our ports. Ports affect the entire Nation, any time you have an import or an export, which covers virtually all of the States of the union. These red dots are harbors that are critical to our infrastructure. On a daily basis, our major ports are at about 35 percent of their authorized depth. 35 percent. Why is that? Well, because we don’t have the money to fix them. And the jetties are falling apart. We don’t have the money to fix them. Well, actually, we do have the money to fix them, but some very shortsighted people around here want to play games. They want to collect a tax from the American people—a minuscule tax, 0.0125 cents on the value of every imported good that comes through a harbor. That is, if you buy a $30,000 car, you are going to spend about $37.50 that, starting with Ronald Reagan, was dedicated to maintaining our harbors at proper depths and maintaining the jetties for these harbors, not limiting the funds just to the commercial harbors, but to small and emerging ports, which are also critical to the Nation: the fishing industry, recreation, and others. However—and this has been a bipartisan problem, starting even when Democrats have been in charge—this has been underspent on an annual basis. Today, there is $10.5 billion of taxes collected from the American people sitting idle or having been spent somewhere else. It has got a theoretical trust fund. Now, that is going to grow every year as we underspend this tax. It could grow to $20 billion within a decade. So we don’t have the money to dredge the ports and we don’t have the money to fix the jetties, because Congress is diverting the money. I actually worked on this with the chairman’s father quite some time ago, and the chairman has been supportive of my efforts. Unfortunately, it was stripped out of that bill by the Rules Committee 2 years ago. And this year, again, the Rules Committee found that they would not allow this to go forward. So we offered it in a different form to get around their technical objections about budget caps and discretionary spending. b1445 So we offered—well, there actually is a way around that. They didn’t like that either. They want to continue to steal money from the American people and divert it to be spent who knows where—somewhere else, but not on our harbors and our ports. Now, the administration actually sent to what is called their statement down to us with an SAP—and it really is a SAP; they are SAPs—a Statement of Administration Policy is what it stands for. They sent down a provision where they said: This is great that you are not allowing the Congress to spend the tax collected from the American people on the stated purpose. What? Really? Yes. That is their position. They say that the ports should have greater flexibility to spend local money on the ports. Well, they have all the flexibility in the world to spend local money on local ports. They can partner with the Corps and fund Corps activities. I did that a number of years ago in Oregon. They don’t have the money, and we are depriving them of the money. But this is the Trump administration’s solution. The big infrastructure package? This is going to be counted. We are going to add $3 billion to the pile of unfunded Corps projects. We have got today $96 billion of Corps projects that have been authorized by Congress that aren’t funded in the foreseeable future. At the end of this debate there will be $99 billion—almost $100 billion—quite an achievement, and the administration is applauding this. They think this is just great because it gives the local ports the capability of raising money they can’t raise to spend on the improvements they can’t make. Meanwhile, we are stealing money from the American people. It is a very sad day. So with that said, I will move on. There are other issues in this bill that are critical. We have $3 billion to new Chief’s Reports which will go on the shelf for the indefinite future, maybe 100 years or longer. But people can go home and say: Well, I got that project, all we need to do now is get the money. Maybe a future Congress—maybe next year—we will decide to start spending the harbor maintenance tax on harbor maintenance. Who knows? It might depend upon who is in charge around here. There are other provisions in here that are critical, authorizing the national levee safety initiative, the national dam safety program—those are pretty important things—promoting improved safety measures, and reducing the risk to life and property. There are a couple of provisions that benefit or would go for Corps projects in my district, one related to Fern Ridge Dam, and a collapsing road near the dam. A number of years ago, we had to expedite funds to fix a collapsing dam, now we have a collapsing road by the collapsing dam, and hopefully, the Corps can get to that before we have a major problem; and then delivering on a very longago promise to 
Indian tribes that were displaced by dams that were built threequarters of a century ago. Their villages were flooded and displaced, and this would authorize the Corps to provide housing assistance to those tribes. There are other meritorious things in this bill. Again, I want to congratulate the chairman on what will be the third conservative 2year authorization of the Water Resources Development Act. We just need to find the will and the money to fund the necessary projects. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for all of his leadership on this important legislation. I want to thank my friend from Oregon and my friend from California for working with us on this, as there is a bipartisan agreement to move this bill forward. Mr. Chairman, why are we doing this bill? People at home who are watching this, people who are living in their communities, why are we doing this bill? We are doing this bill because we need to ensure that people live in places that are safe—safe from flooding and safe from hurricanes. We just saw last year the 2017 hurricanes, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate, where we spent well over $150 billion so far—I believe we are near $180 billion— responding to those disasters. People need to live in safe, resilient communities. We need to ensure that we can build navigation channels that stay compatible with trends in shipping. We built the Panama Canal. The United States built the Canal, yet the Panamanians have stepped in and deepened and widened the canal and the lock system in a shorter period of time than we have been able to even deepen ports here in the United States. Then, of course, there are environmental issues, the environmental consequences of many of these projects, including in my home State of Louisiana, where we have lost 2,000 square miles of our coast, and the Corps of Engineers has not stepped in and done a single thing to actually restore the environmental consequences of their actions— 2,000 square miles of coastal wetlands. If you or I did that, we would be in jail today. So the reason we are doing this bill is because as the ranking member, Mr. DEFAZIO, mentioned a few minutes ago, we have a nearly $100 billion backlog in projects. We are putting forward somewhere around $2 billion a year in construction funds. You can do the math. I am a math whiz, and I can tell you that you will finish those projects approximately never, because $2 billion a year on $100 billion, you can’t even keep up with inflation. We must reform the process, and this bill moves in that direction. There are important reforms in this bill like allowing the nonFederal sponsors, the States, the parishes, the counties, the water boards, and the ports, to grab components of these projects and move them forward on their own working in collaboration with the Corps of Engineers to ensure that we are moving these projects forward efficiently. We need to make sure that we are moving redundancies in the process and allowing these nonFederal entities to use the same permitting process that the Corps of Engineers just went through and spent millions of dollars complying with. We are still being respectful to the environment, but we are not forcing them to carry out redundant measures, paying twice for the same actions because that doesn’t make sense. Let me go back and talk about, again, what these outcomes actually yield. We are talking about projects to prevent communities from flooding, to prevent hurricane damages, to restore the environment, and to ensure that our ports and waterways can facilitate the ships that are growing in width and in depth across the globe to where we can have more costeffective shipping in the United States and our port systems and we can facilitate the trade that comes around the globe and into our country. Mr. Chairman, they have projects that have been in the study phase, not for months or years, but for decades. We have projects that have been waiting on full implementation of construction for decades. Once again, in my home State of Louisiana, we have the Comite project that has been around for 32 years, $100 million nearly has been spent, and nothing has been done to actually provide flood relief—$100 million. We have another project in southeast Louisiana in Terrebone and Lafourche Parishes, where the Corps of Engineers has spent nearly $80 million and hasn’t put a shovel in the ground yet. How do you do that when you look at the fact that we have a $20 trillion deficit and we are spending those sorts of dollars on actions that aren’t benefiting taxpayers? Who is that representing? Because it is not the people who sent us here. So I will say it again: this bill moves forward in transparency, it moves forward in efficiency while respecting the environment, it allows projects to be expedited, and it gives more flexibility for the Corps and their nonFederal partners to work together to deliver these projects. One thing that is in here that I know the chairman is a big fan of and we pushed as well with our friends across the aisle, is taking a look to study whether or not the Corps of Engineers should remain within the Department of Defense. Is this a mission that is truly compatible with our Department of Defense? I want Secretary Mattis focused on Syria and focused on Iran, North Korea, China, Russia, and other threats to our country. I don’t want him or her also worried about what is happening with a coastal wetlands permit. I want him focused on the national defense of our country, so looking at where this mission perhaps could be better housed, better compatibility, and ultimately to deliver better outcomes to taxpayers across the country. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I associate the remarks of my ranking member, the chairman of the committee, and the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. GRAVES . I rise in strong support of the bipartisan bill, H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. I very strongly thank Chairman SHUSTER , Ranking Member D EFAZIO, and Chairman GRAVES for their work on this legislation. It is encouraging to see that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee continue in a bipartisan fashion on this legislation every 2 years. This bill authorizes Army Corps of Engineers’ feasibility studies, Chief’s Reports, and section 7001 water resource projects across the country for a diverse array of purposes, including flood damage reduction, ecosystem restoration, hurricane and storm damage reduction, water supply—very important to me—and navigation. It also includes an important water recycling project for Los Angeles County in California, with the West Basin Municipal Water District’s Harbor/ South Bay project. This project provides a $35 million increase for an existing, successful authorization to improve microfiltration of wastewater and delivery to residents and businesses. This will create longterm water supply reliability in our drought prone region. I want to thank my good friends, Directors Carol Kwan and Gloria Gray, for their commitment to this costeffective and innovative water supply option for all their constituents. I also am pleased to see the inclusion of several provisions that will continue the work we have done in recent WRDAs to assist communities experiencing drought with additional water supply options. These provisions include section 109 that will require the Corps to work with local governments on integrated water resources planning to incorporate in Corps projects locally developed plans for stormwater management, water quality improvements, and—my baby—water recycling. Section 107 provides for forecastinformed reservoir operations in water control manuals to ensure that dams are being used effectively to maximize local water supply. Section 115 provides a comprehensive report on the operation and maintenance backlog of Corps projects so that 
Congress has a full accounting of the unmet needs of authorized water resource projects. We have such a backlog, and there is that fund that goes nowhere, the billions of dollars that should be going to the ports that do not benefit, and we have a tremendous backlog. I am concerned that the bill does not include a bipartisan provision supported by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that would fully fund the harbor maintenance trust fund. Congress needs to remedy this inequity in the harbor maintenance trust fund once and for all, so that the taxes paid into the system are benefiting the projects they were intended for. I support the efforts of port stakeholders, including the American Association of Port Authorities, which includes all ports in the United States which recently approved, for the first time, a national agreement with all ports to create fairness in the harbor maintenance trust fund. It is very unfortunate that the House leadership is using procedural tactics to prevent the House from addressing this critical issue. I am confident that this bill, when and if enacted, will provide drought prone regions like mine and other very necessary areas with the tools necessary to increase water supply and water conservation measures and be prepared for future storm events to capture and reuse the water that would have otherwise been lost. I want to thank my constituent water agencies for their input throughout this process, including the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, the Three Valleys Municipal Water District, the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, the San Gabriel WaterMaster, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, and my local Corps leadership, General Helmlinger, Colonel Gibbs, and David Van Dorpe. Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of this bill, and I ask Members to support H.R. 8. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES ). The other Mr. GRAVES from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit. Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 8. I want to say, too, the chairman’s commitment to passing bipartisan WRDA bills every 2 years has been very impactful on better managing the bureaucracy of the Corps of Engineers. I think we can all agree that the Corps needs regular examination of projects and policy to hold them accountable, and this is good government and a policy I would like to see the committee remain committed to in the future. In my district, Mr. Chairman, this bill is extremely important to the agriculture economy and to everyone who relies on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. b1500 My district alone is bordered by 400 miles of Missouri and Mississippi River frontage. So we in northern Missouri are directly affected by the Corps’ actions. I am glad that the committee unanimously adopted my amendment to bring some common sense to the management of the endangered species— specifically, the pallid sturgeon—that live along the Missouri River. Past efforts to help the pallid sturgeon have led to multiple years of flooding and millions of dollars’ worth of damage to my constituents. What is worse is the fact that the Corps has spent money year after year on population recovery, and it has not helped the pallid sturgeon one bit. This is absolutely unacceptable. Before the Army Corps builds any new, unproven structures along the Missouri and spends millions of taxpayer dollars, they are now required to prove that it actually works. Furthermore, the Army Corps must prove that these structures, called IRCs, do not negatively impact the other management priorities on the Missouri River that the Corps is responsible for, most importantly, which is flood control and navigation. Mr. Chairman, the Corps shouldn’t be focused on constructing environmental habitats. They should be protecting people and businesses from flooding and helping facilitate navigation on the river. We have been down this road before with unproven methods to help fish over people. In closing, this is a good bill. It is necessary to advance important flood control projects and ensure our inland waterways remain a reliable and efficient option for transporting goods up and down the rivers. I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R. 8. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE ), my colleague on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, as a member of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee and a cosponsor of this bill, I rise in support of H.R. 8. Our water infrastructure is important to the health of our economy and job growth, including infrastructure job opportunity in the skilled trades. Supporting our water infrastructure is essential to the goal of ensuring environmental justice. Communities in poverty and women and children are especially vulnerable to the harsh consequences of failing and faulty water infrastructure. Let us not forget Flint, Michigan. This bill continues this important bipartisan process. As a Representative from Michigan, this bill continues to protect the Great Lakes region. The Davis amendment on the floor today affirms the commitment to fighting invasive species. Completion of the longawaited Brandon Road Study is needed to combat environmental threats to our region. The Great Lakes waterways create thousands of jobs and create billions in revenue, annually. We must continue to support the Army Corps’ operations that operate these critical waterways. As Members know, our Nation’s infrastructure is in desperate need of repair, and we cannot kick the can down the road anymore. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), a member of the committee. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman SHUSTER  and GRAVES , Ranking Member D EFAZIO, and also my other good friend, the ranking member on the subcommittee, Mrs. NAPOLITANO . I am proud to join them to support this bill and to say that WRDA works. In 2014, during my first term in Congress, we passed the first Water Resource Development Act in 7 years. This bill made critical reforms to add efficiencies to the Corps’ process of studying and recommending projects for authorization, and, importantly, it set us up to get WRDA back on a 2year cycle of authorizations. This bill represents the continuation of that process. Our bill authorizes a total of eight Army Corps of Engineers Chief’s Reports received since the last WRDA passed by us in 2016. All of these Chief’s Reports have been fully vetted by the committee at hearings during this Congress and in an open and transparent process. Now, I haven’t shied away from my criticism of the Corps in the past. I think that the Corps is good at building things, but actually getting to construction is typically the most difficult part of the process. One particular provision in this bill directs the National Academy of Sciences to analyze the Corps’ civil works functions and the potential impacts of transferring those functions to another Federal agency. They will be required to provide recommendations to us in Congress. Mr. Chairman, it is truly clear that WRDA works. The authorizing committee has diligently worked over the past three Congresses to get us back on this 2year cycle to ensure that we continue to improve processes. I would also be remiss, Mr. Chairman, if I didn’t mention those projects of national significance that have been authorized for many years and yet have seen very little progress, including the Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program, or NESP. Authorized by Congress in 2007, this critical project would expand seven locks on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers to meet the demand for barges to transport agricultural and other commodities to the global marketplace. 
Unfortunately, because of incongruent priorities at the Corps in the past and a reluctance from the Appropriations Committee, we have yet to see this move forward. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. HARPER ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, we can and must do better to align our priorities with the Corps to ensure critical projects of national significance don’t languish after an initial authorization, which is why, related to my earlier comments, I believe it is important for Congress to understand the implications and potential efficiencies of moving the Corps’ mission to another Federal agency. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I thank the committee Democrats and Republicans for bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor. One of the most important pieces of infrastructure in my particular district in the State of Michigan is the Saginaw River. This Federal port allows for raw material from around the world to be brought into our communities to be used in manufacturing and agriculture and is really the lifeblood of the economy there. The depth of the river, however, currently limits the size of the ships that can use this very important port. Our dock owners on the Saginaw River have joined with the local government and businesses to propose deepening the Saginaw River to increase business opportunities and grow jobs in our region. The Army Corps process to authorize deepening of the river, however, can sometimes be rather timeconsuming. While millions have been spent by dock owners, under current law, the Army Corps construction plan for considering construction projects does not allow those investments that have already been made. So I am supporting this legislation, in part, because of the reforms in the bill. It changes the way the Army Corps does their costbenefit analysis on a project. It will greatly benefit many projects, including the Saginaw River’s deepening project. This will grow jobs in my district, in our State, and in our country. It is a step in the right direction. I encourage the Corps to work with those local members and that local coalition on the deepening of this river using the reforms in this bill. This is really important for my district. I really appreciate the work of the committee in coming together and delivering these reforms and delivering a good bill to the floor in a bipartisan fashion. I encourage my colleagues to support it. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ). Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I rise as a conservative in support of this measure. As conservatives, we want less government; but the government that we have, we want to work better. I think that WRDA does that. I think one of the things we look at is how do we become more competitive as a society relative to all the other places around the globe in the way that we deliver goods, whether by land, by air, or by sea. Again, this bill does that. I stand in support of this measure and thank the chairman for his work on it. I want to particularly single him out for what he has done with the WRDA process. As has already been mentioned, there was a 7year skip between WRDA bills. But there was a bill in 2014; there was a bill in 2016; there was a bill in 2018. That kind of predictability is absolutely necessary if you are going to see marine and other investments as we have seen, for instance, in a place like Charleston. Two, I want to thank him for what he is doing with regard to nonFederal sponsors. This idea of adding new flexibility in the way that we originate programs, I think, makes a lot of sense. One authorization means a bottleneck. What this bill does is frees up bottlenecks in the way that things get funded. Third, I want to single out GARRET  GRAVES and, again, the chairman, for this study on whether or not civil works can be done by nonmilitary actors. I think that this is vital in moving the backlog through that now exists on the WRDA front. Finally, I want to say thanks for what he is doing on costbenefit analysis. A place like Charleston has been heavily hampered as a consequence of their throwing in local money. What we want to reward at the Federal level is more in the way of State and local money as we leverage Federal investment. Again, I thank the chairman for what he has done on this measure, and I rise in support of H.R. 8. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ). Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Chairman, this legislation is a bright light of bipartisanship that is sorely needed by communities like mine in Hawaii and those in Florida as well. There is nothing more necessary and basic to life than water. Strengthening and upgrading our water infrastructure is critical to protecting the health, safety, and welfare of communities all across the country. Those like mine, who are surrounded by water, and those in our coastal communities are acutely aware of the dire need for investment. For example, for us in Hawaii, we rely on our ports for the vast majority of the basic needs and supplies that we have to ship in for our residents. We have also experienced historic floods in Hawaii recently, like other States, exposing the urgent need for investment in water infrastructure. Just one example, risk experts in Hawaii have warned that the Ala Wai watershed’s high vulnerability to devastating flooding could result in financial devastation to the tune of over $1.1 billion, damaging more than 3,000 structures, and speaks to the fact that the area is home to over 150,000 residents and over 80,000 visitors every day. This bipartisan legislation will secure critical funding for flood risk management both on the Ala Wai Canal, other places in Hawaii, and across the country, helping to provide that necessary safety and security for our residents. This is a critical piece of bipartisan legislation that deserves the support of Congress. Let’s take this opportunity to better the lives of our constituents and residents across the country by strengthening our national infrastructure and ensuring clean and safe drinking water for all. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER ). Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, North Carolina’s Seventh Congressional District is fortunate to have some of the most beautiful beaches and waterways in the United States, which are major contributors to our State’s vibrant tourism industry, attracting more than 50 million visitors a year and generating more than $22.9 billion in revenue. This Water Resources and Development Act is critical to strengthening our country’s infrastructure projects, all of which are so critical to the Nation’s economy. In the district I represent, Carolina Beach’s Coastal Storm Damage Reduction project reached the end of its 50 year authorization in 2014. While the Army Corps of Engineers works to complete their study to determine future authorization of this project, this bill provides for continued authorization in the interim and longterm certainty of nourishment should the Corps study be favorable and funding available. Our ports, beaches, inlets, and waterways are the lifeline of economic activity and job growth for our coastal communities, and they are incredibly important for the Nation as a whole. I thank Chairman SHUSTER , Ranking Member DEFAZIO and the rest of my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for putting forth a strong bill that addresses the unique coastal needs of North Carolina’s Seventh District and makes great improvements to current law enabling critical projects to move forward while saving taxpayer dollars in multiple ways. A job well done. I urge everyone’s support. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ). 
Mr. L AMALFA. Mr. Chairman, when I first got to the U.S. House, a WRDA bill hadn’t passed in 6 years. Since then, Chairman SHUSTER has led a renaissance in the committee, putting us back on the 2year cycle, which I applaud him and all of our colleagues on the committee for spearheading these efforts. What we are looking for is predictability and stability in this process. Just a few weeks ago, that process continued, as the Water Resources Development Act of 2018 passed through the committee in a unanimous and bipartisan fashion. b1515 Now, WRDA stands before the House ready for final passage. This legislation will institute, importantly, a review process of the Army Corps of Engineers’ backlog that can save, in the near term, $3 billion. Now, with $100 billion worth of work identified, and maybe $2 billion per year allocated, when will we ever get caught up on this unless there is a review and new process put in place? We will also implement a study to improve Army Corps’ administration and procedures, and greatly increase the role of local shareholders in carrying out water development projects like we have seen in Sutter and Butte Counties in northern California. Indeed, the public will be much better served in safety when working on these levee projects and getting them done timely and for lower costs. This whole WRDA legislation will be key for important flood control work and levee work, in addition to the many other things that have been talked about today. This bill is an important next step in moving this process forward, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I rise today in support of H.R. 8—the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2018. As the most senior Texan on the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee and former chair of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, I am pleased to support this bill which represents a bipartisan effort to authorize critical water infrastructure projects and develop our nation’s future water resources. Our ports, inland waterways, locks, dams, flood protection, and other water infrastructure are vital to our nation and its global competitiveness. Water infrastructure forms a critical backbone in support of our overall infrastructure needs and H.R. 8 will ensure that the United States can provide not only basic water resources for its people, but also promote commerce along our nation’s waterways. One element of the WRDA bill that I wish had been addressed is the full use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF). The HMTF was established to cover the operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses of our waterways and harbors. As Harbor Maintenance Taxes (HMTs) are collected, it is the responsibility of Congress to appropriate its spending for dredging and other O&M activities. A sufficient amount of HMT revenue is collected each year to meet our nation’s annual authorized harbor maintenance needs. It is critical that we remain open to the idea of fully utilizing the HMTF for harbor maintenance purposes. Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with Congress to continue authorizing these important projects and sticking to a twoyear authorization cycle. Doing so will ensure that we are able to advance water resources development projects in a timely manner and provide the predictability and support that is so desperately needed. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. Our district, centered in Eastside and Northside Houston and eastern Harris County, was one of the most highly impacted by Hurricane Harvey. While we have passed emergency supplemental funding the Port of Houston and the Army Corps of Engineers have drastic needs for mitigating the damage done by Harvey. The Port of Houston is the second busiest in the U.S. in terms of overall tonnage and the busiest in the U.S. in terms of foreign tonnage. Silt, from the bayous has drastically limited maneuverability and depth. The port had recently completed dredging to 45 feet. Many of the ships can no longer get through the channel due to hurricane damage. The disaster funding has not reached our ports. The port currently estimates that first phase of recovery from the storm will cost an estimated $457 million dollars. The ship channel is the lifeblood of Houston. The energy renaissance that we have experienced in this country is also driven by industry that relies on the Port and the ship channel. It’s absolutely essential to our district that we adequately fund corps projects that get the port back at their normal capacity. Decades ago Congress created the Harbor Maintenance Fund, a tax on goods to keep our ports and harbors in good working order, and every year appropriators do not appropriate the needed funds. It is past time that we start putting all the money collected from port economic activity back into maintaining our ports. Army Corps of Engineer projects go hand in hand with the health of our ports as well. Houston is a city of Bayous. When our Bayou’s are damaged in a storm like Harvey the silt flows downstream into the ship channel. The turning basis, which was hit hard in the Tax Day Floods of 2016 has seen draft restrictions for over 1,300 days now. These Army Corps projects don’t just save money though, they create jobs. These improvements in this bill aren’t theoretical, they’re shovel ready projects the Corps has read to go. The Army Corps of Engineers recently announced that it was allocating around $360 million to address highpriority needs for hurricane ravaged regions but unfortunately while many projects have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, no action has been take to clear these projects. I call on Director Mulvaney to take immediate action on these needs so OMB won’t stand as a roadblock to protecting my constituents as we enter a new hurricane season. I’d like to thank my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure committee for crafting a Water Resources Development Act that addresses these pressing issues and urge my colleagues to support the bill. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–72, shall be considered as adopted, and shall be considered as an original bill for purpose of further amendment under the 5minute rule. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: H.R. 8 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . GIBBS  
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, it is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part A of House Report 115– 711. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 9, line 17, insert ‘‘, if determined necessary after taking into account all relevant factors (including past successful project completion)’’ before the semicolon. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to introduce my amendment to H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act, to provide the Army Corps of Engineers greater flexibility and the ability to use a variety of factors in determining financial assurances with respect to section 404 permitted projects. The Army Corps currently has considerable discretion at the district level on whether to require financial assurance or a bond of unauthorized projects. This includes a firm source of funding from a project or its history of successful completion of projects. The exclusion of this relevant data in determining a financial assurance requirement has led to uneven application of the Corps discretion at the district levels. As a result, regulatory and financial requirements can be uncertain for even one private entity from Corps district to Corps district. My amendment will give a more uniform framework with a wider scope of factors used in determining the financial mitigation requirements for a 404 project. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment for regulatory certainty, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield to my colleague from Louisiana, GARRET  GRAVES . Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is an important amendment in that it tries to ensure that mitigation banks and other types of mitigation mechanisms are viable options to be able to build projects. In some cases, you have unavoidable impacts. We need to be able to have options to mitigate for those impacts so we can truly build projects. I commend the gentleman from Ohio for raising this issue, for bringing this up. I do think that we need to continue working on refining the text a little bit and working together in a bipartisan manner with our friends on the other side of the aisle to get this to a place where everyone can agree. Again, I think it is an important issue for us to address to ensure that mitigation credits are actually accessible, and I want to see if the gentleman will be willing to withdraw the amendment with the understanding that we are going to work with him to ensure that we can address this issue moving forward through the legislative process. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I think, with the comments from the subcommittee chairman and the chairman’s willingness to work through this as we go through the process, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . SOTO 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, it is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part A of House Report 115– 711. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 8, line 7, insert ‘‘water storage,’’ after ‘‘aquifer recharge,’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chair, my amendment directs the Secretary of the Army to consider water storage when carrying out a water resource development feasibility study. Section 109 requires the Secretary to consult with local governments and integrate their water management plans when developing a water resource development feasibility study. My amendment would include consideration of water storage when developing these studies. Water storage is an essential tool that many States use to take full advantage of their water resources. In Florida, we receive over 50 inches of rain annually; however, we don’t always get the rain where we need it. Water may be moved for flood control or water supply. For example, from November 1, 2017, through June 4, 2018, the South Florida Water Management District moved approximately 151 billion gallons of water from Lake Okeechobee to preserve optimal levels for the ecosystem. In my own congressional district, our water management district uses water storage to maintain maximum levels in Lake Toho. Additionally, these storage areas provide wetland habitat to many endangered species. Water storage is important and should be a consideration when studying water resources feasibility. Mr. Chairman, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. This amendment clarifies the section on integrating the water resources planning to our bill and will help communities and the Corps work in partnership, and I am prepared to accept the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, again, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . ROYCE OF  
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to the order of the House today, it is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part A of House Report 115– 711. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Section 1043(b) of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2201 note) is amended— (1) in paragraph (3)(A)(i)— (A) in the matter preceding subclause (I)— (i) by striking ‘‘15’’ and inserting ‘‘20’’; and (ii) by striking ‘‘prior to the date of enactment of this Act’’; (B) in subclause (I)— (i) in the matter preceding item (aa), by inserting ‘‘that have been authorized for construction prior to the date of enactment of this Act and’’ after ‘‘not more than 12 projects’’; and (ii) in item (bb), by striking ‘‘; and’’ and inserting a semicolon; (C) in subclause (II)— (i) by inserting ‘‘that have been authorized for construction prior to the date of enactment of this Act and’’ after ‘‘not more than 3 projects’’; and (ii) by striking the semicolon and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and (D) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(III) not more than 5 projects that have been authorized for construction, but did not receive the authorization prior to the date of enactment of this Act;’’; and (2) in subsection (b)(8) by striking ‘‘2015 through 2019’’ and inserting ‘‘2019 through 2023’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Chairman, let me start by just thanking the chairman of this committee, and I thank his committee for working with me on my proposed changes and for including an additional amendment in the manager’s package. The amendment before us expands the number of projects eligible under the nonFederal implementation pilot program, and, as you know, the pilot program was established by WRDA in 2014. What it does is, it allows projects that can demonstrate greater cost effectiveness, greater efficiency to receive direct funding. Savings from this program then go toward either deficit reduction and other Corps projects. So the original pilot allowed for 15 projects. This expands the program to allow for a total of 32 projects. These projects will need to be authorized and meet the criteria under the program, and if more projects qualify under this pilot, it has the potential to save taxpayers more money. Mr. Chairman, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes additional changes to the pilot program that we authorized in WRDA 2014 for nonFederal implementation of Corps projects. This amendment will allow future projects to be included in the program. I appreciate my colleague’s work on this issue, and I am prepared to accept the amendment at this time. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . ROYCE OF  
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, it is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part A of House Report 115– 711. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Mr. KEATING to offer amendment No. 5. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Insert after section 122 the following (and renumber subsequent sections and the table of contents accordingly): 
Section 22(a)(1) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1962d 16(a)(1)) is amended to read as follows: ‘‘(1) COMPREHENSIVE PLANS .—The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is authorized to cooperate with any State, group of States, nonFederal interest working with a State or group of States, or regional coalition of governmental entities in the preparation of comprehensive plans for the development, utilization, and conservation of the water and related resources of drainage basins, watersheds, or ecosystems located within the boundaries of such State, interest, or entity, including 
plans to comprehensively address water resources challenges, and to submit to Congress reports and recommendations with respect to appropriate Federal participation in carrying out such plans.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Chairman, this particular amendment would expand the Army Corps of Engineers’ authorization to permit cooperation with regional coalitions who are seeking to create or improve water infrastructure in their areas. The amendment today would help achieve the goal by encouraging towns and counties to create partnerships with the Army Corps so they can pursue creative solutions to local infrastructure needs and they can do this together. The reason for it is because watersheds do not follow municipal or even State boundaries, as we know, so it is regional approaches like the project in Mr. KEATING ’s district that provide effective and efficient solutions. So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for offering this amendment. This amendment clarifies the Army Corps’ authority to provide assistance to regional coalitions under certain planning provisions. This is a good fix to the assistance program, and I am prepared to accept the amendment at this time. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MR . DENHAM  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 30, strike lines 15 and 16 and insert the following: (1) by striking paragraph (3) and redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as paragraphs (3) and (4), respectively; and Page 30, line 17, strike ‘‘paragraph (5)’’ and insert ‘‘paragraph (4), as so redesignated’’. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, the DenhamCosta amendment makes permanent authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to enter cost recovery agreements for evaluation and processing of permits for public utility, natural gas companies, and railroad carriers. The goal of this policy known as section 214 is to modernize the evaluation of permits to ensure critical infrastructure projects can be delivered to the public. This policy can benefit the Central Valley, Napa, Sonoma, and other disaster stricken areas by allowing them to rebuild faster so families can turn on their lights and cool their homes. I urge support of its passage, and I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ), my cosponsor. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to also thank the ranking member and the chair of the committee for allowing us to work with the committee for what is an important amendment. The DenhamCosta amendment would make permanent the existing authority for utility companies to contribute to funds to expedite permit reviews for the Army Corps of Engineers. b1545 Expedited permit review reduces project costs and enhances public safety by ensuring that projects are completed faster. It just makes good sense. Projects could benefit from this permanent authority include work to stabilize aging transmission line towers in the San Francisco Bay, replacing natural gas transmission lines over and under waterways, and restoring water delivery systems associated with hydroelectric facilities. A lot of good has come from this amendment. It has broad support from the utility industry and labor unions. I thank the author of this amendment for his good cooperation, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MS . ESTY OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 32, line 16, strike ‘‘and’’. Page 32, line 21, strike the period and insert ‘‘; and’’. Page 32, after line 21, insert the following: (6) an analysis of whether or not the Army Corps of Engineers— (A) considers cumulative benefits of locally developed projects, including Master Plans approved by the Corps; and (B) uses the benefits referred to in subparagraph (A) for purposes of benefitcost analysis for project justification for potential projects within such Master Plans. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which calls for a study on how the Army Corps of Engineers evaluates projects to advance flood control, hurricane and storm damage reduction, and promote water quality. I thank my colleague, Mr. BABIN, for his work on this amendment with me, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their hard work and collegiality in bringing this bill forward with us today. The study in my amendment will look at how the Corps currently calculates the benefits of potential projects and how they can improve the calculation so that more worthwhile projects are approved. Specifically, the amendment tasks the National Academy of Sciences to study whether or not the Corps calculates the total benefits of a Corps project and considers them in evaluating the cost benefit of smaller segments or projects within that larger project. At the moment, it is unclear if the Corps can or cannot do this. Can the Corps count the benefits of a larger overall project and apply them to the benefit cost of a smaller segment of that, that is smaller in scope? Can the Corps always measure individual pieces of a project for justification purposes? These are questions that need real answers. Mr. Chairman, I raise this amendment today because this is a problem that affects cities and towns in my State and, frankly, across the country. In Connecticut, we have rivers that crisscross the State, leaving many of our communities subject to flooding. Over the last 150 years, the city of Meriden has experienced 11 100year floods, and the two most recent in the 1990s caused $26 million of property damage. The good news is that this flooding is preventable by implementing flood prevention and mitigation efforts, which will protect life and property. The city of Meriden has been working for 20 years on trying to get help from the Federal Government. It came to the Corps looking for help. At this 
point, it has completed many portions of this project. It came to the Corps to ask for help with a feasibility study. They were told they could not. The Corps said, We cannot look at that because we can only look at this segment, we can’t look at the benefit of the overall project. This is not serving our community well, and it is, frankly, not serving other communities well either. So we want to ask the National Academy of Sciences to look at the overall benefit. Budgets are tight. Everybody is bringing something to the table. Cities and States and the Federal Government need to do its charge. So we are asking this body to approve this measure to have the National Academy of Sciences look at, in fact, what does the Corps do, how can they do it better, and how can they leverage together the resources to help our cities and towns? I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it will be very useful to know what the Corps, in fact, does in each and every district, and then, together, find a better way to move forward. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks to provide better information to the Congress, to Federal agencies, and to public entities all over the United States to ensure that we understand the value of investments that we are making, to ensure that we understand the return on investment that we are making with public funds at the State and Federal levels. Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentlewoman from Connecticut and I commend the gentleman from Texas for bringing this issue up. I think that there is much we can do to perfect the cost of benefit ratio process and information provided to the Congress to where we can make informed decisions to ensure that we are appropriately using the limited taxpayer resources that we have. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 9 OFFERED BY MR . SOTO 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 36, line 8, insert ‘‘universities,’’ after ‘‘research and development centers,’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment adds universities to the list of entities the Secretary of the Army Corps of Engineers should consider when submitting their report to Congress on the use of innovative materials in water resource development projects. Section 128 requires the Secretary of the Army to submit to Congress a report that describes the activities of various entities involved in the development of innovative materials for water development projects. Currently, as written, the bill mentions centers of expertise, technological centers, technical centers, research and development centers, and other similar centers. Universities are often at the cutting edge of research and, therefore, should be specified for consideration in preparing the report. While the current language could already include universities in the category of ‘‘other similar centers,’’ such consideration would be discretionary. As such, a relevant area of activity may not be considered for the report because a single word was not added to the text. As Members of Congress, we ask for reports and recommendations from government entities so their expertise can be utilized in assisting the legislative process. Here, the activities conducted at universities should be considered so we can best capture the relevant information on the testing, research, development, and identification to best inform the Army Corps report and their congressional recommendations to resources development projects. Mr. Chairman, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment adds universities to the list of organizations studying innovative materials that is already in our bill, but I am prepared to accept this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. SHUSTER for his support, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 10 OFFERED BY MR . 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 36, line 23, strike ‘‘and’’. Page 36, after line 23, insert the following (and renumber the subsequent paragraph accordingly): (2) provides recommendations to improve the capacity and preparedness of the Corps of Engineers workforce; and 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In order to successfully implement the many water infrastructure and conservation projects authorized under the Water Resources Development Act, Americans rely on the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps has approximately 37,000 dedicated civilians and military personnel delivering engineering services. They operate and maintain 13,000 miles of commercial ship channels, 12,000 miles of inland waterways, 700 dams, and have built 14,500 levees and works on more than 900 harbors. Thus, our ability to build a robust infrastructure, to develop resources, and to implement environmentally conscious conservation projects, is inextricably linked to the strength of the Corps of Engineers’ workforce. We should be doing everything we can to help the Army Corps of Engineers recruit, hire, and retain qualified employees to carry out duties that impact environmental sustainability and national security. My amendment addresses this issue by requiring the comptroller general to provide recommendations to improve the capacity and preparedness of the Army Corps of Engineers’ workforce in its report to Congress. In providing these recommendations, the comptroller general will evaluate many challenges, including, but not limited to, diversity, recruitment, retention, and onthejob training. I offer this amendment at a time when the national skills gap is at a recordhigh level. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 6.7 million unfilled jobs across the country, where employers have openings but can’t find prospective employees with the adequate skills or training to fill them. Nearly 600,000 of these jobs are in government services alone. Despite bipartisan efforts to address this issue, the skills gap continues to rise each month, up from 6.1 million this time in 2017. We need to do better. 
I am confident that my amendment will help develop a 21st century Corps of Engineers workforce, which will, ultimately, benefit infrastructure, national security, environmental sustainability, and the overall American economy. Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. This amendment adds additional recommendations to a GAO study on workforce capacity. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. SHUSTER for his support. Just this morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that there are currently more job openings than people looking for work. This amendment is an important step to closing the skills gap, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 11 OFFERED BY MS . JAYAPAL  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 36, line 23, strike ‘‘; and’’ and insert a semicolon. Page 37, line 4, strike the period and insert ‘‘; and’’. Page 37, after line 4, insert the following: (3) describes how changes to the navigation industry workforce with which the Corps of Engineers collaborates may affect safety and operations within the navigation industry. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which simply adds an important aspect to a GAO study that is already in the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member D EFAZIOfor their leadership in crafting this bill, and also my friend on the other side of the aisle, Representative WOODALL , for his support as well. b1600 The underlying bill directs GAO to report to Congress on the preparedness of the Army Corps of Engineers to truly make it a 21st century agency. The study will investigate how the Corps of Engineers is supporting efforts to invest in recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce. It will examine how the Corps of Engineers is coping with the steady trickle of the baby boomer generation retiring, and it will also look at the Corps of Engineers and how it can better utilize available and existing technologies in fulfilling its mission. At the same time, Mr. Chairman, it is important for us to understand how the Corps of Engineers’ primary partner in the delivery of its services, the navigation industry workforce, is also managing the impending retirements of the baby boomer generation. We need to get a grasp on what the Corps of Engineers needs to do to prepare for the graying not only of its workforce, but also the workforce of the maritime and shipping sectors. What is more, it is critical to understand how all of this has a bearing on safety and operations within the navigation industry. Mr. Chairman, in my home State of Washington, the average age of a maritime worker is 54 years old. And while the maritime sector is growing at a rate of 6.4 percent a year, there is a so called silver tsunami looming in the next 5 to 10 years. The industries that the Corps of Engineers intimately works with are expected to be fighting to fill open positions even more than they are now. That is why, Mr. Chairman, my amendment directs GAO to make these additional considerations as it conducts its study. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to control the time in opposition to the amendment, although I do not oppose it. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment. This amendment adds additional considerations to a GAO study that we have included in our bill. I believe looking at navigation safety is an important addition. Mr. Chair, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman SHUSTER very much for accepting the amendment, and I urge support. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. HOLDING ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MR . SOTO 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 38, line 3, after ‘‘storm damage reduction’’ insert ‘‘(including trough bars, coastal wetlands, and barrier coral reefs)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be modified by striking ‘‘line 3’’ and inserting ‘‘line 2’’. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I object to the modification. The Acting CHAIR. Objection is heard. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chair, my amendment would direct the GAO study in section 130 to specifically consider trough bars, coastal wetlands, and barrier reefs in their study on the feasibility of natural features projects for the purposes of flood risk management, hurricane and storm damage reduction, and ecosystem restoration. Section 130 directs the Comptroller General to submit to the Congress a study of consideration by the Corps of Engineers of natural features and naturebased features in the study of the feasibility of projects for flood risk management, hurricane and storm damage reduction, and ecosystem restoration. Specifically, one aspect of the GAO study of consideration in H.R. 8 asks for an assessment of the costs, benefits, impacts, and tradeoffs associated with natural features and naturebased features, as well as the effectiveness of such features. My amendment specifies some of the natural features and naturebased features that could and should be considered by adding the language: ‘‘(including trough bars, coastal wetlands, and barrier coral reefs)’’. In my home State of Florida, we are no stranger to the issue associated with national features and the role they play in storm damage reduction, especially after the devastating effects of last year’s hurricane season, but this is by no means a Floridaspecific issue. Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm 
Sandy showed us firsthand what happens when natural flood protection features do not exist. This amendment would serve to highlight important natural infrastructure options to the GAO study, namely, trough bars, coastal wetlands, and barrier coral reefs were specified with storm damage reduction concerns in mind. These natural structures buffer shorelines against waves, storms, and floods, which help prevent loss of life, property damage, and erosion. For example, trough bars and sand dunes provide substantial protection from storminduced erosion. The larger the trough bar, the more time it takes to be eroded by waves and the more protection it provides areas further landward. Coastal wetlands lower flood heights, filter floodwater, and protect from storm surges. Coral reefs reduce wave energy by an average of 97 percent, dissipating disproportionately more wave energy as wave energy increased. Taken together, these natural features would reduce storm damage and are items that would be specifically evaluated in the GAO study. Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering the amendment as he originally intended. I understand he has some conforming and technical corrections he would like to make. We want to work with the gentleman as we move forward. We are willing to accept what he has offered today. Again, as we move through the process, we will work with the gentleman. Mr. Chair, I am prepared to accept his amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman SHUSTER for his support. The technical amendment was advised to us by the Parliamentarian. I thank the chairman again for his support. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . SANFORD  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 40, line 21, strike ‘‘in lieu of’’ and insert ‘‘or’’. Page 41, line 1, strike ‘‘in lieu of’’ and insert ‘‘or’’. Page 41, line 16, insert ‘‘or reimbursement of funds of an equivalent amount, subject to the availability of appropriations’’ before the period. Page 41, line 21, strike the closing quotation marks and the second period. Page 41, after line 21, insert the following: ‘‘(c) APPLICATION OF REIMBURSEMENT .—At the request of the nonFederal interest, the Secretary may apply such funds, subject to the availability of appropriations, equal to the share of the cost of the nonFederal interest of carrying out other flood damage reduction and coastal navigation projects or studies.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, this is a bipartisan amendment that I wrote with Members DELANEY , DUNCAN , and others, and I think it simply makes common sense. What it does is that it ensures the timely payback of advanced funds to a nonFederal sponsor. What does that mean in English? What that means is that we have a program called the advanced project agreements wherein you have a Federal actor and a local actor, and it can be that the local actor advances funds to speed the project’s completion. What this amendment says is, if you have advanced beyond more than your share, then you, on a timely basis, would be paid back for more than your share. Now, why is that important? If we are going to be competitive as a country, what we need to recognize is that, indeed, time is money. One of the things most critical to improving our water resources is timely completion of these projects. So this is ultimately about recognizing that time is money; recognizing that, to be competitive, we have got to speed the progress that we see on these kinds of projects; and, in fact, it ties to what we all know about competitiveness. I mean, getting things done means a bias for action; it means not waiting on others; it means showing initiative; it means, if you go the extra mile, you get rewarded for it. Let me give one quick example. In the port in Charleston, it is a $558 million project. The Federal share is $287 million; the nonFederal share is $271 million. In the case of South Carolina, they have gone ahead and saved, if you will, in their piggy bank $300 million. If they advance the entire $300 million, are they just out of luck or are they held to the original agreement of this is the Federal share and this is the State share, and therefore, even if you advance that money, you are going to get that additional $29 million back? That, to me, makes imminent common sense, because most of all what it does is it recognizes that time is money, and allowing local actors to move more quickly and not wait on Federal activity is something in all of our respective best interests. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlemen from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. The amendment clarifies repayment requirements for funding advanced by a nonFederal sponsor. This is a good bipartisan amendment. I am prepared to accept the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman SHUSTER for agreeing to the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ). The amendment was agreed to.

At the end of title I, add the following: 
It is the sense of Congress that the construction of a new lock at the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, is vital to our national economy, national security, and national need for new critical infrastructure. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. NOLAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I would be remiss if I didn’t thank Chairman SHUSTER for his leadership on this important legislation, subcommittee Chairwoman NAPOLITANO and the other members of the committee and the staff as well. Mr. Chair, my amendment is pretty straightforward. It simply expresses a sense of the Congress that the construction of a new lock at the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, is vital to our national economy, to our national security, and to our vital infrastructure. Why? Well, really briefly, that lock is a gateway for the Port of Duluth and all of the commerce out of Lake Superior. That is the iron ore; that is the corn; that is the soybeans; that is the forest products, all of which are essential to our national security, our national economy. 
I would just cite one thing. Homeland Security did a study. They found that 13 percent of the Nation’s gross national product goes through those locks, which is why we have military protection there; because if those locks fail from a military attack or if they fail from obsolescence, which we are in danger of having occur, it would throw the country into a great depression. So let me just conclude by saying that these locks and the rebuilding of them are vital to our national security, our national economy, and our vital important infrastructure. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for offering the amendment. The amendment expresses a Sense of Congress that construction of a new lock at the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, is vital to our national economy, national security, and national need for new critical infrastructure. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for bringing this to our attention, and I am prepared to accept the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NOLAN.

At the end of title I, insert the following: 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Corps of Engineers shall make efforts— (1) as part of the mission of the Corps, to identify and address with respect to covered communities any disproportionate and adverse health or environmental effects of the Corps’ programs, policies, practices, and activities; (2) to promote the meaningful involvement of communities of color in the Corps’ project development and implementation, enforcement efforts, and other activities; (3) to provide guidance and technical assistance to covered communities to increase understanding of the Corps’ project planning and management activities, regulations, and policies; and (4) to cooperate with State, Tribal, and local governments with respect to activities carried out pursuant to this subsection. (b) DEFINITIONS .—In this section, the following definitions apply: (1) COMMUNITY OF COLOR .—The term ‘‘community of color’’ means a community of individuals who are— (A) American Indian or Alaska Native; (B) Asian or Pacific Islander; (C) Black, not of Hispanic origin; or (D) Hispanic. (2) COVERED COMMUNITY .—The term ‘‘covered community’’ means each of the following: (A) A community of color. (B) A lowincome community. (C) A rural community. (D) A Tribal and indigenous community. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and madam ranking member. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment to this critical bill, which authorizes billions of dollars in Corps projects. My amendment is very simple. I can keep it short. It would reaffirm the need for the Army Corps to make every effort to ensure, as part of their project planning and implementation process, the fair treatment of all communities in this vital process. Mr. Chair, this amendment addresses the continuing concern that certain vulnerable communities affected by Federal actions often have little to no input into the planning and implementation of those activities, and they include lowincome communities, both urban and rural, communities of color, and other marginalized groups such as Tribes. By adopting my amendment, the Army Corps could lead in reforming how Federal agencies engage with vulnerable communities by working collaboratively with community stakeholders, by outreach, proactive outreach, and requiring really meaningful involvement and conversations with these communities of color, including Tribal communities, engaging them in developing Corps development of the projects and implementation. b1615 I would ask that no one would object to requiring that the Corps spend more time listening to and validating community concerns and working to resolve them collaboratively at every step of the process, rather than waiting until a lawsuit occurs. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not intend to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment. This amendment helps ensure that, as part of the Corps’ activities and mission, they are actively engaged with communities of color, lowincome communities, rural communities, and Tribes. This is important policy. I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

At the end of title I, add the following: 
The Secretary of the Army shall prioritize the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure, improve its reliability, and, as necessary, improve its resilience to cyber related threats. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, the WRDA bill is an important bipartisan piece of legislation that provides for improvements to our Nation’s water resources infrastructure, including ports and inland waterways, locks, dams, flood protection, and ecosystem restoration. Mr. Chairman, I want to applaud my good friend, Chairman SHUSTER , for his leadership on moving forward with yet another WRDA bill through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee; and I am so proud to serve on that committee under his leadership. But seldom in Congress do things actually end up being like they were promised; and I can tell you, under the leadership of this chairman, not only are we voting on yet another WRDA bill, but we are doing it in a transparent, policyfocused manner. And it is this return to regular order that the chairman has truly encouraged so many of his members, not only on the committee, but off the committee. Mr. Chairman, my amendment adds one provision to this important bill: It directs the Secretary of the Army to prioritize the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure and improve their reliability. The last thing the taxpayers want to do is spend needlessly money on expensive new infrastructure if the existing roadways, highways, bridges, ports, airports, water and sewer systems are aging and in disrepair. We have heard all of this before from a number of our stakeholders and, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, if America fails to invest in its existing ailing infrastructure by 2025, the U.S. economy can be 
expected to lose almost $4 trillion in Gross Domestic Product, resulting in a loss of some 2.5 million jobs. Therefore, as we look at this legislation, it is critically important that we repair, rebuild, and modernize the infrastructure we have. I urge support of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman explained, this is an important amendment. Cyberrelated threats are a major concern to the Nation’s critical infrastructure, and I believe this will help ensure that it is protected. I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 17 OFFERED BY MR . MAST  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 17 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. MAST. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title I, add the following: 
(a) WRDA 2000.—Section 601(e)(5)(B) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–541) is amended to read as follows: ‘‘(B) WORK.—The Secretary may provide credit, including inkind credit, toward the nonFederal share for the reasonable cost of any work performed in connection with a study, preconstruction engineering and design, or construction that is necessary for the implementation of the Plan if— ‘‘(i)(I) the credit is provided for work completed during the period of design, as defined in a design agreement between the Secretary and the nonFederal sponsor; ‘‘(II) the credit is provided for work completed during the period of construction, as defined in a project cooperation agreement for an authorized project between the Secretary and the nonFederal sponsor; ‘‘(III) the credit is provided for work carried out before the date of the partnership agreement between the Secretary and the nonFederal sponsor, as defined in an agreement between the Secretary and the non Federal sponsor providing for such credit; or ‘‘(IV) the credit is provided for work carried out by the nonFederal sponsor in the implementation of an authorized project implementation report, and such work was defined in an agreement between the Secretary and the nonFederal sponsor prior to the execution of such work; ‘‘(ii) the agreement prescribes the terms and conditions of the credit, including in the case of credit provided under clause (i)(iii) conditions relating to design and construction; and ‘‘(iii) the Secretary determines that the work performed by the nonFederal sponsor is integral to the project.’’. (b) TIMING .—Section 601(e)(5) of the Act referred to in subsection (a) is further amended by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following (and redesignating any subparagraphs accordingly): ‘‘(C) TIMING .—In any case in which the Secretary approves credit under subparagraph (B), in writing or by electronic agreement with the nonFederal sponsor, the Secretary shall provide such credit for work completed during the period of construction under an agreement that prescribes the terms and conditions for the inkind contributions not expressly defined.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. MAST. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the chairman, Chairman SHUSTER , and the committee for all of their work on WRDA. It has been timely, and they have been a joy to work with. WRDA 2000, however, authorized a plan known as the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and it granted the authority to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works to provide credit to the State of Florida for reasonable cost of any work that was performed toward the completion of the project. However, current law does have some ambiguity that my amendment clarifies with respect to when the work is performed. Now, the Army Corps ultimately has the discretion to determine what work performed by Florida is integral to the project, and this amendment makes no change to that discretion whatsoever. Questions have been raised with regard to the scope of the Army Corps’ authority to grant credit for work Florida has done that is not explicitly stated in the Project Partnership Agreement. My amendment clarifies that, so long as the Secretary and Florida agree that the work completed during the construction phase is integral to the project, the Secretary does, in fact, have the authority to provide credit for that work that is done. I appreciate the full committee and the subcommittee’s leadership working with me on this language, and I encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment does clarify there were crediting responsibilities between the Corps and nonFederal sponsors in the Everglades, so I thank the gentleman for bringing this to our attention. I am prepared to accept the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MAST. Mr. Chairman, again I applaud the committee on their work, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 18 OFFERED BY MR . PEARCE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title I, add the following: 
Not later than September 30 of the first fiscal year following the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall pay the outstanding balance of the Federal cost share for any project carried out under section 593 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 (113 Stat. 380). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, before I start, I would like to join my colleague from North Carolina in recognizing the leadership of Chairman SHUSTER on this important bill and the manner in which it is brought forward with full amendment process allowed. My amendment is fairly simple. It simply asks that the Corps of Engineers would pay their bills. The Corps of Engineers, according to an authorization under WRDA of 1999, is allowed to enter into projects where a cost share is joined in with communities and organizations throughout the States. Many locations in New Mexico are still owed money for projects that were commissioned over a decade ago. The town of Bernalillo, the city of Rio Rancho, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, and the county of Bernalillo all have projects that are owed money. One of those projects, a simple arsenic treatment facility, cost $12 million. The Corps and the community both agreed that they would move forward with the project and the cost sharing agreement. A decade later, the Corps still owes money on that particular project. At one point, the Corps expressed they had forgotten that they owed that money; so it is just important for the government to pay its bills on time. This amendment is fairly simple and straightforward. It just authorizes that and ensures it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires the Secretary to pay the Federal cost share for projects in Central New Mexico. I appreciate the gentleman bringing it to our attention, and I am prepared to accept the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 19 OFFERED BY MR . KELLY OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 19 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title I, insert the following: 
The Corps of Engineers may consider, in making funding determinations with respect to the operation and maintenance of locks on the Allegheny River— (1) recreational boat traffic levels; and (2) related economic benefits. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to acknowledge Chairman SHUSTER ’s leadership on this, and thank the entire committee and all the staff. I sure appreciate all the hard work. This amendment allows the Army Corps of Engineers to strongly consider the large number of recreational boats that use the locks on the Allegheny River in my district when prioritizing operation and maintenance projects. River communities on the Allegheny, like Kittanning, Ford City, Freeport, East Brady, and others, rely on recreational boating for their economic wellbeing. In recent years, the Army Corps of Engineers and a local nonprofit, the Allegheny River Development Corporation, have developed a successful privatepublic partnership. Their partnership has resulted in private money being raised to keep the locks operational only on summer weekends and for recreational use. This amendment will allow the Army Corps of Engineers the flexibility it needs to help keep the locks open throughout the summer tourism months once again. Speaking on this issue, a commissioner in Armstrong County once said to me: ‘‘You know, Washington has taken away our coal jobs, now they’re trying to take away our river.’’ Because of the hard work of people like Linda Hemmes and other community leaders, the river is still open to thousands of boaters who enjoy the Allegheny River on summer weekends. But even the weekend lock operations are still very much at risk, and it is my hope that this amendment will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize funding so the river remains passable all summer long for decades to come. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman explained, the Allegheny River, the locks, and the dams are, again, used considerably for recreational boat traffic, and the Corps should take this into consideration. This is a good amendment. I am prepared to accept it. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ). The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank Chairman SHUSTER , Ranking Member DEFAZIO, Subcommittee Chairman GRAVES , and Ranking Member NAPOLITANO , and their staffs for working with us on this amendment. The amendment simply provides communities with the certainty that the Army Corps has the authority to help them mitigate any detrimental impacts to municipal water supplies that may happen due to a Corps construction project. It is a commonsense amendment, and I am glad to offer it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I don’t plan to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Louisiana is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, this amendment assures the Corps of Engineers can help mitigate any detrimental impacts to the water supply as a result of a Corps of Engineers project. I appreciate my colleague’s work on this, and I do accept this amendment and urge support of the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 21 OFFERED BY MS . JAYAPAL  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 21 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title I, add the following: 
Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the potential opportunity for integrating noise abatement and noise mitigation technologies and practices into improvements and operations in harbors and inland harbors. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington. b1630 Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which simply asks the Corps of Engineers to explore what opportunities exist to incorporate noise abatement and noise mitigation technologies and practices in the Corps of Engineers. Noise has a bearing both on the land and in water, and as maritime transportation and travel increase and as vessels increase in size, communities along our Nation’s waterways stand to be affected the most. Seattle’s residential population and our maritime sector are both growing. And importantly, the liveability of our communities and the strength of our maritime sector will depend on how we address the challenges that come with that growth. At the same time, as sound travels more efficiently in the water, we need to be certain that we understand how we minimize the disruption to maritime environments. 
Underwater wildlife—like the endangered southern residents, orcas—are especially vulnerable to noise destruction, because they are so dependent on underwater sounds for basic life functions. The Port of Vancouver, BC, recently investigated whether limiting the speed of ships would reduce noise and help our overall community. Over the period of the study, ambient noise dropped 44 percent. So research into this area is emerging, but it is clear that more needs to be done. In providing guidance to mitigate noise in 2014, the International Maritime Organization identified more than just speed, but also ship design, on board machinery, and navigation as factors to take into consideration. In the Puget Sound region, the Corps of Engineers is uniquely placed to lead this effort and unite stakeholders behind solutions that protect the maritime environment, ensure the liveability of our communities, and support our growing maritime sector. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment that requires a study for the use of noise abatement technologies at ports. I think this is a good amendment, and I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman very much and I urge support. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 22 OFFERED BY MR . HIGGINS OF  
The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. L OVE). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 22 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title I the following: 
(a) I NGENERAL .—In requiring or acquiring an interest in land, the Secretary shall, in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, prefer the minimum interest in real property necessary to support a project or action. (b) DETERMINATION .—In determining the proper interest in land under subsection (a), the Secretary shall first consider a temporary easement estate or other interest designed to reduce the overall cost, reduce the time, and minimize conflict with property owners related to such action or project. (c) PROCEDURES USED IN STATE .—The Sec retary shall consider and attempt to replicate, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal laws, the procedures that a State has used to acquire interests in land, provided that such procedures are generally consistent with the goals of a project or action. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment to H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. Madam Chair, my amendment is a commonsense and cost savings amendment that would allow the Army Corps of Engineers muchneeded flexibility when acquiring certain rights to the procurement of land. Specifically, it would direct the Secretary to prefer acquiring the minimum interest necessary in real property needed to support a project or an action. This allows flexibilities for the Corps to consider the use of a temporary easement estate or other interest to facilitate a reduction in overall project cost, to reduce project time, and minimize conflict with property owners related to the project or action. This approach will allow the Corps to take a more sensible approach to projects and not force the Federal Government to purchase more property in order to undertake critically needed projects. Historically, in my home State of Louisiana, many of the projects are accomplished through partnerships between the Federal Government and State and private landowners who often can offer more favorable and economical terms than the Federal Government’s outright purchasing of property. As we have heard throughout debate on the underlying bill, there are countless and widely known deficiencies in the way business is conducted by the Corps. Many of these issues are caused by bureaucratic regulations that get in the way of real progress being made in a manner that is responsible to the taxpayers we represent. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I don’t plan to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, I want to thank my friend from Louisiana, a colleague, for offering this amendment. As the gentleman stated, what is happening right now, the Corps of Engineers is requiring nonFederal entities, like the State of Louisiana and other States around the country and other private partners and local governments to acquire land in fee title, and then that is then absorbed as part of the overall cost of a project. In many cases in our home State, 82 percent of coastal Louisiana is owned by private landowners. These landowners are willing to donate the project, servitude or easement to ensure these projects can be built. And these are environmental projects for coastal restoration and other wetland constructiontype projects. It reduces overall project cost. It incentivizes cooperation between landowners and government entities trying to restore the coast. This is in the best interest of taxpayers. It is in the best interest of the Corps of Engineers. It is absolutely good policy, and I want to thank the gentleman for the amendment. I urge adoption of the amendment. Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam Chairwoman, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for supporting the bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense amendment, as well as final passage of the chairman’s bill. Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 23 OFFERED BY MR . BABIN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 23 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. BABIN. Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title I the following: 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) high use Federal navigation projects, including those with numerous deep draft vessel calls per year, should ensure safe 2 way traffic by design vessels recommended by authorized navigation studies; and (2) the Secretary should consider the benefits of the safety modification or improvement to commercial navigation in evaluating such modifications or improvements. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BABIN. Madam Chairwoman, I thank the chairman of the committee. As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee who has the 
great privilege to represent four Texas ports in my district in Texas, it is truly an honor to offer this amendment today on their behalf. Right now, the Corps of Engineers is in the midst of a study of the Houston Ship Channel to evaluate potential improvements. This study will examine the process for widening the channel and extending the 45foot depth further inland. This is a necessary and wellintentioned study for an extremely worthy project. However, everyone involved in producing it is discovering that the Corps processes involved are outdated and inefficient. These processes are unable to adequately evaluate the national benefits of the improvements being studied or the implications of major operational changes in the future. As a result, unless reforms are made, this Corps study and others like it will not recognize the benefits of widening a waterway like the Houston Ship Channel in certain areas; areas that can lead to a restriction of oneway traffic in the future, as vessels become larger and larger over time. The Houston Ship Channel is the busiest waterway in the Nation. It supports the top exporting region and the largest petrochemical manufacturing center in the United States. Ensuring an efficient waterway now and into the future is critical for the region, for the State of Texas, and for the Nation. This amendment takes a first step in righting this process by having this Congress to make clear to the Army Corps of Engineers the importance and the benefits of projects to improve two way traffic safety in highvolume areas in deep draft navigation channels. And while I certainly want to go further and eventually get these formulas fixed into the law, I understand that this needs to be an incremental process. I want to thank Chairmen SHUSTER  and GRAVES , and Ranking Members DEFAZIO and N APOLITANO , and their staffs, for working with us to get this process underway with this very commonsense amendment. Madam Chairwoman, I urge adoption of my amendment and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I don’t plan to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, this amendment intends to cut through the bureaucracy to expedite decisions that are being made. In the case of this amendment, it is designed to address an issue in Texas where you have highvolume port projects and there are safety and navigational improvements that are needed. We support the intent of the gentleman’s amendment to cut through the bureaucracy to ensure that decisions are expedited and cost savings result, and urge support of the amendment. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BABIN. Madam Chair, I also rise in strong support of amendment No. 8, by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY). I am very proud to be the lead Republican cosponsor. The Texas Gulf Coast is not just the export capital of the United States and energy capital of the world, it is a national treasure lined with vibrant communities, fisheries, key military assets, and outdoor recreation that millions call home. But as we saw with the 1900 Galveston hurricane; Hurricane Rita in 2005; Hurricane Ike in 2008; and Hurricane Harvey just last year, all of those great assets that I just spoke of are at risk of finding themselves literally in the eye of the very next storm. That is why leaders in my State have come together to produce this, the Texas Coastal Resiliency Master Plan, a roadmap for the local, State, and Federal officials to study and construct projects to keep our coastal communities safe, restore and preserve our beaches and wetlands, and provide energy security for all Americans. A summary of the Texas Coastal Resiliency Master Plan by the Texas General Land Office can be found at: http:// www.glo.texas.gov/coastalgrants/ projects/texascoastalresiliencymasterplan.html. Madam Chair, this amendment will require the National Academy of Sciences to study and report on whether the Army Corps should measure the cumulative benefit of a holistic plan like the Texas Coastal Resiliency Master Plan when determining benefitto cost ratios. I am confident that the answer will be yes. This study is an important step to get us there. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). The amendment was agreed to.

At the end of title I, add the following: 
(a) C OST BENEFIT AND SPECIAL CONDITIONS .—Section 5(a) of the Act of August 18, 1941 (55 Stat. 650, chapter 377; 33 U.S.C. 701n(a)), as amended by this Act, is further amended by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following: ‘‘(2) COST AND BENEFIT FEASIBILITY ASSESS MENT .— ‘‘(A) CONSIDERATION OF BENEFITS .—In pre paring a cost and benefit feasibility assessment for any emergency project described in paragraph (1), the Chief of Engineers shall consider the benefits to be gained by such project for the protection of— ‘‘(I) residential establishments; ‘‘(ii) commercial establishments, including the protection of inventory; and ‘‘(iii) agricultural establishments, including the protection of crops. ‘‘(B) SPECIAL CONDITIONS .— ‘‘(i) The Chief of Engineers may carry out repair or restoration work described in paragraph (1) that does not produce benefits greater than cost, if the nonFederal sponsor agrees to pay, or contribute to, an amount sufficient to make the remaining costs of the project equal to the estimated value of the benefits of the repair or restoration work and the Secretary determines the damage to the structure was not as a result of negligent operation and maintenance, and that repair of the project could benefit other Corps project missions. ‘‘(ii) NonFederal payments pursuant to clause (i) shall be in addition to any non Federal payments required by the Chief of Engineers which are applicable to the remaining costs of the repair or restoration work.’’. (b) CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY .— Nothwithstanding a nonFederal flood control work’s status in the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program, any unconstructed emergency project for the nonFederal flood control work that was formulated during the three fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which this Act was enacted but that was determined to not produce benefits greater than costs shall remain eligible for assistance under Section 5 of the Act of August 18, 1941 (55 Stat. 650, chapter 377; 33 U.S.C. 701n) until the last day of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year in which this Act was enacted if the nonFederal sponsor agrees, in accordance with section 5 as amended by subsection (a) of this section, to pay, or provide contributions equal to, an amount sufficient to make the remaining costs of the project equal to the estimated value of the benefits of the repair or restoration work and the Secretary determines the damage to the structure was not as a result of negligent operation and maintenance, and that repair of the project could benefit other Corps project missions. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. BOST. Madam Chair, I wish to thank Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for their support of the amendment. The purpose of this amendment is to help local communities recover from flood disasters. Under current law, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can only repair a nonFederal levee if the flood protection benefit outweighs the cost. However, the standard can’t always be met, especially in rural communities, with specific economic and demographic changes. b1645 The Len Small Levee in southern Illinois is a perfect example. The levee breached in the winter floods of January 2016. Several thousand acres of infrastructure and agriculture land were destroyed when the levee gave way. The Corps estimated the cost of repairing the levee would be higher than its 
flood protection benefits, leaving local residents with no recourse. My amendment provides new hope in my district and elsewhere. It allows local sponsors to pay the difference between the cost of repairing a levee and its projected flood protection benefits. My amendment does not increase the Federal Government’s share of the costs for repairs. Let me repeat that. My amendment does not increase the Federal Government’s share of the costs of the repairs. This is a fiscally responsible way to give a lifeline to rural communities struggling to rebuild after a disaster. The amendment is supported by the National Waterways Conference and the American Farm Bureau. Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I don’t plan to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, this amendment is designed to largely address, I think, a flaw that this underlying bill addresses in the costtobenefit ratio calculations used by the Corps of Engineers, by OMB, and others. This particular amendment is focused on emergency repairs. What this does is it allows the nonFederal entities to pay a higher nonFederal cost share for repairs to levees. There are many issues with how OMB and the Corps calculate costtobenefit ratios. This is a fix for emergency repairs while we work on the underlying bill for the larger fixes. Madam Chair, I want to thank Mr. BOSTfor offering this amendment. We are prepared to accept it. I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BOST. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for his support of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 25 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. HECK. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title I the following: 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a study on the compliance of projects and properties constructed or renovated by the Corps of Engineers with stormwater runoff requirements. (b) REQUIREMENTS .—The study under subsection (a) shall include an analysis of— (1) the extent to which the Corps of Engineers has complied with section 439 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17094) for projects and properties constructed or renovated since February 1, 2010; (2) the feasibility of the Corps of Engineers to meet the requirement to restore the predevelopment hydrology of properties under the ‘‘maximum extent technically feasible’’ standard created under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; (3) potential changes to the Corps of Engineers’ budgeting, planning, design, construction, and maintenance strategies that could increase the agency’s ability to meet the requirement described in paragraph (2); (4) potential changes to the guidance described in the Technical Guidance on Implementing the Stormwater Runoff Requirements for Federal Projects under section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and dated December 2009, that could increase the Corps of Engineers’ ability to meet the requirement described in paragraph (2). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK. Madam Chair, my amendment is simply about making sure the Federal Government is setting the example in leading the way in addressing the single largest source of water pollution in America, which is stormwater runoff. Most of us probably don’t think about it, but, frankly, when rain falls— and it does a lot in my neck of the woods—and flows through our streets, it picks up all sorts of pollutants. We are talking about some really nasty stuff, frankly: toxic chemicals like arsenic and flame retardants, as well as oils and pesticides. This stormwater hurts our lakes, rivers, and waterways. In fact, in many bodies of water, it accounts for 80 percent of the pollution. It not only hurts our environment. Just as importantly, it hurts our businesses that depend on clean water, as an example, Washington’s shellfish industry, which employees literally thousands of people. There are probably no places in America that are more impacted by stormwater runoff than in my home on the Puget Sound, which is the largest estuary in the United States. Studies by the Washington Stormwater Center in Puyallup, Washington, have shown that stormwater can kill a salmon within hours. They have timelapsed films. But you don’t have to watch them in time lapse because it happens that quickly. Salmon and other fish are our way of life in Washington, and we are talking major business impact—a $30 billion economy. Salmon also serve as a vital resource of immeasurable value to the 19 federally recognized Tribes in Puget Sound. They are the Salmon People, and salmon—chinook salmon, specifically—are also the prey of choice for our beloved southern resident orcas, which we are precariously close to losing altogether. There are fewer today than when they were listed under the Endangered Species Act many years ago. So, if we fail to address the problem posed by stormwater, these resources will continue to decline, and our region will lose irreplaceable icons of life in the Pacific Northwest. Now, granted, we are doing a lot to address this threat already, but it is nowhere near enough. If we are going to truly address the problem, then the Federal Government needs to set the example. The good news is that Congress already knows this and acknowledges this because, in 2007, this body passed a law which requires Federal agencies to reduce stormwater runoff when they develop or redevelop property. That is just a commonsense requirement. Since it was enacted over a decade ago, there has been no accountability for Federal agencies to show they are meeting these standards. So this brings us to my amendment. It would simply direct the GAO to study whether the Army Corps of Engineers has been able to meet these stormwater runoff mitigation requirements, and if they aren’t, what changes they can make to improve their ability to meet them. Madam Chair, if we are going to help our businesses and communities impacted by stormwater runoff, it is vitally important that the Federal Government set the example and lead the way. Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I don’t plan to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, this amendment directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and report on the Army Corps of Engineers’ ability to comply with Federal stormwater requirements. This is an issue that affects districts across the United States. I want to thank the gentleman from Washington for bringing this amendment up, for raising this issue, and we are prepared to accept it. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Add at the end of title I the following: 
SEC. ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO PUERTO RICO. 
(a) W ATER RESOURCE PROJECTS IN PUERTO  RICO.—It is the sense of Congress that the Corps of Engineers should proceed with a sense of urgency, and viewing requirements in the most favorable light, in evaluating and programming the actions to be taken to complete current phases, initiate pending phases, and prepare the reports necessary to proceed with the water resources projects necessary for flood control, dam repair, beach erosion control, and harbor navigation improvement in Puerto Rico, as well as for repair and mitigation required by hurricane and severe weather event damages that occurred between September 2017 and March 2018. (b) CAN˜OMARTIN PEN˜AECOSYSTEM RESTORATION PROJECT .—It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary should advance the project for ecosystem restoration, Can ˜o Martı´n Pen˜a, San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZ COLO´N) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Madam Chair, this amendment calls on the Army Corps of Engineers to consider urgently and favorably those projects and proposals pending before them for flood control, dam repair, beach erosion, and harbor navigation in Puerto Rico, as well as for the repair and mitigation required in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria and, more specifically, that the Secretary should advance the project for ecosystem restoration at Cano Martin Pena in San Juan. Between projects that had been proposed or planned before the disaster and those resulting from the disaster, the Army Corp of Engineers has before its consideration over 45 different projects or proposals for flood and erosion control for protection of life and property on the island. These projects are in all sorts of phases, from initial studies to planning, to pending construction start, to waiting for the next phase to be funded, and to inactive projects that may be reactivated. While we wait for decisions, we have towns like Toa Baja where, during the last hurricane in September, more than 12,000 families were flooded out of their homes. Every decade, that kind of town suffers losses from different kinds of floods while there is a project already designed and approved that could have greatly mitigated that kind of a hazard and by now would have cost less than the accumulated losses from the last hurricane. Those are the kinds of projects that are already approved by the Army Corps in that part of this amendment. In Ciales and Guayanilla, the mayors have gathered the studies and plans, but it has not yet been made part of the Corps schedule. Among the works that merit special attention is the Cano Martin Pena Project, which has been an example of community partnership and has been an important part of the Corps’ program in Puerto Rico, for the ecosystem restoration, protection of lives in the community, and control of flooding in an area that extends from the San Juan business district to the international airport. The community has been an outstanding local partner, showing great drive to move forward their part of the program, but the project has been very slow because of the limited funding by phases. It is important at this point in time as we face a new hurricane season that our people get the sense of urgency from the Federal Government. When you know that the next storm is coming and danger is on the horizon, you will also want to know that the necessary work has been done. That is the reason this amendment is so important, and that is the reason I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I don’t plan to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. The Acting Chair. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, this amendment expresses the sense of Congress that projects in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria be expedited, that these be considered a priority, and that the Corps of Engineers advance these projects as quickly as possible. My friend from Puerto Rico hosted myself, Mr. DEFAZIO, Chairman S HUSTER , and others in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the storms, and certainly the devastation there was extraordinary. It is important to advance projects like this because as folks are looking at whether they are going to reinvest back in their communities, whether they are going to stay in their communities, whether they are going to rebuild their homes and businesses, knowing that things aren’t going to be back in the same degree of vulnerability is very important. We have got to send a message to these victims of hurricanes in 2017 and other disasters that these communities are going to be built back smarter, they are going to be safer, and the investments they are putting back in their homes and businesses are wise investments. I want to thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment. I want to thank her for her tireless work in the recovery of Puerto Rico. We are prepared to accept, and I urge adoption of the amendment. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 27 OFFERED BY MR . GIBBS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 27 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. GIBBS. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title I, add the following: 
(a) I NGENERAL .—For purposes of dredged material management plans initiated in or after fiscal year 2018, the Secretary shall expedite the dredged material management plan process in order that studies make maximum use of existing information, studies, and innovative dredged material management practices, and avoid any redundant information collection and studies. (b) REPORT .—Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on how the Corps of Engineers intends to meet the requirements of subsection (a). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. GIBBS. Madam Chair, my amendment would expedite the process the Army Corps of Engineers conducts to study and implement the dredged material management plans, or DMMPs. In my home State of Ohio, the Port of Cleveland has had difficulty in recent years coming to a resolution with the Army Corps of Engineers over the disposal of dredged material from the Cuyahoga River’s Federal navigation channel. While the channel depth is maintained each year, the uncertainty from year to year does not provide the confidence necessary to northeast Ohio’s communities, and it does not give the Port of Cleveland the ability to conduct longterm planning without considerable and avoidable risks. To help private and public entities working with the Army Corps on dredged material management plans, my amendment ensures the Army Corps works diligently with local partners to conduct the DMMPs in an efficient manner. My amendment also directs the Army Corps of Engineers to consider 
alternative uses for and creative tools to collect dredged material, lightening the load on contained disposal facilities and increasing their lifespan. The Port of Cleveland and many entities across the country rely on these dredged material management plans. They should not have to wait as long as 4 years for these studies and plans to be completed. In the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, we implemented a 3 by 3 by 3 rule in which studies should cost no more than $3 million, take no longer than 3 years, and include the district, division, and headquarters staff concurrently. When DMMPs are developed, they should be held to the 3 by 3 by 3 rule. Madam Chair, I offer this amendment to provide a timely process for DMMP planning and implementation. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I don’t plan to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BARTON ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. b1700 Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio for offering this amendment. DMMP’s dredged material management plans are plans to manage the sediment that results from dredging activities. It can hold up the navigation of channels for ships and vessels. It can obstruct activity at ports. This is what the rest of the world would call common sense. It ensures that we are not collecting redundant information, we are building upon information that exists, and that we have a limit or goal of 2 years in completing this. This makes sense. I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this amendment forth, which we are prepared to accept. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for his support. He is absolutely right. When these projects are held up, economic activity can be stifled. We saw this happen in Cleveland. So it is very important this be adopted in the Water Resources Development Act. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 28 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. AMENDMENT NO . 29 OFFERED BY MR . RODNEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 29 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title I, add the following: 
SEC. ll. FEASIBILITY OF CHICAGO SANITARY AND SHIP CANAL DISPERSAL BARRIERS PROJECT, ILLINOIS. 
Section 3061(d) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (Public Law 110–114; 121 Stat. 1121) is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘The Secretary’’ and inserting the following: ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL .—The Secretary’’; and (2) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(2) OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE .—Oper ation and maintenance of any project authorized to be carried out pursuant to the feasibility study identified in paragraph (1) shall be carried out at 80 percent Federal expense and 20 percent nonFederal expense. ‘‘(3) CONSULTATION .—After construction of any project authorized to be carried out pursuant to the feasibility study identified in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with the Governor of the State in which the project is constructed and seek Congressional authority to construct any new technologies not included in the Chief’s Report.’’. Page 52, after line 24, insert the following: (21) Projects under the Great Lakes Mississippi River Interbasin Study Brandon Road Study. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, addressing the issue of aquatic invasive species has not always been one where all of the Great Lakes States have seen eyetoeye on. However, this amendment reflects an agreement between myself and my good friend, Mr. MITCHELL , as well as our two States and our two Governors. First, this amendment clarifies that the operation and maintenance of any project authorized subsequent to the Chief’s Report for the Brandon Road Study is done at an 80–20 Federal/nonFederal cost share. For reference, O&M on the existing electrical barriers in place on the Illinois River is at 100 percent Federal expense, as was authorized by Congress. So with this language, we are making it clear that Illinois wants to have some skin in the game on this project. In addition my amendment requires the Corps, following the construction of any project authorized subsequent to the Chief’s Report for the Brandon Road Study, to consult with the Governor of the State where the project is located and seek congressional approval before constructing any additional technologies at the project in the future. Finally, as part of the compromise worked out with my colleagues from Michigan and other Great Lakes States, my amendment directs the Corps to expedite the completion of the Brandon Road Study, which we expect to be completed by next February. Now, let me be clear. It is no secret that the State of Illinois has had concerns with this project and its potential impact on our economy. The Illinois waterway is a critical artery for the movement of agricultural goods and other products that support our region’s economy, and disruptions to commercial navigation could have negative repercussions to our ability to get those goods to market. In addition, my home State of Illinois has taken significant steps to reduce the Asian carp population by using existing measures. In fact, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources recently reported in 2012 the State has reduced the Asian carp population by 93 percent. Much of this is due to the critical Great Lakes restoration initiative funding, which I continue to proudly support. Yet, in an offer of good faith, our Governor has submitted a letter of intent for the State of Illinois to serve as the nonFederal sponsor, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and urging the support of this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is the result of a lot of work between a number of Great Lakes members. I appreciate everyone’s work and consensus on this important issue. I am prepared to accept the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ), my good friend and partner on this amendment. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of the amendment of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). We worked hard on this amendment. It is the result of hard work and agreements between all interested parties, Governors across the Great Lakes, and Members of Congress throughout the Great Lakes basin. The Brandon Road Lock and Dam is a lock and dam complex on the Des Plaines River in Joliet, Illinois. It is one of the last stops along the waterway before Lake Michigan and the entire Great Lakes system. Unfortunately, Asian carp exists in that waterway as well. This invasive species getting into the Great Lakes 
would do unfathomable damage to our economy and ecology not just in my State, but to the entire Great Lakes basin. We must stop the spread of Asian carp, and the Brandon Road Lock and Dam offers the best and last chance to do so. I appreciate the assistance of my good friend from Illinois and the Governor of Illinois for recognizing the problem. Stakeholders and members on this waterway leading to the Great Lakes use it for commerce. Those on the Great Lakes basin prioritize its use to stop Asian carp. It is vital to understand that, and all sides must know and agree we have to achieve both objectives sooner than later. This is a complex problem. That is why we have asked the Army Corps of Engineers to release their study as soon as possible. This study will advise Congress and the American people about what options we have, what effects they could have, and how effective preventive measures could be. Like many things in government, this project has seen delays. The report has seen delays. Time is our enemy here and we cannot have the final report delayed any longer. My section of the DavisMitchell amendment adds the Brandon Road Study to the list of expedited studies. By ensuring timely completion, we can move forward on whatever is recommended in order to achieve two things: effective commerce on the river, while ensuring Asian carp do not invade the Great Lakes. I support the amendment, I ask my colleagues to do so, and I want to express my appreciation to Mr. DAVIS for all the hard work he has put into resolving what has been an issue for a long time here in Congress. Together, we have come up with a good amendment. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank my good friend, Mr. MITCHELL . I would be remiss not to recognize my colleague from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ), who was very supportive. His efforts were very meaningful to this agreement. Mr. Chairman, again, I hope that we can get this amendment accepted, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY  DAVIS). The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 30 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 52, after line 16, insert the following (and redesignate accordingly): (17) Project for navigation, San Juan Harbor, Puerto Rico. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZ COLO´N) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is among the reports that the Corps of Engineers should expedite completion of. It is for the navigation project for San Juan Harbor. This is another amendment for the release of a study that has been waiting for more than 12 years. These reports follow from a study authorized by a resolution of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 20, 2006. This is a project that has been approved and, according to the Corps, could enter the engineering and design phase within 1 or 2 years, once the reports and reviews are finally in. It will increase the main channel depth to 44 feet and make it 100 feet wider, along with other modifications, to allow a safer and more efficient movement of traffic in the Harbor of San Juan and increasing economic activity at a time when the Puerto Rico economy needs every boost it can get. As everybody knows, during the last hurricane, the movement of ships was one of the biggest problems. This would specifically be of importance in the case of a future emergency contingency. As we saw during the last year, one of the problems that arose was the congestion when needing to move those shipments. In the aftermath of hurricanes and flooding events, it becomes even more necessary, due to the incursion of debris and erosion from the surrounding bodies of water, which accelerate the natural deterioration of the harbor. This is a project that has been approved and programmed. The amendment, again, is so that the reports on the studies performed over the many years will finally be completed so that the next stage of engineer and design can proceed. This is an infrastructure that needs to be up and running for the creation of American jobs and to prevent future damage. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Remember, one of the main problems on the island is the energy situation. We are an island. So we are importing all of the coal and all of the oil. If we want to move to an LNG facility, we need to have a wider and a deeper port. This is one of those biggest efforts. If we got this kind of study, we can have those ports and have those ships coming from the States and have a better opportunity to improve our economy and have more goods and materials arriving to the island. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague’s work on this important issue, and I believe all of us understand the importance of restoring Puerto Rico. So I am prepared to accept this amendment at this time. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 31 OFFERED BY MR . LANCE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 31 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 52, after line 24, insert the following: (21) Project for ecosystem restoration, Warren Glen Dam Removal, Musconetcong River, New Jersey. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of the Lance Gottheimer amendment to the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. I thank Chairman SHUSTER and his committee for the tremendous work they have done on the underlying bill. This amendment would direct the Secretary of the Army to expedite the completion of the Warren Glen Dam Removal Feasibility Study in the Musconetcong River, an important waterway in the congressional district I serve. The 30foothigh, 150feetwide Warren Glen Dam is currently one of the largest and most detrimental dams on the Musconetcong River in the State of New Jersey. The dam poses downstream safety risks, worsening the quality of drinking water in the region. The dam also blocks migratory fish from the Delaware River, including shad, alewife and herring. In 1981, the Army Corps classified this dam as a hazard to public safety. It must be removed. The Musconetcong River is an important natural resource in our region of the country, and is well recognized for its scenic beauty, environmental significance, and diversity of wildlife. The restoration of the Musconetcong watershed will improve the water quality by creating a stronger freshwater flow to push down the salt line to enhance the protection of drinking water. Removing the Warren Glen Dam would also open an additional 5 miles 
to the Musconetcong as a freeflowing river for migratory fish. The Musconetcong watershed has the potential to become an even greater site for outdoor recreation and wildlife. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. GOTTHEIMER  for joining me yet again on a bipartisan, problemsolving collaboration. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1715 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I rise to claim time in opposition but do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. This amendment directs the Secretary to expedite the completion of a feasibility study, which the gentleman has so eloquently explained to us. I am prepared to accept this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 32 OFFERED BY MR . BEN RAY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 32 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. BEN RAY LUJA´N of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 52, after line 24, insert the following: (21) Project for flood control and water supply, Abiquiu Dam, New Mexico. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. BENRAYLUJA´N) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. BEN RAY LUJA´N of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize the leadership of Chairman SHUSTER , Ranking Member DEFAZIO, and my friend and colleague, Mr. LARSEN . Mr. Chairman, the amendment I have at the desk today will help start a Federal process in providing additional flexibility for storage of native and San JuanChama water to benefit the Middle Rio Grande region. The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority has been working for more than 5 years to obtain congressional authorization to increase storage in Abiquiu Reservoir by about 35,000 acrefeet. This will provide greater and muchneeded flexibility for water operations to support municipal, agricultural, and environmental purposes. This amendment starts that process by expediting the feasibility study for Abiquiu Dam. According to the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, the added storage will also provide opportunities to benefit acequias in northern New Mexico, many of which have the oldest water rights in the Rio Grande basin, but do not have any ability to store water for use in drought years; management of operations in the Middle Rio Grande for Endangered Species Act compliance; and for the Rio Grande Compact compliance for the State of New Mexico. This project is supported by the Bureau of Reclamation, the Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management. WildEarth Guardians, the Nature Conservancy, the Audubon New Mexico, the city and county of Santa Fe, the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, Rio Arriba County, and the Rio Chama Acequia Association. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I rise to claim time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, this amendment directs the Secretary, as he explained, to expedite the reports to the project for the Abiquiu Reservoir. I know this is an important project to New Mexico. I am prepared to accept the amendment at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BEN RAY LUJA´N of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment so that these communities can move forward with this critical project, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. BENRAY LUJA´N). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 33 OFFERED BY MR . LARSEN OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 33 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 55, line 1, strike ‘‘$3,000,000,000’’ and insert ‘‘$3,025,000,000’’. Page 57, line 24, strike ‘‘$3,000,000,000’’ and insert ‘‘$3,025,000,000’’. At the end of title III, add the following: 
Section 544(f) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–541; 114 Stat. 2675) is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘$40,000,000’’ and inserting ‘‘$60,000,000’’; and (2) by striking ‘‘$5,000,000’’ and inserting ‘‘$10,000,000’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. LARSEN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, No. 33, to H.R. 8 to improve available resources for the Puget Sound Adjacent Waters Restoration program, also known as PSAW. The Puget Sound and the waters and wildlife that call it home are cornerstones of Washington State’s cultural identity, maritime economy, and environment. As the Nation’s largest estuary, a healthy Puget Sound is essential to supporting over 3,000 shellfish jobs and generating an estimated $184 million in revenue annually. Every EPA dollar spent on Puget Sound recovery efforts have leveraged more than $24 in matching funds from State, local, and tribal partners. The PSAW program supports critical ecosystem restoration projects across 15,000 square miles of northwest Washington State, the Puget Sound drainage basin, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The program is part of the larger Puget Sound Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration Project to restore and protect salmon habitat throughout the Sound, especially for endangered chinook and steelhead. My amendment doubles the per project funding cap for PSAW projects to $10 million and raises the overall authorization level for the program by $20 million. As a result, critical Sound nearshore restoration projects in Washington State would be eligible for PSAW funding. Increasing available funds on a projectbyproject basis will ensure that the PSAW program is consistent with the Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Program cap. Recently, the CBO did an analysis of the amendment and found it will have little to no direct impact on the budget. Mr. Chair, a special thanks to Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for their leadership on this measure as well. I am pleased that we are moving forward on WRDA legislation that invests in the Nation’s ports, channels, waterways, and other critical infrastructure to keep the U.S. maritime system competitive. Maintaining the regular 2year authorization of this legislation is critical to the Nation’s economy and will encourage new, goodpaying jobs in the Pacific Northwest. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to continue the robust Federal investment and stewardship needed to save the Sound. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. I was unclear about what this amendment did. Back home, I have a constituent by the name of Carson Frank. I went back and I talked to Carson about this bill, and he explained to me that this is consistent with section 206 of the Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Project and raises all the authorization levels. So I thank Carson from my home State of Pennsylvania for explaining this to me. I am happy to support the gentleman’s amendment so that this project will be completed in a timely fashion. Mr. Chair, I am prepared to accept the amendment at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. LARSEN ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 34 OFFERED BY MR . KEATING  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 34 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title II the following: 
Not later than December 31, 2019, the Secretary shall expedite and complete the dredging of Plymouth Harbor, Massachusetts, as authorized by the Act of March 4, 1913 (37 Stat. 802, chapter 144) and the Act of September 22, 1922 (42 Stat. 1038, chapter 427). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, this amendment would direct the Army Corps to expedite and complete dredging in Plymouth Harbor in time for the 400th anniversary celebration of the Mayflower landing in Plymouth and Provincetown, Massachusetts. This is a huge international event that will attract people from all over the world, particularly from Britain— including Plymouth, England—and it is going to be a significant revenue producer for our Commonwealth but also for our country. The 2020 anniversary is a proud milestone for our country as we commemorate the 400th anniversary of the successful settlement of Plymouth by the Pilgrims; the essential contributions of the Aquinnah and Mashpee Wampanoag tribes; and the number of key events that followed, including the signing of the Mayflower Compact, the 50year Plymouth PilgrimWampanoag peace treaty, and of course, the first Thanksgiving. For my entire time in Congress, I have worked closely with my constituents to prepare for this Plymouth 400 event. The Plymouth Harbor dredging project has always been a cornerstone to these preparations. A centerpiece of the anniversary will be the return of the fully restored Mayflower Two, a fullscale replica of the original ship that brought the Pilgrims to Cape Cod in 1620. However, the Mayflower Two cannot return to her home in Plymouth Harbor unless muchneeded dredging is completed by that time. Further, we anticipate a maritime salute to mark the return of the Mayflower Two as part of the commemoration. We also expect significant uptick in corresponding maritime traffic. The amendment is part of a final piece to ensure that 2020 will be a memorable year for our community and our country, and I look forward to the completion of this project and all the good that will follow. This is something that is critical not only in terms of the event but making sure there is safe navigation, which we will have to be able to, in some way, counter the influx of marine traffic as well. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman offering this amendment that does direct the Army Corps to expedite the complete dredging in Plymouth Harbor, Massachusetts. I know this project is important to the gentleman and to the State, so I am prepared to accept the amendment at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, I just want to thank the chairman for his help working with this, and I want to say, you are welcome. In 2020, come be part of the celebration. It is so integral to our country, and it is something that will, I think, be a great revenue producer as well. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 35 OFFERED BY MR . JOYCE OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 35 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add at the end of title II the following: 
The Secretary shall complete a final feasibility report for the Great Lakes Mississippi River Interbasin Study Brandon Road Study, authorized under section 3061(d) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (121 Stat. 1121) and section 1538(b)(1) of MAP–21 (Public Law 112–141; 126 Stat. 586) by the original deadline of February 2019. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman SHUSTER for his tireless work on this bill and for the fantastic job he has done throughout his career as the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Our Nation owes him a lot for his fine work. My amendment requires the Army Corps to complete its final report for the Brandon Road Study by February 2019, which is the originally established deadline. The purpose of the Brandon Road Study is to evaluate options and technologies near the Brandon Road Lock and Dam site to prevent aquatic invasive species from reaching the Great Lakes; in particular, the Asian carp. The study began in 2015. We were supposed to see the draft report by January of last year. It was delayed 6 months. We cannot afford any more delays. The sooner the final report is released, the sooner we can begin to implement methods and technologies that will keep the invasive Asian carp out of the lakes, which account for more than 20 percent of the world’s fresh surface water supply. Asian carp would devastate the ecosystem and the economy of the Great Lakes region. Studies show the impacts would include declines in native fish species and a onethird reduction of the total fish weight in Lake Erie. We need to ensure that the Brandon Road Study is released by the February of 2019 deadline so we can move forward with the recommendations from the study and stop the invasive Asian carp from infiltrating one of the Nation’s most critical water resources. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. The amendment, as he explained, directs the Secretary to complete the final feasibility report for the Great Lakes Mississippi River study on the Brandon Roads by next February. Keeping this study on track is important. I understand my colleague’s concern about not having it drag on without conclusion. I really appreciate the gentleman for offering this. 
Mr. Chair, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I urge the support of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE ).

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
I would like to thank Chairman S HUSTER and the committee staff for all of their assistance in helping to get this matter to the floor for consideration. This amendment would convey three parcels of land known as the Earle May Recreational Area from the Army Corps of Engineers to the city of Bainbridge, Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the Earle May Recreational Area is vitally important to the city of Bainbridge, Georgia. The city has had a longterm lease from the Army Corps of Engineers, and it has invested nearly $150 million in improvements to this area for public use. These investments include a $25 million water control plant, several sporting complexes, and many other facilities that attract visitors. It is a destination for people from across the Southeast for its unique beauty and the recreational opportunities that are offered by the Flint River. Continued improvements, however, could be done much more efficiently if the land were conveyed from the Army Corps to the city of Bainbridge. Since the original lease was initiated in 1980, any improvements that the city attempted to make had to undergo the very long and arduous process that the Army Corps of Engineers utilizes, and, therefore, it increased substantially the cost to the city, as well as the bureaucratic delays that occurred. By transferring this land to the people of the city of Bainbridge, I am confident that a proper balance can be struck between the city and the Army Corps, and it will facilitate the recreational activities on the Flint River as well as navigation and flood control. I would like to thank the chairman for his assistance and for agreeing to accept this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. I appreciate his work on the issue, and I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I ask my colleagues in the House and I urge their support of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 37 OFFERED BY MR . BLUM  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 37 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of title III, add the following: 
The Secretary shall expedite completion of the project for flood risk management, Cedar River, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, authorized by section 7002(2) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2014 (128 Stat. 1366). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BLUM) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment that prioritizes the completion of the flood mitigation project on the Cedar River in the First District of Iowa. Ten years ago this week, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, experienced a devastating flood that resulted in billions of dollars’ worth of damage. In 2014, Congress authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to complete a flood risk mitigation project on the Cedar River to prevent future floods. Two years ago, in the midst of another historic flood in Cedar Rapids, the 2016 WRDA included my amendment that prioritized the completion of the Cedar Rapids project. However, we are having the same discussion 2 years later for the 2018 WRDA. The Federal Government has let down my constituents in Cedar Rapids and has not fulfilled its duty to provide the necessary resources to complete the flood mitigation project to protect this city. Working with my Iowa colleagues in the House and the Senate, I have attended countless meetings and sent numerous letters to the Army Corps and the Office of Management and Budget urging movement on this most important project, but it has yet to start. It is past time the government fulfills its promise to my constituents in Iowa. This project is shovel ready, and Cedar Rapidians deserve completion to protect this vibrant city from future natural disasters. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. This is an important project for Cedar Rapids, Iowa. We have had many discussions about it. I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BLUM). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 38 OFFERED BY MR . KEATING  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 38 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. lll. CORPS OF ENGINEERS BRIDGE REPAIR AND DIVESTITURE PROGRAM FOR NEW ENGLAND EVACUATION ROUTES. 
Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary may repair or replace, as necessary, any bridge owned and operated by the Secretary that is— (1) located in any of the States of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont; and (2) necessary for evacuation during an extreme weather event. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would grant the Army Corps of Engineers the authority to repair or replace any Army Corps bridge that is necessary for evacuation during extreme weather or natural disaster in New England. In my district, Mr. Chairman, the Bourne and Sagamore bridges represent the only roads for crossing the Cape Cod Canal by car. These bridges, owned by the Army Corps, have long reached the end of their working lives. In fact, the Army Corps is already spending a significant amount of funds just to keep the traffic on the bridges moving. Anyone who has gone there in the summer and experienced that can well attest to that. We cannot risk the safety of those vital roadways at any time, let alone at a time of an emergency. As the Corps already knows, it is important that we recognize that the canal bridges and other critical evacuation infrastructure across the Nation play a fundamental role in providing for the public safety of countless Americans. Much of this State and local work required to ensure the longterm safety of the canal bridges is already under way. I have also been working closely with the Army Corps leadership in New England and in Washington to ensure that the funding necessary for the safest, most resilient evacuation routes remains a priority. This amendment would authorize the Army Corps to continue down the path towards longterm safety for the people in my region, the people in New England, and, importantly, the over half a million people that the population swells to just in that small area over the summer months. For that reason, I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment that clarifies the Army Corps’ authority to repair the Sagamore and Bourne bridges. This will help ensure the people can safely evacuate during an emergency situation. It is important to Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman for offering the amendment. I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman again for his cooperation. This is a vital matter of public safety going forward, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ). The amendment was agreed to.

At the end of title III, add the following: 
(a) D EFINITIONS .—In this section: (1) FEDERAL LAND .—The term ‘‘Federal land’’ means the approximately 288 acres of land situated in Whitman County, Washington, contained within Tract D of Little Goose Lock and Dam. (2) NONFEDERAL LAND .—The term ‘‘non Federal land’’ means a tract or tracts of land owned by the Port of Whitman County, Washington, that the Secretary determines, with approval of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Secretary of the Interior acting through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, equals or exceeds the value of the Federal land both as habitat for fish and wildlife and for recreational opportunities related to fish and wildlife. (b) LAND EXCHANGE .—On conveyance by the Port of Whitman County to the United States of all right, title, and interest in and to the nonFederal land, the Secretary of the Army shall convey to the Port of Whitman County all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the Federal land. (c) DEEDS .— (1) DEED TO NON FEDERAL LAND .—The Sec retary may only accept conveyance of the nonFederal land by warranty deed, as determined acceptable by the Secretary. (2) DEED TO FEDERAL LAND .—The Secretary shall convey the Federal land to the Port of Whitman County by quitclaim deed and subject to any reservations, terms, and conditions the Secretary determines necessary to allow the United States to operate and maintain the Lower Snake River Project and to protect the interests of the United States. (d) CASH PAYMENT .—If the appraised fair market value of the Federal land, as determined by the Secretary, exceeds the appraised fair market value of the nonFederal land, as determined by the Secretary, the Port of Whitman County shall make a cash payment to the United States reflecting the difference in the appraised fair market values.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington. Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I applaud Chairman SHUSTER for getting WRDA back on a 2 year cycle and for his leadership on this important legislation. In eastern Washington, we rely on rivers, locks, and dams to move goods through ports and to markets abroad. I represent the Columbia Snake River system, and this system is crucial to moving Washington wheat and potatoes. Today, I offer an amendment that authorizes a land transfer between the Army Corps of Engineers and Port of Whitman. As introduced, the Port of Whitman Economic Expansion Act seeks to simply allow the port to accomplish their goals of providing additional jobs and opportunities in rural eastern Washington. To do this, they need this land transfer. This amendment simply authorizes this process. We have worked with the State and local community to ensure this process will meet fish and wildlife mitigation requirements as well as keep recreation opportunities available in the community. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER  and Ranking Member DEFAZIO and their staff for their assistance, and I urge the adoption of my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment. I know how important it is to the State of Washington and her district and her constituents. I am prepared to accept the amendment at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 40 OFFERED BY MS . SHEA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 40 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title III, insert the following: 
SEC. lll. HAMPTON HARBOR, NEW HAMPSHIRE, NAVIGATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT. 
In carrying out the project for navigation, Hampton Harbor, New Hampshire, under section 107 of the River and Harbor Act of 1960 (33 U.S.C. 577), the Secretary shall use all existing authorities of the Secretary to mitigate severe shoaling. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. SHEAPORTER) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Chair, my amendment is straightforward. It directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to use its existing authority to dredge Hampton Harbor in southern New Hampshire. Hampton Harbor is New Hampshire’s largest commercial fishing port, and it is a lifeline to the ocean for New Hampshire fishermen. Severe shoaling has made the water so shallow that it will soon become unnavigable. Some vessels must wait for the tides to be at their highest simply to enter the harbor. Over 1,500 recreational vessels, emergency response and patrol boats, and numerous commercial lobster and fishing boats could be cut off from the ocean. The narrowing and shallowing of the harbor not only places unnecessary costs on local businesses, it is also a safety hazard. As access points to the harbor become tighter and the window for entering the harbor safely narrows, more boats must enter and exit the harbor at the same time. This greatly increases the risk of a collision. A Hampton fisherman has warned in a letter to his local paper that: ‘‘Only a matter of time before there is a boat toboat or boattowall collision, which will result in major property damage and possible human injury or death.’’ This project must move forward as soon as possible. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment. I know the importance of it to Hampton Harbor and New Hampshire. I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. SHEAPORTER ). The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 41 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
The Secretary shall expedite the project for navigation for Portsmouth Harbor and the Piscataqua River authorized by section 101 of the River and Harbor Act of 1962 (76 Stat. 1173). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. SHEAPORTER) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Chair, my amendment simply directs the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite its existing Portsmouth Harbor Navigation Improvement Project. Portsmouth Harbor is vital to both New Hampshire’s economy and our national security. It is the only deep draft harbor located in the State of New Hampshire and is the port of entry for fuels that generate 20 percent of New Hampshire’s energy. b1745 The harbor is also home to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, where Granite Staters work on our Nation’s advanced nuclear submarines. It is a challenging harbor to navigate—home to some of the fastest tidal currents on Earth. That is why it is so important that the Portsmouth Harbor project moves forward quickly. The harbor must remain safe and navigable. The skilled sailors of the United States Navy can navigate this difficult waterway. It is vital that commercial traffic can also use the harbor safely and that commercial vessels do not delay the submarines’ entry to the shipyard. In addition, a maritime incident triggered by this difficult waterway could cause a devastating oil spill that would negatively impact the shipyard. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment. This amendment that she explained so well expedites the navigation project for Portsmouth Harbor and the Piscataqua River, which I know many families live along that— the Jones, the Smiths, the Gosselins— and they are all very concerned about this, so I appreciate the gentlewoman bringing this amendment to the floor. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. SHEAPORTER ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 42 OFFERED BY MR . LEWIS OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 42 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title I the following: 
SEC. lll. SENSE OF CONGRESS ENCOURAGING NONFEDERAL DREDGED MATERIAL PLACEMENT SPONSORS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) when a State or subdivision of a State, individually or in partnership with a private partner, develops a reasonable alternative to the Federal standard for dredged material disposal facilities that meets relevant Federal environmental and dredged material placement and disposal requirements in coordination with a Corps of Engineers’ District Office, it should receive preferred consideration by the Secretary; and (2) the Secretary is encouraged to consider entering into agreements with nonFederal sponsors for the acquisition, design, construction, management, or operation and maintenance of dredged material disposal facilities, including port facilities, through section 217 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. LEWIS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, let me start by thanking my colleague from Pennsylvania, the chairman of our committee, for his leadership in getting this bill to the floor. The U.S. Army Corps plays a pivotal role in the transportation of all of our goods and services in the United States. They are tasked with maintaining navigation channels in our most active and commercial waterways. Unfortunately, carrying out this important work brings about challenges my constituents know all too well. Last spring, the Corps released a 40 year dredged material management plan in an effort to identify placement sites for almost 11 million cubic yards of dredged material. Regrettably, the proposal was drafted by bureaucrats in Washington with very little community input. Without knowledge of the local impact, the Federal plan would take 300 acres of pristine land from a third generation family farm, 30 acres in a residential neighborhood in my district, as well as 73 acres from a farm in Congressman KIND’s district. My own family lost their business through condemnation, so I am acutely aware of the damage the eminent domain process can sometimes have on families and communities. After several discussions with the Corps and letters from myself, they agreed that more public comment was needed and that a better solution may possibly exist. I was pleased that the Corps scheduled several public meetings on the topic, and that the Corps worked with us to extend the open comment period several times. This process proved successful, and a number of innovative and thoughtful alternatives were submitted for consideration. Yesterday, the St. Paul District Office of the Army Corps and the city of Wabasha, Minnesota, signed a memorandum of understanding for this 40 year plan. The memorandum of understanding describes a process by which the Corps can use existing authorities to collaborate with a nonFederal entity in order to allow for greater flexibility of material placement. This proposal has the support of the district office, our local community, and the State of Minnesota. It is also environmentally friendly, as it could allow the dredged material to be used in a manner that benefits society, rather than taking up space on a pristine farmland. It also spreads the burden of a public benefit to everyone who benefits. My amendment encourages the Army Corps’ headquarters to fully consider this alternative plan, and alternatives like this, in the future. In its history, the Corps has rarely approved innovative plans such as this. Federal, local, and private partnerships are something that we should encourage, instead of putting roadblocks in the way. Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and I ask that the Army Corps fully consider inventive, but effective projects across the country it would affect. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering a commonsense amendment that encourages the Corps to consider reasonable alternative agreements between State and local entities and private partners. This makes a lot of sense to me. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. LEWIS). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 43 OFFERED BY MR . OLSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 43 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title I, add the following: 
The Secretary shall carry out expeditiously projects already authorized by the Army Corps of Engineers to reduce the risk of future floods and hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, as you know, the greater Houston area, my home, was devastated by Hurricane Harvey. That was 10 months ago. We are still working to recover, and Texas is not alone. Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands were impacted by a shattering hurricane season. And we can’t just focus on the last storm season. The 2018 hurricane season started on June 1. Tropical Storm Alberto hit the Florida Panhandle on May 25, 6 days before hurricane season. NOAA says that there is a 75 percent chance this Atlantic hurricane season will be near or above normal. That is why we must act now to prevent damage from huge floods like Harvey. Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to pass the Bipartisan Budget Act to provide critical Army Corps funds to rebuild our communities and prepare for the next storm. Even though that money has been allocated, the work has not begun. While that is partly due to red tape at the Corps, once work begins, we need to move that process quickly. My amendment is simple. It says that the Army Corps needs to expedite previously authorized projects in the declared disaster areas of Texas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These projects will provide critical help for communities that are still recovering and mitigate future flooding and damage. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. AL GREEN ). Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment by Mr. OLSON . It is a bipartisan effort. But it is also an effort to save lives, because in 2015 with the Memorial Day flood we had 7 people lose their lives; and, in 2016, with the tax day flood, we had 8 people lose their lives; and, of course, Hurricane Harvey claimed 68 lives across the State of Texas. This is not only about dollars and cents, it is about saving lives, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman bringing this amendment to the floor and given that he said the historic hurricanes of 2017 this amendment is critical to that recovery, so I am prepared to accept the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for clearing the way for this amendment to be voted on on the House floor. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues who cosponsored this amendment, and I ask all of my colleagues to vote for this flood protection amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 44 OFFERED BY MR . CULBERSON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 44 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title II the following: 
The Secretary shall expeditiously carry out flood and storm damage reduction studies to reduce the risk of damage from future floods and hurricanes in the Houston and Coastal Texas areas. In carrying out the studies, the Secretary shall leverage existing information and resources. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CULBERSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas last year it put over 50 inches of rain into an area the size of New Jersey. It was the first category 4 hurricane to make landfall in the continental United States since 2004. It was an extraordinary amount of rain and a devastating event, leading to the largest housing disaster in the history of the United States. This led to 1.4 million Texans evacuating their homes, and 300,000 households were left without power. There was over $160 billion in damage. This is the second most expensive storm, Mr. Chairman, in American history, and the most expensive storm in Texas history. Hurricane Harvey was the third major flood to impact the people of Houston in my district since 2015. Mr. Chairman, I want to particularly thank my good friend, Mr. ALGREEN . We have worked together in the Houston area in a bipartisan fashion. All of us in the Houston area—ALGREEN , GENEGREEN , SHEILA JACKSON LEE, TED POE, and M ICHAEL MCCAUL, who is also working with us on this amendment and helped put this forward—all of us in the Houston area have worked together in a bipartisan fashion to help the people of Houston recover. We were proud to work together with the Florida delegation to help the people of Florida recover from Irma and Maria—and Puerto Rico. As the only appropriator from southeast Texas, I was proud to spearhead that effort in putting together three emergency hurricane supplemental bills, for a total of $141 billion, the largest amount of money the Corps commander tells me that he has ever seen in his 40 years of service at the Corps. Mr. Chairman, I particularly want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN  for his support. I want to thank the chairman of the Transportation Committee, Mr. SHUSTER —he and I were elected together in 2000—for his support on this important recovery effort. We are approaching the 1year anniversary of Harvey, and we have not forgotten the devastation that it brought to the people we represent. After we passed that emergency appropriations bill, after those agencies had received that money, one of our most important and, frankly, frustrating jobs is getting the agencies to release the money, to get it into the hands of the homeowners who had suffered, the business owners who had suffered, and to make sure that the Army 
Corps of Engineers is speedily carrying out the studies and recommendations that they have to do to build the flood control structures we need in southeast Texas. This amendment, Mr. Chairman, that Mr. MCCAULand I are putting forward today says, very clearly, that the Secretary of the Army shall expeditiously carry out these flood control studies and make sure that they are built as rapidly as possible. I can tell you from my position on the Appropriations Committee, as a subcommittee chairman representing southeast Texas, I will use all of the tools the Appropriations Committee has available to us, working with Chairman SIMPSON and Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , to ensure the Corps moves rapidly. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman SHUSTER for his support of this amendment. And I also thank my colleague, ALGREEN , for his support on this amendment today. We have worked together arm in arm in helping people recover from these three disastrous floods over the last 3 years. This amendment will make sure the Army Corps of Engineers completes these studies rapidly, that they execute quickly, and build whatever is recommended to help protect the people of Houston and southeast Texas from the next storm. We are going to make sure, as the people’s elected representatives, that our constituents’ very scarce, hardearned, and precious tax dollars are wisely and carefully spent in an expeditious way to rebuild and to protect us against the next giant storm. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. b1800 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for offering this amendment. As he clearly pointed out, this is important due to the historic hurricane season from last year. So I want to thank my good friends, Chairman CULBERSON and Chairman M CCAUL, for offering this. I am prepared to accept the amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. AL GREEN ), my colleague. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I thank all of my colleagues who have been associated with this amendment. Mr. Chair, this has been a bipartisan effort. Mr. CULBERSON and I have worked together not only on this effort, but also to serve people. We do have people who are still living in temporary shelter in Houston and we have people who are still awaiting FEMA’s assistance. With some 4.7 million people in the area having been impacted, it is exceedingly important that this amendment be adopted. Mr. Chair, I am appreciative that the chairman has indicated his support of it, and I thank Mr. CULBERSON , Mr. MCCAUL, and other colleagues for bringing this amendment to the floor. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with Chairman SHUSTER and with my colleagues in the House representing the great State of Texas in ensuring that this money gets out the door to our constituents as soon as possible to help them recover, and that the Army Corps of Engineers is moving as rapidly as humanly possible to complete these studies and build the flood control structures we have to have to protect the people of southeast Texas from the next storm. Mr. Chair, I urge passage of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CULBERSON ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 45 OFFERED BY MR . WEBER OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 45 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 4, after line 10, insert the following (and renumber the subsequent paragraphs accordingly): (1) by striking section 9003; (2) by redesignating sections 9004 through 9008 as sections 9003 through 9007, respectively; (3) in section 9003(c) (as redesignated by this section), by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(6) LEVEE SAFETY ACTION CLASSIFICA TION.—In carrying out risk characterizations for levee systems, the Secretary shall include, as a part of any Levee Safety Action Classification, the following information— ‘‘(A) a complete explanation of the way project condition, design, hydrology, flood frequency, probabilities of failure and overtopping and any other relevant factor were integrated in arriving at the rating assigned; ‘‘(B) all incremental corrective actions that can be taken to progressively improve the relative levee safety action classification assigned to a levee system; and ‘‘(C) the incremental costs associated with each corrective action in subsection (b).’’; (4) in section 9004 (as redesignated by this section), by striking subsection (b) (and redesignating the subsequent subsection accordingly); Page 4, line 11, strike ‘‘9005(g)(2)(E)(i)’’ and insert ‘‘9004(f)(2)(E)(i) (as redesignated by this section)’’. Page 4, line 14, strike ‘‘9008’’ and insert ‘‘9007 (as redesignated by this section)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, my amendment deals with flood control levees and the way the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is assessing and rating these vital communitybased, flooddefense systems. The Corps has been developing levee risk ratings around the United States without the close involvement of local project sponsors, and this is unacceptable. What is more, the agency is trying to characterize ‘‘flood risk to our communities’’ without routinely offering viable solution alternatives or wellinformed sitespecific cost estimates for these solutions. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Levee Portfolio Report from March of this year, the agency indicates the following on page 28: ‘‘ . . . there may be reluctance to share risk information with the public when an immediate and viable risk management solution has not been identified.’’ Reluctance? Reluctance indeed. The Corps has been developing a risk rating tool called the Levee Safety Action Classification, or LSAC. Local levee systems and affected communities are labeled as either very high risk, high risk, moderate risk, low risk, or very low risk for flood inundation. Thus far, 13 percent of the Corps’ program levees are in the very high, the high, or the moderate risk categories. Notably, these systems are estimated to have 8 million people that live or work behind them. My own district includes such an area near Freeport, Texas, where nationallysignificant manufacturing and R&D operations have occurred since 1940. These Corps ratings, which are to be widely broadcast to affected citizens, businesses, and community leaders, will have significant consequences for life safety and important secondary concerns like property values, economic development, zoning, and local governance. These ratings have been formulated without the sort of close local engagement that is required for successful flood hazard mitigation. Moreover, according to the Corps itself, the ratings are not accompanied by viable solution alternatives and cost estimates for these solutions. We can and must do better than this. My amendment enhances the Corps’ LSAC risk tool. It should not only assess levee system locations, conditions, and failure consequences from a Federal perspective, but also include affected levee owners and operators in communities in a completely integrated way to assess, communicate, and mitigate the full range of flood risks. Only then will we progressively improve the LSAC scores and, more importantly, improve local safety conditions with viable longterm economic solutions. This amendment does not remove Corps risk assessment and communication duties that were assigned by the 
Congress in the 2007 WRDA. To the contrary, it supplements these duties by assuring, A, that individual levee system LSAC ratings are transparent; and, B, that they play a meaningful role in expanding options and improving life safety outcomes. This is a nonpartisan, meritorious proposal with national application. It increases transparency and it improves both risk communication and actual risk mitigation. Finally, considering the scarcity of available taxpayer resources necessary for actual infrastructure improvements, my amendment also cuts some fat. For example, number one, it foregoes reestablishment of the Committee on Levee Safety. That committee produced a draft report in January 2009, and later updated, that formed the basis of the 2014 WRDA, which, by and large, has not been executed. Number two, the amendment eliminates the unfilled position of ‘‘Administrator of the Levee Safety Program’’ and accompanying authorization for ‘‘such staff as necessary.’’ The Chief of Engineers, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, eight Corps Division Commanders, 38 Corps District Commanders, multiple agency programmatic chiefs, and existing staff would seem sufficient to me to execute appropriate leveerelated policy authorized by Congress. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. POLIQUIN ). The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chair, this amendment, while potentially well intended, could have the unintended consequences of weakening the Nation’s safety standards for levees. I understand the gentleman plans to withdraw the amendment, and I commit to continue working with the gentleman on the issue. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ). Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding. Mr. Chair, I do want to thank the gentleman from Texas for raising this issue. I actually agree with him that there are fundamental problems in the levee safety program right now: number one, the fact that the Corps produces these worstcase scenario outcomes that they apply to levees without publicly making the data available on how they came to those conclusions; number two, the fact that they fail to provide alternative improvements with associated cost estimates on how these systems could be improved and ensure the resiliency and performance of these systems. There are many, many other concerns. I think the amendment does attempt to address some of those, but I think the gentleman also understands that there are some concerns that have been raised that I think are legitimate. Mr. Chair, I do want to ask the gentleman if he would be willing to withdraw the amendment. I would certainly be willing to work with the gentleman through that process to see if we can find something that everyone can agree to that makes sense without threatening the safety of our communities, which I know no one here wants to do. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, with that in mind, from the gentleman from Louisiana, if we can work together on this in attempting to address this. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. AMENDMENT NO . 46 OFFERED BY MR . MEEKS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 46 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 52, after line 24, insert the following: (21) Project for reformulation, East Rockaway Inlet to Rockaway Inlet and Jamaica Bay, Queens, New York. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from New York (Mr. MEEKS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, I am offering an amendment to expedite the Army Corps of Engineers’ study of Superstorm Sandy recovery efforts, allowing a faster response to dangerous and economically damaging beach erosion in my district and the Rockaway Peninsula. To this day, my constituents suffer from the aftereffects of Hurricane Sandy. Though coastal recovery has contributed to positive economic development, the very same jobs created are now threatened by emergency beach closures. Two weeks ago, only days ahead of beach season, of the beaches opening, 11 of our beaches’ central blocks were deemed unsafe due to erosion, by the city of New York and all of the lifeguards therein. As a result, it will be crippling to the vendors, whose entire livelihood depends on their seasonal income. Last year alone, there were four nor’easters that further devastated our beachfront. We have already allocated funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to begin constructing coastal protections and prevent further erosion. However, construction is not due to begin until 2019. In that time, beaches will be left vulnerable to coastal erosion, threatening more closures, and impacting more jobs and economic activity in my district. This should be of concern to all taxpayers. After Sandy, the Army Corps of Engineers dumped two Empire State Buildings’ worth of sand on our beach for coastal recovery. Stalled efforts to address resiliency issues, such as this study, are allowing millions of Federal dollars to be literally washed away. Mr. Chair, my constituents cannot wait until 2019 for construction of reinforced dunes, groynes, and jetties. The studies must be allowed to be improved and completed in a timely manner so as to not leave our beachgoers unsafe or our economy vulnerable. While I will continue to push for a remedy for this summer—I am going to push to try to save some of it—it is my hope that by expediting this process, the beaches will be made safe and operational for my constituents as soon as possible, and certainly no later than spring season of 2019. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. Of course, with the devastating effects of Sandy on Queens, New York, I understand his concern. Mr. Chair, given the impact of that storm and the importance of this amendment, I am prepared to accept the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking member from California for their understanding. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. MEEKS ). The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman SHUSTER , Ranking Member DEFAZIO, Subcommittee Chairman GRAVES , Ranking Member NAPOLITANO , and their staffs for working with us on drafting this amendment. My amendment requires the Corps to include any project or facility for which there is a final report for disposition from the Director of Civil Works to be in their future work plans, to the maximum extent possible. Mr. Chair, it is a straightforward amendment. I am proud to offer it. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment, which does require the Corps to include complete deposition studies in future Corps plans where practicable. Mr. Chair, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

AMENDMENT NO . 48 OFFERED BY MR . SMITH OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 48 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title I the following: 
(a) I NGENERAL .—After any flood event requiring operation or activation of any floodway or backwater feature within the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project through natural overtopping of a Federal levee or artificial crevassing of a Federal levee to relieve pressure on the levees elsewhere in the system, the Secretary shall expeditiously reset and restore the damaged floodway’s levees. (b) MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES  PROJECT .—The term ‘‘Mississippi River and Tributaries Project’’ means the Mississippi River and Tributaries project authorized by the Act of May 15, 1928 (Chap. 569; 45 Stat. 534). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri. Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of my amendment which protects the Mississippi River and Tributaries System and its floodways. The MR&T is our Nation’s most successful flood control and navigation system expanding from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, down through Louisiana near the Gulf of Mexico. Since 1928, the MR&T has prevented $1 trillion in flood damage and protected the lives of millions who live in the Mississippi Valley. The MR&T’s floodways and backwaters throughout the system relieve pressure on the Mississippi levees during flooding and are essential to keeping the system functioning. One of those floodways is in southeast Missouri, the Birds PointNew Madrid Floodway. In 2011, the Mississippi River experienced historic flooding, leading to the Army Corps’ decision to intentionally breach, with explosives, the Birds Point Floodway. As a result, 130,000 acres of land were flooded, destroying people’s homes, towns, and crops. The people of southeast Missouri are resilient and, in the aftermath of this tragic action, tried to pick up the pieces and return to their lives. Unfortunately, it was not until over a year and a half later that the Army Corps returned the destroyed levees back to their original design. There were even some who indicated that perhaps these levees not be built back at all. That is truly unacceptable. Floodway activation impacts not just residents in the floodways, but all of 4
1⁄2million people protected by the MR&T system. Floodways are a critical part of the MR&T, and their restoration after activation should never be in question. My amendment ensures that, in the event of activation of any floodway or backwater feature within the MR&T, the Army Corps will prioritize expedient restoration of the damaged floodway’s levees back to the original protection. Activation of any floodway on the MR&T has serious consequences and should only be done as a last resort. This amendment simply ensures activated floodway is restored. My amendment is essential to the peace of mind of all people living near floodways and to the proper function of the MR&T. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ). Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH) for offering this amendment. There was something that the gentleman noted in the end that I wanted to make sure legislative intent is preserved here, Mr. Chairman. The gentleman from Missouri stated that the amendment is intended to restore floodways after they are opened up, such as Bird PointNew Madrid, as opposed to perhaps in south Louisiana where a crevasse could open up that would provide fresh water and sort of mimic that natural process that created coastal Louisiana and would currently restore coastal Louisiana wetlands. Mr. Chairman, I want to ensure the intent of the amendment and that we have in legislative history here memorialized that this is intended to address the restoration of floodways as opposed to crevasses that may open in the aftermath of a flood. Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I would absolutely say that the gentleman from Louisiana is correct. It is for floodways and for restoration that have been activated. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the gentleman’s amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH). The amendment was agreed to.

(a) A SSESSMENT .—With respect to each project classified as class III under the Dam Safety Action Classification of the Corps of Engineers for which the Secretary has assumed responsibility for maintenance, as of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall assess— (1) the anticipated effects of the Secretary continuing to be responsible for the maintenance of the project during the period that ends 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act, including the benefits to the State and local community; and (2) the anticipated effects of the Secretary not continuing to be responsible for the maintenance of the project during such 15 year period, including the costs to the State and local community. (b) REPORT .—Not later than 90 days after completion of the assessment under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit a report summarizing the results of the assessment to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, thank you for recognizing me to discuss this revised Young amendment No. 49. I appreciate Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member DEFAZIO’s help and the help the majority and the minority staffs have given us with their assistance to get this amendment to the floor. This amendment requires the Secretary to conduct an assessment of dams classified as Class III under the Dam Safety Action Classification of the Corps of Engineers. Once the assessment is complete, this amendment requires the Secretary to provide a report to Congress describing two things: what will happen to local communities should the Corps give up the control of dam versus what will happen if the Corps continues to maintain the dam. This amendment will show the importance of accurate design and construction. Currently, there is a hole the size of a family sedan in a dam mitigation outlet tunnel that serves the city of Seward, Alaska. The Corps assumed responsibility for this dam, and the design and construction flaw will only get worse until the Corps fixes it, which they are committed to do. The current study for an alternative solution will not be completed until 2019. This amendment is critical to the Alaska community because it prevents Seward from bearing undue hardship from frequent flooding and continuous damage to the outfall due to the unforeseen design faults. This amendment would continue to require the Corps to expedite the study and place a critical importance on fixing the dam system for my constituents in Seward. I want to thank, again, Chairman SHUSTER , Ranking Member D EFAZIO, and their staffs for working with me and my staff on this amendment and for supporting my efforts here today. We will continue to work further on this issue in conference, and I urge all my colleagues to support my amendment No. 49. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Alaska for offering this amendment. As always, the gentleman is looking out for the State of Alaska and also small and rural towns across America. So this is an important issue, and I thank my colleague for working on this amendment. I am prepared to accept the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 50 OFFERED BY MR . COSTA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 50 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title I the following: 
Section 5 of the Act of June 22, 1936 (49 Stat. 1572, chapter 688; 33 U.S.C. 701h), is amended by inserting after ‘‘authorized purposes of the project:’’ the following: ‘‘ Pro vided further, That the Secretary is authorized to receive and expend funds, subject to the availability of appropriations, from an owner of a nonFederal reservoir to formulate, review, or revise operational documents for any nonFederal reservoir for which the Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations for the use of storage allocated for flood risk management or navigation pursuant to section 7 of the Act of December 22, 1944 (58 Stat. 890, chapter 665; 33 U.S.C. 709):’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chair of the committee and the ranking member and all of the staff for their support and work on this important amendment. It is a simple amendment to the Water Resources Development Act. Today, as a result of action taken by the Congress in the previous WRDA bills, the Army Corps of Engineers has the authority to accept funds from nonFederal interests to update rules that govern the operations of reservoirs owned and operated by the Corps. Unfortunately, there are a number of facilities that are regulated but not owned by the Corps of Engineers, and previous WRDA bills have failed to provide similar authority to accept funds to update the operations manuals. These manuals are very important as it relates to flood control issues. Although the Corps regulations specify that water operations manuals, including floodcontrol curves, should be reviewed and updated regularly, the reality is the Corps does not do this because they have got budget constraints. A Government Accountability Office report released in July 2016 found that the Corpsowned projects for revisions to water control manuals are often a lower priority than other operations and maintenance activities, such as equipment repairs, sediment removal, or levee repairs. As a result, the Corps oftentimes does not get to funding these revised water control manuals. This is important. We have floods all across the country, and it is important that these get updated. NonCorps section 7 projects have an even lower budget priority. The Merced Irrigation District in central California, which I have the honor to represent, is the owner of such a facility called New Exchequer Dam, an important reservoir that has served for decades and decades to provide water supply, flood control benefits for the people of the San Joaquin Valley. The Merced Irrigation District wants to improve the spillway and water storage of Exchequer Dam and Reservoir, and it is going to fund all of the improvements. But it has been prevented from doing so for years because the Corps doesn’t have the funding to review and to revise the project’s water control manual. As a matter of fact, the last time it was updated was over 30 years ago, which is of concern. So Merced offered—guess what—to pay for the process, but the Corps said, well, they can’t do that because they are not legally able to accept the funds. That doesn’t make any sense. So this amendment would resolve this by giving the Corps the authority to accept funds to update operation manuals from the owners of all of section 7 private facilities that are, in fact, regulated by the Army Corps of Engineers. So, for the good folks of eastern Merced County, this amendment will provide an opportunity for the Merced Irrigation District to explore the raising of the spillway gates at New Exchequer Dam, therefore increasing flood control protection and, at the same time, increasing the storage capacity of this reservoir that I said has existed for decades to, in some years, another 57,000 acrefeet of water. 57,000 acrefeet of water is an important addition. It is a lifeline—can be— to our way of life in areas like the valley where drought, as many as you have heard about, is an everpresent threat. Every drop of water counts. So I want to thank the cosponsors of my amendment—Representative DENHAM , Representative G ARAMENDI , and Representative MCCLINTOCK —for their working together on a bipartisan basis to provide not only tools for the Merced Irrigation District, but all other facilities, entities, local water agencies that have a similar type of project. This is a good, commonsense amendment. I know of no opposition to it. Not seeing anyone else who would like to speak on it, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ). 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding. I want to thank the gentleman from California for offering this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I actually want to discuss some of the provisions that were included in the manager’s amendment that I think are very, very important. Number one, there is a provision in the manager’s amendment that provides for the Corps of Engineers to take a fresh look at the old river control structure, a structure that diverts 70 percent of the water on the Mississippi River system down the Mississippi, and 30 percent down the Atchafalaya. That is a rigid structure that dates back decades and decades. It has not been revisited. The science has not been updated. It does not reflect the fact that we have additional monitoring stations; and so the plan, a rigid 70/30 split, doesn’t maximize benefits to the lower system. We could be maximizing crawfish production, coastal restoration, navigation features, flood control, and others, and it is not happening. So, Mr. Chairman, this amendment is designed to address that, to direct the Corps of Engineers to modernize this, to ensure that current best science is being applied; to ensure that the monitoring stations are being used and that we are having the best outcomes for ecological productivity, for coastal restoration, for navigation, and, importantly, for flood control, and then stop this rigid, antiquated system of an artificial 70/30 split. Secondly, the amendment also provides for a pilot program for 5 years for an operations and maintenance contract, a 5year operations and maintenance contract; instead of coming in and offering dredging contracts only when there is a shoal that has developed, instead, coming in and offering a longer term contract, over a 5year period, and ensuring that navigation channels are certain that the navigability of these channels at the port facilities are accessible. In many cases, vessels may actually start weeks in advance trying to get to the United States, and if these NAV channels aren’t maintained, these boats don’t have options but to divert to other ports that are lighter. It is expensive. We need to ensure the predictability and the certainty of our navigation channels, and the manager’s amendment addresses that as well. I want to thank the chairman again, Mr. SHUSTER , for including that. I want to thank Mr. DEFAZIO and Ranking Member NAPOLITANO for their work with us on that manager’s amendment and those important provisions. b1830 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment for his hard work on this piece of legislation. I appreciate all of his efforts and his knowledge he put into making sure that bill is a good product. Concerning Mr. COSTA ’s amendment, again, I believe it is a good amendment. It builds on WRDA 2016 on Corps ownedandoperated dams, so I urge all of my colleagues to support it. I accept the amendment at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 51 OFFERED BY MR . SOTO 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 51 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 42, line 24, insert ‘‘In making such information publicly available, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, endeavor to provide such information to all adjoining residential stakeholders of real property to which the Army Corps of Engineers holds an interest therein.’’ after ‘‘holds an interest.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would direct the Secretary of the Army to endeavor to inform all residential property stakeholders of adjoining Army Corps of Engineers’ interest in their adjacent property. Section 137 of this bill would expand public access to residential real estate data by placing information related to all real property data that the Army Corps holds an interest in online. Not all constituents have easy access to the internet. Elderly constituents may not be able to easily search information about Army Corps projects online. Thus, my amendment would expand access to the real estate information by directing the Secretary of the Army, to the maximum extent practicable, to endeavor to provide such information to all adjoining residential stakeholders of real estate with which the Corps holds an interest. By informing residential stakeholders, we will ensure they are aware of how Army Corps property interests might influence their property values, the enjoyment of their property, or their way of life. Mr. Chairman, I urge support for my amendment and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. This amendment does clarify the responsibilities of the Corps with respect to their rural neighbors, which for me, coming from rural Pennsylvania, it is extremely important, and I appreciate the gentleman offering this amendment. I am prepared to accept it at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his support, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 52 OFFERED BY MR . PAULSEN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 52 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 54, beginning on line 5, strike ‘‘the Secretary may not complete’’ and all that follows through ‘‘of the Senate on—’’ on line 9 and insert ‘‘the Secretary shall expedite completion of such study and shall produce a report on the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam that is separate from any report on any other lock or dam included in such study that includes plans for—’’. Page 54, line 10, strike ‘‘the feasibility of’’. Page 54, line 15, strike ‘‘and’’. Page 54, line 16, strike ‘‘the preservation of’’ and insert ‘‘a partial disposition of the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam facility and surrounding real property that preserves’’. Page 54, line 18, strike the first period and insert ‘‘; and’’ and strike the closing quotation marks and second period and insert the following: ‘‘(3) expediting the disposition described in this subsection (d).’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Chair, in offering this amendment, let me just start by letting folks know that I am offering this with my colleague, Representative ELLISON , who could not be with us today. Back in 2015 there was a bipartisan coalition of Minnesota lawmakers working with the folks on the committee, acting to protect Minnesota’s northern lakes and rivers from the spread of invasive species: specifically, Asian carp. Asian carp have spread up the Mississippi River System compromising water quality and crowding out native fish and sensitive species. So Congress stepped in and decided to instruct the Army Corps of Engineers to close the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock to commercial navigation to help mitigate the threat of the northern migration of this invasive species. With the upper lock closed, the Corps of Engineers undertook a disposition 
study of the lock and dam facility, and a vision for a visitor and interpretive center at that site became a consensus goal of the committee. The city of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board passed resolutions supporting repurposing the lock. My amendment would expedite this study and expand upon this work by authorizing a study looking into modifications to the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam to preserve and enhance recreation opportunities for the space, as well as preserve the health of the ecosystem and maintain portions of the lock and dam necessary to help maintain flood control. Now, the upper lock, which is located in the heart of the Twin Cities, is at the only major waterfall on the entire length of the Mississippi River. It presents a very unique opportunity to transform the waterfront of the Twin Cities. It is within the St. Anthony Falls Historic District. It is culturally, historically, and recreationally significant to the city and to our State. The Central Riverfront is a jewel of the State, and the Stone Arch Bridge and St. Anthony Falls are two iconic Minnesota features. The public interest here cannot be overstated, Mr. Chairman. There are several adopted plans for the area as a result, by the city, by the park board, by the downtown council, local neighborhoods, and the St. Anthony Falls Heritage Board. So, now, local governments have all come together, reflecting a readiness and a commitment to engage in this project. The upper lock disposition study should, therefore, move forward expeditiously. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER , Ranking Member D EFAZIO, Subcommittee Chairman GRAVES , for working with me on this amendment. I also want to thank my colleague, Representative ELLISON , who couldn’t be with us. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment, although I do not oppose it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota for his hard work and good work on this solid amendment. These changes are bipartisan, and as I said, I really appreciate his efforts on this. I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the chairman and my colleagues again for supporting the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RUTHER FORD ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 53 OFFERED BY MR . MOULTON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 53 printed in part A of House Report 115–711. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end of title I the following: 
Section 3(c) of the Act of August 13, 1946 (60 Stat. 1056, chapter 960; 33 U.S.C. 426g(c)) is amended— (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ‘‘$30,000,000’’ and inserting ‘‘$45,000,000’’; and (2) in paragraph (2)(B), by striking ‘‘$10,000,000’’ and inserting ‘‘$15,000,000’’. Page 55, line 1, strike ‘‘$3,000,000,000’’ and insert ‘‘$3,150,000,000’’. Page 57, line 24, strike ‘‘$3,000,000,000’’ and insert ‘‘$3,150,000,000’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 918, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to the Water Resources Development Act, which will increase funding for the Army Corps of Engineers’ storm and hurricane restoration and impact minimization program. As communities across the country come together to rebuild in the wake of unprecedented storms, this program funds vital coastal resiliency projects across the Nation. I emphasize ‘‘resiliency’’ because part of what this program does is save money by making costeffective investments now that will prevent that money from having to be spent on costly recovery efforts in the future. Over the past year, severe storms and hurricanes have devastated communities throughout our country, costing us billions of dollars in recovery efforts. We know that severe weather patterns are occurring at a more frequent rate, and with the 2018 hurricane season fast approaching, the cities and towns along our coasts need more resources to minimize the impacts of flooding, storm surges, and coastal erosion. What we don’t need are more outdated government projects that are wasting taxpayer dollars. And by cutting these, we fund the increases to this program. That makes this amendment fully offset and budget neutral. Cities and towns in my district and throughout the country are undergoing studies to assess the feasibility of implementing beach erosion and control projects under the storm and hurricane restoration and impact minimization program today. By raising the cap on this program’s authorization, we can ensure that the vital resources provided by the Army Corps are available to more districts throughout the country. There are States across the Nation that have already benefited from this program, from Alabama to Louisiana, from Alaska to Florida, Ohio, Virginia, New Jersey, and Indiana. All of these States, in addition to my home State of Massachusetts, have benefited from this innovative program. I am proud to have bipartisan support, and I think we need to come together to support this commonsense solution that will empower us to protect our coastal communities by leveraging private sector innovation to enhance coastal ecosystems, promote recreation, and save taxpayer dollars. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for offering this amendment, the program that assists communities in their efforts to recover and adapt to severe weather and natural disasters. It is a solid amendment. I support the amendment and accept it at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I would just like to thank the chairman for his help in supporting this amendment, and ushering it through the process. I think it is a good amendment, and I am proud to have bipartisan support for it. Mr. Chair, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ). Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I just want to take this time, since this is the last amendment, to thank Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member GRAVES for their support, but most of all, I want to thank our staff: Ryan Seiger, Mike Brain, Joe Sheehy, my own personal staff; but mostly, the legislative counsel, Kakuti Lin—it is a hard name—they worked tirelessly; and, of course, your staff, the Republican staff that worked with our staffs so well. And I thank Mr. SHUSTER . This is an example of bipartisan work on this WRDA bill. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. PAULSEN ) having assumed the chair, Mr. RUTHERFORD , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 8) to provide for improvements to the rivers and harbors of 
the United States, to provide for the conservation and development of water and related resources, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 918, he reported the bill, as amended by that resolution, back to the House with sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. b1845 
Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Vela´zquez moves to recommit the bill H.R. 8 to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: At the end of title I, add the following: 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) On August 26, 2017, Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm, made landfall in Texas, resulting in 103 deaths in Texas alone. (2) Approximately 336,000 Texas residents were left without electricity, and more than 17,000 homes sustained major damage. (3) All in all, Hurricane Harvey tied with Hurricane Katrina as the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the United States, causing $125 billion in damage. (4) On September 6, 2017, Hurricane Irma, a devastating Category 5 storm, raked across the United States Virgin Islands with reported wind gusts of 225 miles per hour, killing four people. (5) Soon after, on September 10, Hurricane Irma ripped across Florida with sustained wind speeds of 112 miles per hour. (6) Hurricane Irma resulted in 84 deaths and caused $50 billion in damage in Florida, making it the costliest hurricane in Florida history. (7) Two weeks after Hurricane Irma struck the United States Virgin Islands, Hurricane Maria, also a devastating Category 5 storm, struck the United States Virgin Islands, killing three people and leaving more than 13,000 structures roofless and 100,000 people without power or other essential public facilities such as running water. (8) On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria, by then a Category 4 storm, reached the shores of Puerto Rico with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour. (9) The impacts of Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma were catastrophic, with widespread devastation, uprooted trees, downing of weather stations and cell towers, and destruction and damage to homes throughout the islands. (10) Hurricane Maria caused all 3.3 million people in Puerto Rico to lose electricity, and access to clean water and food became limited to most. (11) According to recent press reports, full electrical power to Puerto Rico may not be restored until July or August of 2018, almost one full year after Hurricane Maria made landfall; this blackout is estimated to be the longest blackout in the history of the United States. (12) Thousands of people, many more than the Commonwealth’s estimate of 64, died in Puerto Rico as a result of the 2017 hurricanes, according to at least one recent study; health publications, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, have attributed this increase to the health care disruption for the elderly and the loss of basic utility services for the chronically ill. (13) Despite the devastating impacts of the 2017 hurricane season, and the fact that, close to one year after landfall of Hurricane Maria, a significant percentage of Puerto Rico’s population remains without basic public utility services, President Trump believes his administration’s response to the natural disaster deserves a grade of 10 out of 10. (14) Despite the dedicated humanitarian efforts of thousands of Corps of Engineers personnel in Puerto Rico since the 2017 hurricanes, the Secretary has not yet fully restored and increased the resiliency of the island’s public infrastructure. (b) RESTORATION AND RESILIENCY OF PUBLIC  INFRASTRUCTURE .—The Secretary shall take all necessary and proper actions to restore, and increase the resiliency of, public infrastructure in the continental United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands for which the Secretary is responsible and that was damaged as a result of Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, or Hurricane Maria. 
Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, as we debate today, Puerto Rico continues to reel from the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, a once inageneration disaster that fueled a humanitarian crisis. Nearly all 3.3 million residents of Puerto Rico lost power following the hurricane. Drinkable water and adequate food supplies became scarce throughout the island. Many have since endured the longest blackout in U.S. history. We all remember when President Trump went to Puerto Rico last September. While he was there, he said that—based on the thenreported 16 deaths—Maria was not ‘‘a real catastrophe. . . .’’ Every day it becomes increasingly clear how out of touch that statement was, and every day the magnitude of this disaster becomes clearer, as does the incompetence of this administration’s response. Just last week, the Harvard School of Public Health released a new estimate suggesting the death toll is staggeringly higher than previously thought. The Harvard study is just an estimate. However, if the number most often cited from that report—4,645—proves accurate, then Maria would rank as the second worst natural disaster in U.S. history. No matter what the President said, that is a real catastrophe. Now, as Puerto Rico continues struggling as thousands still do not have electricity and as we still do not know the total number of lives lost, we are entering another hurricane season. Yet Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands remain vulnerable should another storm come barreling out of the Atlantic into the Caribbean and make landfall. We should remember the 2017 hurricane season was not just devastating for the Caribbean. We cannot forget how the Houston area suffered under Hurricane Harvey. Houston’s layout and the city’s infrastructure also proved vulnerable to the flooding, causing $125 billion in damage. Yet despite 2017 being one of the worst in history for natural disasters and even though we are entering another hurricane season, our public infrastructure systems remain vulnerable. The motion to recommit is very straightforward. It would ask the Secretary of the Army Corps to work to restore and strengthen the resiliency of public infrastructure in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and in the mainland for areas damaged by Maria, Irma, and Harvey. This is common sense. It will mean we are better prepared for the next major hurricane. It could potentially save lives. In Puerto Rico, for instance, this would allow needed upgrades to the Guajataca Dam. The 90yearold dam, located on the northeastern shore of the island and owned by Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, was severely damaged after Maria. While the Corps did good work preventing the collapse of the dam, this was a temporary band aid. American families living in Puerto Rico still face imminent danger. The Corps should invest in this critical infrastructure project seeking to prevent future damage from another storm. In other areas throughout Puerto Rico, rivers, lakes, and wetlands serve literally as sinks for water to drain into. To control massive flooding in the next hurricane season, the Corps needs to make the necessary investments for flood control, something else this motion will help advance. Mr. Speaker, sadly, the administration largely abandoned Puerto Rico after Maria. Now we are learning the death toll from this tragedy will be heartbreakingly high. This Congress has a moral obligation to do everything possible to prevent future deaths and to protect our fellow citizens. That 
is what this motion to recommit will do. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the motion to recommit. This bill, H.R. 8, has many benefits to all 50 States and the territories, including Puerto Rico. It was put together in a bipartisan manner. We just here today adopted over 50 amendments in a bipartisan manner. This bill asserts congressional authority and continues regular order of the Corps of Engineers in authorizing these programs. It is fiscally responsible. We fully offset new projects. Finally, it keeps American jobs by strengthening our competitiveness ensuring that our transportation system remains attractive to privatesector jobs, so I oppose the motion to recommit. This being my last WRDA bill that I will ever be able to shepherd through the House, I am proud to be here. Hopefully we are going to have a conference report in the near future to be able to pass that on the House floor, but I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, I am very, very proud of my term as chairman. One of the accomplishments I am most proud of is getting WRDA back on regular order, every Congress authorizing these important programs so that the Corps can move forward and the American people can benefit by these programs. Again, I want to, first off, thank my Democratic colleagues and the Democratic staff on the other side of the aisle for their work, working together closely on this bill. Of course, I couldn’t get this done without my dedicated staff who have worked so tirelessly, not only on this bill but over the past 5 years, and I thank them from the bottom of my heart. Mr. Speaker, a personal point of order that I would like to take is that in 2016 when we passed the WRDA bill, September 28, 2016, I woke up that morning and found out that my mother had passed away. But I could hear her voice in my head saying: Go to work. Do your job. We came to work that day, and we were able to pass the WRDA bill in 2016. I was so proud that, as always, she was on my shoulder. This morning I woke up and didn’t think about the date until I realized today, June 6, is my mother’s birthday. It would have been her birthday. So, again, my mother who was always my greatest supporter and my greatest cheerleader was here again with me today. I can hear her voice telling me: Make sure you do your work. Our family chain is broken, and nothing seems to be the same. But as God calls one by one, that chain will link again. And today, as strong as ever, that link with my mother is with me. I want to thank my mother. I know she is watching down. Patricia Shuster, as always, is sitting on my shoulder, rooting me on to victory. So, again, today I am very, very proud of the WRDA bill. I am proud we are doing it on June 6, my mother’s birthday. Again, I thank everybody on both sides of the aisle for their efforts. Again, I oppose the motion to recommit and urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.

THE MEN WHO STORMED NORMANDY (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to remember and honor the 
men who stormed the beaches of Normandy 74 years ago today, June 6, 1944, known as DDay. The largest amphibious assault in the history of the world was also one of the bloodiest. By the end of the day, 10,000 Allied soldiers were killed or wounded. But with that, the irreversible liberation of Nazioccupied Europe had begun, and just a couple of years later, it would be complete. It is now 74 years again from that day, and most of those who were there to witness it are no longer with us. It sometimes seems we may forget that sacrifice that they and many others made so that we could all be free— liberate Europe and keep America safe. We must not lose sight of what is important. The obstacles we face today do not compare with the nightmare our fathers and grandfathers faced on those beaches. On DDay, Allied soldiers indeed carried the weight of the free world on their shoulders. The Nazi threat was obviously very real, and that threat was soon defeated. I pray that this generation and the next recognizes the gravity of this heroism, never forgets, and takes into account what it takes to remain free as a nation and as a people that love freedom and export that freedom. 
BARRY FAILE NAMED THE 2018 SHERIFF OF THE YEAR (Mr. NORMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to announce to the 115th session of Congress that Lancaster County Sheriff Barry Faile was named the 2018 Sheriff of the Year by the South Carolina Sheriffs Association. This honor was bestowed on Sheriff Faile by his peers representing 46 counties. He began his career in law enforcement 29 years ago where he began as a patrol deputy in 1989 and moved through the ranks of every department until 2009 when he was elected sheriff. Under the leadership of Sheriff Faile, the accomplishments include: national accreditation of his office; implementation of body cameras; Neighborhood Crime Watch programs grown from 12 neighborhoods to 37 in 2 years; and creation of the first Crowd Control Unit in 2017. In 2011, Sheriff Faile led the agency through a gang investigation resulting in one of the first grand jury indictments by the State Attorney’s office of 15 local gang members, along with the arrest of local members of the Hells Angels as part of a statewide crackdown. His commitment to the local Lancaster community includes serving as a board member of Springs Memorial Hospital, the Rotary Breakfast Club, and the USC Lancaster Educational Foundation. He is currently the president of the South Carolina Sheriffs Association. Sheriff Faile is only the third person in our area to win this prestigious award. f
