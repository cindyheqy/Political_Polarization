Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor former Congressman Ray Kogovsek, a dear friend who rep-resented the Third Congressional Dis-trict of Colorado before me. I ask that you keep him in your thoughts and prayers as he now faces a challenge far greater than any political race. Ray is a native of Pueblo, Colorado, and but for his college years and his tenure here from 1979 to 1985, he never left his hometown and never wanted to. His commitment to his community spread to encompass the entire Third District, which he came to serve after 10 years in the Colorado Legislature where I first met him. Ray won election to Congress in 1978 by 364 votes. In 1980, he faced the same challenger in a Reagan landslide year. He won by 22,000 votes. And in 1982, after redistricting changed half of his district, he handily won again. Ray won because of who Ray is. He is a man of gentle wisdom, wisdom about people, a man with a gut instinct to know what is right, a genuine man, a man who knows no anger. His achievements in his short time here in Congress were many. From a vast wilderness bill painstakingly built through his outreach and development of a coalition of broad support, to fund-ing to widen a beautiful highway through Glenwood Canyon to make it safer for road travel, to resolving a dec-ades-old boundary dispute for the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and his work on behalf of the Third District continued after he chose to leave Congress. He is known for his work on Western water issues and was awarded the pres-tigious Wayne Aspinall Award by the Colorado Water Congress, an award named after another Colorado con-gressman who served as chairman of the House Interior Committee. But I have a sense that what Ray val-ues most about his career in public service, about his advocacy for his dis-trict and for the West, are his friend-ships, the friendships that he found and nurtured here in these halls and be-yond. I want to thank Ray Kogovsek on be-half of the House of Representatives and the Third District and wish him and his family comfort and strength during this difficult time. f 
b1015 END HUNGER NOW—SNAP WORKS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. M
ARSHALL ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. M
CGOVERN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the House Agriculture Committee has held 21 hearings during the past 2 years on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. The com-mittee has heard over 30 hours of testi-mony from over 60 experts, both liberal and conservative, from all across the country. We have heard from aca-demics, advocacy groups, Federal and State government officials, charitable organizations, and even a few people who have relied on SNAP for food as-sistance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2903 April 27, 2017 
All of our witnesses have confirmed what we know to be true: SNAP works. It is a powerful program that helps to alleviate poverty and food insecurity, and it is worthy of our support. Today I would like to share with my colleagues a few of the most important takeaways from the 21 hearings I par-ticipated in as ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee. First, SNAP benefits should not be cut. Forty-two million Americans, in-cluding working families, veterans, seniors, children, and the disabled, struggle to put food on the table. In the richest country in the history of the world, I find that unconscionable. SNAP is a vital tool that helps strug-gling Americans get back on their feet, and participation has steadily declined as economic conditions have improved. Second, the current SNAP benefit is inadequate. On average, SNAP house-holds receive about $225 a month. The average benefit per person is about $126 per month, which works out to be a meager $1.40 per person per meal. You can’t buy a Starbucks coffee for that. Pamela Hess with the Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food and Agriculture, said it best during her testimony be-fore the Agriculture Committee: ‘‘ . . . people can’t parent well and raise happy, healthy children who are ready to learn, and you can’t work well if you are hungry, if you are wondering where your next meal is coming from. . . . ‘’ Cutting this meager benefit would be a rotten and heartless thing to do, es-pecially as so many in our country con-tinue to face incredible hardships. Third, SNAP does not discourage work. The majority of people on SNAP who can work, do work. Almost 70 per-cent of SNAP recipients aren’t ex-pected to work because they are kids, they are elderly, disabled, or caring for a young child or disabled family mem-ber. More than half of SNAP house-holds with at least one working-age, nondisabled adult do work while re-ceiving SNAP, and more than 80 per-cent work in the year before or after receiving benefits. Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents, known as ABAWDs, are limited to 3 months on SNAP out of every 3 years if they aren’t working. I don’t agree with that provision, but I have come to learn that some of my Republican colleagues want to shorten that time that these very vulnerable adults can remain in the program. Make no mistake, such a move wouldn’t help people find jobs; it would only make them hungry and more vulnerable. As Sherrie Tussler of the Milwaukee Food Bank noted in her testimony be-fore the Agriculture Committee: ‘‘Somehow, we have determined that punishing people with hunger will mo-tivate them towards work. Hunger doesn’t motivate. It dulls and it makes people sick.’’ Fourth, case management requires a well-funded, multiyear commitment. Case management that helps connect those in need with tailored services to move out of poverty can be successful, but those investments cost money. We need to adequately fund these efforts. Lastly, block grants threaten pro-grams that provide an economic ladder. Past Republican budgets have proposed block-granting SNAP, but we know from decades of experience that fund-ing for block-granted programs erodes over time and does not provide the same responsiveness to economic con-ditions that SNAP does. SNAP expands during times of eco-nomic hardship and contracts as the economy recovers. It successfully reaches those in need and is only lim-ited by the modest benefit calculation and hurdles to access like the ABAWD time limit. There is no reason whatso-ever, based on all of our hearings, to undermine SNAP through structural changes, block grants, further restric-tions, more onerous requirements, or cuts. At a minimum, the next farm bill must do nothing to make hunger worse in this country—period. Instead, we should focus on strengthening our antihunger safety net to make sure anyone who needs modest food assist-ance benefits has access to them. We need to support and expand innovative programs that help to increase the pur-chasing power of SNAP, and we need to increase SNAP benefits to provide fam-ilies who benefit from the program ac-cess to more nutritious foods that last them through the month. Mr. Speaker, today, chefs and advo-cates from across the country are on the Hill with Food Policy Action and Environmental Working Group to dis-cuss issues related to the farm bill, in-cluding our antihunger safety net. I urge my colleagues to listen to these chefs—they are food experts—and pay attention to them, especially when they ask you to support policies that will be aimed at ending hunger now.

THANKING SHERIFF JOHN SANNER FOR HIS SERVICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. E
MMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank recently retired Stearns County Sheriff John Sanner for his service to the people of Minnesota. For the past 33 years, Sher-iff Sanner has watched over our com-munity, ensuring our safety and the safety of our loved ones. In 1984, he started out as a patrol deputy and was elected sheriff 20 years later. After the horrific abduction of Jacob Wetterling in 1989, Sheriff Sanner was one of the main officers on the case. He worked for more than 26 years search-ing tirelessly for Jacob, hoping to fi-nally give Jacob’s family an answer. Years went by and, soon, decades, but Sheriff Sanner never gave up on Jacob or the Wetterling family. He stood by them until the case was finally solved just this past year, proving his dedica-tion to his job and to the people he served. Sheriff Sanner, I speak on behalf of all Minnesotans when I say thank you. We wish you a long, peaceful retire-ment spent with your family. f 
TRUMP ERA OF IMMIGRATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. G
UTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘This is a new era. This is the Trump era.’’ Mr. Speaker, those were the words of the Attorney General, the former Sen-ator from Alabama. The Attorney General has launched a campaign to paint immigrants as criminals, rapists, gang members, and ‘‘cartel henchmen.’’ In his prepared re-marks at the border a couple of weeks ago, the Attorney General planned to say the following: ‘‘It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.’’ When he gave the speech he edited out the words ‘‘this filth’’ because, I guess, calling immigrants from Latin America ‘‘filth’’ was even too extreme for this Attorney General. But it re-mains on the DOJ website. In fact, as far as the Attorney General is con-cerned, any immigrant who is here ille-gally is a criminal. He has ordered the government to prosecute immigration violations, even minor ones, to the full extent of the law and to make prosecution of immi-grants a top priority—on par with mur-der, drugs, counterfeiting, and kidnap-ping. He has ordered every one of the 94 U.S. Attorney Offices to appoint a spe-cial prosecuting attorney so that im-migrants are considered public enemy number one, nationwide—not drug dealers, immigrants. According to the latest Federal data, 46 percent of all new Federal criminal prosecution is immigration related—not narcotics. The second highest crime prosecuted accounts only for 14 percent of new Federal cases. In the new Trump era, a felony prosecution against an immi-grant who has been living and working here peacefully for decades is three times important than a felony prosecu-tion of a drug dealer. And that imbalance is not enough for the Attorney General. He wants to prosecute immigrants beyond the full extent of the law by turning mis-demeanors into felonies, and turning felonies into aggravated felonies. They think it will not look so ugly when the U.S. is deporting moms and dads who have raised successful families—or de-porting children who grew up in the U.S. from the time they were tod-dlers—if the Attorney General and his team can look and tell the American people they were just thugs, gangbangers, and rapists. Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump want more immigrants criminalized, felonized, and deported. Yes, we are truly in the Trump era.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2904 April 27, 2017 
But let’s be frank. This is not a sur-prise when Donald Trump descended the gold escalator and announced his candidacy for President. Almost the first words out of his mouth were Mexi-cans are rapists, murderers, drug deal-ers, and immigration is turning Amer-ica into a war zone. When he was a Senator from Ala-bama, the Attorney General made a ca-reer of associating immigrants with crime and doing his best to defeat re-forms that would strengthen legal im-migration and reduce illegal immigra-tion. Deportation, criminalization, and restricting legal immigration were the bedrock of this Attorney General’s ap-proach when he was a U.S. Senator. Our legal immigration system al-ready works fine according to both Senator and Attorney General Ses-sions, no matter that some people who are receiving their visas today applied for them when Bill Clinton was Presi-dent and that those applying for visas today will probably get them when Chelsea Clinton is President of the United States. Mr. Speaker, when your constituents say, ‘‘Hey, why don’t those immigrants come here legally?’’ or, ‘‘Why don’t they just go back and come back le-gally?’’ the answer is clear: as a Sen-ator, our Attorney General made sure that that was impossible. Next week, millions of Americans will take to the streets to demonstrate against mass deportation, the border wall, prison beds, and drive-by deporta-tions. But it is not because we are soft on crime or love immigrants more than the people who were born here. No. We have a different vision of what the United States is and should always be. We are not an incarceration nation, a nation hostile to other countries and their people. We are a great nation, a nation that, in her greatness, is a bea-con of hope to refugees, a land of op-portunity for entrepreneurs, and a de-mocracy with separate branches of gov-ernment that act as effective checks and balances on unlimited power. The American people are sensible, fair, and pragmatic, and are correct when they reject the idea that a wall makes sense in the 21st century as the centerpiece of our immigration policy. We are not persuaded by the poetry of the Attorney General when he stands at the border and says: ‘‘It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.’’ No, we think of another, better poem, the one at the Statue of Liberty, the lady with her torch in the harbor, who shares our deeply held values as Americans and says every day to the entire world at that harbor: ‘‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.’’

CONGRESS SHOULD VOTE ON CON-TINUING POLICY IN AFGHANI-STAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. JONES ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, last week was another reminder of the chaos in Afghanistan. Tragically, 200 Afghan soldiers were killed by the Taliban; but, unfortunately, that is no surprise. After 16 years in Afghanistan, abso-lutely nothing has changed. If any-thing, it has gotten worse. The Amer-ican taxpayer, United States military, and the marines in my district are frustrated with the 16 years of contin-ued chaos. That is why Mr. G
ARAMENDI  and I have introduced H.R. 1666 and have been joined by seven of our col-leagues. Our bill asks that Congress be able to debate and vote on whether we should or should not continue our cur-rent policy in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, I bring this poster on the floor as a reminder. Let me say to you today and my fellow colleagues that we have spent over 800 billion tax-payer dollars, over 2,200 American serv-icemembers have died, and over 20,000 of our troops have been severely wounded. The waste, fraud, and abuse is just as bad, if not worse, today than at the very beginning of 2002. Now, some 300 additional marines, mainly from Camp Lejeune in my dis-trict, have been deployed to Afghani-stan this spring, and we have had no discussion of that on the floor of the House. Mr. Speaker, I am calling on P
AULRYANas Speaker of the House to permit a new debate on our future in-volvement in Afghanistan and whether or not our young men and women should be sent to war, as there are more than 300 Members of the House of Representatives that were not here in 2001 that have never had a debate or a vote on Afghanistan and the policy of Afghanistan. It is time that the Congress interject itself. It is our constitutional responsi-bility to send our young men and women to die for this country, and yet we do not ever have a debate. That is why the bill that Mr. G
ARAMENDI and I have put in, H.R. 1666, will simply say that the House will have a debate on whether we should or should not be in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know why that is asking too much because it is our constitutional duty. Nothing that we vote on in this House of Representa-tives is as sacred as sending a young man or woman to die for this country. b1030 I have sent a letter to P
AULRYANas recently as yesterday asking him to please give us the ability that we have taken the oath to debate war. And the Speaker of the House can order the committees of jurisdiction to send an authorization of military force to the floor of the House for debate. Mr. Speaker, for all of our men and women in uniform, all of the families of our men and women in uniform who have died for this country, please, Con-gress, let’s join together, Republican and Democrat, and let’s debate the fu-ture of Afghanistan. CONGRATULATING RABBI ELYSE FRISHMAN ON HER RETIREMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my friend and spir-itual mentor, Rabbi Elyse Frishman, for her 22 years of exceptional service to Barnert Temple in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. After decades of service to the Jewish community, Rabbi Frishman will be re-tiring this June. Personally, I am very lucky to call Rabbi Frishman my rabbi. In addition to leading our congrega-tion, she is the editor of the reform prayer book ‘‘Mishkan Tefilah,’’ and a national leader in worship and con-gregational engagement. Rabbi Frishman has stood as a model citizen and faith leader, going the extra mile to bring together the com-munity in times of anxiety and fear. She was recently featured by The Bergen Record for her work to unite the interfaith communities in a com-mon mission, forming dialogues, under-standing, and building friendships where they didn’t exist before. In doing so, she has long set an exam-ple for the families of our congrega-tion. As a parent, I am glad my chil-dren are growing up knowing and being led and educated by her in our faith community. Rabbi Frishman deserves to be held up as a model for public service. And though our congregation and I will miss her deeply, I congratulate her on her retirement, and I hope everyone en-joys the evening celebrating her years of service to us. America and our com-munity has been very lucky to have Rabbi Elyse Frishman. Thank you, Rabbi Frishman.

MODEI ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor Captain Joshua Byers, a fallen soldier, son, husband, brother, and friend. In Sparks, Nevada, Captain Byers lives on as a legacy. His kind heart, pa-triotic soul, and strong ideals of serv-ant leadership have left a strong and lasting impact on everyone who knew him. Captain Byers attended Edward C. Reed High School in Sparks, the home of the Raiders. Although not originally from Sparks, Captain Byers moved with his mother, father, and two younger brothers to chase a dream and God’s calling in Nevada. While at Reed High School, he joined the Naval Junior ROTC program and various other clubs, all while maintain-ing excellent grades. When he reached his senior year, he was student body president, the bat-talion commander of the Junior ROTC

unit, and in line to be valedictorian on graduation. One of his biggest dreams was to at-tend one of the Nation’s service acad-emies. After he completed his 4 years at Reed High School, he accepted an appointment to the United States Mili-tary Academy at West Point, Hudson High. Upon graduating from West Point, he earned an Army Ranger tab and was deployed to Iraq in 2003, where he was killed in action due to an IED explo-sion. His legacy lives on at Reed High School, especially in the NJROTC pro-gram. Through an award given there by one of the past instructors as well, there is now being more done in order to memorialize a hero who left such a profound impact on those who knew him and were around him. The NJROTC hallway at Reed High is going to be completely dedicated to Captain Byers, being named the Cap-tain Joshua T. Byers Leadership Me-morial Hallway. In this hall you can find Captain Byers’ uniform, awards, military deco-rations, and various pictures and sto-ries to help capture the essence of this hero in our hearts and minds. Mr. Speaker, I ask today that we keep the Byers family and Joshua in our prayers and thoughts.

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S PROMISE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP AND 100 DAYS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. K
APTUR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, we are quickly approaching President Trump’s first 100 days in office, and the swamp he pledged to drain now has been stocked with Wall Street’s finest. President Trump made a big jobs promise to working people across this country in his campaign. But hundreds of steel workers in places like Lorain, Ohio, are being terminated due to con-tinuing Korean and Chinese imports being dumped into this marketplace. The President seems to have a raft of bankers from Goldman Sachs advising him on the global economy, but where is his trade team that is supposed to protect workers like I represent in the State of Ohio? This is the backdrop to the 2018 budg-et the President has chosen to send up to Congress. His 2018 budget rewards Wall Street—anybody surprised—and hurts Main Streets in places like Lo-rain and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Michigan and Indiana and Wisconsin, the States that carried him into the Presidency. Vice President Joe Biden once said: ‘‘Show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value.’’ Well, President Trump’s budget ap-parently doesn’t value the people of the Great Lakes States because it zeros out the Great Lakes Restoration Ini-tiative and other programs under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-ministration and the Environmental Protection Agency that are trying to help us clean up water, the source of all life. Look what he is doing to job training programs, to Meals on Wheels, to after-school care, programs that the middle class cares about and are vital to life: slash, slash, slash. More bankers in there from Goldman Sachs and Wall Street. To make matters worse, the Trump administration has a total disregard for ethics, as they clearly violate the Emoluments Clause of our Constitu-tion. President Trump and his children have still failed to fully divest their as-sets and put them in true blind trusts to prevent real and dangerous conflicts of interest. How about the number of patents that China has just granted to the Trump family, including Ivanka Trump? How about that? When the President has changed his position on China from what he said in the cam-paign and now it is a little bit different and the patents just got approved after sitting on the shelf for a decade, does that strike anyone as unusual? The Trump administration is not draining the swamp. This President is filling it with broken promises to the American people who are depending on him and his administration to make a difference for people who need atten-tion across this country. f 
SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. B
ACON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about Sexual Assault Awareness Month and the need to sup-port those who have been victimized by this terrible crime. According to the National Sexual Vi-olence Resource Center, nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 10 men will experience sexual violence, and 7 out of 10 sexual assault cases are committed by some-one who the survivor knows. Nearly 50 percent of female survivors will experience PTS, or post trauma stress, and per the Rape and Incest Na-tional Network, only 2 percent of those offenders will spend jail time or be con-victed of a felony. Sex trafficking is a prevalent prob-lem, and according to the U.S. State Department, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international bor-ders. Of those numbers, 80 percent are female and half are children. Sex trafficking occurs when someone uses fraud, force, or coercion to cause a commercial sexual act with an adult or cause a minor to commit a commercial sexual act. Thus, victims of sex trafficking are also victims of assault. They are threatened, taken from families and loved ones, and forced to commit acts they would not do on their own free will. These statistics demand action. I per-sonally know victims of sexual assault, and I have tackled it head-on while as a commander. I started this journey when I was a commander at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany. When I arrived there as a new base commander in 2008, the allegations of sexual assault were too high. I imple-mented a two-step solution to address the problem. First, all rape accusers, if willing to testify, would have their day in court, have their day to say what happened to a jury. Second, those convicted of rape would have their names and prison sen-tences distributed widely around the base. Our rates immediately improved. This program was later ranked by the Air Force as the number one sexual as-sault response program—the number one in the Air Force. So I take this issue seriously. I recently met with Courtney, a con-stituent in my district in Omaha, who was sexually assaulted while serving as a marine. She shared her story with me, including how she was treated after reporting the rape. And what she told me greatly disheartened me. I could not believe that someone who proudly served in uniform was basi-cally ostracized by the very people she served with. She felt persecuted and ignored for daring to report an assault that should not have occurred, from simple acts of being ignored to having her belongings thrown out of the barracks in black trash bags by her fellow servicemen. Courtney was not only a victim of as-sault, but a victim of repeated back-lash from superiors and colleagues. Courtney developed PTS because of not only the assault, but how she was treated for reporting the assault. In my district office is Makayla, an intern who at the young age of 15 was molested by her father. Makayla’s par-ents were divorced, and one weekend when she was alone with her biological father, the horrendous crime took place. She would live in fear for the next 2 years until, finally, by the grace of God, she told her mom what happened. The days following were a whirlwind, from giving testimony to telling her grandparents what their son had done to her. The lives of both women will never be the same. However, they both know and both knew that God would turn their trauma into triumph. Makayla is now a college student at the University of Nebraska Omaha and shares her story at colleges, schools, nonprofits, and other organizations all over Nebraska. After graduating, she wants to work in politics to change the policies surrounding sexual assault cases. Courtney is also speaking out and has started a blog on social media sites detailing her journey to recovery and sharing her story so others know that they are not alone.

She also will be staying in touch with me about potential legislation and ideas to help those who are victims of sexual assault in the military. There are many in Omaha who de-serve recognition for the work they do every day to combat sexual assault and human trafficking to help victims. The Women’s Center for Advancement helps victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. They have a hotline that vic-tims can call and make that their first step in getting the help they need. Project Harmony offers victims of child sexual assault the opportunity to take forensic interviews instead of hav-ing to appear in court, which can re-traumatize the victims. The Coalition on Human Trafficking is training staff at hotels and motels to be able to identify possible victims of sex trafficking. The goal is to provide the awareness training to all hotels within a 50-mile radius of Omaha, and to date they have trained over 85 loca-tions. Finally, we can’t forget the members of law enforcement who work tirelessly to catch those responsible for sexual assault and human trafficking. With-out them, there would be so many more victims who would still be abused, assaulted, and traumatized. And while there are law enforcement and others dedicated to stopping these assaults and human trafficking, there is more that could be done. Earlier this month I joined my col-leagues as an original cosponsor on H.R. 2052, also known as the PRIVATE Act, which would amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to provide harsher penalties to anyone who en-gages in what is known as revenge porn. The Violence Against Women’s Act of 1994 also helps provide some justice. This act used Federal funds to help in-vestigate and prosecute sex offenders and establish the Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice, a program we must continue to support. Finally, I have agreed to cosponsor H.R. 1035, the Extending Justice for Sex Crimes Act of 2017, which amends the statute of limitations for a victim of human trafficking or a Federal sex-ual offense to seek and recover dam-ages. This bill sets a 10-year statute of lim-itations from the date the victim dis-covers the offense or injury and not when it occurred to file a civil action. It also extends the statute of limita-tions for a minor victim to file a civil action for 10 years from the date that the victim turns 18. Currently it stands at 3 years. Sexual assault and exploitation is a social problem and a crime. We need to step up and assist with prevention of these acts, prosecute the perpetrators, and provide the provisions for re-sources for victims. b1045 NATIONAL MINORITY HEALTH MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. D
ANNY K. D AVIS) for 5 min-utes. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, April is National Minority Health Month, and I have pledged to use every opportunity that I can to promote awareness, greater under-standing, and direction toward solu-tions to some of our health needs and problems. I have with me today a statement from one of the staff members in my district office who describes what it is like to live with sarcoidosis. She begins her statement by saying: 
Hello. My name is Shonna Latrice Smith, and I have sarcoidosis. Living with sarcoid-osis has been a tough battle for me, not knowing what other parts of my organs could be affected by this terrible disease. I began having symptoms of experiencing hoarseness for months at a time, swollen lymph nodes, loss of weight, loss of breath, severe joint pain with deformity in my fin-gers. My face and arms showed noticeable skin lesions with severe swelling. I experi-ence most mornings chronic dry coughs that feel like my chest would burst open. After a series of blood tests, X-rays, pul-monary testing, and skin biopsies, test re-sults indicated sarcoidosis, I began to have anxiety attacks. Because I had no clue where, when, and how I contacted this dis-ease, I didn’t know if it would affect the lon-gevity of my life. I began with small doses of prednisone orally to treat inflammation and swelling, including steroid injections to my face, arms, and fingers to reduce swelling. My battle with sarcoidosis has affected my getting up, walking with struggling not to lose my balance due to my joints being stiff and sore. Doctors begin treating me for rheu-matoid arthritis with a medication called methotrexate, a chemotherapy agent and im-mune system suppressant to treat auto-immune diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. After taking methotrexate for about a year, doctors saw no change in the swelling of my hands and face, so I began taking a new medication called Plaquenil also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, skin diseases, and autoimmune diseases. I am currently taking prednisone to continue to treat se-vere swelling for my face and hands. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Smith for sharing this information and this expe-rience with us. Therefore, I urge that we continue to support research so that we may find more effective treat-ment and a cure for sarcoidosis and other disease entities. It is my position that health is wealth. We can have all of the other at-tributes of life, but if we have chronic disease that has not been cured or for which we are not sure of a cure for, then that takes away from the quality of life for the individuals with those ex-periences. Therefore, I reiterate that research could be the answer.

PRAYER Pastor Melissa Hatch, Prosper United Methodist Church, Prosper, Texas, of-fered the following prayer: Almighty and gracious God, today we are grateful for Your guidance and Your presence in our lives. We humbly follow Your lead and direction. When our own decisions seem too dif-ficult to navigate, help us to turn to the One who never slumbers or sleeps. When we are impatient for decisions, help us to wait upon You for the right way to go. Strengthen us for the work that You have called us to do. Help us to work together for the common good and reach across lines to be Your hands and feet in a world that desperately needs You. When times and situations seem un-certain, help us cling to the hope that we find in You. And in the words of Micah 6:8, help us to act justly, love kindness, and walk humbly with our God. We pray all of this in Your mighty name. Amen.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Don Davidson for 50 years of teaching and coaching at Yorkville High School, Aurora Chris-tian, and Parkview Christian Academy. Coach Davidson’s ability to inspire and energize his students of all ages has led them to hundreds of victories on the basketball court, earning him a place in the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Not only does Don hold the second longest home winning streak in Illinois history, with 80 wins from February 1988 until Feb-ruary 1997, but his exceptional coach-ing has secured 677 career varsity wins, 10 IHSA regional titles, 5 IHSA sec-tional titles, and 3 ACSI Great Lakes championships. More importantly, Don is a generous, compassionate mentor who cares deep-ly about the lives of his students off the court. Don, thank you for your 50 years of service to our community and, most importantly, for embodying the life of Christ to your students and to their parents, like me.

VOICING SUPPORT FOR SCI-ENTISTS AND FEDERAL WORK-ERS (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice support for the dedi-cated public servants who make this country great. President Trump campaigned on a promise to drain the swamp, and in-stead he nominated unqualified Wall Street executives and career politi-cians for Cabinet and senior-level posi-tions, leaving the next level of appoint-ments almost entirely unfilled, all while threatening to cut the experi-enced Federal workforce who make our government work well every day. As the only Ph.D. physicist in Con-gress, I know that many of these Fed-eral workers and their support staff are scientists who work every day to ad-vance innovation and improve our standard of living. The Department of Energy, for example, relies on sci-entists with technical expertise to run our national labs. The success of their work depends on long-term sustained funding and a continuity of competent leadership to make their new ideas a reality. But our President’s skinny budget would destroy scientific funding and force us to give up our place as a leader in innovation, and many of his appoint-ments are insulting jokes. So last weekend I joined the March for Science because it is clear that this adminis-tration does not value science and sci-entific enterprise. I call on my colleagues here today to support scientists and Federal workers. And if a swamp needs to be drained, the place to start is Mar-a-Lago. f 
TAX FREEDOM DAY (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last Sunday marked Tax Freedom Day, determined by the Tax Foundation, led by President Scott Hodge. This is the day when our citi-zens have earned enough money to pay their tax bill for the year. It is alarming that American tax-payers must work 113 days to foot the bill for their annual tax obligation. Collectively, American families spent more on their taxes this year than on food, clothing, and housing combined. This is an abuse of the American peo-ple, limiting their ability to spend their own hard-earned wages. As Tax Freedom Day is pushed later each year, we must commit to com-monsense reforms to the Tax Code. The Federal Government takes too much from American workers with an obses-sive push to increase taxes, destroying jobs. I am encouraged by the tax plan President Donald Trump outlined yes-terday and look forward to working with him to provide tax reform that will create jobs, simplify the Tax Code, and grow the economy. I am confident that, by working together, we can de-liver comprehensive, balanced tax re-forms for American families which will promote jobs. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
f 
PUERTO RICO MEDICAID FUNDS EVAPORATING (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, while my Republican colleagues take their sweet time passing a bill to fund the government, Puerto Rico is watching its Medicaid funds evaporate. In this package, we must provide suf-ficient resources to address this short-fall from the funding authorized under the ACA that is already owed to the people of Puerto Rico. I remind Congress the funding under discussion would close a Medicaid shortage that was created by the un-equal treatment of American citizens in Puerto Rico, fueling a healthcare crisis of historic proportions. Last year, Speaker PAULRYANcom-mitted to helping the people of Puerto Rico. As he, himself, recognized, these are our fellow citizens. Yes, Mr. President, they are Amer-ican citizens. They have fought, shed blood, and given their lives in nearly every major war, yet they have been treated unfairly for decades. Donald Trump’s own HHS Secretary recently acknowledged Puerto Rico needs $900 million to fund Medicaid. For once, I agree with the Secretary. 
f 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION ACT (Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, a labor union’s purpose is simple: to represent its members and to bargain on their be-half. But for millions of Americans who are currently paying union dues, their money is sometimes being used for po-litical advocacy that they may not support. The First Amendment in our Con-stitution grants workers around the country the freedom to donate or not to donate to any political cause. As it currently stands, however, union mem-bers have to opt out of having their dues spent on certain political activity. This process can be burdensome, and it can be complicated and time con-suming. Instead of asking workers to go through a lengthy process just to avoid funding political causes they don’t sup-port, they should have the choice from the start whether to opt in to that spending or not. Earlier this week, I introduced the National Paycheck Protection Act that would require an employee’s consent before their labor organization dues are used for any purpose not directly re-lated to collective bargaining. Mr. Speaker, union members are Americans before they are Republicans or Democrats, and this simple change would be the first step in the fight for more worker freedom.

DRAIN THE SWAMP (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Saturday marks 100 days since Presi-dent Trump took office. He is far from ‘‘draining the swamp’’ as promised. He stacked his administration with bil-lionaires, family members, and people with dangerous ties to Russian inter-ests. His national security policies have been a far cry from the steady-handed

decisionmaking he promised. From Mar-a-Lago missile strikes to aggres-sive and impulsive national security rhetoric, the President has made our foreign policy as murky as swamp water—a dangerous practice in today’s world. One hundred days in, the President is heavy on alternative facts and light on action. Where is his job bill? Where is his infrastructure and cybersecurity plan? Where is all of the ‘‘winning’’ we were supposed to be sick of by now? It has been 100 days, Mr. President. It is time to do something the American people can get behind. You can start by draining the swamp you created at the White House. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to rec-ognize the life and legacy of Donna Lynn Johnson who, for 40 years, brought quality eye care to the South Side of Chicago. She will be greatly missed by her patients, family, and es-pecially her niece, Donna Miller. Lastly, I am proud to have Baily Lynn Compton from Texas as my shad-ow today.

THE WORLD’S BIGGEST FISH FRY, PARIS TENNESSEE (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the World’s Biggest Fish Fry, which hap-pens to be this week in Paris, Ten-nessee. Each year at the end of April, people from all across the country travel to west Tennessee to take part in a week-long celebration that in-cludes parades, a carnival, rodeos, dances, catfish races, and much more. The Fish Fry, as folks call it in west Tennessee, originated in 1938 as one of the many ‘‘Mule Days,’’ when farmers gathered to trade their products, do their shopping, and enjoy the fellow-ship of their community. By the 1950s, the tractor replaced the mule, so the good citizens of Paris and Henry County started a new event that is now known in west Tennessee and around the country to be ‘‘The World’s Biggest Fish Fry.’’ The festival ends with the main event this Friday, April 28, when more than 5 tons of catfish will be cooked, leading up to a grand 2-hour finale of parades. I thank the Paris-Henry County Chamber of Commerce for their leader-ship in preserving this great west Ten-nessee tradition.

b1215 REPUBLICAN HEALTH CARE (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the new Republican healthcare scam, again, slams good hardworking Americans with higher costs and less healthcare coverage. Fewer people will have healthcare cov-erage, and insurance companies will in-crease their already record profits. And what would a Republican healthcare bill plan be without a mas-sive tax cut for high-paid insurance ex-ecutives? UnitedHealthcare is one of America’s largest insurers and is under investiga-tion by the Department of Justice for defrauding Medicare and the American people out of billions of dollars over the past decade. On page 67, in seven words, this Re-publican bill gives their chief executive officer, who made $66 million in 2014, a massive tax cut. Mr. Speaker, this is disgusting and morally reprehensible. f 
TAKE YOUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS TO WORK DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today there are a lot of children in the Capitol for Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day. While my three sons are all grown and scattered across the country, I do have the privilege of having Seth Lewis Parish with me today. Seth lives in Maryland, and thanks to the nonprofit Tuesday’s Children, he gets to spend the day with me—or bet-ter yet, I get to spend the day with him. Seth is 7 years old and actively in-volved in his Cub Scout pack. I was really glad to hear that, as I am an Eagle Scout who has been involved in Scouting all my life. Seth is in the first grade. He is a Tiger Scout, plays ice hockey, and also participates in tae kwon do. In 2009, Seth’s dad was serving in the Army and lost his life about a month before Seth was born. Tuesday’s Chil-dren uses its experience and expertise to help our military families work through their own losses. Seth’s mom, Debbie, dropped him off at my office this morning. He is the best-dressed guy today on the floor and, very frankly, on Capitol Hill, right over there. Seth, I hope you are having a good day shadowing an old Scout like me.

CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, yes-terday Representative F
ITZPATRICK and I introduced a bipartisan resolution calling on the House to commit to the removal of political gerrymandering from congressional redistricting and to improve the public confidence in our electoral process. Every citizen in every State deserves to have the same ability as citizens in States like California, Arizona, Hawaii, and Ohio, who now have to draw their Congressional district boundaries with-out the influence and gamesmanship of politics. The political gerrymandering of our congressional districts, which attacks at the very bedrock the right of every American to fair representation, has seriously undermined the public’s trust in our democratic system. Mr. Speaker, it is time to get the back room out of the ballot box and let the people decide. f 
HONORING U.S. CHESS TEAM FOR ITS GOLD MEDAL VICTORY AT 42ND WORLD CHESS OLYMPIAD (Mr. LUETKEMEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the U.S. Chess Team for its historic victory in the 42nd Chess Olympiad held in Baku, Azerbaijan, this past September. The last time the United States won this competition was 40 years ago at the 1976 Chess Olympiad in Haifa, Israel. At that time, the gold medal was determined by the outcome of a single game that lasted 14 hours and contained 111 moves, and eventually ended in our favor. The final round in Baku was even more strategic, with the gold medal de-termined by a brilliant final move. The game was close, but the United States Chess Team took home the gold once again. Today I would like to honor the six members of the winning chess team as well as their coach. This was a great accomplishment for the United States. I am honored to have the opportunity in Congress to recognize them. For the next 2 years, the Olympiad trophy will rest and be on display at the World Chess Hall of Fame in St. Louis, Missouri. I look forward to rec-ognizing the team’s accomplishments in my home State.

THE FCC AND NET NEUTRALITY RULES (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, yester-day the new Trump-appointed FCC Chairman announced his mission to un-dermine the net neutrality rules that we fought so hard to put in place. In 2015, over 4 million people sub-mitted comments calling on the FCC to keep the internet open and fair. How-ever, the FCC’s new Chairman, who used to work as counsel for Verizon, wants to turn the internet into a sys-tem of pay-to-play fast lanes for Big Money and people who can afford it, leaving everyone else behind in the slow lane. This hands the levers of access over to big ISPs at the expense of students,

small businesses, entrepreneurs, inde-pendent content creators, and millions more. In today’s digital age, maintaining open and equal internet access is essen-tial to breaking down barriers in edu-cation, media, expanding access to jobs and employment, driving innovation in health care, and so much more. We must stand strong in opposition to the FCC’s attack on fairness, equal-ity, and net neutrality.

CELEBRATING GULFSTREAM’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of Gulfstream Aerospace, the largest private sector employer in Georgia’s First Congressional District. Gulfstream’s origins as an aerospace company are steeped in American his-tory. During World War II, Roy Grum-man built war planes for the United States during the war. After the war ended, he sought a new use for his re-sources and, in 1958, founded Gulf-stream to build business airliners in-stead. Mr. Grumman’s first project, the Gulfstream I, made its first flight on August 14, 1958. This purpose-built business aircraft was the first of its kind and revolutionized general avia-tion. Gulfstream produced more than 200 of the original aircraft, many of which are still operating today. The first project spawned more aircraft models and helped exciting innovations take off. On September 29, 1967, Gulfstream landed in Savannah, Georgia, where it remains headquartered to this day. Sa-vannah offers optimal land avail-ability, labor supply, transportation fa-cilities, and weather conditions, mak-ing it the perfect location to operate. We have gladly welcomed Gulfstream in our district for the last 50 years, and this impressive company has greatly contributed to the community by em-ploying nearly 10,000 people. Congratulations to Gulfstream Aero-space on reaching its 50th anniversary, a milestone I am confident it will con-tinue to build on. 
f 
TRUMPCARE (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the latest version of TrumpCare. Once again, House Republicans have confirmed their approach to fixing health care re-quires gutting key provisions for peo-ple with preexisting conditions, in-creasing costs, and offering fewer pro-tections. Letting the States cherry- pick the essential health benefits—the 10 basic medical care categories cov-ered, like emergency care, mental health, addiction treatment, or lab tests—is just crazy. The obvious problem with elimi-nating the Affordable Care Act’s essen-tial health benefits is that it will leave people without access to reasonable quality health insurance. The con-sumer should know what their health insurance covers. Without some minimum require-ments, insurance companies can offer plans that are insurance in name only. Anyone who is actually sick and needs care will be left out in the cold. The essential health benefits make the marketplace viable because they help pool the risk among the whole population instead of just attracting sick people who need these services. If Republicans thought TrumpCare was so great, why would they exempt Members of Congress and our staff? I urge my colleagues to scrap this po-litical game and work with us to strengthen health care for all Ameri-cans. f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S FIRST 100 DAYS (Mr. SARBANES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, the President said he would drain the swamp in Washington. He has flooded it. He said he would break the cycle of corruption. He has accelerated it. Near-ly 100 days into his administration, the President has reneged on the funda-mental promise that he would clean up Washington. Today, the Democracy Reform Task Force is releasing a report detailing 100 ways the Trump administration has flooded the swamp in the first 100 days. As the report chronicles, President Trump has made a mockery of ethics law and regulation, promoted a culture of secrecy in the executive branch, stacked his Cabinet with Big Money campaign donors, installed a special in-terest revolving door into the Trump White House, put big money ahead of the public interest, turned the Presi-dency into a profit-making enterprise, pursued public policy for his personal benefit, and raided the Treasury to pay for vacations and private business pro-motion. These are not the actions of a Presi-dent intent on draining the swamp or restoring a voice to the voiceless or re-storing power to the powerless. Ameri-cans of all political stripes are starting to wonder: ‘‘Maybe the President isn’t looking out for me and my family. Maybe he is just looking out for him-self, his business, and his brand.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President. SUSTAIN THE RESISTANCE (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this is undoubtedly the greatest 100 days of any President in human history. Give President Trump a grade of A-plus for the greatest broken campaign promises in history; the greatest meaningless executive orders, offering showy cere-monies when a mere phone call would have done the job; certainly, the very greatest number of insulting tweets— no President in history has ever come close; the greatest conflicts of interest; the greatest embrace of authoritarian leaders; the greatest gap between re-ality and fantasy, unquestionably. He talks as a populist and he governs as a plutocrat. The greatest thing about Trump’s 100 days is that America still exists with-out a major war or an economic free fall. Every day we survive without a Trump-inspired catastrophe is a great day for our country. Sustain the resistance and remain hopeful for a Trump-free America. f 
TRUMPCARE DROPS MILLIONS FROM COVERAGE (Ms. PINGREE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I thought the Republican plan for repeal-ing the Affordable Care Act and drop-ping 24 million Americans from healthcare coverage could not get any worse, but I was wrong. The latest iteration of TrumpCare still drops mil-lions from their coverage, but will now make coverage worse and more expen-sive for those who can get it. I believe all Americans deserve pro-tections for the coverage of essential health services and preexisting condi-tions, not just Members of Congress. Swiss cheese insurance plans that don’t cover ER visits or prescriptions and charge you more if you have ever been sick aren’t worth the paper they are printed on. This bill undermines our healthcare system in so many damaging ways. And for what? Let’s not forget that the bill includes nearly $600 billion in tax breaks for drug companies, insurers, and the wealthy. Millionaires would get an av-erage annual tax cut of more than $50,000 while hardworking families and older Americans would struggle to af-ford meaningful coverage. I won’t stand for a bill that endan-gers the well-being of my constituents to benefit the very wealthiest Ameri-cans. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2910 April 27, 2017 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise out of a concern of this administration’s policies to North Korea. I urge the ad-ministration to look at recent history. From 1994 to 2002, North Korea was not developing plutonium and there was no threat of medium- or long-range ballistic missiles. That was under President Clinton’s leadership because President Clinton had come up with a deal to buy the medium- and long- range missiles from North Korea. Then what happened? President Bush came and disregarded both deals and put North Korea under the axis of evil, even though they had no relationship to 9/11. It was a mis-take of foreign policy. We know the solution to North Korea. We know they have an army of 200,000. They have 15,000 places of nu-clear weapons. There is not a mili-taristic solution. The solution is to go back to the direct diplomacy that President Clinton had and to have South Korea engage in that diplomatic solution. There is an answer to North Korea. We cannot play games with this issue when President Clinton showed the framework.

b1230 FIRST 100 DAYS OF BROKEN PROMISES (Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, on the campaign trail, the President talked a good game on trade that appealed to working families. But now that he is President, his promises ring hollow. He promised to stop outsourcing and shipping jobs overseas, but he issued 15 contracts since becoming President with companies that have outsourced jobs. He promised to hold China ac-countable and label them a currency manipulator. He reversed that pledge. He promised to drain the swamp, but he has done just the opposite. He stacked the Cabinet with wealthy in-siders; and his White House is filled with friends, family, and a stunning display of nepotism and conflicts of in-terest. He said he would release his tax re-turns. That is a laugher. Breaking with 40 years of precedent, he has not re-leased his taxes and claimed the Amer-ican people don’t care. Seventy-four percent of Americans want to see his tax returns. And we will never know the full extent of his conflicts of interest and how he stands to enrich himself in office until we see his tax returns. Congressional tax-writing commit-tees can request them because they have the authority under IRC 6103, and I urge my colleagues to support this ef-fort. BIGGER AND BIGGER SWAMP (Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute.) Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump promised American voters he would drain the swamp of special interests in Wash-ington. Instead, he is swimming in it. He has filled his administration with billionaires, Wall Street operatives, special interest lobbyists, lawyers, and consultants who are drafting policies for the very industries they came from, and he refuses to release the White House visitor log so we have no idea what special interest lobbyists he is meeting with. Trump has refused to release his tax returns or divest his business interests. Can you believe the State Depart-ment posted a blog advertising his ex-clusive Mar-a-Lago resort? Since be-coming President, he increased the fees for that resort from $100,000 to $200,000. He has both close allies, Cabinet ap-pointees, and other appointees with questionable ties to Putin and Russia. His swamp is getting bigger and big-ger. f 
HAPPY 75TH BIRTHDAY EARL F. HILLIARD (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with friends and family of our former colleague and my per-sonal friend, Earl F. Hilliard, who this weekend will be celebrating his 75th birthday. While a Member of this body, Earl and I worked very closely together pre-serving the integrity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and supporting the preservation and res-toration of historic sites and buildings. This weekend, a gathering will estab-lish a scholarship in his honor in order for more rural Alabama young men and women to have opportunities to further their education. I want to congratulate my friend for reaching this milestone in his life—a place I got to last year this time—and wish him a happy birthday and further success in establishing benefits for young men and women throughout Ala-bama.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2911 April 27, 2017 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. M
CGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consider-ation of this resolution, all time yield-ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I have a confession to make to you. In fact, I have two confessions to make. The first is I have got a big group up in the Rules Committee right now. It is my Gwinnett County Chamber of Com-merce. It is an amazing county, tre-mendous diversity, tremendous record of success in solving problems. They have been up there visiting with lead-ers all day long. I first met with them this morning while Mr. M
CGOVERN was down here on the floor during 5 minutes. I said: Well, this is a 5-minute time. You can step right through the doors there, if you would like to see it. They said: Who is on the floor? I said: Well, it is this fellow right here. His name tag is there in the Rules Committee. He is down there, #endhunger. I said: The gentleman from Massa-chusetts (Mr. M
CGOVERN ) and I can dis-agree on all sorts of issues, all sorts of public policy, but there is nobody in this institution who has a heart for service on the issue of hunger more than J
IMMCGOVERN does. I said: Here he is. He is representing Massachusetts, of all places, and he has chosen to serve on the Agriculture Committee. If you are a Georgian, you serve on the Agriculture Committee because you grow cotton and peanuts and row crop after row crop after row crop. When you are from Massachu-setts and you sit on the Agriculture Committee, you want to end childhood hunger, you want to feed people. I tell you that as a confession, Mr. Speaker, because I am not going to confess to sharing my admiration for J
IMMCGOVERN all that often on the House floor, but I was with folks up there today who really do commit themselves to making a difference in our county. It was nice to have a col-league on the floor—again, with whom I disagree about much—who was put-ting everything he had, as he does every day, into an issue that he cares a lot about. That is all my constituents back home want, Mr. Speaker, is to believe that we have sincere, earnest folks working on sincere and difficult issues. So I thank the gentleman from Massa-chusetts (Mr. M
CGOVERN ) for that. My second confession, Mr. Speaker, is that ordinarily I really enjoy listen-ing to the Reading Clerk read the rule. It gets me all wound up about how the process is. Of course, today she was talking about all the amendments we are going to make in order. We are making every single amendment of-fered by both sides of the aisle in order on this underlying bill. I found myself thinking back to the days when I was a young man and I came up here with my class. I was sit-ting up here in the gallery, and I walked into the floor at a time when the Reading Clerk was just standing up there reading. There was no cheat sheet that they give you in the gallery, Mr. Speaker. You don’t have any idea whether they are going to read for 20 seconds or 20 minutes. For all you know, they are going to read for the rest of the afternoon, and it was hard to follow. I get a cheat sheet here that my staff gives me before each rule. I didn’t enjoy it as much today as I ordinarily do, Mr. Speaker, because there is a lot of procedural work in this rule. We are coming up on a bunch of big deadlines. So there is the ability to bring up suspensions. These are com-monsense bills that two-thirds of the House agree on. You can bring those up at any time. That provision is made in this rule. There is the ability to bring things up the same day. If the Rules Com-mittee goes up and passes a new rule, we can bring that bill to the floor im-mediately. Ordinarily that would lay over for 24 hours. But because there are so many things we are trying to get done, we waived that. All of those procedural issues, Mr. Speaker, get in the way of my favorite part of the rule, which is that every single Member of this body had a chance to come up to the Rules Com-mittee, offer their ideas for how we can make this bill better, and the Rules Committee made every single one of them in order. Let me tell you more about that. This House Resolution 280, Mr. Speaker, is the structured rule for the consideration of H.R. 1694. If you hap-pen to tune into our Rules Committee web feed, Mr. Speaker, you can see it at rules.house.gov if you are not able to get up there with us as we meet sometimes late at night. This House Resolution 280 is for the consideration of H.R. 1694, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017. Now, folks know a lot about open records, Mr. Speaker. It is that proce-dure—it is called FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act—where any member of the United States community board of directors—that would be any United States citizen—can write and say: this is my government, and I want some in-formation about what is going on. That has been a very fundamental part of who we are as a people for as long as you and I have been alive. What is unusual, though, is the way the Federal Government has gotten in-volved in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the tune of about $187 billion—bil-lion with a B, Mr. Speaker. The Amer-ican taxpayer bailed out these two pri-vate institutions making the American taxpayer, making the U.S. Government the largest shareholder in both of these institutions. So we found ourselves in a unique sit-uation of having the American tax-payers in charge of an institution with no ability, through the Freedom of In-formation Act, to request information from that entity. It just hadn’t come up that often. Thank goodness we haven’t had to bail out folks that way in the past. Mr. Speaker, these entities that Fannie and Freddie are a part—we called them government-sponsored en-terprises—they just haven’t histori-cally been the subject of that kind of taxpayer scrutiny, but times are changing. This bill, Mr. Speaker, went through the regular order process. Hearings were held. Markups were held. It came out of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. If you have not looked into government reform, Mr. Speaker, it is not often that the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Reform is moving unanimous legisla-tion. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is a tough com-mittee to serve on. I served there in my first term here, Mr. Speaker. It is the hardest things about our government, how we hold each other accountable. Of course, where you stand sometimes de-pends on where you sit here. If you sit on the left or you sit on the right, you might feel differently about govern-ment reform and accountability. This bill passed out of this com-mittee on a voice vote, Mr. Speaker. The most collaborative of efforts moved this bill to the floor. Then when we got it in the Rules Committee, we had several Members say: I think we can make this bill bet-ter. I think we can make this bill even better. These were Members who may not have had a chance to fix those issues on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Again, as I said, we made all amend-ments in order from both sides of the aisle. I believe that totals three today, Mr. Speaker. But the take-home mes-sage for me is, if you had an idea about how to fix this bill, the folks in the Rules Committee made that oppor-tunity available to you. Mr. Speaker, we can’t do the big things every single day of the week. Every piece of legislation we pass, un-less we stuff everything into it, can’t do everything for everyone. Candidly, I am opposed to stuffing everything into a piece of legislation. I am glad when we have an opportunity to move one issue, one subject, one topic at a time and deliver on behalf of the American people. b1245 Mr. Speaker, this structured rule, House Resolution 280, is a good bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2912 April 27, 2017 
is a good resolution that, if passed, will provide for the consideration of the un-derlying legislation, H.R. 1694, which, if passed, will provide the American tax-payer, for the first time, the account-ability that they deserve for the $187 billion in taxpayer support that Fannie and Freddie have received. I am proud to be associated with that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Geor-gia (Mr. W
OODALL ), my friend, for the customary 30 minutes. (Mr. M
CGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I first want to begin by thanking the gen-tleman for his kind words to his con-stituents about me on the floor. It means a lot to me, and I appreciate it. I should tell him, however, that, even though sometimes people don’t realize this, Massachusetts has a robust agri-cultural base, and, in fact, in my dis-trict, I have 1,832 farms on over 142,899 acres, compared to the gentleman who has 209 farms on 13,328 acres. So, in ad-dition to fighting hunger, I am on the Agriculture Committee to represent my farms. I do genuinely appreciate the gentle-man’s kind words, but then I look at the rule that we are debating today and it kind of spoils the mood. Having said that, I just want to say to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that here we are again, just 1 day from our government running out of funding and confronting yet another manufactured, totally avoidable crisis, and instead of working on a bill to fully fund Amer-ica’s biggest priorities, we are back on the floor with—the only way I can characterize this—more filler legisla-tion. It seems my Republican friends care more about looking busy than ac-tually doing their jobs. This rule provides for the consider-ation of H.R. 1694, as my colleague mentioned, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017. It is a fine bill designed to strengthen trans-parency at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I support the legislation. My Democratic colleagues support the leg-islation. The Republican majority sup-ports the legislation. In fact, I haven’t found one person yet who doesn’t sup-port the bill. Freedom of information is a good thing, Mr. Speaker, and I support FOIA, but what about the freedom from the threat of a government shut-down? What about freedom from the threat of a default on our national debt? What about freedom to know what our President’s conflicts of interest are and to see his tax returns? What about the freedom from having our healthcare protections ripped away, protections like essential health benefits and protections for people with preexisting conditions? And what about the freedom to know what Congressional Republicans and the White House are doing to our healthcare system behind closed doors? None of this seems to matter. But the most troubling part of this rule is that it declares blanket martial law, through Saturday, that allows Re-publicans to bring anything—and I mean anything—to the floor between now and then. Now, I understand the importance of rushing something to the floor when the government is about to run out of money; although, I would point out that we are 7 months into the fiscal year and my Republican friends set this deadline themselves back in De-cember, so there is absolutely no ex-cuse for Congress to come within hours of yet another shutdown. But this is just the latest example of Republican obstruction, obfuscation, and incom-petence that has, once again, brought us to the edge of the cliff. And, Mr. Speaker, this is no way to govern. This rule would allow Republican leadership to rush anything to the floor within hours of it being released. Not just appropriations, it gives them blanket authority to jam us with what-ever new disaster they cook up with the White House in the backroom of Capitol Hill, and that includes this lat-est healthcare deal that I have heard so much about this week. Of course, with it being a backroom deal, we were relying on news reports all week to clue us in to these terrible new provisions; and it was only last night, around midnight, when the Re-publicans finally posted their newest healthcare proposal that we were able to confirm just how bad it really is. Incredibly, this new amendment will make the bill even worse than before. Honest to God, Mr. Speaker, I didn’t know that was possible. In addition to killing the require-ment to provide basic, crucial, essen-tial benefits like maternity care and prescription drugs and emergency serv-ices, this new amendment will also completely gut protections for people with preexisting conditions. In fact, this amendment directly violates the commitment made by President Trump and House Republicans to protect those with preexisting conditions. This newest proposal will allow in-surers to charge an unlimited ‘‘age tax’’ to older Americans, and, to make matters even worse, Republicans have set up a system that would allow women to once again be charged more than men for health coverage. It will bring us back to those bad old days when insurance companies could charge women more because they said being a woman was a preexisting condi-tion. Give me a break. All of this, on top of a disaster of a healthcare bill that will cause 24 mil-lion Americans to lose their healthcare coverage. And in addition, their bill would cut Medicaid by close to $1 tril-lion, and take that $1 trillion and give it, in the form of tax breaks, to the wealthiest individuals in the country. Mr. Speaker, this is not the way we should be running this House. All of this is being done to appease the most conservative fringes within the Repub-lican Conference in an attempt to de-liver, I guess, a political ‘‘win’’ to Don-ald Trump so he can celebrate 100 days in office. It doesn’t matter what the de-tails are, he just wants to be able to tout a victory of some sort. Well, this is not a victory for the American people. This would be a dis-aster for the American people. It is no wonder that my Republican colleagues have been overwhelmed by angry calls from their constituents at home demanding that they oppose this reckless and heartless bill. As one Re-publican remarked: ‘‘I spent the whole work period hearing from people pissed about preexisting conditions. This isn’t helpful.’’ That is one of my Republican colleagues. Now, under this rule, these dangerous backroom deals could be rushed to the floor without any proper deliberations, but they will have a very real, very se-rious, and very dangerous consequence for millions of Americans. Real lives are at stake here. Now, I can’t help but also note that this newest amendment exempts Con-gress from the terrible impacts of this proposal. Can you believe that? Know-ing just how damaging these new provi-sions are, Republicans wanted to keep healthcare protections for themselves but set up another system for their constituents. Now, it was only after the press caught Republicans with their hands in the cookie jar that they introduced yet another bill to unexempt themselves. But the new bill to unexempt Congress would require a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate. What are the odds that is going to happen, Mr. Speaker? Are we seriously supposed to trust that they won’t exempt themselves from this terrible plan, to trust that the Senate can muster 60 votes to pass this provision or anything else? Let me be clear: this maneuver is a procedural sleight of hand. This is leg-islative smoke and mirrors designed to give Republicans, who tried to pull a fast one and got caught, a talking point. Mr. Speaker, Republicans wrote this bill, so change the damn bill. Don’t just say: ‘‘Trust us. We will pass an-other bill to fix the fix, and we will get the Senate not to make any changes. Oh, while we are at it, we will get a supermajority in the Senate to support it.’’ Who do you think you are fooling, Mr. Speaker? I urge all my colleagues to defeat this martial law rule, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would tell my friend that I think this is exactly the right way to be mov-ing legislation, and I am proud that we are doing it. Big bills are hard and big

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2913 April 27, 2017 
bills are sloppy. Can we do better on big bills? Of course we can. Of course we can. But you and I have been on the Rules Committee together, Mr. Speaker. The Rules Committee process, you have seen it happen. If I am down here talk-ing about a small bill that everybody agrees on, folks want to know why it is we are not doing something bigger. And when I bring a big bill down here tomorrow, folks are going to want to know why I have rushed it to the floor and we are not doing something that has more bipartisan agreement on it instead. These issues are hard, and that is why they have sent serious men and women here to try to solve them. I want to do everything that my friend from Massachusetts has talked about, Mr. Speaker. I want to see a healthcare bill go across the floor. I want to see a full-year funding bill go across the floor. Shoot, I don’t stop there. I want to see the budget go across the floor. I want to see a transportation and infra-structure bill go across the floor. I have got a tax bill I want to see go across the floor. The list is long. And while my friend from Massachu-setts and I are down here working on this, I have got 433 other colleagues out there working on that, and my great hope is that we are going to deliver on those things in the very near future, too. But today, Mr. Speaker, today isn’t a day for recriminations. Today is a day for celebrations, in that what we have here is a bill that we have worked through the regular order process. You are not going to hear one person, Mr. Speaker, not one, come down to the floor and say this bill wasn’t moved through the process in the right way. You are not going to hear one person come down to the floor and say their voice was silenced on this bill. You are not going to hear one person come down to the floor and say their input was turned away on this bill. We do so much that we wish we could do better, Mr. Speaker. When we have these opportunities to celebrate those things we are doing right, I sometimes wish we would take a little more time to focus on our successes. There will al-ways be time to turn our attention back to our failures. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my colleague, I don’t have any problem with the underlying bill, but I would argue with him that I think most of our colleagues probably don’t know what the hell we are doing here be-cause, in the scheme of things, this is not terribly consequential. I think our problem is the fact that we are at the edge of another crisis where, if we don’t fund the government by tomor-row, we shut this place down, we shut the government down, and that has an impact on the American people. I think what our objection is is that the rule that you bring to us here today to consider the underlying bill also allows my Republican friends to bring up anything they want between now and Saturday, including, you know, an awful healthcare repeal bill. And by the way, when we talk about regular order, it would be nice, espe-cially when it comes to the big things like health care, that we actually do things like hearings and listen to what experts have to say and our constitu-ents and patients and doctors, I mean, a whole bunch of people who have a stake in our healthcare system. The bill that my friends brought to the floor, that they had to pull, never had a single hearing and, in all likeli-hood, whatever monstrosity they bring to the floor in the future will probably not be the result of regular order. It will be the result of a backroom deal where very few people have any input. So I can’t celebrate today. I am very concerned for my constituents. I am very concerned for the millions of peo-ple who might lose their health care. I am concerned for this country. Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s first 100 days have been embroiled in con-troversy and shrouded in secrecy. The American people deserve a heck of a lot better. They deserve transparency from their government. They deserve to know which special interests are getting face time with the President and his top aides and whether the White House is being used to person-ally enrich President Trump and his family. It is our duty, as the people’s Rep-resentatives, to hold this administra-tion accountable, an administration that has so many conflicts of interest, financial conflicts of interest, that it is on a collision course with corruption. So, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative KATHERINE  C
LARK ’s resolution, H. Res. 286, which would force the White House to release information to us regarding the Presi-dent’s many potential conflicts of in-terest, including his tax returns, in-volvement in his business empire, and White House and Mar-a-Lago visitor logs. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to insert the text of my amend-ment in the R
ECORD , along with extra-neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 12 minutes to the distinguished gentle-woman from Massachusetts (Ms. K
ATH-
ERINE CLARK ) to discuss our proposal. Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts. I am glad to share in this bipartisan moment of admira-tion for his work with my colleague from Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous ques-tion so that we can bring a resolution to the floor. This resolution will ensure that the House meets its constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch by investigating potential conflicts of interest of Presi-dent Donald J. Trump. b1300 It reads: ‘‘Whereas, on October 18, 2016, then-candidate Donald J. Trump communicated via Twitter: ‘I will Make Our Government Honest Again— believe me. But first, I’m going to have to #draintheswamp in DC’; ‘‘Whereas, President Trump subse-quently nominated a team of wealthy and connected insiders to lead his Cabi-net, many of whom have been forced to withdraw from consideration because of irrevocable conflicts of interest; ‘‘Whereas, as President-elect, Presi-dent Trump announced that he would be ‘leaving his great business’ to his adult children, a move he felt would be ‘visually important’; ‘‘Whereas, President Trump has taken no steps to untangle his finan-cial interest in his business holdings, to limit his ability to advise the nomi-nal managers of The Trump Organiza-tion, or to prevent other interests from currying favor with the White House by doing business with companies that might benefit the President’s bottom line; ‘‘Whereas, President Trump has re-versed White House policy and now re-fuses to release visitor logs to the pub-lic; ‘‘Whereas, on May 30, 2014, President Trump stated: ‘If I decide to run for of-fice, I will produce my tax returns, ab-solutely’; ‘‘Whereas, on January 24, 2016, Presi-dent Trump stated that he would re-lease his ‘very big returns . . . in the next period of time’; ‘‘Whereas, on February 25, 2016, President Trump changed his position and stated that, although he could not release his tax returns while under audit, he would do so ‘as soon as the audit is done’; ‘‘Whereas, on May 11, 2016, President Trump communicated via Twitter: ‘In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when the audit is com-plete, not after election!’; ‘‘Whereas, on January 22, 2017, White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway stated that ‘the White House response is that he’s not going to re-lease his returns’; ‘‘Whereas, President Trump has di-rected the Congress to act on com-prehensive reform of the Internal Rev-enue Code; ‘‘Whereas, without the President’s tax returns, the public cannot know

how the full extent to which any pro-posed reforms will personally benefit the President; ‘‘Whereas, on January 11, 2017, Presi-dent Trump insisted that he has ‘no dealings with Russia’; ‘‘Whereas, it has been widely re-ported that President Trump sought and received funding from Russian in-vestors, especially when American banks stopped lending to him after his multiple bankruptcies; ‘‘Whereas, Donald Trump, Jr., who runs day-to-day business operations for his father’s companies, has stated: ‘Russians make up a pretty dispropor-tionate cross-section of a lot of our as-sets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia’; ‘‘Whereas, on March 20, 2017, James B. Comey, Director of the Federal Bu-reau of Investigation, confirmed the existence of a Federal investigation into multiple connections between the Trump campaign and the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin; ‘‘Whereas, it has been reported that President Trump has personally guar-anteed over $300 million in loans to German financial institution Deutsche Bank AG; ‘‘Whereas, the Trump administration is now responsible for overseeing mul-tiple investigations into the trading and lending practices of Deutsche Bank AG and for negotiating a potentially multibillion-dollar settlement with the bank related to its trading of mort-gage-backed securities; ‘‘Whereas, these matters represent only a few of the many instances in which President Trump has broken his promise to ‘drain the swamp’; ‘‘Whereas, under the Constitution of the United States, the United States Congress has a responsibility to con-duct oversight of the executive branch of government; ‘‘Whereas, the majority of the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives rejected an amendment to have the committee’s oversight plan that would have tasked the committee with inves-tigating the President’s conflicts of in-terest; ‘‘Whereas, members of the Commit-tees on Energy and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, the Judiciary, Homeland Secu-rity, and Ways and Means of the House of Representatives have each advanced resolutions of inquiry designed to ob-tain information about the President’s ongoing conflicts of interest; ‘‘Whereas, the majority has blocked each of those resolutions from consid-eration on the House floor; ‘‘Whereas, the continuing refusal of the majority to conduct even basic oversight of the Trump administration diminishes the status of the Congress as a coequal branch of government; ‘‘Whereas, this continued neglect un-dermines the credibility of the House of Representatives and raises a ques-tion of the privileges of the House; ‘‘Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives directs the following persons to take the fol-lowing actions: ‘‘(1) President Trump is directed to transmit to the House of Representa-tives copies of any document, record, memorandum, correspondence, or other communication in possession of the Ex-ecutive Office of the President, or any portion of such communication, that refers or relates to President Trump’s proposal to maintain an interest in his business holdings, while turning over day-to-day operation of those interests to his sons Donald J. Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump. ‘‘(2) In support of transparency in government and the longstanding tra-dition of the disclosure of tax returns of Presidents and Presidential can-didates, the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to provide the Committee on Ways and Means with the tax return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2007 through 2016 for review in closed executive session by the com-mittee as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and directs the committee to hold a vote on reporting such information to the full House of Representatives. ‘‘(3) The Director of the Office of Government Ethics is directed to pub-lish any waiver or exception granted to any officer or employee of the govern-ment to the January 28, 2017, executive order entitled ‘Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees’. ‘‘(4) The Administrator of General Services is directed to provide the Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform of the House of Rep-resentatives with any legal analysis supporting its March 23, 2017, conclu-sion that Trump International Hotel in Washington may maintain its lease with the Federal Government, despite an express prohibition on elected offi-cials taking part in the lease. ‘‘(5) President Trump is directed to provide visitor logs for both the White House and Mar-a-Lago to the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives on a rolling and ongoing basis, and di-rects the committee to hold ongoing votes on reporting the contents of such visitor logs to the full House of Rep-resentatives.’’ Mr. Speaker, I filed this resolution because it appears to me and the Amer-ican public that Mr. Trump has drained the swamp and funneled it into the Oval Office. Trump’s billionaire, special interest friends are now in charge of policies that impact every American, every family, and every child. Everything from education to health care to taxes are in the hands of people who have never sent their kids to public schools, who have never had to take out a loan to pay for college, and who have never had a medical bill they couldn’t af-ford—and all of this is in the hands of a President who refuses to release his tax returns. While Trump fights to keep Ameri-cans in the dark about which of his other friends he owes special favors to—whether it is Big Oil, foreign banks, lobbyists at Mar-a-Lago, or the Russians—Republicans seem to be happy to look the other way. Transparency and accountability are not partisan ideas. Families at home deserve a Congress that works together to be the necessary check that our Constitution provides over this unac-countable administration. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous ques-tion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that they had me at hello. When they said this was a great bill underlying this resolution and they didn’t see any controversy, they thought we ought to pass this and they thought this was a good step forward for the American people, yet you had me. I would like to do that. I remember, Mr. Speaker, a friend of mine, his name was Jay Pierson. He served in this institution for over four decades. His job was not to be particu-larly partisan one way or the other. His job was to make sure this place func-tioned. I wonder what goes on over the 40 years of changes in the way that we treat each other on the House floor and the way that we work with each other on the House floor. My friends have a perfectly legiti-mate concern. In fact, they brought it up as a privileged resolution already this year. It has been tabled. I recog-nize that my friends and I have dis-agreements—vast disagreements—in numerous areas of public policy, but today we have a chance to talk about one of the agreements that we have. I wonder, Mr. Speaker, what folks back home watching think. Do they think, just like the media loves to report, that, golly, those guys can’t even agree on what time to start in the morning? For Pete’s sake, we have worked a bill through the process, just like we learned about in civics class. Don’t make me sing ‘‘I’m just a bill, and I’m sitting here on Capitol Hill,’’ Mr. Speaker, because that is exactly the process that we all want bills to go through, and we have done that here today. We can’t even take a moment to talk about how successfully we have worked together, not even a moment to talk about how the process worked, not even a moment to talk about how we delivered for folks. We have to shift gears to something that is not even the topic of the bill today. We will have time to talk about every controversy we want. If folks want to go fisticuffs with one another, I am certain we will make time for that, but right now we have a chance to talk about those things that unite us. In the spirit of dispelling those myths, Mr. Speaker, dispelling those

myths that things don’t get done around here, dispelling those myths that we don’t respect each other, and dispelling those myths that we can’t work together, I want to dispel the myth that what this underlying rule does is it provides Republicans with a pathway for doing whatever it is they want to do whenever it is they want to do it, because that doesn’t really sound like fair play. I wouldn’t want to sup-port such a bill either. What this rule does do is, contrary to the rules, allow us to bring up suspen-sion bills at any time. Now, what a sus-pension bill is, Mr. Speaker, as you know, it is a bill that can pass not with a simple majority, but with a two- thirds majority. So this rule says, for-bid the thought, should bipartisanship break out in the next 72 hours, you all should be able to bring those bills to the floor and deliver it for the Amer-ican people. Well, dag gum it, I support that. I don’t look at that as a way of Repub-licans to manipulate the system. I look at it as a way for the United States Congress to deliver on behalf of the system, and I am glad we are doing it. Number two, the bill says, if the Rules Committee, in its wisdom, passes a rule to bring a bill to the floor rather than have that bill lay over for a night, you can bring that bill to the floor di-rectly. So my friend is absolutely right when he says that passing this rule would allow us to rush legislation to the floor. It would rush that common-sense, bipartisan legislation that two- thirds of us would agree on, we can rush those results across the finish line for the American people; and, if the Rules Committee acts and we pass that rule on the floor of the House, it will allow us to consider the legislation that that rule would bring to the floor on the same day instead of waiting 24 hours. Now, what my friend says about hav-ing an opportunity to read the bills is critically important—critically impor-tant. I want to point out because, again, folks have so many concerns about what goes on in this institution, I got lots of things I can gripe about, but when we are getting it right, I want to make sure that we are telling folks that we are getting it right. This tradition of self-flagellation in this institution drives me crazy be-cause, when we tear ourselves down, Mr. Speaker, it is not us who bears the cost of that. It is our constituents. It is the board of directors of the United States of America. It is the folks who come beyond us. We have a responsibility to lead this institution, and when we are doing it right, we ought to tell the American people that we are doing it right. For example, there might be a healthcare vote that comes to the floor of this House in the next 24, 48 hours. I don’t want to get my expectations high for that, Mr. Speaker, but I sure would be enthusiastic if that happened. If that were to happen, my friend is exactly right: we will go to the Rules Com-mittee; we will pass a rule; we will bring it to the floor; and we will bring it up the same day. But the language was posted yesterday, and the vote wouldn’t happen until tomorrow. So when folks say let’s leave the language out there for folks to have a chance to read it, let’s not rush something through, we have got 3 days built into the system. b1315 That is not a rule of the House. I want to make that clear. There is no rule in this institution that says you have got to present a bill before you can pass a bill to read it and find out what is in it. This is not a rule of this House. It is a policy of ours. It is a pol-icy of who we are and of let’s do this; let’s make this our commitment to make this happen. Mr. Speaker, it does not always happen, but most of the time it does. I celebrate that success. Again, thinking about those things that unite us instead of divide us, I just listened to my friend, Ms. C
LARK of Massachusetts, make an incredibly elo-quent plea for her bill. She said, if we defeat the previous question—that vote is coming up very soon—we will take up her piece of legislation, which was just handed to me about 3
1⁄2minutes ago. Mr. Speaker, I get it that sometimes people think that they have such ur-gent ideas that those ideas need to come to the floor in a hurry. I will set-tle for either outcome: that it is okay that we bring ideas to the floor in a hurry and that it is okay if you hand somebody a bill 3
1⁄2minutes ago and tell them you want to bring it to the floor 30 minutes from now. If that is okay, then let that be okay. If what we need is for bills to lay overnight, then let that be okay. We have a process here that is built on mutual respect, that is built on years of tradition that men and women paid a tremendous price for, that they provided tremendous leadership for. In the name of short-term political gains, I want to make sure that we don’t tear down those long-term policy successes. This institution should be a source of pride for the American people. I don’t believe that it is today. The responsi-bility of making it that source of pride falls on you and me. We are the only ones who can get that job done. We have an opportunity today to do just a little bit of that, and I hope we take advantage of that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me say to the gentleman from Georgia: he had me at hello, too. If all he said was ‘‘hello’’ and introduced the underlying bill, we would be done. There would be no controversy. The underlying bill is being brought to the floor under a rule that is atrocious and that, quite frankly, every Member of this House should be ashamed about. Under this martial law rule, you can bring anything up at any time you want, at a moment’s notice, without people having an opportunity to actu-ally understand what they are going to vote on. The gentleman talked about they might bring up the healthcare bill be-tween now and Saturday. He said: Yes-terday, we posted the text of our new amendment. He used the word ‘‘yester-day’’ loosely. They posted it at mid-night last night. I was asleep at mid-night; I don’t know about the gen-tleman. The bottom line is, there is nothing that says that they can’t change the text again and again and again and again, offer more amendments, because that is what they have been doing since they first began their effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. On something as important as health care, on something that could affect millions and millions of people in this country, that could throw 24 million people off of health care, that will cut Medicaid by a trillion dollars, that will compromise Medicare, that will take away essential benefits, people ought to know what the heck they are voting on. We ought to have regular order on these major pieces of legislation. Why is that so controversial? How about a hearing on health care? The idea that we would like the opportunity to know what we are voting on, to do this in a thoughtful way, is so offensive to my Republican colleagues. I am flab-bergasted by this—to basically defend this process. We have to use a procedural motion to be able to try to force a debate or bring to the floor the bill of my col-league, KATHERINE CLARK , which basi-cally calls on the President to release his tax returns and calls for some transparency with regard to visitor logs at the White House and Mar-a- Lago. We have to resort to a procedural motion because the Republican major-ity basically blocks us from bringing anything to the floor under a normal process. The Rules Committee has become a place where democracy goes to die. Yet the bill that we have before us, the un-derlying bill that we are going to con-sider later today, could probably pass on a suspension. By the way, we have no problem with giving you same-day authority on sus-pension bills. Those aren’t controver-sial. We don’t even have a problem, al-though you should have prepared for this, with you being able to bring a bill to the floor quickly to keep the govern-ment running. It is the broad authority that you have given yourselves to bring any-thing at a moment’s notice, without anybody having a chance to review it. That is what we have a problem with. Quite frankly, my Republican col-leagues ought to have a problem with that, too. Mr. Speaker, shortly after taking the gavel, Speaker R
YAN said: ‘‘I want to

have a process that is more open, more inclusive, more deliberative, more participatory, and that is what we are trying to do.’’ That was the Speaker of the House. Unfortunately, Republicans do not appear to be trying very hard. The cur-rent Congress is on track to become the most closed in history, with an in-credible 26 closed rules in this year’s first quarter out of 42 total rules. The Republican majority shut out all amendments from both Democrats and Republicans on fully 62 percent of the legislation considered by the House under a rule. Do Members realize that? On most bills, even they are not allowed to offer amendments. No amendments at all. Under a closed rule, you can’t even offer an amendment to fix a typo. Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to take a look at this chart. This shows closed rules in the past dec-ade and for the first quarter of the year. Do you see this really long red line on the top? I am happy to bring it over to my colleagues here. If you see that line, you will see that the bottom line is that this shows that this Congress has an abysmal record with regard to an open, fair process. When we were in charge from 2007– 2010, we averaged only 8 closed rules in the same timeframe. This Congress is more than three times as closed. We have 26 closed rules in the first quarter alone; that is not to mention zero open rules. You are even crushing your record for 2015, the year that you beat the all-time closed rule record. This is not something to be proud of. What has this historically closed process brought to the House? Com-plete chaos. Virtually no legislative ac-complishments. A lousy process usu-ally leads to lousy legislation. We learned that from your awful, disas-trous attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. By the way, I should point out that while we were meeting here today—I guess some of the advocacy organiza-tions had a chance to read the lan-guage you posted last night at mid-night—so far, the American Hospital Association, AARP, the American Med-ical Association, March of Dimes, and America’s Essential Hospitals have all come out against this terrible, new Re-publican health proposal. In fact, the American Hospital Association said: ‘‘The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen the bill.’’ I would just say to my colleagues: We don’t have a problem with suspensions. We don’t have a problem with a rule that will allow us to keep the govern-ment running. We have a problem with your closed, authoritarian approach to the legislation. We have a problem with the prospect that you might bring a healthcare bill to the floor that will impact millions and millions of Ameri-cans, and nobody will have read it, no-body will even have any guarantee that what you posted last night at midnight will even be what we are voting on. This is a big deal. It affects my con-stituents and it affects your constitu-ents. We ought to be doing a better job around here, and this process, quite frankly, stinks. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. J
ODYB. H ICEof Georgia). Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remain-ing? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Massachusetts has 3
1⁄2 minutes remaining. Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Simply, again, I reiterate that every-body in this House, Democrats and Re-publicans alike, should be ashamed at the way this House is being run. The American people who are watching should be appalled by the way this House is being run. I don’t care whether you are a liberal or conservative or fall somewhere in the middle. You ought to have some confidence that what the people’s House is doing is actually thoughtful and is actually in the best interest of the people of this country. That is not what is happening here. Yes, the underlying bill that we are going to talk about later today, we have no problem with it. It could have passed overwhelmingly under a suspen-sion vote. I am happy to support it. No problem. I have no problem, by the way, with bringing up suspensions to fill up time as we try to get a resolution to the continuing resolution. We have no problem, quite frankly, with bringing up a continuing resolution in a quick fashion. This rule continues a lousy process that has been embraced by the current Republican leadership in this House. There is no excuse for this. When it comes to big bills, big legislation, like health care, which is a very personal thing to people in this country, the American people deserve much better than this. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ‘‘no’’ on this lousy rule and stand up to your leadership and demand that they open this House up not only to Democratic amend-ments but to Republican amendments as well. This is a deliberative body. We ought to be able to deliberate. On big issues like health care, it ought not be some backroom deal that a few people put together. We saw the result of those backroom deals with a lousy, terrible, awful bill that would hurt millions of Americans. We ought to do it out in the open. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I heard a group of con-stituents ask one of our freshman Members what they found to be the most surprising part of this institu-tion, having served here for about 100 days, and it was with no small amount of joy that they gave exactly the same answer that I would have given after my first 100 days. They said to their constituents: What really surprised me is how earnest, hardworking, conscien-tious, dedicated, and how committed each and every Member of this institu-tion is. There are a couple of bad apples that don’t follow under that perspective, but, by and large, the surprise when you get elected to Congress is about the high quality of the people who you get to work with, the commitment of the people you get to work with, the conviction of the people who you get to work with. What you have heard from my friend from Massachusetts, Mr. Speaker, I will tell you, is 100 percent authentic. There is no one down here playing for the cameras today. I could make a powerful case that while cameras pro-vide a great deal of sunlight, they cre-ate a great deal of unnecessary heat, as well. Folks sometimes are performing for cameras in this institution, but not my friend from Massachusetts. What you heard from my friend from Massachusetts was absolutely sincere concern about public policy. I agree with him. I believe we should have an open and deliberative process in this institution. You and I and my friend from Massa-chusetts don’t work for the leadership. The leadership works for us. There is not one Member of the leadership team who votes for me. I vote for them. We have an opportunity to direct the way this institution is led. Candidly, I couldn’t be more proud than I am of the way that P
AULRYANleads this in-stitution. He is not the Republican Speaker. We have a Republican leader. The Democrats have a Democratic leader. P
AUL RYAN is the Speaker of the House. I am incredibly proud of the way he leads this institution. The way to make it even better, Mr. Speaker, is not to cite every single thing that we do as a failure. It is just not so. Let’s find those things that we do that we can do better, and let’s identify them and work together, but let’s celebrate those successes. For example, my friend pointed to the number of closed rules that have come to the floor. For folks who don’t follow the process closely, a closed rule means there were no amendments al-lowed. Well, many of those bills, Mr. Speak-er, were bills that the Rules Committee sent out an email to all of Capitol Hill and said: We are bringing this piece of legislation to the floor. Here it is for you to read it and digest it. And if you have any ideas about how to make this bill better, you send them to us, and we will take a look.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2917 April 27, 2017 
When we did that, Mr. Speaker, not one single idea came back from the Re-publican or the Democratic side of the aisle for improving the bill. b1330 So, yes, the bill came to the floor. The rule was closed not because we are trying to silence the minority, not be-cause we are trying to silence elements of the majority, but because we had a completely open process, and it turned out that regular order got it right the first time. We don’t need to identify that as a failure. That is an unmiti-gated success. Some of those closed rules, Mr. Speaker, came because we were bring-ing legislation under the Congressional Review Act. Now, for folks who don’t know the Congressional Review Act, that is that act that was passed so that Congress could go back and review reg-ulations that had been passed by the administration to make sure those reg-ulations followed congressional intent. By definition, those bills have to be narrow and targeted. We can’t have an amendment about healthcare legisla-tion added to our waters of the U.S. Congressional Review Act bill. We can’t have folks go and add a pay raise for our military men and women to that Congressional Review Act bill. We want a pay raise for our men and women in uniform. We passed it out of the House. It is sitting in the United States Senate, but it can’t be on a CRA piece of legislation. So, yes, every sin-gle one of those bills came to the floor under a closed rule not because some-one was trying to silence the minority, not because someone wanted to silence elements of the majority, but because that is the process that we have to work through together, and, by golly, we are doing it right. My friend from Massachusetts talked about what has gone on in this body. I will tell you, this body has moved more legislation to the President’s desk for his signature in these first 100 days than any President since Truman. We have had Republicans running the show, we have had Democrats running the show, but it is only when we col-laboratively have been running the show that we have moved more bills to the President’s desk than any other Congress in modern American history. I am proud of that. Some of those votes went my way, some of those votes didn’t go my way, but we worked each one of those through the process, and we did each one of those things to-gether. Mr. Speaker, I would love to tell you what is going to happen over the next 18 months. I have no idea. But I know that to the extent that this body is full of accusations, to the extent that this body is full of mistrust, to the extent that this body is full of frustration and condemnation, we are going to go down one path. To the extent that this body isn’t afraid to tell folks back home when we are working hard together, to the ex-tent that this body isn’t ashamed that we rolled up our sleeves together and got some things done that folks thought we wouldn’t be able to get done, to the extent that this body isn’t afraid to confront the fact that we are always going to have disagreements, but from time to time bipartisanship breaks out and bills move a little more quickly than they do at other times. If folks are willing to accept our suc-cesses with the same zeal that they cel-ebrate our failures, Mr. Speaker, I tell you, we are going to create a different institution over these next 18 months. Again, not under Democratic leader-ship, not under Republican leadership, but under P
AUL RYAN’s leadership as Speaker of this entire House of Rep-resentatives. We have one such opportunity today. I encourage folks to go to the web page of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I believe it is oversight.house.gov. Those folks are working on some of the toughest issues in this town, and often they are bit-terly divided along partisan lines. They are working on those issues that tend to separate Americans rather than unite them. They have sent us a bill today that was so widely supported, it passed by a voice vote unanimously out of that committee. It then went to the Committee on Rules, where every sin-gle Member of Congress was invited to improve it. Three Members of Congress took us up on the invitation, and every single one of their amendments was made in order by this rule. Mr. Speaker, we have lots of things that are going to bring my friend from Massachusetts and I back down to this floor, and we are going to disagree heartily about those. Today we have an example of something that brings us together. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this rule that brings our OGR unanimously passed bill to the floor, and vote ‘‘yes’’ on that under-lying bill, just as our Republican and Democratic colleagues on the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Reform did. Mr. Speaker, there are lots of chal-lenges ahead of us. This is one we can put in the books as a success for our constituents back home. I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote. The material previously referred to by Mr. M
CGOVERN is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 280 O FFERED BY  M
R. MCGOVERN  At the end of the resolution, add the fol-lowing new sections: S
EC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order without inter-vention of any point of order to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 286) direct-ing certain officials of the executive branch to provide information to the House of Rep-resentatives that will enable the House to meet its constitutional responsibility to con-duct oversight of the executive branch by in-vestigating potential conflicts of interests of President Donald J. Trump. The resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform; and (2) one motion to recom-mit with or without instructions. SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H. Res. 286. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT I
TREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to House Resolution 280 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 1694. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. C
OLLINS ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1419 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1694) to require additional entities to be sub-ject to the requirements of section 552 of title 5, United States Code (com-monly referred to as the Freedom of In-formation Act), and for other purposes, with Mr. COLLINS of Georgia in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. R
OSS) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. C
LAY) each will control 30 min-utes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1694, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017. Mr. Chairman, transparency is crit-ical. It is critical to oversight and ac-countability of the Federal Govern-ment and how it spends taxpayer dol-lars. The American public has a right to know how their tax dollars are spent. The Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, is a key tool for citizens to ac-cess information about their govern-ment. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not subject to the requirements of FOIA, despite taxpayers’ substantial investment into both entities and the government’s implicit guaranteed backing of these entities. Taxpayers have spent $187 billion to bail out Fannie and Freddie, the most sweeping government intervention into private financial markets in decades. Taxpayers are on the hook for $400 bil-lion in lost investments and $5 trillion in mortgage liabilities. At the same time, the American pub-lic is unable to seek accountability from these entities under FOIA. It is far past time we apply FOIA to Fannie and Freddie. There is precedent for ap-plying FOIA to non-traditional quasi- governmental entities. Congress sub-jected Amtrak to FOIA in recognition of sizeable taxpayer funding. To stabilize the housing market in the aftershock of the 2008 financial cri-sis, the Federal Housing Finance Agen-cy placed Fannie and Freddie into con-servatorship to return them to finan-cial viability and stockholder control. FHFA is a government entity subject to FOIA. Under the terms of its con-servatorship over Fannie and Freddie, FHFA exercises the titles to their books and records, as well as the pow-ers and privileges of Fannie and Freddie. Despite this government intervention and explicit guarantee, taxpayers, how-ever, are unable to obtain any informa-tion from Fannie and Freddie. H.R. 1694, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017, sponsored by Oversight and Government Reform Chairman J
ASON CHAFFETZ , will allow the American public to submit FOIA requests to Fannie and Freddie as long as the entities remain under FHFA’s conservatorship. H.R. 1694 reflects FOIA’s presumptions of openness, granting taxpayers information unless an exemption applies. This bill is a commonsense measure to allow the American public access to basic information regarding entities that they fund with their tax dollars. The American public should not be in the dark when it comes to what Fannie and Freddie are doing. Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bill, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017. I want to start by thanking the spon-sor of this bill, Chairman CHAFFETZ , for working with the Democratic members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to address con-cerns that we raised as well as con-cerns raised by the Federal Housing Fi-nance Agency. The bipartisan coopera-tion that was demonstrated on this bill should be a model for this body. This bill would apply the Freedom of Information Act to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while they are in con-servatorship or receivership. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder- owned, government-sponsored enter-prises chartered by Congress to pur-chase mortgages and pool them into mortgage-backed securities to create liquidity in the mortgage market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were brought into Federal conservatorship under the control of FHFA in Sep-tember 2008. According to the CBO, during the financial crisis, Treasury purchased $187 billion of senior pre-ferred stock from the two entities to ensure that they could continue to op-erate. Neither entity has drawn on Treasury support since 2012, both have returned to profitability, and the divi-dends they generate are paid to the Treasury. There are some practical concerns with the underlying bill because it would apply FOIA to these private companies for the first time. The amendment Chairman C
HAFFETZ will offer addresses some of those concerns, which I will discuss when we consider this amendment. I would like to discuss some concerns with language that was added in this bill at the Rules Committee to address the estimated cost of the bill. CBO estimates that this bill would increase the administrative costs of Fannie and Freddie by $310 million, with $10 million of that resulting in di-rect spending. This bill would address those costs by requiring commercial requesters to pay for processing FOIA requests made to Fannie and Freddie. This would be a significant change from the way FOIA typically works. It is unclear how Fannie and Freddie could reasonably estimate how many FOIA requests they would receive or to know how to distribute administrative costs equitably among commercial re-questers. The bill would allow Fannie and Freddie to determine how much they

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2921 April 27, 2017 
would charge commercial requesters. Whatever cost estimation methodolo-gies Fannie and Freddie choose to use, the methodologies will almost cer-tainly be challenged, potentially lead-ing to litigation, which would be han-dled by the Department of Justice. It is highly likely that banks would file FOIA requests to obtain informa-tion about the business practices and holdings of Fannie and Freddie. The costs charged to them for their re-quests would then be passed on to con-sumers. I believe this language was intended to be helpful, but it is one result of ap-plying to private companies a statute designed to apply to government agen-cies. We should carefully analyze this provision and its likely consequences as this bill moves forward in the legis-lative process. There may be a better way to address this issue. I also hope that the chairman will continue to seek ways of expanding transparency in government, and that the committee’s next step will be to re-quire the disclosure of White House vis-itor logs. The White House recently reversed what had been the Obama administra-tion’s policy of disclosing the records of who comes and goes from the White House. The president of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton, said: ‘‘This new secrecy policy undermines the rule of law and suggests this White House doesn’t want to be accountable to the American people.’’ I look forward to working with the chairman to address this very trou-bling reversal of a critical government transparency policy. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-sas (Mr. H
ILL). Mr. HILL. Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from Florida for the opportunity to speak on this bill. And as a member of the House Financial Services Com-mittee, I am grateful for the bipartisan leadership in the Oversight and Gov-ernment Reform Committee in bring-ing H.R. 1694 to the floor, for it is high time that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac be subject to the regimen of the Free-dom of Information Act. This critical oversight tool is sorely past due for these government-sponsored agencies. Over the past four decades, we have seen the waste and largess exhibited by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac embedded in their everyday operations. And while they got their start during the height of the Depression and performed an able task of setting high standards for the liquidity for mortgage credit, they have long outlived their original charter. Oakley Hunter, the president and chairman of Fannie Mae back in the 1970s, described Fannie Mae as the world’s largest floating crap game. Nothing has changed. b1430 In the early 1980s, we found Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dominating, as they do today, 9 out of 10 mortgages in the United States, and yet they were highly unprofitable and highly suspect in their management. During that time, Senator William Proxmire led the charge in the United States Senate seeking answers about the enterprises’ executive compensation. Flash-forward to the 1990s, we saw executive compensation at Fannie Mae run amok. During the 2000s, their imprudence and desire for growth paved the way for the U.S. housing crisis and global eco-nomic collapse. More recently, we have discovered that Fannie Mae is spending $171 mil-lion in taxpayer funds on a new Taj Mahal office in Washington, D.C., to re-place their already extraordinarily lux-urious campus on Wisconsin Avenue, which one Washingtonian, Mr. Chair-man, described as what Versailles would look like if Louis XIV had any money. According to the inspector gen-eral’s report from last June, this 15- year cost of relocating Fannie Mae’s headquarters and the construction of the new building now topped $770 mil-lion. The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman has expired. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chair, I yield an addi-tional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Arkansas. Mr. HILL. Mr. Chairman, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac languish in Fed-eral conservatorship following their collapse from the 2008 housing crisis, it is high time to apply FOIA to these GSEs and bring accountability and transparency for the American tax-payers. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, as you can see, this is a bill that I think has broad bipartisan support. It is something that we need to do for the taxpayers who have invested so much into Fannie and Freddie over the years. Let’s make them subject to FOIA. I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general de-bate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5- minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the na-ture of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Oversight and Gov-ernment Reform, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amend-ment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a sub-stitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–14 modified by the amendment printed in part A of House Report 115–96. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be consid-ered as read. The text of the amendment in the na-ture of a substitute is as follows:

SEC. 3. COMMERCIAL REQUESTERS. 
For purposes of subsection (n) of section 552 of title 5, United States Code, as added by section 2(a), each enterprise described in such sub-section shall establish a fee schedule such that in the first year the fees collected from requests for records intended for a commercial use cover the costs of administering such subsection (n), which shall be estimated as $40,000,000 in the first year. In each subsequent year, each such enterprise shall evaluate whether the fees col-lected under the prior year’s fee schedule were sufficient to recover all actual costs of admin-istering subsection (n) and revise the fee sched-ule to recover the costs of administering sub-section (n) in the following year and any out-standing costs of administering subsection (n) from the prior year not collected through fees in the prior year. Each such enterprise shall make the revised fee schedule and a detailed expla-nation of the prior year’s costs and projections of future costs that were used to justify the fee schedule publicly available online for 10 days prior to the fee schedule going into effect.

Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4617). ‘‘(2) For purposes of this subsection, the exemption described in subsection (b)(4), re-lating to trade secrets and commercial or fi-nancial information, shall apply without re-gard to whether such information was ob-tained from a person outside the Federal Na-tional Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, as the case may be.’’. Page 1, line 18, after ‘‘on the date’’ insert the following: ‘‘that is six months after the date’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 280, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. R
OSS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, the man-ager’s amendment that I am offering on behalf of Chairman C
HAFFETZ makes technical and conforming changes to the bill. Applying FOIA to Fannie and Freddie while the entities remain in conservatorship will better ensure that the American people know what their government does with their taxpayer dollars. But, if and when Fannie and Freddie come out of conservatorship, the entities need to be able to operate as commercially competitive busi-nesses. This amendment clarifies that Fannie and Freddie may use exemption 4, which protects sensitive commercial information from disclosure, regardless of whether information was obtained from a person outside of Fannie or Freddie, to protect their financially sensitive materials from public disclo-sure. Mr. Chairman, recognizing the ad-ministrative labors involved in setting up FOIA shops, the amendment also addresses the implementation date. Fannie and Freddie will likely need to hire staff, update their websites, and identify records to be made publicly available as a matter of course. The manager’s amendment, there-fore, provides Fannie and Freddie 6 months after the bill’s enactment to establish their respective staffs and protocols to administer FOIA. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not op-posed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Missouri is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which would make improvements that ad-dress concerns raised by FHFA. The manager’s amendment would make several important improvements to the underlying bill. This amendment would provide Fannie and Freddie 6 months to implement the bill. This time is important to ensure they have staff and procedures in place to process FOIA requests. This amendment would also clarify that Fannie and Freddie could use ex-emption 4 of FOIA in the same way that FHFA can currently use it to pro-tect trade secrets and commercial or financial information generated by Fannie and Freddie. Exemption 4 protects ‘‘trade secrets and commercial or financial informa-tion obtained from a person and privi-leged or confidential.’’ Exemption 4 re-quires that that information can only be protected if it comes from an out-side source rather than being generated by an agency itself. Without the language added by this amendment, there would have been un-certainty as to whether confidential business information that would have been protected if Fannie or Freddie sent it to FHFA would have been pro-tected when those entities were, them-selves, responding to FOIA requests. I appreciate Chairman C
HAFFETZ ’ willingness to work with us in address-ing these concerns, and I urge all Mem-bers to support this manager’s amend-ment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. R

AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . JOHNSON OF  
GEORGIA  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report 115–96. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 1, after line 16 insert the following new subsection (and redesignate the subse-quent subsection accordingly): (b) R
ULE OF CONSTRUCTION .—Nothing in this Act may be construed as precluding the application of any of the exemptions de-scribed in section 552 of title 5, United States Code, to subsection (n) of such section, as added by subsection (a). 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 280, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. J
OHNSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair-man, I would like to first commend Chairman C
HAFFETZ for introducing H.R. 1694, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. C
UMMINGS ) and members of the committee for all of their hard work on this legislation. H.R. 1694 would amend the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, to make its provisions apply to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when the two entities are in Federal conservatorship or receiver-ship. My amendment makes common-sense improvements to the underlying bill to ensure that all nine FOIA ex-emptions apply to government-spon-sored entities in conservatorship. By passing this amendment, we will ensure that personal privacy and sen-sitive information is appropriately pro-tected, while ensuring the highest level of transparency for the American tax-payers. I am pleased to have the support of Chairman CHAFFETZ on this amend-ment, and I urge all of the Members to support this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, though I am not op-posed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, FOIA does not require that all records be released to requesters. The FOIA statute allows agencies to withhold information under nine exemptions, which were designed to protect truly sensitive information that would be harmful to important in-terests if released. Just last year, Congress clarified that the expectation—and now the legal requirement—is that agencies only withhold information when it is necessary to prevent harm to the inter-est that the exemption was intended to protect. The Johnson amendment clari-fies that Fannie and Freddie would be allowed to withhold requested informa-tion under those nine exemptions, just as any other agency would be per-mitted to withhold information, if the enterprises reasonably foresee that dis-closure would harm a protected inter-est. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. J
OHNSON ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes ap-peared to have it. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . CLAY  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 115–96. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, as the des-ignee of the gentlewoman from the Vir-gin Islands (Ms. P
LASKETT ), I offer amendment No. 3. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
At the end of the bill, add the following new section: 
SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
Nothing in this Act, or the amendment made by this Act, may be construed as pre-cluding or restricting the disclosure of infor-mation regarding any proposed new product or significant new product term prior to loan

purchasing, or substantive negotiation with an interested party regarding purchase of loans with such new product or significant new product term. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 280, the gentleman from Mis-souri (Mr. C
LAY) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment of-fered by the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. P
LASKETT ). This amendment simply makes clear that the application of FOIA to Fannie and Freddie will not limit disclosures re-garding the loans to which Fannie and Freddie offer any type of guarantee or support. I agree that Americans have the right to know what loans and other agreements Fannie and Freddie are backing. Earlier this year, Fannie Mae created a ‘‘pilot program’’ under which Fannie has backed a large investor’s purchase of foreclosed homes that the investor will then lease. The public cer-tainly has a right to information about such programs. As Ms. P
LASKETT ’s amendment makes clear, such disclosures should occur before any loans are purchased or backed so that Congress can assess the potential effects on all stockholders, including taxpayers, home buyers, and renters. I appreciate the gentle-woman’s thoughtful amendment, and I urge all Members to support it. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, though I am not op-posed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, it is imper-ative that Fannie’s and Freddie’s con-servator—the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA—scrutinize new pur-chasing strategies to ensure that the enterprises’ dealings are in line with their charters to stimulate homeown-ership. If FHFA fails to guarantee the soundness of their business dealings, FOIA could empower the taxpayer to step in and hold accountable Fannie or Freddie. For instance, thanks to taxpayers’ explicit backing of Fannie earlier this year, Invitation Homes, the single-fam-ily rental business owned by the lucra-tive private equity firm Blackstone, se-cured a $1.8 billion initial public offer-ing, or IPO, the largest since October of 2015. In its IPO filing, Invitation Homes disclosed that Fannie, which received over $116 billion from the taxpayers in the aftershock of the financial crisis, is guaranteeing up to $1 billion in debt from Invitation. While Blackstone gets the money, the taxpayers take on the risk; and Fannie pivots unimpeded into the rental markets, leaving those hope-ful of homeownership with less sup-port. Applying FOIA to Fannie and Freddie under this bill strengthens the guarantee that government-sponsored entities are fulfilling their mandate to stimulate homeownership rather than being in the business of supporting profitable, private equity investors on the backs of taxpayers. Mr. Chairman, this amendment fur-ther clarifies the legislation’s assur-ance of applicable disclosures as a mechanism to keep Fannie and Freddie consistent with their Federal charters to stimulate homeownership. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. S
IMPSON ) having assumed the chair, Mr. C
OLLINS of Georgia, Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consider-ation the bill (H.R. 1694) to require ad-ditional entities to be subject to the re-quirements of section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.

But Poland has never been truly free because Mr. Putin—mother Russia—has controlled Poland’s energy. Mr. Putin has pun-ished Poland in their desire to be free by slowing natural gas exports in a cold, Polish winter that became much colder. Uncle Sam is about to put the Rus-sian bear on permanent hibernation by exporting American liquid freedom. Our liquified natural gas will leave Sabine Pass in June heading to Poland.

This past weekend, a group of East Brunswick High School students were recognized as the best team from the Northeast in the We the People com-petition. Competing against more than 1,200 students, this team demonstrated knowledge of constitutional principles in both historical and contemporary contexts. This weekend, students from John Witherspoon Middle School of Prince-ton and West Windsor-Plainsboro South High School will come to Wash-ington to compete in the final round of the 2017 National Science Bowl. To all of these students: The guid-ance of your teachers, Alan Brodman, Bill Merritt, and Sunila Sharma, and your hard work is evident, and New Jersey’s 12th District is very proud of you. It is an honor to represent a district that continues to emphasize the impor-tance of STEM and civic education, and encourage our Nation’s youth to thrive.

In his first 100 days, President Trump has enacted more pieces of legislation than any other President since Tru-man, facilitated the earliest Supreme Court confirmation since 1881, elimi-nated many onerous regulations to re-store economic optimism and oppor-tunity, protected the sanctity of life, and driven illegal border crossings to a 17-year low. His accomplishments are truly remarkable. I have appreciated President Trump’s willingness to listen and work with Congress on major pieces of legislation. His effort to work with Congress is a breath of fresh air. President Trump made several prom-ises to the American people, and I am encouraged by his efforts to fulfill them. Mr. Speaker, the American peo-ple are watching—they are watching both the President and those of us in Congress. They will not accept broken promises or half-hearted measures. They want results. I look forward to working alongside President Trump to keep our promises. f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S PROMISE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, the President made big promises on the campaign trail to drain the swamp. He promised that his Washington would look different. Well, it does look dif-ferent, but not in the way he promised. Instead of ethics reform, his adminis-tration rolled back ethics provisions that prevented officials from serving in Federal agencies that they lobbied in the last 2 years. He promised to tackle campaign fi-nance, saying that he wouldn’t accept campaign donations from special inter-est groups. Instead, he has invited the special interests into his Cabinet, ap-pointing them into the highest posi-tion. He promised he would ask Congress to pass campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American poli-tics. Instead, it turns out that some of his closest confidants and former cam-paign advisers have made millions lob-bying foreign governments. He promised he would release his own tax returns, but has not. The American people have no way of knowing how he or his family businesses stand to ben-efit from these tax cuts. Mr. Speaker, this is not draining the swamp. Everyone is accountable, espe-cially those in the highest levels of our government.

CONGRATULATING DARLENE JOHNSON (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Darlene Johnson of Woodland, Wash-ington, on being nominated for two Women in Transport Awards of 2017 by Transport News International. She was given these well-deserved awards for Best Woman-Owned Land Logistics Company in the Pacific Northwest, and Most Inspirational Woman in Land Transport in the Northwestern U.S. Throughout her distinguished career, Darlene has done everything in her power to serve her community. She currently sits on the Woodland Cham-ber of Commerce Board of Directors where she advocates for stronger envi-ronment for businesses in southwest Washington. Darlene’s tenacity and dedication motivate and inspire those around her, me included. Not only does she advocate for local businesses, but she is a local businessowner herself. Darlene, along with her husband, Jim, operate Wood-land Truck Line, Inc. It is fitting that she is receiving this award for success-fully running a business in an industry that is commonly thought to be male dominated. Those who know Darlene, like I do, know that if Darlene were to start a business in any other industry, she would go over, under, or right through any obstacles in her way. Darlene’s service to our community does not go unnoticed. There is not an issue affecting the Woodland commu-nity with which she is not actively in-volved. She currently is deserving of this prestigious award on behalf of southwest Washington. I congratulate her and wish her the best in her future endeavors and continued success in transportation. f 
LET’S START FOCUSING ON MAIN STREET AND AMERICAN WORKERS (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Penn-sylvania asked and was given permis-sion to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned throughout this country, including my home State of Pennsyl-vania, as a great populist, as a cham-pion of the working class. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Presi-dent Trump and his administration for revealing their true intentions yester-day when they revealed their Wall Street written and designed tax plan— a giveaway for millionaires and billion-aires. And not one thing—not one—for 99.9 percent of the working American people. Mr. Speaker, we do need tax reform, and you would see broad bipartisan support for that. But it has to be real. It has to be paid for. And it must in-clude relief for those three-quarters of the American people who pay more in payroll taxes than they ever do in indi-vidual income taxes. Enough of focusing on Wall Street and the corporate income tax rate, and let’s start focusing on Main Street and American workers.

HEALTHCARE DEBATE IN OUR NATION (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, as President Trump and Republicans in Congress work toward finally deliv-ering the American people relief from ObamaCare, it is important to remem-ber how we got here and why we find ourselves in this position today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2927 April 27, 2017 
We are approaching the fork in the road for health care in our country. We have a choice of two paths, and they lead to very different outcomes. ObamaCare’s regulatory behemoth is collapsing the individual market and is paving the way toward a disastrous re-sult, namely, socialized medicine—and the crowded waiting rooms, scarce ac-cess to physicians, and low-quality health care that comes with it, not to mention an unprecedented accumula-tion of power in Washington, D.C. This is not conjecture. Barack Obama, Harry Reid, and a whole host of ObamaCare supporters have been completely candid about their ultimate goal of a single-payer healthcare sys-tem, which could then seamlessly de-volve into socialized medicine. The time to right our course is now. Republicans are offering the American people a better way, one that fosters choice, lowers healthcare costs, and improves Americans’ health outcomes. We have two clear and very distinct op-tions. Let’s make the right choice and pull back from the brink of socialized medicine.

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S FIRST 100 DAYS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the last four elections have defined one of the most dramatic political realign-ments in our country’s history. In these elections, we have seen a net shift of 64 U.S. House seats, 12 U.S. Senate seats, 10 Governors, 919 State legislative seats, and the Presidency shift from Democrat to Republican. This happened in large part on three overarching mandates from the Amer-ican people: revive the economy, secure our borders, and restore our healthcare system. If President Trump can accom-plish these three objectives, his admin-istration and this Congress will be re-membered as one of the most success-ful and beneficial in our Nation’s his-tory. In working toward these goals, Presi-dent Trump has faced the most bitter, virulent, and partisan opposition that any President has endured since the election of 1860. We have seen the radical left in full display across our Nation with its ap-palling incivility, its intolerance of other points of view, and its disrespect of our democratic process and constitu-tional institutions. Sadly, this opposi-tion now permeates much of our press and academia. Yet, despite these obstacles, as we mark the first 100 days of this Presi-dency, there is ample reason to cele-brate the new direction that President Trump and this Congress have taken and the progress that we have made. Our overarching mandate is to revive our economy and restore prosperity to millions of struggling American fami-lies who have suffered the most dis-appointing decade in more than 80 years, buried under an avalanche of Obama-era regulations and taxes. American workers finally have an ad-vocate in the Oval Office. This Presi-dent has signed more legislation in his first 100 days than any President since Harry Truman. And many of these bills, as well as his executive orders, have begun repealing the heavy regula-tions that have been sinking our econ-omy. One study estimates these actions have already relieved our economy of $68 billion of destructive regulations. That comes to about $500 for every family in America. The Keystone pipeline alone will produce thousands of construction jobs, billions of dollars of private in-vestment, and, when completed, 830,000 barrels of Canadian crude oil entering American markets every day. And what has happened? Well, consumer confidence is up 3 points since the election. The S&P is up 11 percent, the NASDAQ is up more than 15 percent, and the Dow is up 13 percent. 317,000 more Americans are working today than on the day the President took the oath of office, un-employment has dropped three-tenths of a point, and the labor participation rate has started to inch upward once again. It is not yet ‘‘morning again in America,’’ but the first faint shades of light are appearing on our economic horizon. The second great mandate was to se-cure the borders after many years, when millions of illegal immigrants made a mockery of our Nation’s sov-ereignty and our rule of law. Wages for working Americans stagnated, jobs dried up, and social services have strained as a result. Well, finally, we have a President who takes the Nation’s security and the sovereignty of our borders seri-ously. Renewed enforcement has, by all accounts, boosted morale of our immi-gration agencies dramatically, and criminal aliens are finally being de-ported—already showing a 32 percent increase in deportations compared to the last administration. Because of this new resoluteness, illegal border crossings have plunged by some 60 per-cent. b1600 Now, healthcare reform is the third of the mandates. That requires con-gressional action, and here is where Congress has let him down. But as we approach the 100th day of the adminis-tration, it appears legislation will soon begin moving to the Senate, and, be-fore long, the collapsing, one-size-fits- all bureaucracy of ObamaCare will give way to a healthy and vibrant healthcare market where Americans will have the widest possible range of choices to meet their own needs with the supported tax system to ensure that these plans are within the finan-cial reach of every American. Ultimately, though, the success of this administration will not be meas-ured by 100 days or by talking points from politicians. It will be measured by a simple question that every American will answer for himself or herself: Am I better off today? As we approach this first checkpoint in the course of this administration, there is strong reason to believe the answer to that question will be a decisive yes. This is a period of great change, and great change brings great controversy. But I believe that this President and our Nation can take increasing con-fidence from these first 100 days and can take great strength in knowing that a day is fast approaching when we will awaken and realize it is, indeed, morning again in America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
FIRST 100 DAYS ACCOMPLISHMENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentleman from Geor-gia (Mr. W
OODALL ) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I appre-ciate you yielding and being willing to stick around with me this afternoon. I have a great pleasure this afternoon, and that is to talk about successes that we have had together. I was down on the floor earlier when we were debating the rule, and I was talking to my Democratic colleagues on the Rules Committee about the good work that was going on in the Rules Committee; the good work that was going on on the House floor. In fact, we brought the bill—it was a rau-cous debate, Mr. Speaker. You will re-member it. We argued for an hour about all sorts of extraneous things, then we brought the bill down, and it passed, I believe unanimously, here on the floor of the House just a few min-utes ago. I don’t understand that. I just don’t understand what those drivers are in politics, Mr. Speaker, that encourages us to tear folks down instead of build folks up. And that is why I want to talk about some successes today. You can’t see my slides, Mr. Speaker, but I have got some numbers written down to the left in red, and those are the numbers that are worth paying atten-tion to. Twenty-eight. Twenty-eight is the number of bills President Trump has signed into law in his first 100 days; 28. That is more bills signed into law than any other American President since Harry Truman. More bills. Now, I read the same newspapers you read, Mr. Speaker. I listen to the same news broadcasts you listen to. I hear folks talk about inac-tion. I hear folks talk about confusion. I hear folks talk about division. I don’t

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2928 April 27, 2017 
hear folks talking about success, and success is what marks these first 100 days. Again, there has been more legisla-tive activity than any other President and Congress—collaboratively Con-gress, House, Senate, Republicans, Democrats—more legislative success than we have had in any Congress and White House combination since Harry Truman. Mr. Speaker, we had the first Su-preme Court confirmation in the first 100 days since 1881—since 1881. Now, it is with no joy that I share with you that the Supreme Court is such a pow-erful institution, Mr. Speaker. I think too often we fail to get the job done legislatively, and the Court steps in and legislates from right across the street. That wasn’t the job the Con-stitution envisioned. That wasn’t the job assigned in Article III, but it is the job that has been taken on by default. So it has become increasingly impor-tant that we make sure the Court is staffed. I supported the Senate having hear-ings on the Garland nomination last cycle. I supported the Senate having hearings on the Gorsuch nomination this cycle. Decision after decision in the last session went 4–4, which meant we could sustain the underlying Court’s decision, but we couldn’t decide these important questions that were still a source of confusion across this country. We now have a fully staffed Supreme Court again—the first time since 1881. We have seen a Supreme Court confirmation in the first 100 days of a new administration. Seventeen, Mr. Speaker. It has been 17 years since illegal border crossings reached this low level. I am going to come back to that. But what I am say-ing is that words matter. And what the President has said is: we are going to grow the most robust economy the world has ever seen, but we are going to do it with a legal visa program that makes sure folks are coming and going in accordance with U.S. law. And sim-ply that change in attitude, Mr. Speak-er, simply that change in attitude from ‘‘we are going to ignore the law’’ to ‘‘the law matters’’ has brought illegal crossings down to a 17-year low. Mr. Speaker, 728; that is the number of millions of dollars saved with the President’s first foray into cutting Federal budgets. His first foray into cutting Federal budgets, he started taking a look at Federal contracts. Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, what it is like to be a new President of the United States, particularly one that doesn’t come out of a legislative or government tradition? Everything is new as it comes to the content, but what is not new is so much of the proc-ess. The President has been looking at contracts his entire life, Mr. Speaker. The President has been negotiating contracts his entire life. He took a look at the beginnings of the Pentagon con-tracts and said, by golly, we can do better for the American people; $728 million on project number one saved for the American taxpayer. That brings us to number 16, Mr. Speaker, and that is 16 years since con-sumer confidence in this country has been as high as it is today. I enjoy traveling across the district, Mr. Speaker, and I am talking to folks. We are a divided community, like every community is in the country. Some folks believe one thing; some folks be-lieve another. Generally, we are united on issues, but sometimes we are di-vided on issues. And voter after voter after voter says: R
OB, I am not sure what is going to happen, but I feel like we are going to have opportunity. It has been 16 years since consumer con-fidence has reached this high of a level. Now, with that increase in con-fidence, Mr. Speaker, comes an incred-ible obligation on the 435 of us to de-liver. This isn’t confidence that is based on nothing happening. This is confidence based on something hap-pening. We have real obligations to ful-fill those promises, those commitments that we all made during the last elec-tion cycle. I think we have the men and women in this Chamber who can do it, but it has been 16 years since the American people believed that we could. I want to put those border crossings in perspective, Mr. Speaker. There has been a 61 percent decline in border crossings in President Trump’s first 100 days. Now, I come from Georgia. We have got a robust agricultural economy in Georgia. And I tell my constituents day in and day out, if you are not going to raise your son or daughter to pick carrots in south Georgia; if you don’t aspire for your son or daughter to be the very best cabbage picker that we have in the State of Georgia; if you are not aspiring to be part of that agricul-tural economy and help us get crops out of the field, we are going to need somebody who is aspiring to do that hard work. And it is hard work, Mr. Speaker. Well, if we can agree that these aren’t jobs that American citizens are losing, these are jobs that are adding to the American economy, then we need a legal visa program to let folks come in and to let folks go out. I went on a bipartisan codel, Mr. Speaker—a bipartisan codel, Republicans and Democrats, traveling together to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras talking with families. You remember the women and chil-dren crisis there: unaccompanied mi-nors coming across the border? I talked to family after family, and they said: R
OB, listen, I don’t want to be an American citizen. I don’t want to go to America. I don’t want to be in Amer-ica. I am happy here at home. But dad, or my husband, he generally travels to America during the growing season, during the construction season, and turns around and comes back home when that season is over. Well, you all are getting so tough on your border security, you are not hand-ing out legal visas to do this work, that now my husband or my dad can’t come back home when the growing sea-son is over. So now we are all picking up, and we are trying to get into Amer-ica, too, so the family can stay to-gether. Well, it makes perfectly good sense to me if you were that family. It makes no sense if you are the American tax-payer. You recognize that you have jobs that need to be filled. You recog-nize you have skills that you are not training your children to fulfill, and you don’t want to change the visa pro-gram to make that happen. The President has committed to growing the economy. We know that is going to mean legal access in and out of the country. There was a 61 percent drop in illegal border crossings in the first 100 days. I will tell you what else that means, Mr. Speaker. That means, instead of our border patrol men and women working that border under very dif-ficult conditions, instead of our law en-forcement, instead of all of the instru-ments of homeland security that we have in this country being focused on families crossing the border, with a 61 percent decline in this human traffic crossing the border, law enforcement can now focus on the real security issues to this country: to the drugs crossing the border, to the weapons crossing the border; forbid the thought to weapons of mass destruction cross-ing the border. There have been tremendously im-portant accomplishments here in the first 100 days; so much more that we will be able to do together. Mr. Speaker, there were 25 Iranian entities sanctioned by the Trump ad-ministration in the first 100 days. That is what we did together in this Cham-ber. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, we passed the Iranian sanctions lan-guage in a bipartisan way to send the word to the leaders of Iran that while we have great respect for your citi-zenry, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. We do not trust you to be a mem-ber of the league of nations with nu-clear capabilities, and the answer is no as you pursue those very dangerous dreams. Well, you will remember, President Obama negotiated a deal with the international community and with the Iranians. I wish he hadn’t, but he did. We had sanctions. Those sanctions are now gone. Iran is pursuing very much the same path that I would have ex-pected them to pursue, given the deal that was negotiated. And the world continues to be a dangerous place. Well, we have rules on the books today, laws on the books today that allow the government, in consultation with Congress, in cooperation with Congress, based on statutes passed by Congress, to get involved unilaterally as the United States of America in try-ing to prevent a nuclear Iran.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2929 April 27, 2017 
There were 25 different entities iden-tified by this administration as helping the Iranian Government to pursue those dangerous and illegal nuclear goals sanctioned and reined in. It is going to make a difference. It is going to make a difference to national secu-rity. It is going to make a difference to international security. Mr. Speaker, $18 billion—you can’t see this slide, but already in 4 months on the job, 4 months in cooperation with this Congress, we have seen $18 billion saved through the elimination of red tape. I don’t mean $18 billion that is a one-time deal, Mr. Speaker. I mean $18 billion annually in wasteful compliance costs erased by this admin-istration, again, often in cooperation and consultation with Congress. When I go back and tell you that this President has signed more bills into law than any President since Harry Truman in cooperation with this Con-gress, I am talking about many of the bills that did exactly this: cutting red tape, saving the American taxpayer money. Those bills, very often, were brought through the Congressional Re-view Act process. That is a process, as you know, Mr. Speaker, that allows the Congress to take a look at the regula-tions that the administration promul-gates. We pass the laws; the administration writes the regs; we get to go back and look at the regs to make sure they rep-resent the true intent of the legisla-tion. Well, in many instances so far this year, Mr. Speaker—in fact, in more in-stances than any other time in Amer-ican history, we have decided that those regulations do not reflect the in-tent of Congress. In fact, often they are running directly contrary to the intent of Congress. We have eliminated those $18 billion annually in savings to the American taxpayer. Remember the Keystone pipeline, Mr. Speaker. This administration approved the Dakota Access pipeline. Think back, Mr. Speaker. We are going to dis-agree on things. I am perfectly com-fortable with the disagreements that this body has. But when the applica-tion for the Keystone pipeline was de-livered to the administration, it took longer for the past two administrations to approve the Keystone pipeline—and by approve it, I mean ultimately they rejected it. It took longer for them to consider and reject the Keystone pipe-line than it took for Americans to build the Hoover Dam from start to finish. I want you to think about that. When we are talking about jobs; when we are talking about the economy; when we are talking about America being that beacon of hope, and freedom, and op-portunity across the country; when we are talking about the tremendous need for public works projects in this coun-try, and the amazing things the Amer-ican people can do when they put their shoulder into it, it took longer in the 21st century to get an answer to wheth-er or not you are allowed to build a pipeline than it took to build the Hoo-ver Dam from start to finish. That is bad for all of us. b1615 That is bad for every Republican, every Democrat, every Independent. Every single American citizen needs economic opportunity. Every single American citizen needs a job. Every single American citizen needs the cer-tainty of knowing if the pipeline is bad, let’s cancel it and let’s move on. But let’s not sit and wait and delay. Let’s not debate and debate. Let’s get to an answer. In the first 100 days on the job, Presi-dent Trump got to an answer. Presi-dent Bush and President Obama, com-bined, again, over 8 years of delay. President Trump, first 100 days, ap-proved this. What does this mean? Well, it means that the oil coming out of Canada is going to come to America to be re-fined. Remember, the Keystone Pipe-line debate, Mr. Speaker, was never about the environment and whether or not the Canadians were going to har-vest this oil. It was never about that. The Canadians were loud and clear: We are going to get this oil out of the ground. We are either going to get it out of the ground and send it to Amer-ica to be processed, or we are going to get it out of the ground and send it to China to be processed. You pick. Well, Mr. Speaker, that is an easy choice. If I get to be king of Canada, I can make different decisions about their environment. But while Canada has sovereignty and gets to make its own decisions about its natural re-sources, we get to decide: Are Amer-ican citizens going to profit from the processing of this oil or is China going to profit from the processing of this oil? When this oil gets processed, who do you think is doing it in the most envi-ronmentally sensitive manner, Mr. Speaker? You tell me. If there’s a sin-gle colleague in this body that believes the Chinese are better stewards of the environment than the Americans are, then you needed to vote ‘‘no’’ on the Keystone pipeline. But if you believe that we care more about Mother Earth than the Chinese do, if you believe that American rules and regulations protect the environment more than Chinese rules and regulations do, then you needed to be a supporter of the Key-stone pipeline. In his first 100 days, President Trump took this source of indecision and con-fusion and provided certainty. That is not academic, Mr. Speaker. That cer-tainty is directly connected to jobs. You can’t see it from where you sit, Mr. Speaker, but I am talking about over 500,000 new jobs not connected to the pipeline, individually. There are going to be a lot of jobs on the pipeline. Not this number. I am talking about this approach to governing that says people deserve a ‘‘yes’’ or a ‘‘no’’ an-swer. People deserve certainty. People deserve fast responses. People don’t need to hang in the lurch. Every single Member of this body, Mr. Speaker, has seen it in their con-stituency back home where a small- business owner said: You know what? I wanted to hire a few more people, but I wasn’t really sure what was about to happen and so I have been putting it off. I wanted to open a new franchise, but I wasn’t entirely sure of what the economic situation was going to be so I have been putting it off. When we talk about the economic growth over the past 100 days, when we talk about the stock markets moving, when we talk about consumer con-fidence rising, when we talk about new jobs being created, we are talking about a change in attitude. And I have seen it on both sides of this body. It is a shame, Mr. Speaker, there is that underlying current that maybe voters reward fighting with each other more than they reward working to-gether. I don’t believe it, but I cer-tainly see people posit that theory. I believe folks reward cooperation and getting things done. I don’t think peo-ple pay us to agree with each other. I think people pay us to make progress together—500,000 new jobs. I will read from The Wall Street Journal. It says: ‘‘The Trump order is a promise in the bank for the voters who elected the President because he prom-ised to focus on jobs and revving up the economy.’’ I believe it is 12 congressional dis-tricts, Mr. Speaker, that have Demo-crats representing them in Congress, but those districts voted for President Trump in the Presidential election. These are not conservative men and women out across the district pursuing some sort of ideological agenda. These are hardworking American families who identify more with the Democratic Party and Democratic values but who began to lose hope in what was going on with regulation across the country and job creation across the country, and they cast their vote for President Trump. Over 500,000 new jobs, Mr. Speaker. What are we talking about? We are talking about the Keystone pipeline. We are talking about the Clean Power Plan, which, alone, threatened to put about 286,000 jobs out to pasture. We are talking about new investments in infrastructure. I am not just talking about roads and bridges, Mr. Speaker. I am talking about the FAA and air transportation. I am talking about ports like the Port of Savannah in Georgia, the fastest growing container port in the Nation, and sea transportation. I am talking about railroads. I am talking about water infrastructure to make sure every family has access to clean and healthy drinking water. These are job-creating proposals, and they are job-creating proposals that have been kept off the books for so long because of regulatory uncertainty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH2930 April 27, 2017 
Today we have an opportunity to do that for the very first time. Mr. Speaker, I am going to take you back to where I began, and that is that we have a choice in this country. We can focus on the things that divide us all day every day. We can do it. I still believe there is more that unites us as a nation than divides us as a nation, but if you choose to spend your time talking about those things that divide us, you can fill up a day. If you choose to spend your time talking about those things that are broken yet proffering no solutions to fix them, you can fill up a day. If you choose to spend your day talking about why everybody else is a lazy son of a gun and only you have access to the truth, you can fill up a day, and then a week, and then a month, and then a year, and then a Presidential cycle, and then a decade, and then a genera-tion. But, Mr. Speaker, if you will recog-nize that working together we have al-ready passed more laws in 2017 than any other Congress and President working together since Harry Truman, if you will recognize that we have taken the uncertainty out of the Su-preme Court—we fully staffed the Su-preme Court so that uncertainty in the legal arena will exist no longer—if you recognize that a thorny issue like ille-gal immigration that has been made so difficult to solve because we haven’t been able to figure out how to deal with the border security aspect so that we can go on and deal with the other thorny issues, those border crossings are down, which means our oppor-tunity has increased for dealing with these problems that have plagued our Nation for so long. I can give you one example of that, Mr. Speaker. I am going to digress. I have got a family in my district trying to bring a relative into the country from Haiti. They have been working on it for 11 years—11 years. All the talk that goes on in this body about immigration, nobody is taking about helping my constituents from Haiti. Nobody is talking about passing a law to make it easier to get your family member in from Haiti. Nobody is talking about those families that have been separated while trying to follow the law of the land. Nobody is talking about those families that have paid out of pocket to go through the legal process—all the time, all the money, all the delay to do it the right way. Nobody is talking about fixing it for those families. Let’s fix it for those families because we all agree there is a better way. If you want to get your adult child in from Mexico, Mr. Speaker, you needed to file your paperwork in 1993 for their number to be coming up today—1993, to do it the right way and have their number to come up today. Who believes a 25-year process to bring a family member into this coun-try is the right answer? Of course folks are going to do it the wrong way. If you want to bring your adult brother or sister in from the Phil-ippines, you had to file in 1994 for their number to be coming up legally today. Who believes that is the right system? The system is broken. We don’t have enough trust together to repair the system. By eliminating the illegal bor-der crossing’s immediate challenge, the President has created the headroom for us to work together on issues that we can absolutely solve. 728, Mr. Speaker, the number of mil-lions of dollars saved in contract nego-tiations thus far—in fact, not even thus far, but contract negotiations on one single Pentagon project that the Presi-dent has inserted himself in. For all the things you may think the President knows, doesn’t know, you agree with, you disagree with, you have to know that he knows how to drive a hard bargain. You have to know that he knows how to negotiate big contracts. The American taxpayer is not satis-fied with the way we have been doing it, with the way former White Houses have been doing it. We have an oppor-tunity to come together and do it bet-ter, and the President is leading us in that way. And that all culminates, Mr. Speak-er, in 16. That is the number of years since consumer confidence in this country was at its current levels. You can do that math if you would like, Mr. Speaker. It will take you back through an entire 8 years of Democratic control of the White House, and it will take you back through an entire 8 years of Republican control of the White House. The American consumer does not care whether you are a Republican or a Democrat. The American consumer cares whether or not they think their job is secure. The American consumer does not care if you are a Republican or a Demo-crat. The American consumer cares whether prices are higher tomorrow or lower tomorrow. The American consumer does not care about our petty, silly, inside-the- beltway Washington arguments. They care about whether America is going to be stronger for their children and grandchildren a generation from now. And it has been 16 years since Amer-ican consumers have the optimism that they have today. I will say it again, Mr. Speaker. We can consume every second of every day in this body fussing, griping, com-plaining—there are lots of things that are wrong and lots of folks to blame for it—or we can recognize the big hopes and dreams that the American people have placed on this President and this Congress and this time in our history. We can recognize that there is still more that unites us in this country than divides us in this country. We can still recognize that folks care very lit-tle about us and our families and care so very much about their community and their families. With that as our touchstone, Mr. Speaker, call me an irrational opti-mist, but I think there is absolutely nothing that we can’t do together, and I look forward to playing a role in that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S TAX PLAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. J
AYAPAL ) is recog-nized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks and include extra-neous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentle-woman from Washington? There was no objection. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, this Special Order is for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I am so proud to be a vice chair of that caucus and to lead the Special Order hour with my colleague, the gentleman from Mary-land (Mr. R
ASKIN ). We do this once a week, and we try to take up topics that we think are of great interest across the country to our constituency. So I am very proud to have the Congressional Progressive Caucus leading the way on so many issues that are important, from edu-cation to transportation, infrastruc-ture to, of course, today’s topic, which is the tax plan that was released yes-terday by President Trump. The tax plan that was released yes-terday—and I have to start by saying I am not sure this is actually the plan. I am not sure that a one-page document constitutes a plan. This is not even a two-sided document. It is a one-sided document. This is what we are reacting to. And it is similar to the tax plan that candidate Trump spoke about dur-ing the campaign. So we will do our best with what has been put forward as a plan, but this plan, in our estimation, when you look at what it contains, really amounts to nothing more than a one-page docu-ment full of handouts to the rich. The Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, yesterday said, during a press conference, that one thing that this President has done very well—this is a quote: ‘‘One thing this President has done very well is listen.’’ Mr. Speaker, I have to disagree with that. Two weekends ago, there were 190,000 Americans in red States and blue States across the country who were on the streets asking for the President to release his tax returns in the same way that every other Presi-dent of the United States has done in modern history. Unfortunately, this President has not listened. As a can-didate, he said he would release his tax returns. As a President, he has refused to do so.

He didn’t listen when women and their allies took to the streets in the biggest march in American history to demand that he respect women, protect Planned Parenthood, and support equal rights for women. And this President certainly didn’t listen to the millions of Americans who were outspoken in their opposition to the Republican healthcare plan that es-sentially took $1 trillion off of the backs of working people and folks who need health care across this country and transferred it to the wealthiest in our country. The reality is this President, unfor-tunately, has not been listening to the American people. If you look at that healthcare plan, just as an example, only 17 percent of the American public actually supported TrumpCare. This President has not been listening, to now put forward another plan on health care that again suggests that we should actually take away essential health benefits from people, take away the opportunity for people to have pre-existing conditions covered, and, once again, leaving an additional 24 million Americans stripped of their health care. b1630 So in this tax press conference yes-terday, it became very clear that the administration doesn’t have really an idea of exactly what the plan is going to look like, except for the fact that it will be good for business. Secretary Mnuchin said: ‘‘Under the Trump plan, we will have a massive tax cut for businesses. . . .’’ Despite all of President Trump’s bro-ken promises, we have to believe that this may actually be true. Let’s not forget that the Secretary of the Treas-ury was a C-level executive at Goldman Sachs and his loyalties have been with Big Business. The tax plan, as we have been given it on this one-page document, is a gift- wrapped tax cut to the highest earners and corporations. The claim is that it was written to create jobs and spur economic growth and help low- and middle-income families, but what it really does is drastically reduce tax rates for Big Business to just 15 per-cent. That tax break isn’t just for co-operations; it is also for pass-through firms. Let’s be clear about what pass- through firms are. Pass-through firms are entities that wealthy people and companies use in order to funnel money and have lower tax rates. Among these companies is The Trump Organization. This is why, in asking for the Presi-dent’s tax returns, this is not just an ask that doesn’t have any meaning. It is not a partisan ask. We have 190,000 Americans in the streets in red States and blue States asking. When we know what is in the President’s tax returns, then we have the ability to make sure that we understand, as the American people, whether any plan he proposes is in the interest of the American people or whether it is in his own financial in-terest. According to the Center for Amer-ican Progress, 70 percent of partnership and S corporation income goes to the top 1 percent of U.S. households by in-come. So when you propose a tax cut for these pass-through entities, we are talking about a tax cut for the people in the top 1 percent of this country. We are not talking about a tax cut that benefits middle class, working families. The Center on Budget and Policy Pri-orities provided a specific example where a lawyer making $1 million a year could funnel their income through that pass-through and could actually save $180,000 a year. There is no doubt that this President would himself ben-efit from this tax plan, although we can’t say exactly how much, because we haven’t seen the tax returns and we don’t know exactly which financial in-terests he has and how much he would benefit. However, his own lawyers reported that nearly all of his 500 or so busi-nesses are—don’t be surprised—pass- throughs. If we accept this assertion from his lawyers that his assets are worth more than $10 billion, then this tax plan or tax ploy, depending on how you want to see it, would actually save the President of the United States mil-lions of dollars, but it would not ben-efit millions of working families across this country who actually need to see our tax system reform so that it is more fair. When asked how these tax cuts were paid for, Secretary Mnuchin said they would be so effective at bolstering the economy that it would pay for itself. Now, we have seen trickle-down eco-nomics before in this country, and it is a nonsensical idea that this tax plan would bolster the economy. We have seen the disastrous effects of trickle- down economics specifically on low-in-come and middle-income families. The Tax Foundation estimates that reducing the business rate for compa-nies and pass-throughs to 15 percent would actually reduce revenue in this country by $3.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found that, at the very best, the plan would only spur enough growth to pay for less than half the cost of the tax cuts. Low-and middle- income Americans would ultimately pay the price, not Big Business. Now, this is similar to what we saw in the healthcare plan. In the healthcare plan, if you remember, what we saw was a proposal to cut $880 bil-lion from Medicaid and take that money and essentially give a trillion dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest. So if you were in the top 4 percent of income earners in this country, you would have gotten a tax cut of about $200,000 a year. But if you were in that age that we like to call seniors, be-tween 50 and 64, you would have an age tax and you would have to pay up to $15,000 more on your premiums. So that is why some of my colleagues across the aisle actually called that healthcare plan a downpayment on a tax plan. It was supposed to be the be-ginning of a tax reform plan that, again, moved more money to the wealthiest in our country. We are seeing a State-level micro-cosm of this playing out right now in the State of Kansas where the State passed massive tax cuts, including ex-empting pass-throughs from State taxes. The result? More than 333,000 residents changed their income to funnel through pass- throughs in the first year alone. What happened in Kansas when this was pushed through? State revenue went down by an addi-tional almost 2 percent, costing $206 million in 2013 and $472 million the fol-lowing year. Today, the State faces a $1.1 billion shortfall, and residents are paying the price in lost programming and services. But the promise that was made at the time that this plan was pushed through in Kansas—the same kind of plan that is being proposed today at the Federal level—the promise that was made was that it would kick-start the economy. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, that hasn’t happened either. Economic growth in Kansas is happening at just half the national average. Because here is the thing: tax cuts don’t just pay for themselves, and there are plenty of experts on both sides of the aisle that will attest to that. A sheet of paper is not a plan, and everyone knows it. When reporters pressed Secretary Mnuchin and the National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn for details, they failed to provide anything of sub-stance. A reporter asked Cohn three times what the tax cut would look like for a family of four making $60,000 per year. I have a lot of those families, Mr. Speaker, in my district. I believe we have those families in red States and blue States, working people across this country who believe that America should be and must be a land of oppor-tunity for people who work hard. Maybe they are not the richest people in the world. Maybe they are not the richest top 1 percent in this country. But they work hard, they earn a good living, and they deserve to have fair-ness in our tax plan. Now, when Mr. Cohn was asked three times by this reporter what the tax cut would look like for a family of four making $60,000 a year, he replied it is ‘‘gonna mean a tax cut’’ three times in a row. Instead of getting answers, though, and when he was pressed, re-porters were told over and over again that they would get more information later and that the administration is in ‘‘robust talks.’’ Well, I am a Member of the House, and supposedly those robust talks are happening with the House and the Sen-ate. We all represent the people of the United States. We want to all be a part

of the conversation, and we demand to know specifically, as we look at this plan, how this President, his family, and his Cabinet will benefit from the tax plan. That is only fair, Mr. Speak-er, that we understand exactly how this tax plan would benefit the person who is proposing the tax plan. Is this tax plan for the American peo-ple to see relief, or is it for the Presi-dent and his best friends to see relief? The reality is that this is about an issue of trust. The American people de-serve to know whether they can trust this President and this administration to act on their behalf. So far, unfortu-nately, this administration has contin-ued to throw the middle class under the bus, whether it is threatening to cut funding for Meals on Wheels, which is part of the budget proposal in cut-ting the CDBG programs, or whether it is in proposing a healthcare plan that cuts vital health care from millions of Americans. So we are intent to stay ex-tremely vigilant. I see that we have a couple of col-leagues from the Progressive Caucus. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distin-guished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J
ACKSON LEE), a colleague on the Judi-ciary Committee, a strong champion for working people in Texas and across our country. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wash-ington (Ms. J
AYAPAL ) for yielding and for her leadership on this Special Order. I will take just a moment of the gen-tlewoman’s time because I think she has captured the essence of the frustra-tion, not that Members of Congress have, but that the American people have. So I wanted to make sure that I shared some of the contrasts that we have between what has happened yes-terday and the announcement of the administration of Mr. Trump’s tax pro-posal, which, in essence, is really a bowl of horror. It is a continuation of an ineffective 100 days, and the fear that I have is that it was rushed and put together to meet this really unnec-essary standard or unnecessary test of 100 days, one that was so pronounced during Mr. Trump’s campaign in con-trast to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush, and Mr. Obama, the last three Presidents that we have as examples. What is in the first 100 days? The first 100 days should be working. You should be working every day and you should have to account or you should be able to account for the suc-cesses that you have done in the nor-mal course of work. Methodically, you can check off the good that you have done for the American people; that it comes naturally, that you have been methodical, that you have worked with Congress, that you worked with your executives, that you have looked to see what can be improved. All that we can see is what has been destroyed or dismantled or taxed or ridiculed. There is nothing that advan-tages the American people. Certainly, the healthcare bill was ridiculing the American people. It was ridiculous. $880 billion was taken from Medicaid; $600 billion was to be used for tax cuts, which they do not have at this point. We fear that they will be rushing through such a bill in the next couple of days. More importantly, where was the commitment to all of the promises? So let me just speak to two par-ticular points. The economic security of women, what has happened under this adminis-tration? Blocking expanded overtime pay, which disproportionately benefits women workers. Failing to advance equal pay, paid family leave, and af-fordable childcare legislation, talking about it but doing nothing. Endangering retirement security by blocking a rule requiring retirement advisers to put clients first. Can you imagine? Senior citizens have helped build this country, and you would deny them ade-quate counsel on their retirement. That has happened. All of these have happened under the Trump administration: proposing se-vere cuts to the Department of Labor, which would hinder enforcement of family and medical leave. Of course, cutting Meals on Wheels, as has been indicated. Cutting the National Insti-tutes of Health. Major lifesaving re-search down the drain. Scientists look-ing for other countries to go to because they have no room at the inn. And then making student debt harder to pay off by rescinding a rule that limits the fees that loan companies can charge its borrowers. Remember, those borrowers are 18, 19, 20, 21 years old. They are the next generation or the current generation of the builders of this economy and this society. Then to add insult to injury, if I might say, yesterday a big pronounce-ment announced over the weekend the biggest, fattest tax cut you could ever have or tax reform that you would ever have. Of course, everyone knows in America this is not tax reform. This is a simple bunch of tax cuts that will have a competition between debt and deficit. This will be a spiraling down-ward trend digging America into the deepest hole of debt and deficit in the history of the United States. Trillions of dollars spent on individ-uals and corporations that do not need it. How do I know? I have spoken to them, and there is a whole litany of corporate issues that are not being answered. For example, the idea of being able to deduct interest payments is nowhere to be found. That might help middle class working families, as well as corpora-tions and small businesses. What you have is trickle-down eco-nomics. President Trump’s tax plan is built on the same trickle-down eco-nomics that withered inequality and undermined working families. There are massive tax breaks for Trump himself. In the course of his days that he may have paid taxes—and let me be very clear that we don’t know what impact this tax bill would have on him because we do not have his tax returns. But we do know, in the last time we have records, he had to pay $39 million in taxes because of the alternative minimum tax put in place in 1986 by President Reagan. Can you imagine? If there was not the AMT—alter-native minimum tax—he would be pay-ing $5 million. b1645 Well, ladies and gentlemen, my dear colleagues, they have eliminated in this tax bill the AMT. That sounds sus-picious, and it shouldn’t sound sus-picious. It is suspicious, and the reality of it is it is self-promoting and self- happening. Then, of course, these tax cuts are moving the corporate rate from 35 to 15. Let me make a breaking news an-nouncement. Most corporations pay about 14, but with the 35 moved to 15, maybe they will pay zero. Who is going to be part of the overall supporting and investment in this Na-tion, to build our infrastructure, to create jobs, to build the new level of energy, new technology, to ensure that health care is provided for those who need it, to make sure that the Afford-able Care Act continues to cover the millions of people that need it instead of cutting 24 million people? Well, with the tax cuts in place, there is a rush to judgment. That judg-ment is a pronouncement of a complete deficit hole for the American people. That is what this tax cut does. There are no benefits for working class Amer-icans or middle class Americans. There is no incentive to create jobs. In fact, I have no idea what the thinking or planning was that went into the Presi-dent’s tax plan. All I know is that the American peo-ple who get up every day and go to work, or those who get up every day and get three or four buses to go to work—and part of the time that they are going to work, they have to drop off their children at a school that may not be in their neighborhood because there is a need for more investment in education. All I know is that those peo-ple whom I am so proud to be able to represent, as well as large businesses and small businesses that, I believe, as I have listened to corporate leaders just a few hours ago saying, ‘‘We are with you all. We want what is best for America. This is not what we desire, not to give all to us or the top 1 per-cent. We want to help America grow because, as America grows, our compa-nies thrive, our shareholders thrive,’’ that is not the message of this admin-istration. So I am delighted to join the Con-gressional Progressive Caucus to ask the question of the Trump administra-tion: Are you so worried about the 100

days that you cannot worry about the American people? Is 100 days more im-portant than the mother who is trav-eling to work 3 and 4 hours? Is 100 days more important than the traveling salesmen who need the kind of infra-structure and roads that work? or those in southern America that need the kind of rural electric system that helps them? or those that need clean energy? or those that need research for the next cure for sickle cell anemia? Is your 100 days so important that you cannot provide resources for law enforcement and firefighters and first responders, that you cannot provide help for the national parks, the Na-tional Endowment for the Arts, and you cannot provide direction to the De-partment of Justice, which has turned itself into the injustice, unjust depart-ment, exploring ideas of taking away civil rights, denying individuals their rights as citizens in the United States in terms of discrimination and equal-ity, opportunity or, in actuality, cre-ating the one thing that you can be proud of, and that is the deportation task force that is demonizing hard-working individuals who simply want an opportunity for their families? So I would only say that I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. R
ASKIN ), as well, for his presence here and others that will come and ask the question: Are all these people that we have listed less important than your 100 days? I am saddened if the an-swer is yes. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague Congress-woman P
RAMILA JAYAPAL and who is leading tonight ‘‘Congressional Progressive Caucus Special Order the impact of President Trump’s Tax Cut Plan.’’ As a member of the House Budget Com-mittee, I would participate in any Committee’s markup of a tax reform bill. President Trump’s much anticipated tax plan is another disappointment; a poor work prod-uct; something he should have been ashamed to put his name on; and it reveals yet again what many warned about before the election. This President is unprepared for his office, and he shows either no capacity or interest in on the job training. This tax plan in any school of business would get a failing grade. A one page federal tax cut plan—really is an insult to the American People. This plan shows no command of the facts regarding our nation’s very complex tax sys-tem. President Trump’s tax plan, just as his healthcare reform proposal, and immigration reform proposal would hurt working families and disproportionately favor the wealthy and large corporations at the expense of the na-tion’s middle class. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin set out a test for tax reform that, ‘‘there will be no ab-solute tax cut for the upper class.’’ But the president’s tax plan has failed this test miserably by providing a huge tax cut for the wealthy while middle income families would receive very little benefit. In fact, Trump’s tax plan provides a huge tax benefit for him personally. Using his 2005 tax return numbers, President Trump would save about $28.6 million in taxes under his plan. About $27 million of those savings is due to the reduction of the pass through income rate to 15%. President Trump’s tax proposal blows a hole in the nation’s deficit. It’s become painfully obvious that the deficit only matters when a Democrat is President. The plan is not revenue neutral. In fact, early press reports indicate that the Trump proposal is likely to add several trillions of dol-lars to our deficit. Busting the deficit the way the Trump tax plan would do puts immediate pressure on our other obligations—including guaranteed Medi-care benefits. The President can’t pretend to protect Medi-care, then leave beneficiaries completely ex-posed by draining our coffers. For some context, these tax cuts could fund Medicare for the next 75 years or more. You have to question the priorities of the President—is he working to keep his promises to hardworking Americans, or is he aban-doning those promises in favor of enriching the wealthy. President Trump’s tax proposal is a return to Reagan’s failed supply side economics. The evidence is clear: large tax cuts like this don’t pay for themselves, despite the rhetoric we hear from this Administration. Just ask the conservative leaning Tax Foundation. This broad outline—which lacks any kind of real detail—seems to simply be a repeat of the mistakes we made with President George W. Bush’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, which cost us trillions of dollars, did nothing to help working families, and, in part, contributed to the Great Recession. Democrats know that the Middle Class de-serves the tax cut, not Donald Trump and his Cabinet. We would focus on growing our economy from the middle out, instead of trickle-down economics from the top down. The middle class does not need to lose their healthcare coverage provided by the Afford-able Care Act. The middle class does not need to deal with the consequence of a massive tax cut for the wealthy. Any tax cut must be paid for by getting funding from somewhere else in the federal budget. The source of funding to pay for the tax cuts under the failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act would have come from Medicare and Medicaid—hurting millions of people who would have lost access to health insurance coverage. I am joining my colleagues this evening in strong opposition to this Administration’s at-tempt to diminish the quality of life of working families by creating unfair burdens like funding ill-conceived tax cut plans. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for elo-quently articulating so many of the issues that are in front of us right now, including, once again: What exactly is this administration doing for people across this country, both those who voted for him and those who didn’t, but middle class Americans who are trying to make sure that this country stays a land of opportunity? Mr. Speaker, so the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ), my distin-guished vice chair and co-chair of this Special Order hour, may control the re-mainder of this hour, I yield back the balance of my time.

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S TAX PLAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentleman from Mary-land (Mr. R
ASKIN ) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman J
AYAPAL for leading us in this Special Order to discuss Presi-dent Trump’s tax proposal, which we received this morning—or last night. The public discussion on taxes has been going on for several weeks now in an-ticipation of the release of the Presi-dent’s proposal. Hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets, from the East to the West, the North to the South, all over America. Hundreds of thousands of people marched with a very simple demand to President Trump, which is that he follow the precedent and the policy that was pursued by the last nine Presidents, going back to Richard Nixon, for a half century of releasing his tax returns, something that Presi-dent Trump promised to do as a Presi-dent, saying he would do it after his audit was completed, and then he got into office and then just changed his mind and said this would be, I guess, another one of the broken promises that he would deliver to the American people. So why is this a big deal? Why is it important that we get to see the Presi-dent’s taxes? Well, America was conceived in pop-ular democratic revolution against royalty, against monarchy, against ar-istocracy. We, as a people, overthrew a king who imposed tea taxes on small businesses, on the little people, but ex-empted his tycoon buddies in the East India Corporation, a king who con-stantly sweated the commoners with high taxes to pay for his lavish ex-penses and traveling jaunts and vaca-tions around the world with the royal family and the royal court, a king who never paid any taxes and never dis-closed his own entanglements with for-eign governments. We rebelled against that kind of government. We demand accountability. We de-mand transparency here. Mr. President, please read the Con-stitution. We have no kings here. We have no slaves here. We have no czars here. We have no serfs here. We have equal citizens, free citizens with equal rights. We allow no titles of nobility here, which is a point you might mention to your Secretary of State, who still car-ries that disgraceful title conferred upon him by Vladimir Putin, the Rus-sian Order of Friendship. In America, no one is above the law and all of us are subject to it. As Tom

Paine put it, in the monarchies, the king is law; but in the democracies, the law is king. The President of the United States owes an undivided loyalty to the peo-ple, the laws, and the Constitution of the United States, not the oligarchs of Russia, not the businessmen of Azer-baijan, not the hotel owners of the world, not the Bank of China, not the dictators and kleptocrats and tyrants of the Earth. The President owes undi-vided loyalty to the people of the United States. So we ask the question: Where are your taxes? How can we determine whether the President has conflicts of interest or is collecting illegal emoluments from for-eign governments if he won’t show us the names of the people and the cor-porations that he is in active partner-ship with all over the world? We simply can’t do it. How can we dream of undertaking to completely reform and revise the tax policy of America unless we see the President’s tax returns in order to de-termine whether or not he is going to benefit from the policies that he is now advancing? We can’t do it. Forgive me, but is there anyone left in America who thinks that this Presi-dent would propose a tax reform that would hurt his own individual, per-sonal, or business interests? If you be-lieve that, you are too innocent to be let out of the house by yourself at this point in the Trump administration. So then we arrive at work and we re-ceive this. This single piece of paper is the Donald Trump tax plan. It is not a bill. It is not a study. It is not a plan. There are not even complete sentences in it. There are sentence fragments in it. It is not even a press release. But it has got a few key ideas, appar-ently, that he is asking the Repub-licans in Congress to lead us to pass by tomorrow in order to make the 100-day deadline which the President has dis-dained and castigated. But he wants to make the 100-day deadline because he understands now that there is some kind of milestone that he wants to sud-denly be able to achieve. Well, what is in here? Well, first, the Treasury Secretary, Mr. Mnuchin, set out a test for tax re-form in which he said there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class. Well, this plan totally defies that promise. It betrays that promise. It provides a huge tax cut for the wealthy, while middle class families re-ceive very little benefit, at the same time that social programs are being sliced and diced all over the Federal Government. We also know that the tax plan will provide a huge benefit to Donald Trump himself. Now, we know this only because one of his tax returns leaked out, suspiciously, and some think, from the White House, the 2005 plan, which appeared on TV—nothing before that, nothing after. But even taking this 1 year which, presumably, is most in the President’s favor, President Trump would save over $28 million in taxes under the 1- page plan that got passed around Con-gress today. Most of that money comes through the reduction of the pass- through business income tax rate, re-ducing it from the 30 percent range to 15 percent. But then it also proposes abolishing, and I know it because it says right here, bullet No. 3 under bullet No. 5, re-peal the alternative minimum tax. He wants to repeal the alternative min-imum tax. Now, what is this AMT? AMT does not stand for ‘‘all money to Trump.’’ AMT stands for the alternative min-imum tax. And what it means is, if you are superwealthy and you have got an army of lawyers on your side and you can structure your corporate bank-ruptcies and your personal business losses—of which President Trump has many—in such a way as to make it pos-sible for you not to pay any taxes for a long time, the alternative minimum tax says, well, there is something that everybody has got to pay. There is an alternative minimum tax. We are not going to let anybody’s clever lawyering bring them below a certain rate. On that rule, we know that Mr. Trump, in that 1 year we know about, 2005—you probably saw it on Rachel Maddow. In that 1 year, he paid mil-lions of dollars only because of the ex-istence of the alternative minimum tax. In other words, all of his deduc-tions and corporate bankruptcies and clever lawyers’ tricks that got him down to zero, presumably, in all these other years that he won’t show us, none of them could stop him from hav-ing to pay something, because the al-ternative minimum tax says let’s not press a good joke too far. We under-stand you are very wealthy. We under-stand that there are loopholes that have been injected to the law, but we are not going to let anybody fall below a certain minimum threshold. You could think of it kind of like equivalent to the minimum wage for working people. The alternative min-imum tax is kind of the minimum wage that the wealthiest people in the coun-try pay us, as opposed to escaping all of their taxes. Well, Donald Trump now wants to abolish the alternative minimum tax. He just wants to get rid of it. That doesn’t sound like a very good idea. It is going to dig a superbig hole for us and dig the deficit much further. Let’s talk about the deficit. Well, I thought—look, I love the fact that we have got two parties. We should have more parties. It is great that we have got a left and a right. A bird can only fly if it has got a left wing and a right wing, all right? b1700 But I thought that the heart of Re-publican Party orthodoxy is you don’t blow up the deficit with outrageous tax proposals or spending proposals. They call us tax-and-spend liberals. They are cut-the-taxes-and-spend conservatives. I don’t even know what makes them conservative anymore. I call myself a liberal because the heart of the word ‘‘liberal’’ is liberty. I call myself a pro-gressive because the heart of the word ‘‘progressive’’ is progress. And if we are not making progress, then what are we doing in government? But after seeing this plan, I realize those of us on our side of the aisle can call ourselves conservatives, too, be-cause we want to conserve the land, the air, the water, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, political democracy, our alliances with foreign governments and foreign democracies, Social Secu-rity, health care for the people, and we want to preserve as much of a balanced budget as we can get to. On the other side of the aisle, they are calling them-selves conservatives, and I don’t know why because if they back this proposal, then they are blowing a multitrillion- dollar hole in the deficit. This plan is not remotely revenue neutral. The earliest estimates are that it will blow a 6 or $7 trillion hole in the deficit. That, of course, is a way to put unsustainable pressure on the other commitments we have made as a Congress, as a people, Social Security commitments to the people, and Medi-care commitments to the people for health care. We cannot afford this irre-sponsible and reckless tax plan that has been sent to Congress by the Presi-dent. It is a return to discredited, failed, supply-side economics. All they can say is they will blow a $7 trillion hole in the deficit, but they are going to make so much money back through all the economic activity that we will be able to make money on that. If you believe that, then you will believe Mr. Trump’s promise that he is going to re-lease his tax returns next year or the year after that. Look, we do need tax reform in America because this system is regres-sive, and this system is opaquely com-plex. We need some real reform. But this is not remotely the answer, this one-page mimeographed sheet of some really bad ideas. Let me just say one other thing that seems to have snuck in there: repeal the estate tax. They want to repeal the estate tax. This might be the greatest betrayal of all—not because President Trump has ever supported it, but be-cause the Founders of America were determined to have an estate tax. I am talking about Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine, and Ben Franklin. The original Americans wanted this to be a country of economic opportunity and freedom for people. But they thought the idea of inherited wealth passed down from generation to generation was a major threat to the idea of political equality and democracy for all. They saw that it would be unsustainable if you had huge fortunes—nowhere near as huge as they are today—but huge fortunes being

passed down from generation to gen-eration. That would lead us to an aris-tocracy; that would lead us to a mon-archy; and that would lead us to Presi-dents of the United States who would think that they don’t have to show you their income taxes, Presidents of the United States who think it is okay to spend public money on fancy vacations for their family and Secret Service all over the country and the world and having a winter or a summer escape at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, and so on. Go back, please, I beseech the citizens of America, read Thomas Jefferson about inherited wealth. Now, our laws today don’t even have the estate tax or the inheritance tax starting until millions of dollars. The vast majority of Americans are not even affected by it. It applies right now only to the smallest sliver of the wealthiest Americans. I think—and forgive me for not having the facts in front of me—again, we are just getting this all right now, but I think we are now somewhere around $4.5 million. So if you die with $4.5 million, your estate is not going to be taxed. That is enough to send the kids and the grandkids to college. It is enough for people to inherit a house or two houses. That is not bad. But the fact that we would tax beyond that means that we are not going to get a society that is based on inherited wealth and deep, profound political and economic inequality which were totally anath-ema to the Founders of the country, and also, by the way, totally antithet-ical to the vision of Adam Smith who is the big hero to my conservative friends on the other side of the aisle. Adam Smith was someone who said: You don’t want to have inherited wealth in a society like that. That is dangerous. It will promote idleness and irresponsibility among the people who inherit hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. It will increase political in-equalities and class tension in the soci-ety, and it will lead to irresponsible be-havior by the people who have that kind of wealth. People will get the idea that they can buy a public office. In America, public office is something that you earn. It is not something that you buy; but, right now, there is a model for elective poli-tics around the country which is you don’t have to be involved in politics, you don’t have to be involved in social movements, you don’t have to be in-volved in public service, and you don’t have to do anything for anybody. As long as you have got enough money, you can go in, you can buy the consult-ants and the pollsters, and you can go right to the head of the class, and then you can get into office. What is so dangerous about that? Well, look around the world. What is happening? There is a whole new model of government that is popping up from Putin’s Russia to Duterte’s Philippines to Orban’s Hungary to Le Pen’s France. And the model is this: that people get into office, and government becomes a moneymaking operation for them and their friends, for a tiny elite. That to-tally contradicts the promise of Amer-ica. Our Founders were concerned with making sure that there would be public virtue, that we would put people in of-fice who were committed to the com-mon good, to the public interest of ev-erybody, not to the goal of enriching themselves or their hotel partners or people they are in business with in Russia or in Saudi Arabia or all over the world. That is not the model. In America, the government has got to be devoted to the people. So, America, read the fine print here. This tax plan contradicts everything that we were founded on as a country. It upsets the very idea of democracy— abolishing the estate tax, abolishing the alternative minimum tax, driving all the wealth up the income and wealth ladder. That is not America. We have got to stand up for what Amer-ican values really are. We are not Rus-sia. We are not a kleptocracy. We are not Azerbaijan. We are not Saudi Ara-bia. This is the United States of Amer-ica. We need a government that is com-mitted to the economic success of every family and of every person. So I am urging the public to do ex-actly what you did with that terrible health proposal they came forward with that would have thrown 24 million Americans off health insurance in order to create hundreds of billions of dollars of tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. Reject it. Don’t accept it. America needs to know that all of the protests and the popular participa-tion is working. The Women’s March set the whole context for discussion about what is going to happen here be-cause we know that President Trump campaigned like William Jennings Bryan, like he was a big populist. He was going to be on the side of the working people. But he got in, and the very people he denounced, like Gold-man Sachs, have come to run his gov-ernment. It is a Wall Street Cabinet. It is the wealthiest Cabinet in the history of the United States. That is who this government represents today. That is what this tax plan represents today. So they are going to try to jam it down Congress over the next 24 hours. We are going to do everything to stop it. We need the help of the American people to stand up and say: No; what is the rush? Let’s take time, and let’s analyze what is in there. Let’s see if it is consistent with our values. Let’s see if it is going to blow a multitrillion- dollar hole in the U.S. deficit. Let’s see if it is sustainable, and let’s see if this is the best way to do this. This is not a way to run Congress of the greatest democracy on Earth— springing things at us in the last minute, just like they did with the healthcare plan. The Affordable Care Act that they are so eager to slice and dice at this point came about after 70 hearings in this body, after a year and a half of debate, and after town meet-ings all over America. Their plan to de-stroy it they brought in on Monday night, and they voted it in on Wednes-day with no hearings, with no wit-nesses, with no deliberation and discus-sion. Now they want to try the same magic trick with their tax plan. They have got a royal straight flush. Let’s be clear, they control the House, the Senate, the White House, and now, with the confirmation of Mr. Gorsuch, the Supreme Court. All that we have on our side are those three beautiful words that kick off our Constitution: we the people. We the people have to stand up and say that this is not what anybody voted for. It clearly was not what the majority of the country voted for because a majority of the people did not vote for Donald Trump. But it is not even what the States and the elec-toral college who were on his side wanted. Nobody was talking about a tax plan that would bring havoc and ruin to our economy and drive working class and middle class people even fur-ther into a position of submission to the wealthiest people who now appear to want to govern us in all things. We don’t begrudge anybody their wealth. It is great. This is a country where people can get rich. That is great. But your wealth does not give you the right to control everybody else. Your wealth does not give you the right to govern the rest of America. That is the principle at stake here. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

DILIGENT CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
OHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it has been interesting hearing about a situa-tion in the country—and it is amazing how some of us can look at the same thing and see very different situations. I know there are some that think we should stay in session all the time, but as is normally said back in Texas about the Texas legislature—and it applies even more so to the U.S. Congress—and that is, when legislature is in session, neither man nor property is safe. We are voting on bills every day we are in session. As I understand it, there was a time when Congress could be in session, have hearings during the day, maybe vote in committee but not actu-ally have votes on the floor during the day. But I think over the years, the concern has been if we are not voting on the floor where it is recorded, then people might not show up. There is cer-tainly a body of evidence to support the country being better off when Con-gress doesn’t come into session. I had read that one of our Founders, Thomas Jefferson, for all his wisdom and his incredible draft—his was the first draft of the Declaration of Inde-pendence—Jefferson was not actually there in Philadelphia to help draft the

Constitution in 1787. But I had read that he sent a letter and remarked that if he had one thing that he could get into the Constitution—realizing, of course, it was too late at that point— but it would be a requirement that no bill could be voted on in Congress until it had been on file for a year. Some might immediately respond: well, gee, there are so many bills that we pass as emergency bills; and I would respond that yes, and usually those things that are drafted so quickly are more problematic than other legisla-tion that goes through a lengthy and more diligent look at what is in the bill before it is passed. In fact, if we had such—and I am not advocating that we have this constitu-tional amendment—but I am noting, Mr. Speaker, the merits of having bills on file for a lengthy period of time so people have a chance to think about it, talk about it, weigh the merits, and go back to our districts and talk about the merits there. Of course, I am not talking about going back and having these fake news townhalls where people who supported opponents demand townhalls, and they have their playbook for how you go about trying to intimidate your Mem-ber of Congress and keep intimidating until your Member of Congress be-comes a coward and he is afraid not to have, or she is afraid not to have, a townhall. And then once you have co-warded them into having a townhall, then they have the playbook for how you totally disrupt the townhall. b1715 That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about going all over your district talking to people eye-to-eye, heart-to-heart, and finding out where people are. It is incredible how people have come to be hurting over the last 8 years. For all the talk that President Obama had about Fat Cats on Wall Street, it was as if there was a wink and a nod: Okay, I am going to refer to you guys on Wall Street as Fat Cats, but I am going to make you richer than you have ever been. I am going to stack the deck in your favor. All you have to do is endure me calling you Fat Cats, making references to you being so greedy. I may even refer to you being Republican, even though prob-ably more of you donate to me than did my opponents. But that will be our lit-tle game. Then, of course, when I am out of office, you can pay me $400,000 for giving you an hour of my time. That is another wink and nod. It is just a friendly reward for how good I did for you while I was President. Let’s face it, the Democrats got through the Dodd-Frank bill that was supposed to punish the banks that brought us to the brink of ruin, but in-stead of punishing or reining in the in-vestment banks on Wall Street that brought us to the brink of ruin, Dodd- Frank has overseen the demise of hun-dreds, even thousands of community banks that did not bring us anywhere close to the brink of economic disaster. In fact, they were the backbone. As President George W. Bush was going out of office, he got $700 billion handed over to the Treasury Depart-ment so they could reward people like those at Goldman Sachs who helped bring us to the brink of desperation. In fact, I only saw one of the contracts that were drafted by the Treasury De-partment some years back. Lo and be-hold, it was one of the firms that was listed as being appropriate for the Treasury to contract with. Goldman Sachs was right in there. Of course, with the disdain that Sec-retary Paulsen had for Goldman Sachs, he wasn’t about to let their compet-itor, Lehman Brothers, survive. He was able to keep them from surviving, not helping them. God bless Ford Motor Company. They were able to turn down any government assistance that GM and Chrysler took. There was a remedy, if we hadn’t panicked and followed the advice of former FDIC Chairman Isaac. I found out from my Democratic friend B
RAD S
HERMAN that he actually was the one that first brought former Chairman Isaac to the Hill. He had a good solu-tion that would not have caused us to take what was referred to by socialists the day after it passed as the biggest step toward socialism in the last 50 years, and that was the Federal Gov-ernment crawling in bed and calling the shots with the investment banks on Wall Street, much to the ruin of so many community banks. We gave advantages to the big banks. We hurt the community banks who were not able to compete as well. God bless all of those that have hung in there. I hope that we can rectify things better than that. The bottom line, I think, testifying about what the Obama years were about—and was even acknowledged by President Obama—a few years ago, he actually acknowledged that his Presi-dency oversaw a record that had never happened before in U.S. history. Nine-ty-five percent of the income in the United States—that was under Obama’s policies—95 percent of all American income went to the top 1 per-cent in America. If you were looking for one fact to really characterize the abuses of the preceding 8 years, I think that would be in contention. Ninety-five percent of the income went to the top 1 percent, not under George W. Bush, not under George H.W. Bush, not under Ronald Reagan, not under Richard Nixon, not under Dwight Eisenhower, not even under Harry Truman, but under Barack Hussein Obama’s policies. During his Presidency, the way the deck was tilted against the middle class and shrunk as the poor in Amer-ica grew under Obama’s policies, we ac-tually hit a milestone in American his-tory. Ninety-five percent of the income went to the top 1 percent income earn-ers. That is pretty amazing. I do personally, Mr. Speaker, think that has something to do with the Re-publicans gaining the majority in the House, in the Senate, and getting the Presidency. Americans, by a huge mar-gin of electoral votes, and if you look at the map, who voted for Donald Trump and who voted for Hillary Clin-ton, it pretty well establishes the Democratic Party as the fringe party of America. They won the fringes, other than some major cities here and there. They are the fringe party. All across America—the bulk of America, when you look at the map, voted to change course. Let’s try some-thing different so that 95 percent of America’s income doesn’t end up in the pockets of the top 1 percent—those same 1 percent that will be paying former President Obama $400,000 for 1 hour of his time. Where have we heard that recently? Well, I don’t believe that was George W. Bush speaking to the disabled vet-erans getting that kind of money. Oh, yes, I recall now. It was Hillary Clin-ton. It was Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton earned massive amounts for speeches while his wife was the Secretary of State. And, wow, all of those tens, hun-dreds, millions of dollars coming to the Clinton Foundation amazingly at the time that this company that ends up being controlled by the Russians are allowed by Hillary Clinton to buy 25 percent or so of our uranium produc-tion. Let’s recap briefly what the Clinton family has done for us. Well, we know that in the nineties, when it comes to foreign affairs, North Korea was a threat to the world, to freedom, be-cause they had a crazy leader, Kim Jong-il, and the world was concerned that North Korea might get nuclear weapons. So what happened through the Clin-ton administration? Well, they sent Wendy Sherman and some other folks and they negotiated with the North Koreans and said: If you will just sign and say you are agreeing not to develop nuclear weapons, we will make sure you have everything you need to make nuclear weapons, but you will have to sign saying that when we give you everything, make sure you have everything to make nuclear weap-ons, you just won’t make them into nu-clear weapons. I mentioned before, it reminds me of that routine Jeff Foxworthy talks about when he was not doing very well financially and a guy comes to take his car because he hasn’t been able to make his payments, and he said: Look, man, please don’t take my car. If you take my car, I can’t do any more gigs and I can’t make any money, and then I have no chance of paying you. The guy said: Buddy, I am sorry, but my instructions were to either take the car or cash or a check. Foxworthy said: Check? You mean I can just sign something and you will take that and leave me alone? Oh, I can give you a check. I didn’t know that was going to be good enough.

I thought about Kim Jong-il think-ing: You mean you will give me every-thing I need to create a bunch of nu-clear weapons and you will accept my signature and that is good enough for Wendy Sherman and all those other people—our Under Secretary of State under Bill Clinton? It is amazing that she has had the nerve to come out critical of any other Secretary of State after the disaster she presided over. Yes, he was glad to sign whatever the Clintons wanted him to sign. He said: Sure, if Ms. Sherman wants me to sign something, I will sign whatever you want. And in no time, what does he have? Nuclear weapons. President Obama comes into office and the whole world is concerned about Iran getting nuclear weapons. What do they do? They said: Let’s send Wendy Sher-man and some of these smart people like John Kerry, who doesn’t now how to pronounce Genghis Khan. Let’s send them over there to negotiate with Iran so that maybe we can keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons the same way some of these same people kept North Korea from developing nuclear weapons. So what happens? They go over and they give the larg-est supporter of terrorism in the world massive amounts of cash. By massive, I mean pallets of cash and checks; how-ever you may want it. There is no tell-ing. They may have sent some gold or platinum. Who knows? Plutonium. It will be interesting in the years ahead to just see how terrible the agreement was and how we are finding out—it seems like almost every night in the news we find out some other dis-aster that the Obama administration provided the crazy supporters of ter-rorism in Iran. I don’t mean the rank- and-file people. We get the impression possibly a ma-jority of Iranians like Americans. They wish they did not have radical Islamists in control, but they are. The Obama administration provided them murdering thugs who have killed, been responsible for the death of so many in the past, and no doubt will be again in the future, and they are on their way to having nuclear weapons, just like the Clinton administration oversaw with North Korea. b1730 In the meantime, though at the end of the Bush administration, the Presi-dent Bush administration actually was making progress in making our borders more secure. It never came out during those days, but the Republicans in the Texas delegation in Congress were hav-ing meetings once every couple of weeks with people in the Bush adminis-tration—Karl Rove, Chertoff—a lot of good that did. But we were getting re-ports every couple weeks. We wanted to know what advancements, what progress had been made in the pre-ceding two weeks in securing our bor-der. They were taking steps to do that. President Obama takes over, and what happens? It is like the floodgates were opened. As the Border Patrol have said to the drug cartels who were re-sponsible from the Mexico side for every inch of the border, if you cross over in one drug cartel’s sector, you must make sure you have their permis-sion. Normally that means you must pay or agree to work for them when you get to the U.S. city where you are going. That is why they called the Depart-ment of Homeland Security their logis-tics, that all the drug cartels had to do is get these people across the border. They would pay thousands to the drug cartels to get them across. They were used as a distraction. They sent them across. The Border Patrol would have to in-process them in accordance with the Obama policies. While they were doing that, they would tell you pri-vately, yes, we know there are drugs coming across at other points in the river down there south of McAllen and southwest of McAllen, but they knew. We are doing our job. We know they are bound to be bringing drugs over while they keep us tied up. What a business model. Then the Department of Homeland Security would ship many of those peo-ple to the places that they would have addresses for, and, as I witnessed my-self, there were times when our Border Patrol would say: well, you certainly didn’t come up with all the thousands. And ultimately they finally admit: no, they are going to let me work some of that off when I get to the city where I am going. In other words, they would be their drug mules, they would be their drug salespeople. Some, God forgive us, would get into sex trafficking. The Obama administration allowed this massive network to take off. At the same time, we heard from FBI Director Comey, we ended up with ISIS cells in every State, we had the drug cells locating all over the country in the last 8 years, we had ISIS creating cells that would be activated at some point and begin to kill Americans, and so it shouldn’t have been that big of a surprise to those who were really pay-ing attention that Americans were ready for a change. Not on the fringes, but Americans across the heartland were ready for a change, and they voted for Donald Trump. This week, I don’t know if we are going to vote tomorrow on the Amer-ican Health Care Act. I indicated now, with the changes that have been made, I think probably 90 percent or so of the Freedom Caucus has now agreed. Be-cause, I mean, we have gotten the best we can get. If we don’t do something, people in my district who are just over-whelmed with the prices of their health insurance premiums, the cost of health care, the high deductibles, meaning they are paying for insurance they are probably never going to get anything out of—they have got to have help. That is one of the reasons, one of the biggest reasons I was a holdout because even though I think CBO was talking about premiums continuing to increase up to 2026, and then 10 years from now start down a little bit, people in east Texas could not afford for premiums to continue to go up for 10 years. I think it was probably more accurate they would be going up for 3 years. But with what we have done, and the agreement we got—I am telling you, President Trump is a great man to ne-gotiate with. He does want to get a deal done. He was extremely coopera-tive. He actually can be quite enjoy-able to negotiate with. He is an amaz-ing man. But we were having trouble with leaders in the House and the Sen-ate. President Trump would agree to things, and we would have trouble get-ting it past our own leadership. Some of us felt all along, if you let the conservative group sit down with the Tuesday Group, we could probably get things worked out, and, really, bot-tom line is, that is what happened. T
OM M
ACARTHUR is a very dear friend. I know he wants what is best for the peo-ple in his district. He is doing all he can to serve them. I know that is what the Tuesday Group wants to do. They want to serve their constituents. We all do. So now where we are—and hopefully we will have votes and we can get this done. But we have gone from a bill that had 17 percent support of the American people, and now we have gotten an agreement to include provisions that eliminate the taxes immediately that would have been kept in place for the future. Under our agreement, the lan-guage is there, those taxes are out im-mediately. There has also been added a work requirement for people who are Medicaid recipients. If they are able to work, then they should work. If they don’t have a job, they still will need to do some work under the work require-ments, much like the welfare require-ments that were passed in the 1990s by the Republican House and Senate. For the first time in 30 years, a single-mom income, when adjusted for inflation, started going up after the work re-quirement was added. We have also agreed to language that will make sure that people who have preexisting conditions can’t be shunned by the insurance companies. If you are 26 and you are living with your par-ents, you can still be on their insur-ance. I don’t know why we have even an age limit at all. Those things will still be there, despite all the fear mongering that some on the other side of the aisle have done back in Texas that I know of. Let’s make no mistake, this is not a full repeal. There is still a lot of work to be done.

does not fully repeal ObamaCare, it will bring down the costs of health in-surance. The people I represent just had to have help. At least 75 percent were saying: We have got to have help. So we look forward to working with the Senate and trying to make it even better as it goes through the Senate. I think I have got just a minute. I just wanted to note, the observance an-niversary of the Holocaust this past Tuesday, April 25, was a very somber occasion held in the rotunda. I know the minority leader, Senator S
CHUMER , wanted it there. I just continue to hope and pray, as I hope most Americans do, that we will never, ever have another Holocaust. I think one of the things that can help prevent that is if we have effective national days of prayer, as have been going on for so many dec-ades, going back to Washington pro-claiming days of thanksgiving and prayer and fasting. I deeply regret, though, that we thought we were going to be able to fulfill the vision of Anne Graham Lotz, the new chairman of the National Day of Prayer. She took over for Shirley Dobson, who did a magnificent job for the last 25 years as the national chair. She had a vision for doing it in the ro-tunda, and all that would require, like for the Holocaust observance, would be a unanimous consent agreement in the House and Senate, and then it would have been in the rotunda. It would have needed to have been after 5. Even though the Holocaust occurred during the day, it was clear, and she had agreed, the National Day of Prayer folks had agreed, but any Senator can put a hold on such a thing, and one Senator did. Senator S
CHUMER put a hold on the National Day of Prayer being able to use the rotunda. I hope and pray some day Senator S
CHUMER will realize that the best way to avoid a Holocaust in the future is to have effective national days of prayer from the rotunda and everywhere else that we possibly can, as the church services have been held in the Capitol, participated in by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and so many oth-ers. They were nondenominational; so they thought that didn’t violate their Constitution. But it looks like this will be in the area that Senator S
CHUMER cannot stop from being used. It is totally under the control of the House. I want to thank Speaker R
YAN for allowing the use. We will be in statuary hall where nondenominational Christian churches were held on Sunday. It was the largest Christian church in Wash-ington for much of the 1800s. So that is where it will be this year. Hopefully we won’t have a Senator who will put a hold on it next year, and Billy Gra-ham’s daughter, Anne Graham Lotz’ vi-sion will finally be fulfilled. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HIG-
GINS of Louisiana). Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess subject to the call of the Chair. Accordingly (at 5 o’clock and 41 min-utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was called to order by the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ). 
f 
PRAYER The PRESIDENT pro tempore. To-day’s opening prayer will be offered by Martyn Sloan, lead pastor of Harvest Time in Fort Smith, AR. The guest Chaplain offered the fol-lowing prayer: Almighty and Eternal God, who has created us, to whom we belong and whom we serve, it is in You that we find our purpose, our peace, and our prosperity. May Your Kingdom come. Use this day our lawmakers to com-plete and carry out Your will on this Earth as in Heaven. Create in each of them a clean and a courageous and a selfless heart that will not give in to fear, adversity, or temptation. Grant them wisdom and the discernment of the truth so that they may rightly judge these, Your children. Strengthen them as they grow weary so that they may give strength to the weary and burdened in this life. We pray this and all things in Your Holy Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
TRANGE ). The Senator from Arkansas is recognized. 
f 
WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank Pastor Marty Sloan for delivering the opening prayer in the Senate today. Pastor Sloan is the lead pastor of Harvest Time, one of the most active and well-attended houses of worship in Arkansas’s second largest city of Fort Smith, which is the city in which I grew up. Pastor Sloan is also a proud husband and father and plays an important role in the life of the Fort Smith commu-nity. As the lead pastor of Harvest Time, he has a passion for caring for his congregation and those in the larg-er community through preaching, teaching, and counseling in order to encourage and build up their faith and develop meaningful relationships with Christ and one another. For 22 years, Pastor Sloan has been in ministry and has focused on both na-tional and international missions. He has also been involved with the Live Nativity on Capitol Hill and the Na-tional Day of Prayer and has conducted pastoral conferences in America, Peru, and Armenia. Pastor Sloan says that one of his greatest joys is to ‘‘pastor from the center of the room’’ because his desire is to lead his congregation by walking through life together with them. Serving as the guest Chaplain is an incredible honor. I am thankful for Pastor Sloan’s ministry, and I am so pleased he could be here to offer an in-vocation of asking God to guide and bless the efforts of Congress and Amer-ica’s leaders. I yield the floor. f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader is recognized. 
f 
THE PRESIDENT’S TAX PLAN Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-terday, the administration introduced a plan to serve as the guideline for modernizing and simplifying America’s Tax Code. This process is long overdue, and it is a priority that is shared by the Republican House, Senate, and the administration. By bringing down tax rates for individuals, we can help ease the burden on middle-class families, and by lowering taxes for American businesses, both small and large, we can foster job creation here at home, while making our country more com-petitive in an increasingly competitive international economy. I commend the President and his team for taking this critical first step, and I look forward to working with the administration and our House colleagues to finally over-haul our tax system. f 
NOMINATION OF ALEXANDER ACOSTA Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, despite much unneces-sary obstruction, the Senate has con-tinued to move forward with the con-firmation process for administration nominees. Just this week, we have confirmed two more impressive individuals—Sec-retary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Today, we will have the op-portunity to confirm a third. That nominee, Alexander Acosta, under-stands the difficult task ahead of him as the next Secretary of Labor. Fortu-nately, he has an impressive back-ground that will serve him well as he takes on these tough issues. It explains why Acosta has earned high acclaim from numerous pro-job groups, like the National Association of Manufacturers, which called him an ‘‘exceptional choice to lead the Department,’’ and the chamber of commerce, which noted his ‘‘extraordinary history of govern-ment service and refined skills.’’ He has also earned support from across the political spectrum, includ-ing from people like Lafe Solomon, a National Labor Relations Board Acting General Counsel in the Obama adminis-tration, who said Acosta is ‘‘very open- minded and fair’’ and ‘‘deserves to be Secretary of Labor.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2566 April 27, 2017 
We have also heard from unions that have backed him as well. In their words, Acosta is an ‘‘advocate for the middle class,’’ a nominee with ‘‘strong credentials and an impeccable reputa-tion,’’ and someone they can work with ‘‘to protect and make better the lives of working men and women across America.’’ Acosta’s leadership at the Labor De-partment will serve as a much needed change from what we saw under the previous administration, when, too often, onerous regulations that stifled instead of encouraged growth were given high priority, which came at a disadvantage to the very workers the previous administration claimed to be helping. Of course, much work remains when it comes to providing relief to middle- class workers, but today’s vote to con-firm Acosta represents another posi-tive step in that direction. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING LEGISLATION Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final issue, as we know, talks on government funding legislation have continued throughout the week on a bi-partisan, bicameral basis. The House has introduced a short-term funding bill that we expect to pass before Fri-day night’s deadline so that a final agreement can be drafted and shared with Members for their review prior to its consideration next week. This ex-tension will also protect thousands of retired coal miners and their families from losing the healthcare benefits I have fought for throughout this entire process, as I continue to lead the fight to secure them on a permanent basis. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business is closed.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will pro-ceed to executive session to resume consideration of the Acosta nomina-tion, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of R. Alexander Acosta, of Florida, to be Secretary of Labor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think I have 15 minutes to speak. When I get to about 13 minutes, would you raise your thumb or something and tell me, please. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair certainly will. Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ’S OFFICE OF THE  
INSPECTOR GENERAL  
Mr. President, I come to the floor today to spotlight a potential failure of leadership at the Defense Department’s Office of Inspector General in that a large number of hotline cases have been set aside, neglected, and possibly forgotten. The hotline plays a very critical role in the inspector general’s core mission of rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse. The hotline is the command and con-trol link between whistleblowers on the one hand and investigators on the other hand. To succeed, hotline tips need quick and decisive action, but speed is not one of the chief assets of this unit. Without a quick response, the full value of whistleblower infor-mation is lessened. Last year, at my request, I was given a 12-page spreadsheet dated November 8, 2016. It listed 406 hotline cases that had been open for more than 2 years or over 730 days. Frankly, I was stunned by what I saw on this spreadsheet. I counted 240 cases—over half of the total—that had been open for more than 1,000 days. Many had been open for more than 1,300 days. Some were right at a 4-year marker; that is 1,460 days. The oldest is now pushing close to 1,600 days. Even—if you can believe it—5-year-old cases are not unheard of. So we can see why working quickly on these investigations—taking tips from whistleblowers and pursuing them on waste, fraud, and abuse—is very impor-tant, and we shouldn’t have this time wasted. When cases remain open for years, they become stale. Inattention breeds neglect. Work grinds to a halt. Cases slowly fade from memory. This is unac-ceptable, and my colleagues ought to consider it unacceptable, and the Sec-retary of Defense ought to consider it unacceptable. The hotline, then, with this waiting period, loses its full value. The deputy inspector general for ad-ministrative investigations, Mrs. Mar-guerite C. Garrison, is in charge of the hotline, so she is accountable for the backlog. The backlog shows a lack of commitment to the hotline creed and the plight of whistleblowers. Here is why: Hotline posters are displayed throughout the Department of Defense. They are a bugle call for whistle-blowers. They encourage whistle-blowers to step forward, and they do that at considerable risk. In return, then, these patriotic people ought to deserve a quick and honest response. Allowing their reports to slide into a deep, dark hole, in limbo for 2, 3, or 4 years—and even more, as I have point-ed out—leaves whistleblowers exposed, leaves them vulnerable to retaliation, and of course distrusting of the system that is designed to protect the whistle-blowers. So, in the end, this kind of treatment will discourage others from stepping forward in the future. Hotline officials, including Mrs. Gar-rison, were questioned about the back-log on December 15, 2016. They at-tempted to deflect responsibility else-where and showed little interest in the problem. After numerous followup in-quiries, a second meeting was re-quested. So at a March 30 meeting this year, Hotline officials were singing a whole different song. They tried to dispel the notion that a surge in cases closures were triggered by my inquiry. To the contrary, they said, it was part of rou-tine, ongoing ‘‘cleanup of the hotline mess’’ that began way back in March of 2013. They reported that 107,000 cases were swept up, including the so-called bad dog cases from 2002. This explanation may be fiction. Mrs. Garrison should know that the 406 cases date back to 2012 and 2013. After sitting on the hotline docket for up to 4-plus years, these cases are any-thing but routine. They are tough nuts to crack, of course, and very difficult to resolve—sort of like the bad dogs way back in 2002. What they needed was clear direction from the top. They needed to be handed off to a tiger team, but that didn’t hap-pen. Priorities became an afterthought, and the hotline mess got more nourish-ment. Then, finally, the ‘‘routine, ongoing’’ cleanup reached the 406 most egregious cases—the worst of the worst. The ones that bring me to the floor today. Since January, I received five up-dated spreadsheets trumpeting the clo-sure of 200 of these so-called bad dogs— done with due diligence, I hope. Though late and incomplete, the surge shows what is possible when manage-ment starts doing what we expect man-agement to do; in other words, man-aging. The backlog can be controlled and eliminated. Why did it take top managers so long to see the light and get on the stick doing their job? Maybe they just didn’t care—at least not until the Senator from Iowa started asking questions. Then and only then did they indicate what had been characterized as ‘‘ag-gressive management oversight.’’ Well, praise the Lord. Those words— ‘‘aggressive management oversight’’— warm my heart, but the deputy IGs need to exercise aggressive oversight at all times, not just when a Senator steps in and not just when embar-rassing revelations get some daylight. Good managers don’t need a Senator looking over their shoulders to know what needs to be done. That is no way to run a railroad, as we say. The man-agers responsible for the hotline mess need more supervision.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2567 April 27, 2017 
One of Mrs. Garrison’s other direc-torates—the whistleblower reprisal in-vestigations, or what we call the WRI unit—is always crying out for help. It is facing its own hotline-style tsunami. It has a staff of 56 personnel, but only 28 of those 56—or about 50 percent—are actually assigned to investigative teams. They complete 50 to 60 reports per year. With some 120 cases under in-vestigation at any one time, a large number inevitably get rolled forward from year to year. The backlog could easily double or triple over the next few years. In November, 38 cases were beyond acceptable limits. As of March 28, the oldest one was 1,394 days old. While many of these cases were recently closed, new ones keep popping up on the list. Despite very substantial in-creases in money and personnel since 2013, the deputy IG still seems over-whelmed by the volume of work. While beefing up the whistleblower reprisal investigations may be nec-essary, Mr. Fine and his deputies need to do more with what they have. With an annual budget of $320 million and a 1,500-person workforce, efficiencies can be found. Some units are said to be top-heavy and ripe for belt-tightening. The inves-tigative processes are notoriously cum-bersome and could be streamlined. The audit office, with 520 workers, turns out mostly second-rate reports. It needs strong leadership and it needs redirection. The Obama administration never seemed to take these problems very seriously. I hope this new admin-istration coming in to drain the swamp will do better. Weak leadership gave us the hotline backlog. Weak leadership is giving us the continuing mismatch between the workforce and the workload. Both are messy extensions of a much more harmful leadership problem—a fes-tering sore that is eating away at in-tegrity and independence. This is what I am hearing: Top managers have allegedly been tampering with investigative reports and then retaliating against super-visory investigators who call them to account. This is sparking allegations that a culture of corruption is thriving in the Office of the Inspector General. I gave my colleagues a glimpse of this problem in a speech on April 6 of last year. I used the fifth and final report of Admiral Losey’s investigation to illu-minate this problem. That report was allegedly doctored by senior managers. Investigators were allegedly ordered to change facts and remove evidence of suspected retalia-tion. Can my colleagues believe this? Mrs. Garrison even sent a letter that cleared the admiral long before inves-tigators had even completed the review of the evidence. This was a very serious error in judgment, giving the appear-ance of impropriety. Was this then a coverup to facilitate the admiral’s pending promotion? Thankfully, Acting Inspector General Fine intervened. He showed real cour-age. After taking a firsthand look, he backed up the investigators, over-turning some—but not all—unsup-ported charges. He helped to bring evi-dence and findings back into sync. I thank Inspector General Fine from the bottom of my heart. But Mr. Fine still has more work to do. The alleged doctoring of the Losey report, I am told, is not an isolated case. There are at least five others just like it—and probably more—that all need oversight. As I understand it, the Office of Spe-cial Counsel is contemplating a review of these matters and could rule in favor of whistleblower reprisal investiga-tions. They blew the whistle on all of the alleged tampering going on—and do my colleagues know what these patri-otic people got for it? They got ham-mered for it. They got hammered for protecting Federal workers. If top managers are tampering with reports and retaliating against their own people who report it, then how can they be trusted to run the agency’s pre-mier whistleblower oversight unit? All of the pertinent issues need to be resolved, and they demand high-level attention. So I call on the new Sec-retary of Defense and the acting in-spector general to work together to ad-dress these problems. No. 1, the hotline needs to be brought up to acceptable standards under stronger management; No. 2, all poten-tial solutions to the workload-work-force mismatch need to be explored, in-cluding internal realignments; No. 3, an independent review of all cases where alleged tampering occurred should be conducted, to include an ex-amination of the Garrison letter clear-ing an admiral in the midst of an inves-tigation. If tampering and retaliation did in fact occur, then the culprits should be fired. I look forward to receiving a full re-port. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority whip. 
U.S. MILITARY READINESS  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, our military and our intelligence commu-nity grapple with intersecting issues that aren’t wholly unique to this day and age. Our national security has al-ways been imperiled by foreign threats, from the Revolutionary War to two World Wars, and we previously faced a seemingly unsurmountable debt burden following World War II. The challenge seems to be, as it al-ways is in a democracy, that people of different views differ on the sense of urgency on priorities and the means to address both those threats and our fi-nancial house in order to be able to pay for what it takes to keep America safe. What is unique is the range and com-plexity of the problems we face and their scale. I am reminded of a sobering quote from the former Director of National Intelligence during a hearing just last year, former Director James Clapper, who served 50 years in the U.S. intel-ligence community. He said: ‘‘In my time in the intelligence business, I don’t recall a time when we have been confronted with a more diverse array of threats.’’ I agree with him. On top of that diverse array of threats, never before has our country been at war for such an extended period of time since 9/11, and never before have we done so much with an all-vol-unteer military force stressed by re-peated deployments, while at the same time defense spending has been cut by nearly 15 percent over the last 8 years. So the United States is at a cross-roads when it comes to meeting the di-verse threats we face today, while si-multaneously preparing for the ever- evolving future threats headed our way tomorrow. I wish to first provide a little bit of context about our lack of readiness to meet those threats by framing the challenges our military and our Nation faces, and then I wish to offer some thoughts about how we can rise to meet these challenges and maintain our military preeminence and leader-ship in the world. First, there are the challenges abroad. We face a range of adversaries unlike any other in our history. In the Middle East, even as ISIS forces are pushed back in Iraq, their ideology spreads like a contagion through their so-called cyber caliphate, and it con-tinues to permeate the West and at-tract the vulnerable and the disillu-sioned. FBI Director Comey has said that his agency has open investigations into home-grown jihadists in all 50 States. Iran, under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is a breakout nuclear threat and remains the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world. At the same time, it is rapidly growing its ballistic missile arsenal and has re-gained much of its financial strength following sanctions relief under the JCPOA. Then there is Syria. Since the Syrian civil war began, 400,000 have died in a bloody civil war, while Bashar al- Assad, a brutal dictator known to re-peatedly use chemical weapons on his own people despite redlines drawn, en-joys Russian and Iranian support and protection. In addition to its meddling in the Middle East, Russia has invaded east-ern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. It routinely threatens NATO member states and has ramped up its use of ‘‘active measures’’—a program of both overt and covert action that leverages propaganda, cyber espionage, social media, and a sometimes gullible main-stream media both here and abroad—to influence and undermine public con-fidence in the very foundation of our democracies, which are our free and fair elections. In the Pacific, China seeks to ad-vance its regional dominance by mak-ing claims to former sandbars and reefs

that it has now built into strategic military bases—complete with a 10,000 foot runway—in the South China Sea. Finally, as we learned more about yesterday at the White House in the briefing from the President’s national security advisers, North Korea con-tinues to develop and test its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities with the threat of soon being able to com-bine the two to threaten the conti-nental United States and wreak death and destruction. Many before me have observed that American strength on the world stage is a deterrent and a stabilizing influ-ence, while weakness is an invitation to our adversaries and inherently de-stabilizing. I think that proposition has never been more evident than it is today. But to address these threats—to maintain the peace and fight, if we must—we need a capable, ready, and modern military force. But the truth is we are not ready. While I believe Amer-ica will always rise to the challenges once roused from our national compla-cency, it makes a dangerous world even more dangerous. U.S. military readiness and mod-ernization—already under great stress and stretched thin around the world— has suffered 15 years of continued oper-ations and simultaneous budgetary re-strictions and deferred maintenance and investment. That has led to some very real consequences for our mili-tary. Let me just illustrate a few of those consequences. According to General Walters, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, more than half of all Marine Corps fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft were unable to fly at the end of 2016. Let me say that again. That is a shock-ing statistic. More than half of the Ma-rine Corps’ fixed- and rotary-wing air-craft were unable to fly by the end of 2016. These aircraft are in constant op-eration overseas and are absolutely necessary to continue the fight against ISIS and terrorism, yet half of them are unable to take off. The Navy fleet currently stands at 275 of the 350 ship requirement. Law mandates an inventory of 11 aircraft carriers and has a stated force level goal of 12. But today, the Navy requires a waiver in order to operate just 10, currently. As we all know, these car-rier strike groups deploy worldwide, and, as the Navy likes to say, they act as ‘‘100,000 tons of diplomacy that doesn’t need a permission slip.’’ Of our 58 Army brigade and combat teams, only three are considered fully ready for combat. These are the main building blocks of the Army that sup-port the majority of Army operations, and only three are fully ready. Keep in mind, too, that our Army is smaller than at any time since before World War II, as a result of draconian cuts in defense spending. Finally, when it comes to our Air Force, General Wilson, the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, recently testified: ‘‘Sustained global commitments and funding reductions have eroded our Air Force to the point where we have be-come one of the smallest, oldest equipped, and least ready forces across the full-spectrum of operations in our service history.’’ The Air Force cur-rently has 5,500 aircraft in its inven-tory. That is down from 8,600 since 1991. The average aircraft in the U.S. Air Force is 27 years old. For example, I was at Dyess Air Force Base in Abi-lene, TX, just last week, viewing some of their B–1 bombers, which is a plane first flown in 1974. Then, of course, there is the grandpa of our aircraft fleet, the B–52—that is still in operation—first introduced in the 1950s. The Air Force is also experiencing a pilot shortage crisis due to the pres-sure on the force, including quality of life issues and, of course, increased de-mand and competition from the airline industry. So our military faces these internal issues as well. No one would argue that in order to keep the peace and to pro-tect our national vital interests, we must have a credible and modern force. But the hard truth is that we don’t cur-rently meet that standard, and we can’t afford to ignore the problems. So why, I ask, do we continue to do so? More importantly, the question is this: Where do we go from here? How can we assure that our military can maintain its competitive edge and en-sure it is ready to meet these and fu-ture challenges? I have a few sugges-tions. First, we must fund our military to meet the threat environment, not do what we can to meet the threat envi-ronment with what we funded for the military. In other words, the threat should determine the resources nec-essary to meet that threat. So I would suggest we should start by eliminating sequestration of Department of Defense funding under the 2011 Budget Control Act. The truth is that the Budget Con-trol Act was never meant to cut mili-tary spending. It was meant to spur ac-tion. Remember the supercommittee and the hoped-for grand bargain? In-stead, the BCA took a meat ax to our defense budget. Allowing the Budget Control Act to keep making automatic cuts to our military until 2021 does not serve the national security interests of the United States. It does the opposite. These cuts add risk not just to our na-tional security but also to our service-members and their families—who, as I said, have been fighting the longest war in our Nation’s history—and it does so by undermining their training, readiness, and modernization. At a time when our growing national security threats require greater invest-ment in technology, we are tying the hands of our military and simply hop-ing for the best. So if we want to re-turn to a strong American military after years of stress and inadequate funding, we need to start with ending the Department of Defense sequestra-tion. Of course, the next logical question becomes this: If we do away with the defense portions of the Budget Control Act, how do we control overspending, deficits, and unsustainable national debt, which is a serious problem? That brings me to my second point. A bipartisan Congress and the Trump administration must address our budg-et priorities by looking at and address-ing all government spending, not just the 30 percent or so represented by dis-cretionary spending. Right now, about 70 percent of Federal spending isn’t even appropriated by the Congress. It simply runs on autopilot, and it grew last year at the rate of 5.5 percent, while discretionary spending has re-mained relatively flat. Until we have the political courage on a bipartisan basis to tackle our structural financial problems, we will never adequately fund the military or our other national priorities. We also need a bipartisan commit-ment to ending continuing resolutions and the self-destructive drama and nar-rative of potential government shut-downs. Most importantly, perhaps, the De-fense Department needs to be able to plan, not just for the duration of the next continuing resolution, but it needs to be able to plan long term and to spend the money that is appro-priated to it in an efficient way. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Goldfein, captured the point well 2 months ago, when he said: ‘‘There is no enemy on the planet that can do more to damage the United States Air Force than us not getting a budget.’’ This sentiment is shared by all the service chiefs, and I whole-heartedly agree. In a Department as big, as large, and as unwieldy as the Department of De-fense, there is no doubt that there is room to streamline, improve effi-ciencies, and reduce duplication. We can all agree on that. But the truth is we need to take a hard, strategic look at our budgetary and fiscal needs across the Federal Government. End-less continuing resolutions aren’t the answer. Continuing resolutions actu-ally limit an agency’s ability to be effi-cient and flexible, and they prevent the establishment of new programs and the retiring of the old and obsolete pro-grams. At the end of the day, the only way we can rein in spending, get a handle on our debt, and ensure our military stays ready for the threats facing it every day is to clearly articulate our country’s needs and how we plan to meet them. That way, we can restore constitutional oversight responsibil-ities to Congress. Finally, Congress has a tremendous opportunity, working with the Trump administration, to propose a strategy to modernize our military and prepare for the next generation of warfighting. Both readiness and modernization have been encumbered by the lack of a co-herent national security and foreign

policy strategy in recent years, in addi-tion to the blanket restrictions placed on defense spending. Too frequently, modernization has simply been pushed aside by myopic views of how to deal with our financial challenges, which place greater risk on the warfighter and our collective secu-rity. You had better believe that, not hamstrung by redtape and regulations or continuing resolutions or deep cuts in defense spending or national secu-rity spending, our enemies take full ad-vantage of our reluctance to deal with our challenges on a bipartisan basis. All the while, the United States oper-ates on platforms engineered decades ago to fight the last generation’s wars. I can’t think of a better example than our nuclear weapons program. This is the preeminent deterrent to war. Our country is the leading pioneer in science and technology, but instead of modernizing our nuclear weapons to provide a safe, reliable, and dependable deterrent, we, in effect, merely extend the service life of outdated and ancient weapons. Clearly, we need a coherent national security strategy from President Trump and his Cabinet to do that. I know Congress is committed to work-ing with them to make that happen. By doing away with the Budget Con-trol Act, putting the Pentagon on a de-pendable and predictable budget and developing a coherent national secu-rity strategy, we can maintain our sta-tus as the top military in the world. Along the way, we can deter our en-emies and reassure our allies. We don’t need to rewrite the playbook. We need to go back to the basics of government, providing for our national defense and keeping our fiscal house in order, all in light of the challenges and threats these times present. My hope is that we will get out of the rut we have been in the Senate and in the Congress for the last few years and we will actually capitalize on this mo-ment—and rally around a bipartisan commitment that a strong, modern, and ready military is really a nonnego-tiable item—to lay the foundation for a modern military that will continue to keep our Nation safe for generations. I am committed to working with the ad-ministration and all of my colleagues in order to accomplish these goals. Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I en-joyed hearing my friend and gym col-league talking about defense. I agree with him; we need a strong defense. I agree with him that deficits are an enemy of getting the defense spending that we need. I hope when we consider tax cuts, we will hear that same view that we can’t go deeply into deficit. I appreciate my colleague’s great com-ments. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING BILL  
Mr. President, I wish to talk first about some good news: the appropria-tions process—our negotiations to keep the government open. The President has backed off his threat to hold gov-ernment funding hostage over the wall and over cutting healthcare funding for millions of Americans. This healthcare funding is essential to ensuring that millions of Americans will not see their premiums skyrocket and that they will not be kicked off their plans. Make no mistake, we will watch the administration like a hawk to make sure they follow through on their promise to continue this funding. We are very happy that they have seen the light that Democrats have tried to show them for weeks. Threat-ening to hurt Americans for political gain is a loser. Much like the administration’s with-drawal of their demand for wall fund-ing, which Democrats laid out a month ago as a condition for successful bipar-tisan negotiations on the appropria-tions bill, this decision brings us closer to a bipartisan agreement to fund the government and is good news for the American people. The tendency of this administration has been to go at it alone. What these negotiations show is that when the Trump administration takes into ac-count the Democratic position and is willing to move in our direction, they can make progress on issues as we have on the appropriations bills. On those appropriations bills, of course, there are a few remaining issues to be settled. The most vexing are poison pill riders. We will not ac-cept them, but I believe we are close to final agreement. Our side will continue to work in good faith to see that an agreement is reached to keep the gov-ernment open by tomorrow’s deadline. I hope that this is something of a metaphor for the future, that the ad-ministration will not put together its plan and say that bipartisanship means you support our plan without any Democratic consultation, input, and, more importantly, taking into account our values, which we believe are close to where American values are—much closer than some on the other side. THE PRESIDENT ’S TAX PLAN  
Mr. President, yesterday the Presi-dent released—and this is not as good news, unfortunately—a one-page out-line of his plan to change the U.S. Tax Code. Even from the very limited de-tails that were released, the Presi-dent’s priorities are clear: Give mas-sive tax breaks to folks like himself— the very, very wealthy in America. The top rate would come down; taxes that disproportionately affect the very wealthy would go away, while middle- class and working families would be de-nied some of the most useful deduc-tions. This isn’t simply the Trump plan to lower taxes. It is the plan to lower the taxes of Trump and those with enormous wealth, similar to his. The prime beneficiaries of the Trump plan would be his Cabinet. Secretary Mnuchin, one of the architects of the plan, could not guarantee this morning that the middle class will not pay more under the Trump tax plan. If, on one sheet of paper, you can guarantee that corporations pay less and you can guarantee that the wealthiest Ameri-cans pay less but you can’t guarantee that hard-working, middle-class Amer-icans pay less, you don’t have a good recipe for changing our Tax Code. And, for the good of America, you are to go back to the drawing board. This proposal falls short, far short of the mark in several ways: First and foremost, it mostly benefits the very wealthy. In the Trump tax plan, cor-porations and the very wealthy get a huge tax break through lower rates and the elimination of things like the es-tate tax. In fact, the proposal the President put out yesterday is actually even more of a giveaway on the estate tax than his proposal in his campaign. In the campaign, President Trump promised to repeal the estate tax for estates up to $10 million, retaining it for the wealthiest of estates. This pro-posal would eliminate the tax com-pletely, particularly on those multimillion- and even billion-dollar estates. The result would be that the 5,200 wealthiest families in America would each receive, on average, a $3 million windfall, and many would re-ceive much, much more than that. Also, because the Trump plan lowers the tax rate on the so-called pass-through entities to 15 percent, wealthy businessmen, like President Trump, will be able to use passthrough entities to pay 15 percent in taxes while every-one else pays in the twenties and thir-ties. This has implications for some-thing we don’t need—the carried inter-est loophole. President Trump prom-ised to get rid of this in his campaign. Instead of using the carried interest loophole under the President’s bill, Wall Street funds could file their taxes at a new passthrough rate of 15 per-cent, which is even lower than the present tax on carried interest. Ironically, the President’s tax plan would indeed get rid of the carried in-terest loophole only by making it lower than the present rate and mak-ing it permanent—a total, total rever-sal of what he pledged in his campaign. It all goes to show that those who stand to benefit most from this pro-posal are folks like the President and those at his level of wealth, while tens of millions of American middle-class, working families are hurt and could very well pay more. This brings me to my second point, which is that the Trump plan hurts middle-class and working Americans by eliminating their most popular and useful deductions. Take the elimi-nation of the State and local tax de-duction, for instance, which is used by so many middle-class families in my home State of New York. As it was cited in the Syracuse Post Standard: ‘‘The loss of the deduction will cost New Yorkers an average of $4,500 per year for those who file itemized re-turns, totaling about $68 billion per

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2570 April 27, 2017 
year that State residents will no longer be allowed to deduct from Federal re-turns.’’ I saw in Newsday this morning that a number of our Long Island Republican colleagues said they couldn’t be for this. We hope they will stand up to anything that gets rid of State and local deductibility because, let me re-peat, that is $4,500 a year that New Yorkers would no longer be able to de-duct on average—massive tax cuts for the very wealthy, crumbs at best for everyone else. Third, the Republican plan is steeped in hypocrisy. Even without filling in the details, Trump’s plan is already im-possible to pay for. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget esti-mates that Trump’s tax cuts will cost about $5.5 trillion over 10 years, as much as $7 trillion. That is a huge amount of money in our economy. CRFB projects that ‘‘no plausible amount of economic growth would be able to pay for the tax plan.’’ The Re-publican plan would explode the def-icit. For the last 8 years, all we heard from our Republican colleagues was that Obama was raising the deficit and we needed to cut programs that benefit the poor and the middle class; cut the entitlements, Social Security, Medi-care because of the deficit. All of a sud-den, now with a Republican President and a proposed tax cut for the wealthy, we are hearing from the other side of the aisle that deficits don’t matter. Our Republican colleagues certainly believe the admonition that ‘‘consist-ency is the hobgoblin of little minds.’’ Fourth, the Trump tax plan would explode the deficit and, thus, endanger Social Security and Medicare, which may well be the nefarious, ultimate goal of the hard right. Sadly, I know it can happen. I have seen it before with the Bush tax cuts. President Bush pushed a big tax break for the wealthy. It blew a hole in the deficit and racked up debt, and then he and his Republican colleagues tried to pursue deep cuts to the social safety net to balance the ledger. If Trump’s tax plan were to pass, you can be sure, America, that a few years down the line—maybe even not that long—the deficit will be so large that our Republican colleagues will throw up their hands and say: We have no choice but to come after Social Secu-rity and Medicare and other important programs for the middle class as a way to address the deficit they created by showering tax breaks on the very rich. They will resume the cry they had in the Obama years: Cut the deficit— which seems to apply to the programs that help the middle class but never to the ones that benefit the wealthy. Just from the bare-bones skeleton the administration outlined yesterday, we can already surmise that this plan is not much more than a thinly veiled ruse to give away trillions to the wealthiest among us, starve the gov-ernment of resources, balloon the def-icit, and then cut Social Security, Med-icaid, and Medicare to make up the dif-ference. This plan will roundly be rejected by taxpayers of all stripes. The American people are once again learning that what President Trump promised to working America in his campaign and what he is doing are totally at odds. 
TRUMPCARE  
Mr. President, on TrumpCare, very briefly—on the new version of TrumpCare that may soon be headed for a vote in the House, let’s not forget the reason that Americans were against the first version of TrumpCare. They are still in the second version. This version is worse, and there has been a lot of focus on a few of the changes. The fundamental nastiness of the TrumpCare proposal—raising the rates on people 50 to 65, 24 million people un-covered, difficulty in covering pre-existing conditions—is still in this bill. In fact, it is even worse. The new TrumpCare will allow States to decide whether insurers have to cover Ameri-cans with preexisting conditions. It is hard to come up with a crueler bill than one that would have resulted in 24 million fewer Americans with healthcare coverage, but this new TrumpCare manages to do it. It would hurt even more Americans and bring us back to the days when an insurance company could deny you coverage ex-actly when you needed it most. I say to the more moderate Repub-licans in the House: If you didn’t like the first version, you surely shouldn’t like this version. Frankly, you will pay a huge consequence in the 2018 elec-tions if you vote for it. We hope you don’t vote for it because we know how many people it would hurt. Even if it passed the House, the chances for sur-vival in the Senate are small. We don’t even know if the new version would survive under the rules of reconcili-ation, the amendment to allow States to drop preexisting conditions. The ful-crum of the new changes very possibly violates the Byrd rule and would be kicked down here and need 60 votes, which they won’t get for such a nasty provision. A warning to all those voting for it in the House: It may well be a chimera, all to save face for the President in his first hundred days. 
THE PRESIDENT ’S FIRST ONE HUNDRED DAYS  
Finally, Mr. President, we are only a few days from President Trump’s 100th day in office, and by all accounts, this has been a vastly different Presidency than was promised during his cam-paign. So far this week, we Democrats have highlighted how this President has broken or not fulfilled promise after promise to the working men and women of America. Today, I would like to focus on a par-ticularly stunning reversal this Presi-dent made in the first 100 days on one of the central pillars of his campaign: his promise to drain the swamp. Presi-dent Trump repeated this phrase at every campaign rally. In many ways, it summed up his ‘‘outsider’’ campaign. Make no mistake about it—the Presi-dent ran as a populist outsider, not as a traditional, hard-right, conservative Republican. He challenged the estab-lishments of both parties and pitched himself as a change agent, someone who could shake up the status quo. ‘‘Drain the swamp’’ was his tag line. We Democrats disagree with this President on many things, but we agree with him that the very wealthy, powerful special interests have far too much power in Washington. Large cor-porations that have the resources to make unlimited, undisclosed campaign contributions, that have resources to hire lobbyists on issue after issue, hold far too much power in this Nation’s Capital, and that structure has created a system where the wealthy and power-ful are advantaged in DC, while aver-age, hard-working Americans have a much smaller voice. Draining the swamp would be a good thing, but unfortunately, despite the many times he pledged radically to change the power structure in Wash-ington in the first 100 days, the Presi-dent has abandoned the mission. He filled his government with billionaires and bankers laden with conflicts of in-terests. He has broken with the prac-tice of the Obama administration by ending the publishing of visitor logs to the White House, so the press and the American people don’t know who has the ear of the President and his top people. He has even granted waivers to lobbyists to come work at the White House on the very same issues they were just lobbying on, and he has kept those waivers secret. A President who truly wanted to drain the swamp wouldn’t have taken a single one of those actions. What are the American people going to think? He campaigned on this and totally re-versed himself within the first 100 days. What are they going to think of him? It is no wonder his popularity ratings are low and sinking. President Trump ran as a populist, but at the 100-day mark, he hasn’t even tried to change the power structure in Washington and has in many ways rigged the government even more to benefit corporate special interests. This is one of the biggest broken prom-ises he made to the working men and women of America. That is how we Democrats sum up the first 100 days— broken and unfulfilled promises to the working people of America. And when it comes to draining the swamp, he has not done it. One final point. The events yesterday have further proven our point. The President promised one thing in his campaign and is now doing another. On his new healthcare proposal, he has shown his hand: Promise something for the working people but deliver legisla-tion that only helps the very wealthy. On his new tax plan, which still bene-fits the rich: Promise the working peo-ple; deliver for the wealthy. The Presi-dent has made our point better than we

could this week. After these two bills, his promises to working people are in tatters. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his remarks, especially with respect to the new addition of the healthcare bill. It is a disaster for Americans. It is immoral. It doesn’t work. It doesn’t address any of the problems that remain in the under-lying healthcare system. Hopefully the Senate can rise above it and work to-gether to do something better for the American people. 
GUN VIOLENCE  
Mr. President, I rise today because tomorrow President Trump is going to become the first President in about 30 years to address the National Rifle As-sociation. He will address the NRA to-morrow, and I thought it would be ap-propriate to come down to the floor to talk a little bit about the epidemic of gun violence in the context of this speech. A lot of us were thrown off by the tone of the President’s inaugural ad-dress. It was very different from a lot of inaugurals we have heard—not up-lifting, really. There was much more of a dark, dystopian picture of America, one that was frankly unfamiliar to a lot of us. Maybe the most memorable line from the President’s inaugural ad-dress was that after describing this dystopia that he believed most persons lived in, he said: ‘‘This American car-nage stops right here and it stops right now.’’ I wanted to come down to the floor today to talk about that idea of Amer-ican carnage, what it really is. I mean, this is American carnage. It is 31,000 Americans, mostly young men and women, who die every year from gun-shot wounds—2,600 a month, 86 a day. That is an enormous number. There is no other country in the first world, in the industrialized world, that has num-bers like this. They happen for a vari-ety of reasons. Two-thirds of those are suicides. That is an epidemic in and of itself. A lot of them are homicides. A number are accidental shootings. But America has this problem uniquely. There is no other industrialized com-petitor where this happens. That is the face of American carnage. President Trump is going to address the National Rifle Association tomor-row—an organization that is, frankly, dedicated to continuing this real car-nage that is happening in America. You can’t explain these numbers through mental illness. There is just as much mental illness in all of our eco-nomic competitors around the world. You can’t explain this through expo-sure to violent content on TV or mov-ies or video games. There are plenty other countries that have rates that are much lower than this and the kids see that same content. You can’t ex-plain this away by law enforcement. We spend an awful lot of money put-ting cops on the streets. What we have in this country that is different from any other nation is loose and lax gun laws that allow for criminals and peo-ple with serious mental illness to get their hands on weapons that are more powerful than those that are available in other nations. That was the case in Sandy Hook, too—enormous destruc-tion in a short amount of time. I want to talk a little bit today about two things—first, about the real scope of this carnage, and second, about the real story of gun owners. The President is going to go talk to the NRA—a group that is increasingly wildly out of step with gun owners not just in my State but across the coun-try. First, I want to talk about this idea of carnage in America—the central focus of the President’s inaugural ad-dress. I commend to my colleagues an article that appeared earlier this week—maybe late last week—called ‘‘What Bullets Do to Bodies.’’ We don’t like to talk about that a lot because today the popular image of a gun is almost divorced from its actual function. People collect them. People buy them in order to convey a certain image or lifestyle. People certainly have weapons to protect themselves, but very few Americans actually un-derstand what these guns are designed to do. They are designed to kill people. They are designed to gravely hurt peo-ple. In particular, the AR–15 and AR–15 variants are dedicated to killing people as fast and as gruesomely as possible. This article, ‘‘What Bullets Do to Bodies,’’ follows a trauma surgeon in Philadelphia. I want to read a few para-graphs from this article. It says: 
The main thing that people get wrong when they imagine being shot is that they think the bullet itself is the problem. The lump of metal lodged in the body. The ac-tion-movie hero is shot in the stomach; he limps to a safe house; he takes off his shirt, removes the bullet with a tweezer, and now he is better. This is not trauma surgery. Trauma surgery is about fixing the damage the bullet causes as it rips through muscle and vessel and organ and bone. The bullet can stay in the body just fine. But the bleeding has to be contained, even if the patient is awake and screaming because a tube has just been pushed into his chest cavity through a deep incision without the aid of general anesthesia (no time; the pa-tient gets an injection of lidocaine). And if the heart has stopped, it must be restarted before the brain dies from a lack of oxygen. It is not a gentle process. Some of the sur-geon’s tools look like things you’d buy at Home Depot. In especially serious cases, 70 times just at Temple last year, the surgeons will crack a chest right there in the trauma area. The technical name is a thoracotomy. A patient comes in unconscious, maybe in cardiac arrest, and Goldberg has to get into the cavity to see what is going on. With a scalpel, she makes an incision below the nip-ple and cuts 6 to 10 inches down the torso, through the skin, through the layer of fatty tissue, through the muscles. Into the open-ing she inserts a rib-spreader, a large metal instrument with a hand crank. It pulls open the ribs and locks them into place so the sur-geons can reach the inner organs. Every so often, she may have to break the patient’s sternum—a bilateral thoracotomy. This is done with a tool called a Lebsche knife. It’s a metal rod with a sharp blade on the end that hooks under the breastbone. The surgeon in this case is Dr. Gold-berg. 
Goldberg takes out a silver hammer. It looks like—a hammer. She hits the top of a Lebsche knife with the hammer until it cuts through the sternum. ‘‘You never forget that sound,’’ one of the Temple nurses told me. ‘‘It’s like a tink, tink, tink. And it sounds like metal, but you know it’s bone. You know like when you see on television, when people are working on the railroad, ham-mering the ties?’’ 
‘‘It’s just the worst,’’ one nurse told the writer of this story. ‘‘They’re breaking bone. And everybody—every body—has its own kind of quality. And sometimes there’s a big guy you’ll hear, and it’s the echo—the sound that comes out of the room. There’s some times when it doesn’t affect me, and there are some times when it makes my knees shake, when I know what’s going on in there.’’ The article goes on to talk about what happens to those who survive. 
The price of survival is often lasting dis-ability. Some patients, often young guys, wind up carrying around colostomy bags the rest of their lives. 
They go to the bathroom through a stoma, a hole in their abdomen. 
‘‘They’re so angry,’’ Goldberg said. ‘‘They should be angry.’’ Some are paralyzed by bullets that sever the spinal column. Some lose limbs entirely. 
AR–15s are designed by the military in order to kill people even more quickly so that you don’t ever have the chance of going to an emergency room. That is what happened at Sandy Hook. What is remarkable is that not a single one of those kids ever made it to a trauma surgeon. All of those kids died on the spot—20 of them. You sort of have to think about bul-lets like running fingers through the water: When you run your fingers through the water, it causes ripples, it causes disruptions in the water around them. Well, a bullet coming out of an AR–15 rifle moves three times faster than a bullet coming out of a handgun. So just look what happens when you run your hand through water. You run it through at this speed versus running it through at that speed. The ripples and the disruptions get bigger, right? And they spread further. That is what happens when the bullet from an AR–15 enters the body of anyone, but it cer-tainly does something different when it enters the body of a 6-year-old. One trauma surgeon said that when it hits bone, it likely will just turn it to dust. If a bullet from an AR–15 hits the liver, well, this surgeon says that ‘‘the liver looks like a Jell-o mold has been dropped on the floor.’’ I know some people think AR–15s are fun. They are fun to show off to your friends. They are neat to fire. But that is carnage. A little kid’s bones turning to dust in the middle of a first grade classroom is not sport; that is Amer-ican carnage. Do you know what? A lot

of gun owners get this. A lot of gun owners understand that this has gotten out of hand. There was a poll that was conducted just about 2 weeks ago of gun owners across the country. Eighty percent of them support requiring a background check before you buy a gun. That is pretty similar to the number you would find when you ask gun owners and nongun owners, but the gun owners in my State were frankly just as shocked and horrified at what hap-pened in that classroom at Sandy Hook as my nongun owners were. Gun owners in this country increas-ingly are not represented by the Na-tional Rifle Association, the group Donald Trump is going to go talk to this week, because the National Rifle Association, which claims to be speak-ing for gun owners, opposes back-ground checks. They don’t want a sin-gle additional gun sale to go through a background check. They are just fine with the fact that almost half of all guns sales in this country occur with-out a background check, meaning criminals and people with serious men-tal illness can get a gun so easily in this country that they don’t even have to make much of an effort. Eighty-six percent of gun owners in this poll support prohibiting anyone who is convicted of stalking or domes-tic abuse from buying a gun. The NRA opposes that. Eighty-five percent of gun owners support prohibiting those who are on the Federal terror watch list or no fly list from buying a gun. The NRA opposes that. Eighty-eight percent of gun owners believe you should have a permit to carry a concealed handgun in a public place. The NRA opposes that. So it is no secret that 67 percent of gun owners feel the NRA used to be an organiza-tion dedicated to gun safety, but it has been overtaken by lobbyists. Fifty per-cent of gun owners feel the NRA does not represent their interests. When President Trump goes to talk to the NRA tomorrow, I hope he under-stands they are not advocating for the views of gun owners in my State, they are not advocating for the gun owners in most all of your States. They are a radical political organization. They have to start answering for why they don’t square with the views of gun own-ers. Finally, here is a story of American carnage. Keon Huff, Jr., was 15 years old when he was shot on March 17 of this year in Hartford, CT. Here is what Keon said to one of his mentors in the North End of Hartford. He said: ‘‘I’m either going to go on to college and play basketball or I’m going to die on the streets.’’ Can you imagine there are kids who think that in this country? Can you imagine there are kids in this country who think their choices are to go play basketball in college or die on the streets of Connecticut? Most Ameri-cans cannot imagine a little kid saying that, but Keon thought that. He was right—because he was a great basket-ball player. He lived at the North End YMCA. He devoted all of his energy to basketball. He wanted to be the next Michael Jordan. If you told him other-wise, he just did not want to hear it. He was committed to playing basketball in college, but it was the other one that got him. He died in the hallway of his apartment complex when he was shot in the head on Friday, March 17. He died on the streets of Hartford. He did not end up going to college to play basketball. He is just one of 2,600 a month who die from guns, 31,000 a year, 86 a day. A lot of gun owners in this country get that. They understand the flow of illegal weapons into our streets. They understand there are some weapons out there that are way too powerful that do those terrible things to bodies when the bullet enters. When Donald Trump talks to the NRA, I hope he takes them on and asks why they refuse to stand up for policies that will end this American carnage that the President talked about in his speech and why they will not start ac-tually representing the views of Amer-ican gun owners. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
UL-
LIVAN ). The Senator from Wyoming. 
FOREIGN POLICY  
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, peo-ple around the country know the world continues to be a very dangerous place. It became more dangerous over the past 8 years. I believe that is particu-larly related to what I saw as unwise and unsound policies by the Obama ad-ministration, certainly when it comes to foreign policy. Every President’s foreign policy should secure America’s national inter-ests and demonstrate America’s leader-ship around the world. That was not the case under President Obama. The last President and his team followed a policy, what has been called strategic patience—strategic patience—when dealing with hostile countries all around the world: Iran, North Korea. Any time there was a belligerent, ag-gressive, cunning dictator on the move, President Obama’s position was stra-tegic patience. It was a terrible ap-proach—a terrible approach for us in dealing with reckless regimes. I always thought President Obama was completely focused on signing a nuclear deal with Iran, not because it actually was a great deal but maybe because it might reflect well on his leg-acy. I thought he wanted a deal so badly that he ended up getting a deal that was a bad deal. Well, as part of the deal, the former President accepted Iranian demands—and he accepted all of them—to lift an arms embargo that the United Nations had put into place. This was an embargo that said that Iran was not supposed to be selling weapons to other countries. The em-bargo was going to disappear in 5 years, whether Iran complied with it or not. We already know Iran has no in-tention of playing by the rules. They haven’t played by the rules all the way through. Last week, the Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, said Iran has already been violating the embargo. That is why I believe they have no in-tention of playing by the rules. The Secretary of Defense tells us they are not playing by the rules now. He said we have seen Iranian-supplied missiles—our Secretary of Defense said: We have seen Iranian-supplied missiles being fired into Saudi Arabia by the rebels in Yemen. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was even more clear. He said last week that Iran is ‘‘the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism.’’ He said that Iran is ‘‘responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts’’—‘‘in-tensifying the conflicts and under-mining U.S. interests in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon.’’ Now, this is a direct result of President Obama spending 8 years being strategi-cally patient. It is the result of sending the signal that Iran would be rewarded for its bad behavior. So let’s look at what happened last year when the Obama administration was bragging about the nuclear deal— and they were high-fiving, bragging about the deal. Just when the deal went into effect, President Obama arranged to send to Iran $1.7 billion in cash—$1.7 billion is an astonishingly large amount of money. It is a million and a million and a million—it is 1,700 piles of $1 mil-lion. Remember—try to visualize this. You may remember the news reports about pallets of cash stacked up going to Iran. President Obama sent $400 mil-lion as a downpayment. Within 24 hours, the Iranians agreed to release a group of Americans whom they had been holding hostage. The Obama White House said it was not a ransom payment to free the hostages. The Obama administration actually thought the American people were naive enough to believe it was just a coincidence in timing. Well, you can bet the Iranians did not believe it was a coincidence because they actually said it was not a coincidence. The Iranians described the money as for the release of the hostages. We know from experience that the Ira-nians see hostage-taking as a valid way of conducting their own foreign policy. Right now, North Korea also has taken hostages—three American hostages written about today in the papers. We know from experience the Ira-nians see hostage-taking as a valid way to conduct foreign policy, and they have also gotten the message, at least from the previous administration, that it can be a very profitable policy as well. President Obama played right into their hands. There is something else President Obama did that we just learned about, and that is why I want-ed to speak about this today. Politico had a major expose on Mon-day of this week. The headline was: ‘‘Obama’s hidden Iran deal giveaway’’—

the ‘‘hidden deal giveaway.’’ Around the same time President Obama was sending cash to Iran, he also released seven Iranians who had been arrested by the United States. The President downplayed the crimes these individ-uals had committed. He said it was a ‘‘one-time gesture’’ to help grease the skids for his Iran deal. Now, according to the documents ob-tained by Politico, the Obama adminis-tration also dropped charges and inter-national arrest warrants against 14 other individuals. Some of them were wanted for serious threats to our own American national security. One man was charged with trying to buy thou-sands of assault weapons—thousands of assault weapons—and send them to Iran. Another was charged with conspiring to get from Iran thousands of pieces of equipment with nuclear applications. The scheme included hundreds of U.S.- made sensors for uranium enrichment centrifuges in Iran. Centrifuges were a big reason we were concerned about Iran’s nuclear program in the first place. Yet, according to President Obama, this doesn’t seem to be a prob-lem. According to the article that came out Monday, ‘‘As far back as the fall of 2014, Obama administration officials began slow-walking some significant investigations and prosecutions of Ira-nian procurement networks operating right here within the United States.’’ As one expert told Politico, ‘‘This is a scandal.’’ She said: ‘‘It’s stunning and hard to understand why we would do this.’’ Republicans in Congress warned about this kind of thing from the very beginning. President Obama was so in-terested in getting a deal that he got one that in my opinion, has been very bad for the United States—not just for the United States, bad for the world be-cause Iran with a nuclear weapon makes the world less safe, less secure, and less stable. President Obama has this as part of his legacy, but I will tell you strategic patience has failed. Secretary of State Tillerson said so last week, and I agree with him completely. I am glad to hear our top diplomat recognized this, and I am glad to see the Trump administra-tion doing a comprehensive review of the Iran nuclear agreement. The last President put international opinion first when it came to foreign policy. We see this all around the world. This President, President Trump, is showing that we will put America’s interests first. It is not just Iran where we have the problem. I was recently in Asia over the break, along with a group of Senators. We went to Tokyo, we went to Beijing to meet with the leaders in China. We went around that region. We met with the Premier of China, who is the No. 2 per-son in China, and we met with the No. 3 and the No. 4 to talk specifically about the problems of North Korea and the region. For a long time, North Korea has been called the land of lousy options, but there is new urgency as we see the increasing capacity of North Korea now with their rockets not just pro-pelled with liquid fuel but now with solid fuel that allows for quicker launches. The launch vehicles are no longer on wheels limited to the roads in North Korea, they are now on tracks and they can go anywhere. North Korea has increased their nu-clear capacity as well as their missile deliverability, and they are working on intercontinental ballistic missiles that can hit the United States. That is why we were at the White House yesterday for this secure briefing. That is why it is so critical that we focus on North Korea and we have a President who is focused on a peaceful resolution but is not afraid to use force, as we have seen in Syria and in Afghanistan, because if you want to use deterrence, you have to have a capacity—which we have had in the United States, which is incred-ible—through the Presidents over the years. You have to have a commitment to use that capacity, and we have seen from President Trump a commitment to use that capacity in Syria, in Af-ghanistan. You have to communicate a willingness to use that capacity, as President Trump is doing today. Last week, Vice President P
ENCE  traveled to the demilitarized zone be-tween South Korea and North Korea. He said very clearly that when it comes to North Korea’s nuclear weap-ons program, ‘‘the era of strategic pa-tience is over.’’ North Korea has been allowed to get away with too much for too long. It continues to test nuclear weapons. It continues to test missiles. It continues to use hostages as a way of getting what it wants from other countries. Over the weekend, we learned that North Korea arrested an American pro-fessor who was in that country. North Korea, like Iran, has a history of tak-ing hostages and using them as lever-age to get what it wants. We now know three Americans are being held in North Korea. The leadership of countries like Iran and North Korea need to understand that this kind of action will not suc-ceed. No one wants a fight with Iran. No one wants a fight with North Korea. The way to avoid the fight is to show that there is a limit to the patience of civilized countries of the world, which is why the age of strategic patience is now in the past. There is new leadership with negotia-tion, deterrence, and, as a final option, the use of force, if necessary, which has not been the case in the last 8 years, where the use of force, the message sent by that administration was: We have no commitment to use the capac-ity which the United States has. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, there is probably nobody in the Senate I admire more than the Senator from Wyoming, except maybe his colleague, MIKEENZI, who is also from Wyoming. I come to the floor not to talk about these issues but to talk about others. I feel compelled to respond to some of what he said. There’s no need for Senator B
AR-
RASSO to remain. So don’t feel as though you have to, but thank you just the same. Mr. President, a little background: As the Presiding Officer knows, having spent some time in the military—’06, the Marine Corps; the Navy salutes the Marine Corps. I am a retired Navy cap-tain, three tours in Southeast Asia in the Vietnam war. I served as a P–3 air-craft mission commander right at the end of the Cold War. The month I stepped down as a Navy captain, I led a congressional delegation back into Vietnam. Six of us—Democrats, Repub-licans—went at the behest of former President George Herbert Walker Bush’s administration to find out what happened to thousands of MIAs to see if we could get information about them and to provide that information to their families for closure. That was the beginning of an effort in the House, mirrored by the one over here led by J
OHNMCCAINand John Kerry, to move us toward normalized relations to see if the Vietnamese would cooperate with us in providing information that we wanted and the families wanted and de-serve. In fact, a year ago, I learned, along with President Obama, that we are there to kind of close the circle on our relationship with Vietnam, which has changed a lot over the last 30 years. In-terestingly enough, we are Vietnam’s best trading partner, and they are a very good trading partner to us. When we were there, they announced they were going to buy something like $10, $12, $14 billion worth of our air-craft—not fighter aircraft, not military aircraft, but civilian aircraft from, I believe, Boeing. I learned about some polling data. They had taken two polls, two surveys of the Vietnamese people early last year, and the question asked of Viet-namese people was: How do you feel about other countries, the people from other countries? How do you feel about the Chinese, the Russians, Filipinos, Malaysians, Indians, Pakistanis, Amer-icans, and others? How do you feel about them? In one survey, 85 percent of the Vietnamese people said they had favorable opinions toward America and Americans—85 percent, the highest of any other nation surveyed. Another survey said: No, no, 95 percent of Viet-namese have favorable opinions of the United States, which is higher than their opinions of any other nation. The reason I mention Vietnam—they were a bitter enemy of this country. The names of 55,000 men and women with whom I served in Southeast Asia are on a wall just down 2 miles from here, down by the Lincoln Memorial. While we were bitter enemies, we re-solved those differences in the 1990s.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2574 April 27, 2017 
We are now close trading partners. We don’t agree with them on every single thing, but they like us a lot. We have much more of a relationship than we have ever had in the past, and it is a much better economic relationship than we have ever had in the past. The reason I mention Vietnam is that there are some corollaries here with Iran. In 1978, that was when some will recall—the pages are too young to remember this. But in 1978, Iranians, led by their religious leader, captured, took control of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. They held our folks for a year or two as part of their cultural revolu-tion or religious revolution. When they did that, do you know what we did? We seized a lot of their assets in this country, in other coun-tries as best we could. And that was not just a couple of dollars, not just a couple million dollars; it was hundreds of millions of dollars, and, man, maybe even more. Maybe it was even billions of dollars. We held those assets, and we kept the Iranians from reclaiming those assets for, gosh, over 30 years—maybe close to 40 years. They have litigated in court. They say that they feel they should have access to what is theirs, what was theirs. We are told by lawyers—I am not a lawyer—but we are told by some pretty smart lawyers on our side and others that they had a very good chance of getting all that and more in court if we didn’t settle. What we did, at the end of the day, when the Iranians agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agree-ment, which was reached with not just the United States but with the Ger-mans, the French, the Brits, the Chi-nese, and the Russians—the idea was to make sure that Iran didn’t have a quick path, a fast track to continuing their development of nuclear weapons. They were clearly wanting to do it, and we wanted them not to do that. So we ended up negotiating this agreement. Part of the agreement was to settle these claims from almost 40 years ago, financial claims, valuable assets that we basically seized and re-fused to return. It turns out, we have to mention how highly the Vietnamese people think of us today. As it turns out, Vietnam is a very young country, very young. So is Iran. Iran has about 80 million people. In Iran, the majority of the people are under the age of 25. They like this country a lot, but they have people over there who are more in line with the old regime, who don’t like us. The Revolutionary Guard, some of the mili-tary leadership—they don’t like us. They have newly elected leadership from 4 years ago, President Rouhani, Foreign Minister Zarif, and others who, frankly, want to be able to work with us, if they can. They are willing to agree to what I think is a very harsh agreement to ensure that they don’t move forward on developing weapons and developing nuclear weapons. If they do, then we are going to impose these really stringent sanctions on them, shut down their economy—dou-ble-digit rates of inflation, economy in the tank. Finally, they said: OK, uncle. We will agree to this agreement. Since then, the Iranians have done what the Vietnamese did a year ago; they have a more abundant civilian air fleet. Their civilian aircraft are old, de-crepit, and they need new ones. They are doing what the Vietnamese have al-ready done: buying a lot of American- made aircraft, passenger aircraft by Boeing. We are not talking about just a couple billion dollars’ worth but cer-tainly more than $10 billion worth. I think they have already taken or-ders on one and have made one of the very first ones, and there is more to come. I think they are also going to buy a bunch of airbuses. I think more than half of the airbuses have compo-nents made in America, and that is an-other boost to our economy. I don’t remember who said it, but a Chinese military leader once said: The greatest victory of all is the one that we win without firing a shot. That is what he said: The greatest victory of all is the one we win without firing a shot. Well, for a Navy guy who has seen some time in a combat area and the Presiding Officer, who knows a little bit about this stuff as well—I think he probably agrees with me that if you can win one without shooting anybody or getting anybody killed, I think that is worth doing. The other thing I would say is, that doesn’t mean we just trust Iran that they are going to do what they said they are going to do in the deal. There is an agency—I think it is called the International Atomic Energy Agency. They are all over them in terms of monitoring the deal and making sure that what the Iranians agreed to do, they actually do. What is it, trust but verify? That is really what the Iranian deal is all about: trust but verify. We will see how it all works out. Color me hopeful. A lot of times when we vote on stuff, we vote our hopes as opposed to our fears. Some-times we vote our fears, as opposed to our hopes. On the Iran deal, I voted my hopes. We will see how it goes, and I am hopeful. 
BORDER WALL  
Mr. President, that is not why I came to the floor. There is a lot of talk about a wall. I heard a song by Pink Floyd the other day: ‘‘All in all it was just a brick in the wall.’’ The President wants us to build a wall on our southern border with Mex-ico. It is about 2,000 miles between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf Coast. I have been down there any number of times as the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and still as the senior Democrat on the Homeland Se-curity Committee. The ranking mem-ber is C
LAIRE MCCASKILL of Missouri. I have not been on every square mile of the border with Mexico, but I can tell you that there are some places on the border where a wall makes some sense, and there are frankly a lot of places where it doesn’t, including where you have hundreds of miles of river where it doesn’t make any sense. Also, I have heard from folks from Yuma down there, where the Border Patrol told me—where they had an area where they had some wall. I think the wall was maybe 15 feet high, and they kept finding like 18-, 19-foot lad-ders on the other side of the wall, where people would come up with a lad-der to the wall and go over and above the wall. So you can go over a wall. You can even go over a high wall with a ladder that is high enough. A lot of that has been done. You can go under a wall, tunnel under. A lot of people tried to get out of Mexico into the United States by tunneling under the wall. As it turns out, walls in some places make sense. Fences in some places make sense. Boats in some places, like on the river that happens to be our bor-der, the Rio Grande border with Mex-ico—boats make sense. Sometimes fast boats, really fast boats make sense. Sometimes it makes sense to build a ramp so you can get boats into the water in different places. Sometimes it makes sense to build a road on our side of the border to give us mobility. Sometimes it makes sense to put sur-veillance equipment in drones. Some-times it makes sense to put surveil-lance equipment in helicopters. Some-times it makes sense to put surveil-lance equipment in fixed-wing aircraft and also not just binoculars to try to find people. There is something called VADER. It is an acronym for Vehicle and Dis-mount Exploitation Radar, to find peo-ple. It is very highly sophisticated sur-veillance equipment to go on our drones, go on our helicopters, and go on our fixed-wing aircraft. What is so special about this? It can see at night. It allows us to see dozens of miles into Mexico at night—through fog, through rain. We have a system and if we need to, rather than just send out aircraft or drones or whatever without that kind of surveillance equipment, let’s put the surveillance equipment on it. That makes far more sense than building a 2,000-mile wall. Other things that make sense are surveillance towers. We have to go 100 feet up in the air, 200, 300 feet. Some of them are mobile. Some of them are stationary. We have motion detectors. In some places, that makes a lot of sense. There is no shortage of ideas that make sense. What I like to do to try to figure out what to do is I ask people like the Border Patrol: What do you think makes sense? And what they pretty much say is an ‘‘all of the above’’ approach. We have an ‘‘all of the above’’ ap-proach in energy. If we are smart about securing our border with Mexico, I think we have gotten smarter as we

have gone on. We certainly have a lot more people down there than we had before that. We have 20,000 people, our men and women in the Border Patrol. They work hard and do a good job. It is an ‘‘all of the above’’ approach. So I wanted to get that off my chest. Does it make sense to spend $25 bil-lion to build a wall that we may need less than 100 miles? Probably not. Ab-solutely not. The people who are coming across our border with Mexico are not Mexi-cans. They used to be. There are more Mexicans going back into Mexico from the United States than are coming into the United States from Mexico. The places where a lot of illegal immigra-tion is coming from are three coun-tries: Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Here is why they come. It is because they live lives of desperation. They live lives without economic hope, economic opportunity, murder, mayhem, some of the highest murder rates in the world. I think El Salvador—I don’t know if we have the numbers here. They have a number of different routes they take from the three countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, mostly coming into the United States right here. They don’t so much go over to El Paso. They certainly don’t head over here on land to get in on the western side of our border. Some try to come by air, but mostly they come by—it used to be by train, now mostly it is by land, and they are dangerous missions. The reason they come is because there is not much hope there. Frankly, the reason there is not much hope there, in part, is because of us. There used to be a comic strip called ‘‘Pogo.’’ The Presiding Officer remembers ‘‘Pogo.’’ One of the lines from ‘‘Pogo’’ is, ‘‘I found the enemy, and it is me.’’ We are the enemy. The chairman of the Homeland Security Committee said many times, the root cause of what is going on down there is our addiction to drugs in this country. The drugs are trafficked through here, they come into the United States, are sold, and the money from the drugs goes back there along with guns. When we deport the bad guys, what do we do? We take the bad guys who were selling the drugs, and we put them right back down here. It is a toxic mix of guns, weapons, and bad guys. They make life down here miserable for people. As it turns out, Colombia, a few years ago, was a miserable place to live too. One time, about 20 years ago, a bunch of gunmen in Colombia rounded up the supreme court justices of the Colombian supreme court, took them into a room and shot them to death— shot them to death. There was a time when the FARC, the rebel groups, the leftist groups, and the drug gangs were trying to take down the Government of Colombia, and it looked like they could. And some great people in Colombia stood up and said: Not on my watch. This is not going to happen on my watch. They came up with Plan Colombia in order to make sure this didn’t happen. Presi-dent Clinton and a guy named Joe Biden, who was chairman of the For-eign Relations Committee, led an ef-fort to—not for us to fully fund Plan Colombia, but they basically said: This is on you. You can do it like at Home Depot. You can do it. We can help. They did the heavy lifting. They did most of the raising of revenues, and we played our role. We continued to play our role for 20 years and Colombia is a different place today. The same thing can happen to these three countries down here. Joe Biden was playing a significant role as Vice President. I was helpful, as was Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of Home-land Security, and others as well. These folks, along with these three countries, came up with something they called the Alliance for Prosperity. It is really like Plan Colombia—find out what works, do more of that. Plan Colombia worked, and they are trying an approach like this down here. The idea is to restore the rule of law, to focus on infrastructure, to focus on making good government work and be effective, to really tamp down on the corruption they have there, the ob-struction that goes on with small busi-nesses. The idea is to create a safer, better place. Most people don’t want to leave here. I talked to plenty of them. They want to stay there. Some of them want to come up here and work but then go home. This is their country, and they love their country, like we love ours. Finally, as we have been joined on the floor by one of my colleagues, I ask him to allow me just maybe another minute or two. 
NAFTA  
Mr. President, there has been talk about NAFTA. There has been talk— and I don’t know if these are alter-native facts coming out of the White House or what—that the President is going to pull out of NAFTA. I would just state this. I met with Robert Lighthizer, who is going to be our Trade Rep—and I understand that he will be a good one. He will succeed Michael Froman, who was an excellent Trade Rep for a number of years. When I met with Mr. Lighthizer in my office a couple of months ago, he talked about renegotiating NAFTA. When we negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partner-ship with 11 other countries around the world—40 percent of the world’s mar-kets—we did that over the last couple of years, we were renegotiating NAFTA. We fixed a lot of things in NAFTA that needed to be fixed, not just in the Mexico part of NAFTA but also Canada. One of the things that needed to be fixed was in our top market—we raise a lot of chickens in Georgia, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and other places. Our top market for poultry is Mexico. Canada doesn’t buy our chickens. They keep us out. The Trans-Pacific Part-nership renegotiated NAFTA, not just for poultry but for a variety of other commodities we want to sell. So my friendly advice to the Presi-dent is, before he goes ahead and pulls out of NAFTA, why doesn’t he and the administration take a closer look at what we renegotiated in the Trans-Pa-cific Partnership when we renegotiated NAFTA. I think we will find a lot of what we need to do, want to do, and what we can agree to do. HEALTHCARE  
Mr. President, I want to talk about healthcare reform. The Republicans came up with a really good idea in 1993. It was introduced by John Chafee, the Senator from Rhode Island, and co-sponsored by 23 Senators. It was an al-ternative plan to HillaryCare in 1993. The Republicans got the ideas from the Heritage Foundation, and they turned out to be good ideas. One provision they included was that every State would have an exchange. If people couldn’t get healthcare, they could buy their healthcare coverage as a part of a large purchasing pool called an exchange. The Republican idea from Chafee and others not only had ex-changes but had sliding-scale tax cred-its for buying down the healthcare for lower income folks to buy down the cost of coverage for lower income peo-ple. When their income reached a cer-tain level, the tax credit went away. That was in 1993, the alternative plan to HillaryCare, with the individual mandate. Basically, many folks had to be covered, and there would be a fine if they didn’t get coverage. We can’t make people get coverage, but the idea was to get people to get coverage. The employer mandate was the fourth concept. The fourth concept said employers of a certain size—I think it was employers with 50 to 100 employ-ees—were to provide healthcare to their employees. The last piece was that insurance companies could not deny coverage to people because of preexisting condi-tions. That was the 1993 proposal, cour-tesy of the Heritage Foundation. When Mitt Romney was Governor of Massachusetts, he took that game plan, lock, stock, and barrel, and estab-lished RomneyCare and it worked out pretty well. When we did the Afford-able Care Act, we took RomneyCare and built on that. I will close with this. The piece that needs to be fixed and repaired, not re-pealed but fixed, out of the original Re-publican idea is the idea that the insur-ance companies need a stable insurance pool of healthy people, not just old peo-ple and sick people but healthy people and younger people as well. There are some ways we can fix that. It is one of the fixes we need to make. It isn’t all that hard. It isn’t all that hard, and I will talk about that some other day. I appreciate my friend from one of those Dakotas—South Dakota—for being patient and waiting. Thank you. I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2576 April 27, 2017 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Dakota. Mr. ROUNDS. Thank you, Mr. Presi-dent. My colleague and friend, the Senator from Delaware, is also a former Gov-ernor, and it is always enjoyable to lis-ten to the experiences and clearly the understanding about a number of the issues we have in common in terms of things that concern us. I remember back in 1993, as well when we were looking at healthcare re-form in South Dakota, we actually, in our process, adopted the vast majority of what was considered to be the rec-ommendations from the National Asso-ciation of Insurance Commissioners— guaranteed renewability of policies, guaranteed to be able to move from one group insurance product to another group insurance product, a minimum amount of premium versus maximum amount of premium by any carrier in any single group of policies in one plan. Those provisions actually worked for us for a period up until 2009, when ObamaCare became the law of the land, and at that point we suffered through the same problems most of the rest of America is suffering through right now. But there are some things that really do bind us together, and one of them is trying to make and produce the best healthcare products for the citizens within our different States that we possibly can. I think in the U.S. Senate there are enough of us who truly be-lieve we can fix, repeal, replace ObamaCare. I think Democrats would like to say we are going to fix it. I think Republicans recognize that we are probably going to do more of a startover because the basic concept of ObamaCare, which was moving more and more into a single-payer system, will not work. For those of us who believe in the free market, what we want to do is take away the regulations at the Fed-eral level, give them back to the States, and allow the States to actu-ally experiment and make a more com-petitive healthcare product. That al-lows for businesses to be able to insure more individuals to help pay for their costs. It also means, then, you can ac-tually get more individuals to receive the benefits of private healthcare rath-er than being responsible for or at least expecting that the Federal Government is going to subsidize with Federal tax-payer money their healthcare costs. I think that is part of what we need to be concerned with here today. 
REGULATORY REFORM  
Mr. President, we all want a strong economy. We want more jobs being made available. One of the reasons I am here on the floor today is to talk about not just the healthcare regula-tions that impact the ability of em-ployers to hire employees, but we should also be talking about the regu-latory environment in the United States. That is what I really want to talk about today, is this tremendous suc-cess we are beginning to have in just the first 3 months that President Trump has taken office. We have been successful in undoing a number of the regulatory hurdles that have been hin-dering job growth and prosperity in the United States. It has been 3 months now since the President took office, with a Repub-lican-led Congress in place ready to help him advance policies that grow our economy and allow hard-working Americans to keep more of their pay-check each month. We are going to be talking a lot about tax reform, but we shouldn’t for-get about regulatory reform as well. One of the items with tax reform, some folks actually suggested a tax on items being brought into the United States—a border adjustment tax. One of the reasons for that was they thought we would be buying more American goods if we made those goods from other countries more expensive by putting a tax on them, which would be passed on to the consumers. I think that is the wrong approach. What we should be doing is allowing our consumers the availability of a less expensive American product, and the way you do that is we allow manufac-turers in the United States to become more competitive. We do that by reduc-ing their input costs, including a regu-latory impact that is huge. We believe we should be creating an atmosphere in the United States for products to be produced at a cost that is less in the first place. We shouldn’t have to increase the cost of other peo-ple’s products coming into the United States. We should be making it less ex-pensive for our producers to compete with them. The way we accomplish this, first and foremost, is by reducing the regulatory environment in Amer-ica, which is way too intrusive, dupli-cative, and overreaching. If anyone is wondering how bad the regulatory environment is in the United States today, well, regulations cost the American people $1.9 trillion annually, the bulk of which is handed down to consumers. Businesses don’t absorb it, they pass it on. How are the consumers paying for it? Through higher prices on products and goods produced in the United States. If you are wondering why it is such a big deal, it is because we want our manu-facturers, our producers, and our busi-nesses in the United States to be able to compete with our competitors over-seas, the ones that don’t have the crip-pling regulatory environment we have here at home. Right now, our busi-nesses and job creators are crippled by Federal regulations that limit their ability to expand and grow, to create more job opportunities, and pay higher wages. If the $1.9 trillion we spend annually on regulations were a country, it would be the 10th largest economy in the world, about the size of India or Rus-sia’s economy. Get this. We pay more as consumers for the cost of regula-tions at $1.9 trillion than we as tax-payers pay in personal income taxes on April 15. On April 15, we pay about $1.4 trillion in personal income taxes, and yet we pay $1.9 trillion—one-half tril-lion more in the costs of regulations. No other country in the world even comes close to this sort of unhealthy, costly regulatory environment. It is putting us at a competitive disadvan-tage in the international arena. While there has been a lot of focus this week on reforming our tax policy to get us back to the level of global competitive-ness that we need, we must not lose sight of the need to reform our regu-latory environment to one that invites growth and innovation. Both are need-ed. We have to reform our tax policy, and we absolutely have to reform our regulatory policies. Already in the first 3 months that President Trump has been in office, we have made progress in stopping harm-ful regulations from taking effect. Under the Congressional Review Act, the Senate has passed 13 resolutions so far this year to undo Obama-era regu-lations. The Congressional Review Act allows us to disapprove certain regula-tions that basically were approved by the administration or created by the administration over the last 6 months. The reason we are able to do it is be-cause we can do it with just a majority vote. It is a privileged motion in the U.S. Senate. It is a majority vote in the House and takes a majority vote in the Senate. It doesn’t require 60 votes, so we are actually able to, with a ma-jority vote, undo these regulations that were going to be imposed on the American public over the last 6 months. I think that is a step in the right direction. This is a program which in the past has been used only one time since it was created in the 1990s. We have done it 13 times in just these first 3 months. The Congressional Review Act, or CRA, is truly an impor-tant oversight tool that allows Con-gress to undo Federal regulations issued by unelected bureaucrats at Federal agencies by this simple major-ity vote. For example, we have been able to re-verse the Obama administration’s edu-cation mandate which would have im-posed Federal education standards to assess schools at the State and level local. We think that should be done at the State and local level. We also stopped an Obama regulation that would have imposed burdensome new restrictions on internet service providers that would do nothing to in-crease privacy protections for con-sumers. If you follow some of the mis-information that has been put out there, some people have suggested that we were taking away privacy that had been put in place by the last adminis-tration. Not true. Actually, what hap-pened was that the courts had already stopped these provisions before they were ever put into effect. So, for the people who like the policy protections that are in place today,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2577 April 27, 2017 
they are still there. This was a new regulation that they were going to im-pose that took an entirely different ap-proach to managing privacy. We were able to stop it. We have told the agen-cies to go back, to start over again, and to start following a similar course of action to what was already in place and that people already liked. The savings that come from undoing these and other regulations that we have stopped under the Congressional Review Act, combined with the Presi-dent’s Executive actions and rule delays, will save Americans, approxi-mately, 52 million hours of paperwork annually and, if you accumulate what the costs are over an extended period of time, over $65 billion in regulatory compliance costs. To the President’s credit, he has also been busy using the tools he has available in order to undo burdensome regulations that are crip-pling growth. The new administration put a halt to the overreaching waters of the United States—or WOTUS—rule, requiring the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to review the WOTUS rule in order to make cer-tain it promotes economic growth and minimizes regulatory uncertainty. I would suspect that this time around, rather than the last time around, they will actually be required to use sound science in making those determina-tions. It also stopped the Obama adminis-tration’s costly Clean Power Plan, which would have required States to completely rework their electric grids and would have led to dramatically higher electricity bills for every single American in the country. Now, I am not suggesting that all rules are bad. Some rules are necessary for a government to operate in an or-derly fashion and keep Americans safe, but too much regulation is costly and clearly stifles innovation. For the past 8 years, Americans have seen an un-precedented number of new rules and regulations that have been issued by unelected, unaccountable Washington bureaucrats. We are committed to changing that ‘‘Washington knows best’’ mentality because, at the end of the day, over-regulation hurts families the most be-cause they are the ones who are forced to pay more for goods and services when businesses are forced to spend ex-orbitant amounts of money just to put their products on the market. It is time for America to retake its position as a world leader in innova-tion. It is time for America to get busy on production again—creating new job opportunities, selling more of our prod-ucts at a competitive advantage over-seas, affording young people new job opportunities and the ability to stay here in the United States, inviting more capital to come in because there is a better return on capital, which, once again, gets reinvested in the United States and, thus, grows our economy and allows us to be able to enjoy the services that economy sup-ports. It is time to take a second look at regulations. It is time for the United States to be a leader again and for the American people to have the ability to have influence on the laws that are being created. Those laws should be voted on by their elected representa-tives, not imposed on them by unelected Washington bureaucrats. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. K
EN-
NEDY ). The Senator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to follow up on the remarks that have just been made by our friend from South Dakota. During his first 100 days in office, President Trump has wasted no time in fulfilling one of his key promises and one of those promises that is hard to appreciate because, if bad things do not happen to you, it is hard to realize they did not happen. Yet there were many bad things in store for the Amer-ican people and frankly a lot of bad things that have happened through the very kinds of regulations, over the last years, that Senator R
OUNDS was talk-ing about. Over the last 8 years, any time I had been traveling in Missouri, one of the top-of-mind issues with group after group had always been a different and more troublesome and more burden-some recent regulation by the Federal Government. I had heard about healthcare, but often I had heard about healthcare with regard to the irra-tional regulations that were being put out as part of the bill, and I had heard about taxes. Yet I would say that the No. 1 issue I had heard about for the whole 8 years was that of out-of-con-trol regulators who were clearly also not responsive to anybody and did not need to be. Frankly, in the second 4 years of that Presidency, the regu-lators were even less responsive than they were in the first 4 years, and I think that is something that happens way too often. I hear from families, farmers, and job creators who tell me that the biggest barrier to job creation and economic growth is exactly what we are hearing about here this morning; that people do not think out the real consequences of the regulations. According to regulations.gov, Fed-eral agencies finalized more than 4,000 new regulations in 2016 alone. That was an average of 11 new regulations a day in the final year of the Obama Presi-dency. Let’s think about that. Every one of those 4,000 regulations was a regulation that the country had lived without for the entire history of the country and that the Obama adminis-tration had lived without for 7 years. A number of those regulations had been done so late that we had had a chance to look at them through the Congressional Review Act because they were still available to the new Con-gress. That is how late they happened. One of them went into effect on Janu-ary 18, and the Obama administration was over at noon on January 20. They handed down a record-breaking 600 major new regulations that imposed more than $700 billion in costs on our economy. Senator ROUNDS just men-tioned the estimated total annual com-pliance costs for regulations of $1.9 bil-lion—almost $2 trillion. Imagine. If half of those regulations are either du-plicative or unnecessary, talk about a stimulus, if somehow we go back and figure out how to eliminate the half that does not need to be done so one can really focus on the half that needs to be done. I am for every regulation that we absolutely have to have, but I am not for regulations that we do not absolutely have to have. What is worse is that the completely unnecessary aim of these regulations is frankly the amount of effort some of them require. There is a $12.3 billion regulation on efficiency standards for central air conditioners. Now, one has to find a lot of efficiency to find $12.3 billion in sav-ings. That is a lot of efficiency. There is a $4.4 billion regulation that sets standards for ceiling fans. I like ceiling fans as much as the next person, but when you add $4.4 billion to standards, that has to be paid for by somebody just like the $3.6 billion in regulations of the control of commercial vehicle operators. What the regulators so often do not seem to understand is that ultimately the consumers have to pay for the costs of these regulations. The cost of regulations is not really a reflection of the government’s cost of being the reg-ulator, it is the economic cost of hav-ing the regulations. That is why I have been particularly encouraged to see President Trump taking the steps he has taken to roll back many of the late efforts by the Obama administration. Since taking office, President Trump has signed 13 Congressional Review Act resolutions which, according to the administra-tion, will save $10 billion in regulatory costs over a 10-year period of time. With regard to the Congressional Re-view Act, the Congress’s passing a re-jection of the rule and the President’s agreeing to it happened exactly one time in 25 years prior to this adminis-tration. It has happened 13 times this year. It will happen, I am confident, a few more times, and it will have a real impact. When you look at the regulations that have been delayed or repealed by CRAs and Executive orders—Congres-sional Review Act resolutions or Exec-utive orders—the American Action Forum estimates that $18.8 billion would be saved annually. Now, the President is not going to get much credit for that, and the Congress is not either, but if in the last few weeks we figured out how to take an $18.8 billion burden off of people by not moving for-ward with regulations that the country had not had prior to just a few weeks ago, in some cases, that is a good thing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2578 April 27, 2017 
Many of the Missourians from whom I have heard are particularly relieved that the President is also moving back from a couple of rules—the power rule and the waters of the United States rule—that Federal courts, fortunately, up until now, had said to President Obama’s administration they did not have the authority to do what they were trying to do in either of these rules. The rules would have had dev-astating impacts on job opportunities and on families in our State. The power rule would have doubled the utility bills in 10 or 12 years. I have been reminding Missourians over the last several months that if you do not think that is going to im-pact you when you pay your electric bill the next time, just write it right out of your checkbook one more time— write it—because that is what you would be doing sometime in the next decade and see what impact that has on the kinds of things you and your family would have been doing with the money that you would have been spending on twice your utility bill. A week ago, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt was in our State, at the Thomas Hill powerplant, to talk about how these rules would have affected the State and how one can still fulfill the mission of the EPA for clean air and clean water and a better environ-ment without having rules that dev-astate families as well as deal with problems, many of which have now been on the priority list for 10 years and longer and have never been dealt with, while the EPA has been coming up with something else to do. They would have driven up the cost of gro-ceries. They would have driven up the cost of the utility bill itself. Of course, when the utility bill goes up, the util-ity bill work goes up, too, and work might not be there at double the util-ity bill. The combined cost savings is esti-mated to be as high as $67.3 billion over the very foreseeable future of the Con-gressional Review Act, the President’s Executive orders, the announced deci-sions that they have made about things like the clean power rule and the waters of the United States rule. Even in Washington, $67.3 billion is a lot of money, not to mention the 52 million hours of paperwork that will be needed to comply with rules that were not necessary to be there and that Senator R
OUNDS mentioned. Our economy cannot grow and thrive with billions of dollars’ worth of regu-lations dragging it down. Let me say again that I am for every regulation that we absolutely have to have—there is no argument about that—but we need to have a process by which we know whether we have to have them. That is why, in the next few weeks, I plan to reintroduce the bipartisan Reg-ulatory Improvement Act, which the Congress looked at last year. This bill would create a Regulatory Improvement Commission that would review outdated regulations with the goal of bringing the list back to the Congress and saying that we think that these can all be eliminated. I have also cosponsored an act called the REINS Act, which would give me and the rest of the Congress the obliga-tion to vote on any regulation that has more than $100 million of impact on the economy so that if we need it, we are going to go home and justify it, and the American people—where I live and the Presiding Officer lives—can get their hands on us if we cannot explain why we thought it was a good idea to do that. I believe the government should work for the American people, not the other way around, and I believe the President and the Congress have taken advantage of this historic opportunity to drive that peg a little deeper in the ground. I look forward to continuing to work on these issues. I think we need to take more responsibility for these issues. I know some of our colleagues have said: Well, why did we repeal these late reg-ulations? Well, they were late regula-tions for a reason, and the country had done just fine without them up until now. So I look forward to working with the Presiding Officer and others to con-tinue working on this effort to have regulations that make sense when we need them and not to have regulations when we don’t need them. NORTHWEST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY  
BEARCATS CHAMPIONSHIPS  
Mr. President, I would also like to mention one more topic quickly. This is a very Missouri topic. The Northwest Missouri State Uni-versity Bearcats this year, in NCAA Division II, won both the football championship and the men’s basketball championship. It has been a long time in Division II when any school was able to bring both of those championships back to their campus. When I was a college president, we were in that conference, the MIAA, which is a competitive conference, and competitive enough that in that Divi-sion II level, the Bearcats brought home both of those championships. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
CONGRATULATING SNOWFLAKE JUNIOR HIGH  
SCHOOL  
Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I have spoken a lot in recent years about how Arizona is quickly becoming one of our country’s major tech hubs. From entre-preneurial startups to major tech-nology companies, Arizona is sup-porting innovation like never before. In fact, it was just announced that Waymo, Google’s self-driving car project, will be launching its first pub-lic trials of self-driving vehicles in the greater Phoenix area. But, today, the biggest news in tech isn’t coming from publicly traded Sil-icon Valley companies. No, today, the talk of the tech world is the students from my alma mater, Snowflake Jun-ior High School. That is because these students from my small hometown of Snowflake, AZ, just won the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow contest. This national contest tasks students from across the country with creating a solution to improve their local com-munities by using STEAM skills— Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math. The winning project from Mr. Eilertsen’s students is something spe-cial. Snowflake students designed and constructed a low-cost animal detec-tion system to prevent fatalities from vehicle collisions with wild animals. They were motivated by the fact that an estimated 200 people lose their lives each year in these collisions, which can be common around rural communities like Snowflake. The winning design consists of a 10- inch, weather-resistant motion sensor that blinks to warn drivers when a large animal is near. These durable, af-fordable sensors can be placed atop ex-isting fence posts like the thousands that line roads all over rural Arizona. I had the opportunity to meet with these very bright students—2 of them from a class of, I believe, 23—and those 2 are in the Gallery today, along with their teacher Mr. Eilertsen. I had the opportunity to meet with them yester-day in my office and to hear all about this winning project. Let me tell my colleagues that they blew me away with their creativity, their knowledge, and, most of all, their desire to use the STEAM discipline to save lives. Think about how remarkable this project is. Here is a device that can ac-tually save hundreds of lives and pre-vent harm to wildlife and to livestock. With the grit and ingenuity of a great startup, these students at Snowflake Junior High have shown the country that big ideas come from small towns. In recognition of their innovative project, the students won $150,000 in technology for their school and an ad-ditional $20,000 for having the most popular project on social media and with the public—not bad for some kids from Snowflake. Before I yield the floor, I would like to thank Mr. Eilertsen for all that he has done to inspire his students to think big and for making a victory in this Samsung competition possible. I would also like to thank all of the faculty and staff in Snowflake for their tireless work as educators. Finally, I would like to congratulate the students of Snowflake Junior High for their victory. I am confident that your project will save lives, and by winning this competition, you have provided your school with educational resources that will help students for years to come.

NAFTA  
Mr. President, we can’t simply ignore the benefits of NAFTA for the U.S. economy. Experts have said that more than one-quarter of global GDP—some $20.5 trillion—is produced in NAFTA’s combined markets of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Canada and Mexico are the largest export mar-kets for the United States. U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico has more than tripled since 1993, and that was before NAFTA came into effect. In 1993, U.S. foreign direct invest-ment in Mexico was slightly more than $15 billion. In 2016, it was more than $92 billion in foreign direct investment. NAFTA increased U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico by 350 percent, supporting U.S. farmers and ranchers like those back in Arizona. NAFTA has resulted in an integrated supply chain between the United States and other countries. For example, the Wall Street Journal reported that ‘‘tens of thousands of parts that make up a vehicle often come from multiple producers in dif-ferent countries and travel back and forth across borders several times.’’ Abandoning NAFTA would destroy these supply chains, making it harder for our country’s private sector em-ployers to grow and to do business. Arizona has certainly benefited from NAFTA. In 2016, Arizona’s trade with Mexico exceeded $15 billion. Total trade between Arizona and NAFTA countries reached nearly $20 billion last year. The Arizona Daily Star noted back in November that ‘‘trade with Mexico supports about 100,000 jobs in Arizona and retailers depend on roughly $8 mil-lion Mexican shoppers spend daily in Arizona.’’ The bottom line is that trade is good for American businesses, it is good for American workers, and it is good for American consumers. Trade deals like NAFTA make inputs for U.S. manufacturing cheaper than they would be otherwise. Cheaper in-puts mean lower production costs for U.S.-based businesses, which, in turn, allows these companies to expand pro-duction and to reduce prices. That means everyday consumer products are more affordable for middle-class fami-lies. If the protectionist trade policies of the past have taught us anything, it is that when we increase trade barriers, nobody wins. Do I agree that we should work to make U.S. businesses more competitive? Absolutely. Do I agree that we can modernize NAFTA? You bet. Pro-growth trade policies have been at the top of my list of priorities since I came to Congress. But any ef-forts to impose new restrictions on our ability to trade with Mexico and Can-ada will have serious consequences for Arizona, leading to jobs being lost and higher costs for consumers. If we just think, in 2003 total U.S. trade with Mexico was just around $50 billion. Today, it is between $500 billion and $600 billion. What is not to like about NAFTA? It is good for Americans. It is good for the Mexican economy. It is good for Canada. We have noted many times that with regard to border security, the net flow of Mexican migrant workers has been south, not north, over the past couple of years. One of the biggest reasons for that, obviously, is the Mexican econ-omy is doing better, and part of the biggest reason for that is because of NAFTA and their ability to trade. That is good for the United States. It is good for Mexico. Trade is not a zero sum game where one party wins and the other party loses. Free trade benefits everyone. I hope that we remember this as we look toward NAFTA’s future. We need to improve it and to modernize it, cer-tainly, but we shouldn’t abandon it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Colorado. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I just want to say, while the Senator from Arizona is still here, what a privilege it is to hear somebody come to this floor and actu-ally speak about facts as they actually are—economic facts, facts related to immigration. If we had more people in the Senate who spoke on the floor the way the Senator from Arizona just did, there is nothing we wouldn’t be able to accomplish together. It is a privilege to serve with him. It is a privilege to hear the clarity with which he spoke about these important issues. So I want to thank him through the Chair for that speech. 
ANTIQUITIES ACT  
Mr. President, at the close of the 19th century, many of our country’s—al-most all of our country’s—most his-toric sites were completely unpro-tected. Places like Chaco Canyon and Cliff Palace, home to some of the most ancient dwellings in North America, faced looting and desecration. So in 1906, Congress actually passed pieces of legislation and thought about the next generation of Americans. Congress acted to protect these places by pass-ing the Antiquities Act. The act em-powered Presidents to preserve sites of cultural and historic importance and protect our most spectacular land-scapes by designating them as national monuments using that authority. Teddy Roosevelt moved to protect places like Devil’s Tower, Muir Woods Forest, and even the Grand Canyon. Looking back, it is hard to imagine our country without those iconic places. It is hard to imagine our country without the legacy of those people who were thinking not between sound bites on the television but across generations. Since Teddy Roosevelt, administra-tions from both parties, Democratic and Republicans—he was a Republican, as it happens, but both parties have used the Antiquities Act to preserve places critical to our heritage, includ-ing the designation of Colorado Na-tional Monument in 1911. I just visited there. In Washington, we may differ over policies—sometimes sharply. There is no surprise that is true. But both par-ties have long risen above partisan squabbles of today to protect these spe-cial places for tomorrow. But with yes-terday’s Executive order, President Trump has upended that tradition by opening the door to attacks on our na-tional monuments for generations to come. I know there are people in this ad-ministration who have said they are ‘‘lifetime supporters and admirers of Teddy Roosevelt’s policies.’’ If they are, now is the time they need to be heard because today’s action is an of-fense to Teddy Roosevelt’s vision for America and threatens his bipartisan legacy of conservation. The adminis-tration’s latest Executive order initi-ates a review of all national monument designations since 1996 that are larger than 100,000 acres, with an interim re-port on its findings just 45 days later. I wonder if they know how long it takes to build a consensus in the West and in other places that a place is sacred enough that it should have one of these designations, and in 45 days they are going to threaten to disturb the work of people all over the West who have supported these designations. Speaking yesterday, President Trump justified this action by calling earlier monument designations an ‘‘egregious abuse of federal power.’’ I wonder what he would call a Wash-ington-led effort to undo protections for national monuments that enjoy deep support from communities all across the country, including in my State of Colorado? For all their rhetoric about Wash-ington overreach, this administration and its allies in Congress seem to have no problem substituting their rash judgment for the thoughtful, commu-nity-driven designations of national monuments across the United States of America. Had they studied this issue at all, they would have learned that exist-ing monument designations come from exhaustive consultation and hundreds of meetings over thousands of hours. Unlike this administration, western communities did our homework. We laid the groundwork and paved the way for these designations, which leads me to wonder what the administration’s review hopes to achieve. I would chal-lenge anybody in the Senate to come down here to this floor and explain ex-actly how this 45-day review will un-cover information that somehow our western communities missed. They can’t. They can’t because that is not the point of this review, which is no more than a Trojan horse for advanc-ing the agenda not of the West but for advancing the agenda of partisan think

tanks and politicians in Washington in-stead of the real-world interests of western communities. Worse, if the administration ulti-mately repeals national monument designations—which I hope they will not—as a result of this order, it would cause real economic pain to Western States, especially in rural areas. A re-cent study found that rural counties in the West with protected public lands saw jobs grow at a rate more than three times faster compared to areas without protected lands. It just makes sense. Just ask outfitters and guides near Browns Canyon, a national monu-ment, or local business owners around Chimney Rock, a national monument, what the effect has been on their busi-nesses. In fact, those businesses were huge champions of both those national monuments. You can go buy a beer in Pagosa Springs from a brewery that is brewing it and putting a label on it that says ‘‘Chimney Rock National Monument.’’ You can buy the beer and take it rafting through Browns Canyon with outfitters who strongly support the monument. National monuments not only pre-serve our heritage, they strengthen rural communities by supporting out-door economies and attracting visitors from around the country and around the world. We should be more encour-aging of that. Let’s do more of that. In-stead, this Executive order takes aim directly at our rural economies in the West. Look at this. As we can see here, na-tionwide, Americans spend $887 billion on the outdoor economy each year, supporting $65 billion in Federal tax revenue and 7.6 million American jobs which can’t be exported anywhere. There is not a country in the world that has a system of public lands like the United States of America and in particular the Western United States of America. There is not a country in the world that has what we have. If this administration really is seri-ous about creating jobs, strengthening our economy, and remaining faithful to the bipartisan legacy of Roosevelt, it should keep our national monuments intact and uphold the traditions hon-ored by every President since 1906. These are treasured places. Even though they have a huge value in dol-lars and cents, their value goes far be-yond the economic value. It goes to the heart of who we are as a nation. It goes to our cultural heritage and to the leg-acy we want to pass on from our grand-parents to our grandchildren. Teddy Roosevelt called conservation ‘‘a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of ensuring the safety and continuance of the nation.’’ We must do our duty, our patriotic duty, and I will use every tool at my disposal to protect the Antiquities Act and our national monuments because in the end our character as a nation is re-vealed in what we choose to preserve now and for generations to come. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, yes-terday President Trump issued an Ex-ecutive order that undermined the pro-tection of dozens of our national monu-ments that were established over the past two decades by three different Presidents. In continuing his adminis-tration’s war on our public lands, President Trump and Secretary of the Interior Zinke have attacked one of our Nation’s most prized conservation laws—the Antiquities Act, which gives the President the authority to protect our nationally important lands and waters on Federal land by designating them as national monuments. In the 111 years since the Antiquities Act was signed into law by President Teddy Roosevelt, 16 Presidents—8 Re-publicans and 8 Democrats—have used the law’s authority to designate over 150 national monuments. President Trump is trying to undo over 100 years of conservation in just a few days. Many of our Nation’s iconic national parks were first protected by using the authority of the Antiquities Act, in-cluding the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Glacier Bay, Joshua Tree, Zion, and in my home State of Washington, Mount Olympus National Monument, which later became Olympic National Park. No doubt Presidents of both parties have used the Antiquities Act to pre-serve the most beautiful places in our country. However, President Trump ap-pears to be very uninformed on the his-tory or the importance of the Antiq-uities Act. In his remarks signing the Executive order yesterday, he de-scribed the designation of national monuments as an ‘‘egregious use of fed-eral power’’ and vowed he would ‘‘give that power back to the States.’’ He truly does not understand the Antiq-uities Act, nor does he appreciate the bold leadership of all of those Presi-dents, both Democrats and Repub-licans, over a period of time—eight Re-publicans and eight Democrats—who have used this authority in an appro-priate way to preserve for all Ameri-cans in the future and those in the past who have enjoyed these beautiful places—and to preserve our access to public lands. I can’t tell you how important access to public lands is for schoolchildren, our returning veterans, our families, hunters, fishermen, and hikers. Put-ting the Antiquities Act and the mil-lions of acres of national monuments that have been protected back into the hands of a few who are more aligned with special interests to try to open these areas up to oil and gas explo-ration is the antithesis of what the An-tiquities Act is all about. We plan to continue to emphasize how wrong the President’s Executive order is. First and foremost, in the Executive order, the President directed the Sec-retary of the Interior to review the des-ignation or expansion of national monuments under the Antiquities Act where the Secretary deems that the designation or expansion was made without adequate public comment or coordination with relevant stake-holders. That literally gives the Sec-retary of the Interior broad authority to look at all the land that has pre-viously been designated since 1996 and potentially open it up to saying they are going to try to reverse that. There have been many discussions about the last 20 years of the designa-tion of some unbelievable, beautiful places in America that are so special— the Grand Staircase-Escalante Na-tional Monument in Utah, which is 1.7 million acres; the Grand Canyon- Parashant National Monument in Ari-zona; the Giant Sequoia National Monument in California; the Canyon of Ancients National Monument in Colo-rado—I know my colleague Senator B
ENNET from Colorado was speaking about it earlier; Hanford Reach Na-tional Monument in Washington, which covers 195,000 acres; the Ironwood For-est National Monument in Arizona; the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in Arizona; the Carrizo Plain National Monument in California; the Sonoran Desert National Monument in Arizona; the Upper Missouri River Breaks Na-tional Monument in Montana; the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument in New Mexico, on which my colleague Senator H
EINRICH worked so hard; the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks Na-tional Monument, also in New Mexico; the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument in California; the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument in California; the Basin and Range Na-tional Monument in Nevada; the Mo-jave Trails National Monument in Cali-fornia; the Sand to Snow National Monument in California; Bears Ears, as I have mentioned, in Utah; and the Gold Butte National Monument in Ne-vada. That sounds like a lot of designa-tions that we have made over the last 20 years. Presidents were very judi-cious about those designations. It took a lot of public comment, many commu-nity meetings, and a lot of scientific analysis about the preservation of these areas. The end result is that for these generations and future genera-tions, national monuments have been designated on public lands that are in our national interests. This has been so important to us as a nation. As I said, places like the Grand Canyon, Olympic National Park in my State—many places have created what has become an outdoor recreation economy. That outdoor recreation economy is now over $800 billion of an-nual revenue and dwarfs what the oil and gas industry represents as an econ-omy of the future. In fact, this indus-try sector is on par to compete with

other large sectors of our economy— the financial service sector and the healthcare sector. So why are we tak-ing away the very tool that has launched so much outdoor activity and a burgeoning job economy, with 7 mil-lion outdoor industry workers? Why are we taking away national monu-ment designations that have been the priority of past Presidents and trying to return them because someone doesn’t understand what the Antiq-uities Act is all about? In addition to those large monu-ments that I just mentioned, also under review will be a group of other monuments that are marine national monuments. Yes, according to the defi-nition I mentioned earlier, Secretary Zinke could review all of these monu-ments. In fact, I noticed that there were several people at the President’s signing who represented some of these monuments. I don’t know if they are urging the President to remove their areas, but it raises great concern about how important these marine monu-ments have been. There is the Papaha´naumokua´kea marine national monument in the Ha-waiian islands that was established in 2006; the World War II Valor in the Pa-cific National Monument, also in Ha-waii; the Rose Atoll National Monu-ment in American Samoa; the Pacific Remote Islands National Monument in Hawaii; the Marianas Trench National Monument in the Mariana Islands; and the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the At-lantic. In addition to all of those maritime national monuments of grand scale, these also under consideration are an additional two dozen or so—I think it looks like 25—smaller national monu-ments that could also be reviewed by the Secretary of the Interior. Even though they were designated with this Presidential authority, in previous ad-ministrations after great review, they could, by this President and this Inte-rior Secretary, be wiped away very quickly. We definitely do not believe the President has this legal authority, and we will pursue a vigorous fight. Why should we be wasting taxpayers’ money when taxpayers’ money was already spent to make these designations, and the taxpayer is getting the huge eco-nomic benefit of having these outdoor areas? What else could be on the President’s list according to this Executive order? The California Coastal National Monu-ment; Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument; President Lincoln and Sol-dier’s Home National Monument in Washington, DC; Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument in New Mexico; Minidoka National Historic Site in Idaho; Pompeys Pillar National Monument in Montana; Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument; Gov-ernors Island National Monument in New York; the African Burial Ground National Monument in New York; Fort Monroe National Monument in Vir-ginia; Fort Ord National Monument in California; Chimney Rock National Monument in Colorado; the Cesar Cha-vez National Monument in California; San Juan Islands National Monument in the State of Washington; the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Na-tional Monument; the First State Na-tional Historic Park in Delaware; the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers Monu-ment; the Honouliuli National Monu-ment in Hawaii; the Pullman National Monument in Illinois; Browns Canyon National Monument in Colorado; Waco Mammoth National Monument in Texas; Castle Mountains National Monument in California; the Belmont- Paul Women’s Equality National Monument; Stonewall National Monu-ment in New York; the Birmingham Civil Rights Monument in Alabama; the Freedom Riders National Monu-ment in Alabama; and the Reconstruc-tion Era National Monument in South Carolina. The Executive order says the Sec-retary of the Interior can review any national monument designation since 1996 ‘‘Where the Secretary determines that the designation or expansion was made without adequate public outreach and coordination with relevant stake-holders.’’ The Executive order says that for any national monument on the list I just mentioned, the Secretary of the Interior could decide there was not ap-propriate public outreach. Even though the process used by Presidents under the Antiquities Act makes sure you have that, this Secretary could decide there wasn’t enough and recommend to undo any of these monuments and eliminate access to the public for the purposes of recreation and enjoyment. So this administration has it dead wrong. He is no Teddy Roosevelt. In fact, I saw he had a press conference with a statue of Teddy Roosevelt be-hind him. Teddy Roosevelt would be appalled because his concept of pre-serving Federal land was so important. Teddy Roosevelt was an outdoorsman who spent many a time in these great places of our Nation and understood their great significance. That is why we have the Antiquities Act. He knew that these resources strengthened our country. They made us strong as a na-tion. They show the crown jewels of the United States of America in all their glory and beauty. He knew it was important to protect them for future generations to enjoy, not just for the special interests to take advantage of in the near term. We have a lot of Federal land and off-shore land that is used for resource ex-ploration and development. As people know, natural gas is at an all-time high in the United States and driving an all-time low price. It is not as if you need access to Bears Ears National Monument to drive down the price of natural gas or other fossil fuel. What you are going to do by pursuing this wrongheaded approach on Bears Ears is take away one of the historic and beau-tiful archaeological histories of Native Americans and early Americans in the United States—and an area that has excellent outdoor recreation opportu-nities—and throw it, along with the concept of the Antiquities Act, over the side just because someone wants to try to reverse what our previous Presi-dents, starting with Teddy Roosevelt, have done to protect these monuments in our national interest. Representing a State where we have several counties that have lots of Fed-eral land, whether forest lands or BLM lands, I know that it can be chal-lenging for local communities to main-tain the infrastructure, the education, the hospitals, the law enforcement. I am a big believer in making sure that what are called PILT payments and the Secure Rural School Program are well funded and financed to make sure that these communities can be there to help us support these public lands. But the notion that with one act we would throw in Teddy Roosevelt’s face all of these national monuments and now say that we are going to try to use it in re-verse to review the work in the near term, of 3 different Presidents who used this authority is simply wrong-headed. What we need to do is embrace the outdoor economy. As I said, it is 7 mil-lion jobs with over $800 billion of eco-nomic activity. In fact, since the last time they did their report, there has been a $200 billion annual increase in the economic impact in the United States of America. What great news. An industry and sector, particularly in retail, is growing by leaps and bounds. It is an industry that is providing peo-ple with more tools and opportunity to enjoy our beautiful places. The only thing we can do to screw that up is start taking away the beautiful places where people go to recreate. I would say we should be examining how well these areas we have protected are being used and figure out how we can con-tinue to communicate to the general public about these wonderful experi-ences. Do not think for one minute that the American people in their souls are not connected to the spiritual nature of these beautiful lands. They are. And that is what Teddy Roosevelt knew. He knew this is where we go to rejuvenate. Let’s not take it away for some oil and gas exploration. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S

Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, as we approach yet another deadline to con-tinue funding for the government, I rise to speak today regarding my frus-tration and disappointment that Con-gress is once again kicking the can down the road. I am frustrated that I keep having to have this same con-versation with my colleagues. I am dis-appointed in the lack of responsibility of everyone here in Washington, DC, to

do their job. Washington, DC, is the only place I can think of where people believe it is OK not to do their job, miss their deadlines, make up a new deadline, and then repeat that same process year after year after year. I am upset that continually I have to remind everyone in Congress that the most basic responsibility that we have is to pass a budget and all of the appro-priations bills and we should do it on time. It seems like Members of Con-gress now depend on the countdown clock at the bottom of every news channel to remind them to do their job. Here we are, 4 months into 2017, and we still have not completed the appro-priations process that was supposed to have been done half a year ago. If that is not bad enough, we only have 15 leg-islative weeks left to finish funding for the next fiscal year. My colleagues, I believe we are setting ourselves up for failure. Washington is a consequence-free zone. That is why I will continue to ad-vocate for my No Budget, No Pay Act. I have personally never seen Congress pass all 12 appropriations bills on time, on their own, without an omnibus or a CRomnibus. Regardless of who is in the majority, regardless of who is in the minority, my No Budget, No Pay legis-lation says that if Members of Congress do not pass an annual concurrent bi-partisan budget resolution and all 12 spending bills on time, each year, then, they should not get paid. Let me repeat that last part. If Con-gress fails to pass all 12 spending bills on time each year, then, they should not get paid. The American public is just as frustrated as I am. Since I have introduced No Budget, No Pay, I have been getting some much positive sup-port for this idea. A woman by the name of Patricia from Fernley, NV, wrote to say No Budget, No Pay is long overdue. Dorothy from Henderson, NV, wrote me to say No Budget, No Pay is a won-derful solution. Just last week, speak-ing in Reno, NV, I was asked when Con-gress is going to finally pass the No Budget, No Pay Act. Until the No Budget, No Pay Act is passed into law, I don’t see any other way to motivate Members of Congress to do their job and avoid these continuing resolutions in the future. I cannot support a CR that just boots our problems to another day without enacting the principles that are out-lined in my No Budget, No Pay Act. There are important issues that need to be addressed through the appropria-tions process. For my home State of Nevada, we are looking at proposals from this new administration to cut funding to vitally important programs, such as the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, better known as SNPLMA, or payments in lieu of taxes, better known as the PILT pro-gram. While these programs may not mean much to some of my colleagues, for Ne-vada they are vitally important to en-suring economic viability and competi-tiveness for our State. Moreover, Ne-vada has been a good steward of these dollars by utilizing them for job-cre-ating projects within my State. By taking up individual appropria-tions bills and engaging in debate on programs important to particular agencies, Members have the oppor-tunity to fight for priorities that are important to their State. Right now, I am fighting to fund these programs. Sometimes this fight needs to ensure certain programs are not funded be-cause they are a waste of taxpayer dol-lars, like Yucca Mountain. I cannot say it enough times for my colleagues: Congress should not provide any fund-ing to this failed project that has al-ready wasted so many taxpayer dollars. Nevada will not be a federally sub-sidized national nuclear waste dump, plain and simple. If I can repeat that. Nevada will not be a federally sub-sidized national nuclear waste dump, plain and simple. Without exercising the power of the purse, which my No Budget, No Pay legislation ensures, we will all be right back here in a week, a month, or several months, making the same speeches, taking the same votes over and over. So I would like to say to any of my colleagues who are tired of these con-tinuing resolutions, regardless of what specific issues they are fighting for, to support the No Budget, No Pay Act. I believe the Congress can work again, but it will take some of that account-ability—like the No Budget, No Pay Act—to get us there. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT  
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about legislation to give our economy a shot in the arm and to help raise wages for Americans all across our country. When I am back home, whether it is at a small auto body shop or whether it is at a big steel plant or whether it is at a soybean farm, I hear the same thing, which is people coming up to me and saying: Hey, R
OB, with all of these regulations coming from Washington, I would love to hire more people, but I am spending too much time and money trying to keep up with these regula-tions. I think that is true with every Mem-ber here, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, when you are back home talking to people. They get frus-trated. Sometimes it is local and State regulations as well, but a lot of them are coming from the Federal Govern-ment. One example would be the Whitacre Greer Company, which makes bricks. It is a small family-owned business in Al-liance, OH, just outside of Youngstown. They told me recently that complying with just one regulation is now costing this small company almost a million bucks a year that they don’t have. They have had to go out and borrow the money, and that has been difficult for them. The cost of just complying with this one new regulation is about 10 percent of their annual revenue. Otherwise, that roughly million bucks would have been invested, they say, in plant, equipment and people. In other words, they would be able to create more jobs and modernize their facility if not for that compliance cost. They are not alone. It is happening all over Ohio and across the country. Costly regulations are causing compa-nies to pull back on expanding jobs and creating more opportunity for the peo-ple we represent. Look, regulation has its place. There is no question about it. We need regula-tions. I think everybody acknowledges that. It has a proper role. We need rea-sonable laws that protect our health and the environment and prevent dis-honest business practices. But let’s make sure that, as we regulate more and more and more, we have smart reg-ulations—regulations that make sense and that don’t affect these small busi-nesses, as I talked about with this brick company in Alliance, OH. The reality today is that a lot of Fed-eral regulations are more extensive in scope, more expensive to these compa-nies—and, therefore, these workers— more unpredictable than they have to be to meet whatever the policy objec-tives are. So Congress writes a law, and we have certain policy objectives, but then the regulators take that and they change the spirit of the congressional law instead of meeting that objective in the most cost-effective way possible. So I get that from my constituents, and the question is this: What do we do about it? The other thing I hear about is the fact that regulators aren’t accessible. People don’t feel like they have any in-fluence over it. By keeping new businesses from starting and small businesses from growing, regulations are just making it harder for people to be able to make a living. So how did we get here? Why are reg-ulations so expensive and so burden-some on workers and jobs? I think a big reason is the way the Federal Gov-ernment goes about writing regula-tions. Too often the process is unac-countable to the people. Too often it is based on sloppy or even bad informa-tion. The current law that gives us the basic framework for all this process is called the Administrative Procedure Act. This has been around for a long time. But guess what. It has not been reformed in any significant way in 70 years. The APA, or the Administrative Pro-cedure Act, is something I have studied

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2583 April 27, 2017 
in law school, as did other people here in this Chamber. It is something that you would expect to sort of change with the times, but it simply hasn’t. That doesn’t make sense. Imagine if we didn’t update our healthcare laws for 70 years. We are talking right now about updating the healthcare laws that were passed 7 years ago. Imagine if we didn’t update our immigration laws for 70 years. Imagine if we didn’t update our crimi-nal laws for 70 years. You know, the world changes. It just doesn’t make any sense not to update our regulation policy because we live in a growing and dynamic economy. Things are chang-ing, and we have changed a lot in the last 70 years. We didn’t have things like microwave ovens or color TVs, and our economy was 10 percent the size of what it is today. Yet we are still using the same regulatory process that was put in place for a totally different kind of economy. By the way, in 70 years, we have also learned a lot about how to regulate in a way that it is more cost effective and more efficient, and we need to put that into practice. So a reform of our regu-latory process, in my view, is long overdue. So far this year, we have taken some steps here in the Congress to give small businesses very specific regulatory re-lief by rescinding some of the recent regulations that the Obama adminis-tration had promulgated. We have done this about 10 times now with what is called the congressional review proc-ess. It is estimated that this has saved the economy a total of $65 billion in regulatory costs and about 45 million hours of paperwork. I have supported most of these Con-gressional Review Act bills because I think they make sense. But this is just a handful of recent regulations. We have only addressed a few of the symp-toms, not the underlying cause. We still have to deal with the underlying problem of the way regulations get made. If we don’t do that, the regu-latory burden will just continue to in-crease. By the way, this should be true whether it is a Republican administra-tion or a Democratic administration. The same rules ought to apply. All of this is why yesterday Senator H
EIDI HEITKAMP from North Dakota and I introduced bipartisan legislation called the Regulatory Accountability Act, or the RAA, which would put in place some really important and very reasonable safeguards on the regu-latory process to get better outcomes. Every President since Ronald Reagan—Republican and Democrat alike—has agreed with the idea that regulatory agencies should estimate the costs and the benefits of something that we all accept. So they put this into what are called Executive orders saying that they have to go through the cost-benefit analysis the same way that your family does and that families in Ohio do when they make a decision as to whether to buy that car or wheth-er they can afford to send their kids to college. They figure out what it will cost and what the benefit will be. That has to go into regulations. Although every President from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama has agreed on the need for that, it has never been put into law. The first thing this legislation does is very simple. The Regulatory Ac-countability Act—the RAA—says that there should be a law, we should codify the practice so that businesses have the predictability of knowing that reg-ulations are going to continue to use that commonsense cost-benefit prac-tice. The Regulatory Accountability Act would then take the next step of re-quiring regulatory agencies, once they have figured out the costs and benefits of these proposals, to choose the most cost-effective way to achieve their pol-icy objectives. That is common sense, right? It is not done now. This is a big change and an important part of the legislation. Again, it is the same thing people do every day with their fami-lies. When they are deciding where they are going to go to school or what brand of milk they are going to choose, they go through that kind of analysis. Let’s find the most cost-effective way to accomplish the goal, one that costs less and has the least impact on the ability to create jobs. As I said before, a lot of regulations are expensive. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, from 2009 to 2014, in those 5 years, the Federal Government published more than 80 major rules a year, every year. A major rule costs the economy more than $100 million a year, and there have been 80 a year. For these major rules, the RAA would let stakeholders ask a court to review the cost-benefit analysis used by the regulators, so that we ensure that agencies are using the best infor-mation available, not relying on faulty information or making mistakes. That seems fair to me, that we should have some process to make sure they are doing the right thing. This is going to have a huge impact on regulations. The RAA makes regulators more ac-countable by bringing the public into the process. When folks talk about reg-ulations, a lot of the time, their con-cern is that they feel they are cut off from the process. Although they can come to me or their other elected offi-cials and state their concerns about this or that law, they have no access to the regulators. They are not elected; they don’t feel as if they are account-able. They can’t complain to them, and there is no influence if they do. So under the RAA, agencies would have to listen to public comments and proposals before making a decision. Again, this is an important change. In-stead of waiting until after the deci-sion has been made and potentially triggering years of litigation, the RAA would move up that process. An ounce of prevention, my colleagues, is worth at least a pound of cure. It is a lot bet-ter for our companies and for job cre-ation to put some time into the effort upfront to get it right than to have to fix it later. I think it is better for the regulatory process and better for a smart regulatory process in terms of taking our laws and putting them into practice. So the RAA requires agencies to choose the most cost-effective regula-tions, creates more accountability by involving the public, ensures we are using better information, and takes ex-isting practice and puts it into law. Ul-timately, this is going to make smart-er rules with better outcomes and will give us a better environment for cre-ating more jobs with better wages. The RAA will free up more resources for small businesses to hire more people, raise wages, and purchase more equip-ment. That will boost economic growth and benefit all of us. There are some critics who have sug-gested that this bill will kill the regu-latory process and prevent new regula-tions from being issued, but clearly they have not read the bill. The reason this bill is bipartisan is because it gives the American people a voice in the regulatory process and it makes it more effective for both our economy and for our health and safety. That is the kind of commonsense regulatory process that hard-working taxpayers expect and deserve from their govern-ment. We have a lot of support for this bill from workers all over the country and from a wide variety of industries, in-cluding organizations representing truckers, farmers, electricians, and manufacturers. It is a bipartisan bill because it is a common-ground bill. It is a middle-ground bill. I first introduced the RAA 6 years ago, and it has passed the House of Representatives five times. By the way, on one of those stand-alone votes, 19 Democrats in the House supported it. Some Democrats who serve in the Senate today have supported it in the past; they were House Members then. By the way, that was when the regu-latory burden was less of a problem than it is today. I have always had Democratic cosponsors of the RAA when I have introduced it here in the Senate. I am happy to have Senator H
EITKAMP , Senator M ANCHIN , and Sen-ator H
ATCH as the original cosponsors to this legislation because this idea is needed now more than ever. It is a great opportunity to break through the partisan gridlock and get something that creates more jobs, raises wages, and makes a difference in people’s lives. I think that is what the Amer-ican people are looking for. That is what my neighbors in Ohio tell me. They want us to get stuff done to help families. I urge my colleagues to join Senator H

TRIBUTE TO JOHN STRAAYER  
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, in Denver today, the Colorado General Assembly will gather to pay tribute to Colorado State University professor John Straayer, whose 50-year teaching career included 37 years of managing a legislative intern program during the spring semester. Every Tuesday and Thursday, rain or snow, Dr. Straayer, a van or two, and an over caffeinated, sleep-deprived, ambitious crew of col-lege juniors and seniors would travel to Denver from Fort Collins under the tu-telage of Dr. Straayer to learn the ‘‘art of legislation.’’ After publishing several seminal books on Colorado politics, accumu-lating roughly 140,000 miles back and forth to the State capitol, and super-vising over 1,000 interns over the years, he is retiring from his service as Colo-rado’s legislative professor emeritus. Dr. Straayer has a true love of poli-tics—the process, the policy, the peo-ple, and the place. He has a passion for every ounce of it, the kind of healthy obsession with a place that means so much to the lives of its citizens. He has seen it all—the good and the bad, the fights and the endearing moments. He watched the impacts of constitutional battles, term limits, and reforms, and 50 years later, he has never lost his passion. To be a part of his intern program, students were required to take his class on the legislative process. As a young CSU Ram myself, I remember his class vividly, absorbing his drive and drawn into the intrigue of policy. We talked about the cowboy coalition and the Sagebrush Rebellion; about Speaker Bev Bledsoe and Roy Romer; about Anne Burford, who served in the legislature as one of the self-identified ‘‘House Crazies,’’ who in the 1980s be-came known as Ronald Reagan’s EPA Administrator but who this past month became known as Neil Gorsuch’s mom. We talked about the high-water mark of rural power and the rise of the sub-urban legislator. Dr. Straayer introduced new genera-tions of students to oatmeal with va-nilla ice cream and topped with maple syrup. Dr. Straayer introduced people to public service, including congressional and legislative staffers and many mem-bers of my own staff. According to a re-cent article in the Denver Post, those staffers and interns included former Democratic Governor Bill Ritter, Democratic State Senator Matt Jones, and Republican State Representative Dan Nordberg. They were all proteges of Dr. Straayer’s. The article goes on to state that Straayer had arranged these internships, monitored them, and graded the reports of their experiences. Dozens of Straayer interns have risen to high electoral office or become key legislative lobbyists—and not just in Colorado; one of his former students is a city alderman in Chicago. I remember visiting Dr. Straayer when I first joined the program and was getting ready to be assigned to a legislator. When I received the assign-ment, I was disappointed to learn that I hadn’t been appointed to the legis-lator I was hoping to be assigned to. In-stead, I was assigned to a legislator from the Western Slope of Colorado. I am from the Eastern Plains, and I wasn’t used to the Western Slope issues. Soon I would discover that Dr. Straayer had placed me with an incred-ible legislator named Russell George, who went on to become Colorado’s speaker of the house—an individual who Dr. Straayer knew would be an in-credible tutor and an inspiration to me. Dr. Straayer was right. Speaker George taught me about issues I work on each and every day here in the U.S. Senate—about public lands, water, and the West. He was and is an inspiration to me, and it is because Dr. Straayer had the discernment to go above and beyond for his students. After graduation, Dr. Straayer in-vited me to speak to his class and later would tease me in the State legislature that perhaps I talked too much from the well. He provided me interns from the very same program I was a part of 10 years before. Most of all, he re-minded me of the good that comes from our teachers and mentors, those who look out for us because, from a special place in their heart, they know that through the gift of their teaching, they will have a lasting impact for genera-tions to come. Congratulations, Dr. Straayer. Thank you for your service to Colorado State University and to the State of Colorado, and thank you for impacting the lives of so many people. From this U.S. Senator, thanks for being that life-changing spark. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
CLIMATE CHANGE  
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, on Monday night we confirmed former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue to be President Trump’s Secretary of Agri-culture, and I am here for my 164th ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ speech to urge Secretary Perdue to listen to his agen-cy, to scientific researchers in farm States across the country, to our major food and agricultural producers, and to farmers, fishermen, ranchers, and for-esters about the serious and growing effects of climate change. Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is changing the atmosphere and the oceans. We see it everywhere. We see it on drought-stricken farms and in raging wildfires. We see it in fish that are disappearing from warming, acidifying waters. We see it in our dying pine forests. We see it in extreme weather events. Secretary Perdue is taking the helm of an agency with a key role in miti-gating those very effects. The USDA provides farmers, foresters, commod-ities markets, and State and local offi-cials with analyses of trends and emerging issues affecting agriculture, the food supply, the environment, and rural communities. In its own Climate Change Adaptation Plan, the Depart-ment notes: ‘‘Climate change has the potential to confound USDA efforts to meet these core obligations and respon-sibilities to the Nation.’’ During his tenure as Governor, Sec-retary Perdue issued a State energy strategy, stating: ‘‘Strong scientific evidence exists that increasing emis-sions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are affecting Earth’s climate.’’ That is encouraging. Yet, when asked by Senator LEAHY about climate change during the Secretary’s con-firmation process, he backpedaled and said: ‘‘It is clear that the climate has been changing,’’ but there is ‘‘signifi-cant debate within the scientific com-munity’’ on whether human activities play a role in that. Whoops, that is the classic denier dodge, and it is just not true. Secretary Perdue said several times during his confirmation process that he will use the ‘‘best scientific and statis-tical data available’’ to make deci-sions. The National Climate Assess-ment uses the ‘‘best scientific and sta-tistical data’’ to conclude this: ‘‘In the long term, combined stresses associ-ated with climate change are expected to decrease agricultural productivity.’’ In the Midwest, for instance, the Na-tional Climate Assessment reports that temperatures are increasing, and the rate of warming tripled between 1980 and 2010. Under the assessment’s worst- case scenarios, temperatures across the Midwest are projected to rise 8.5 de-grees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. If you are a farmer, 8.5 degrees changes everything. In the western mountains, massive forests stand dead on the mountain-sides as warmer winters allow the kill-er bark beetle to swarm into higher latitudes and higher altitudes. Over 82 million acres of national forests are under stress from fires, these insects, or both. Ominously, the assessment says that the combined effect of in-creasing wildfire, insect outbreaks, and diseases is expected to cause an ‘‘al-most complete loss of subalpine for-ests.’’ The cost to taxpayers of fighting fires in those dead and dying forests is growing dramatically. Firefighting has gone from just 13 percent of the Forest Service’s budget in 2004 to over 50 per-cent in 2015. The Forest Service esti-mates that by 2025 fighting fires will take up to two-thirds of its budget.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2585 April 27, 2017 
Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell tes-tified to the Senate: ‘‘This increase in the cost of wildland fire suppression is subsuming the agency’s budget and jeopardizing its ability to implement its full mission.’’ One place Secretary Perdue can go to find out a little bit about this is from our State universities. The University of Wyoming’s Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geo-physics, for example, reports: ‘‘Many of the most pressing issues facing the Western United States hinge on the fate and transport of water and its re-sponse to diverse disturbances, includ-ing climate change.’’ At Kansas State University, pro-fessor of agronomy Charles Rice is using climate modeling to help antici-pate climate effects in the Great Plains and to help the region mitigate and adapt to those effects. In Wisconsin, Victor Cabrera, an as-sistant professor in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Dairy Science De-partment, says that higher summer temperatures and increasing drought will interfere with both livestock fer-tility and milk production, and dairy cows could give as much as 10 percent less milk. Secretary Perdue’s own De-partment of Agriculture predicts that by 2030 climate change will cost the United States’ dairy sector between $79 million and $199 million per year in lost production. South Dakota State University pro-fessor Mark Cochrane is working with the Forest Service to better under-stand how a changing climate is affect-ing our forests. Professor Cochrane re-ported: ‘‘Forest fire seasons worldwide increased by 18.7 percent due to more rain-free days and hotter tempera-tures.’’ Secretary Perdue could travel to Iowa and hear from Gene Takle, an Iowa State University professor of agronomy and geological and atmos-pheric sciences, who told a United Na-tions conference recently that climate change is already affecting Iowa farm-ers. ‘‘This isn’t just about the distant future,’’ he said. At Iowa State’s Leopold Center for Sustainable Agri-culture, Secretary Perdue could also hear about what the center calls ‘‘ag-gravated and unpredictable risk that will challenge the security of our agri-cultural and biological systems.’’ I am from the Ocean State. So let’s turn to the oceans, where the National Climate Assessment predicts: ‘‘Fishing costs are predicted to increase as fish-eries transition to new species and as processing plants and fishing jobs shift poleward.’’ In the Pacific Northwest, ocean acidification caused a 70-percent loss of oyster larvae from 2006 to 2008 at an oyster hatchery in Oregon. Wild oyster stocks in Washington State have failed as weather patterns have brought more acidic water to the shore. This is an industry worth about $73 million annually. So we ought not to laugh this off. In Alaska, the University of Alaska has an Ocean Acidification Research Center. That is how seriously they take it. The Ocean Acidification Re-search Center warns that ocean acidifi-cation ‘‘has the potential to disrupt (the Alaskan seafood) industry from top to bottom’’—a top-to-bottom dis-ruption of one of Alaska’s major indus-tries, and we cannot get a word on cli-mate change out of the Republican side of the aisle in this building. It is, of course, not just scientists. Some of the largest agriculture and food companies are speaking out as well. For these companies, climate change is not a partisan issue. It is not even a political issue. It is a business survival issue. It is their new reality. In 2015, major food and beverage com-panies visited Congress to tell us how climate change is affecting their indus-try. ‘‘Climate really matters to our busi-ness,’’ said Kim Nelson, of General Mills. ‘‘We fundamentally rely on Mother Nature.’’ The choices we make to protect or forsake our climate, she said, will be ‘‘important to the long- term viability of our company and our industry.’’ Paul Bakus, of Nestle, agreed, saying that climate change ‘‘is impacting our business today.’’ His company cans pumpkins under the Libby’s brand. They have seen pumpkin yields crash in the United States. Mr. Bakus told us: ‘‘We have never seen growing and harvesting conditions like this in the Midwest.’’ Chief sustainability officer for the Mars Corporation, Barry Parkin, was blunter in his assessment: ‘‘We are on a path to a dangerous place.’’ Greg Page, the former CEO of Cargill, has publicly stated that climate change must be addressed to prevent future food shortages. Specifically, he said: 
U.S. production of corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton could decline by 14 percent by mid-century, and by as much as 42 percent by late century. From an agricultural stand-point, we have to prepare ourselves for a dif-ferent climate than we have today. 
In advance of the Paris climate con-ference, the heads of Mars, General Mills, Nestle USA, Unilever, Kellogg Company, New Belgium Brewing, Ben & Jerry’s, Cliff Bar, Stonyfield Farm, Danone Dairy, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Hershey, and Hain Celestial signed a public letter—this one here—that said: 
Climate change is bad for farmers and agri-culture. Drought, flooding, and hotter grow-ing conditions threaten the world’s food sup-ply and contribute to food insecurity. 
They continued: 
Now is the time to meaningfully address the reality of climate change. . . . We are ready to meet the climate challenges that face our businesses. 
These big, successful companies don’t take climate change lightly, and nei-ther do our farmers, loggers, ranchers, and fishermen. In South Carolina, farms that have been in families for generations, like that of Representative M
ARK SAN-
FORD ’s, are under threat from climate change. Congressman SANFORD said: ‘‘At our family farm in Beaufort, I’ve watched over the last 50 years as sea levels have risen and affected salt edges of the farm.’’ Out West, ranchers are experiencing longer and more severe droughts. In a 2012 survey of Southern Colorado ranchers, roughly one-quarter of re-spondents said they would likely leave the industry if the drought persisted. Carlyle Currier, who owns a ranch in Molina, CO, said: ‘‘We just can’t grow enough to feed the cattle ourselves.’’ In New Hampshire, Jamey French, President of Northland Forest Prod-ucts, has seen hardwood tree species begin to migrate, with less valuable timber trees like oak and hickory be-ginning to take the place of sugar maple and yellow birch. I sure hope Secretary Purdue will come to Rhode Island and meet our fishermen. Chris Brown is the owner of Brown Family Seafood and the presi-dent of the Rhode Island Commercial Fishermen’s Association. He has fished in the waters of Rhode Island Sound for years: ‘‘We used to come right here and catch two, three, four thousand pounds [of whiting] a day, sometimes 10,’’ he told the New York Times. But the whiting have moved north to cooler waters. ‘‘Climate change is going to make it hard on some of those species that are not particularly fond of warm or warming waters,’’ Chris said. And he is not alone. I have been told by other fishermen that it is getting weird out there in Rhode Island’s waters, that this is not our grand-fathers’ ocean. These changes are seri-ous for this industry. So I hope Secretary Perdue will hear the message of our farmers, foresters, ranchers, and fishermen. They are sending this message loud and clear. Climate change is happening now, and they count on us to face the challenge. The problem, of course, is the fossil fuel-funded denial machine that has so much influence over the Republican Party in Congress today. That fossil fuel-funded denial machine will do its best to change the subject, to muddy the waters, to create artificial doubt, and to use its anonymous dark polit-ical money to break up and thwart any signs of progress, but all the dark money in the world can’t change the things that Iowa farmers, Wyoming ranchers, South Dakota forest man-agers, and Rhode Island fishermen see. If this body—if our Republican friends here—will not listen to Mars Corporation, to General Mills, to Nes-tle USA, to Unilever, to Kellogg, to Coke and Pepsi and Hershey, it is real-ly time to wake up.

INCREASING THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS  
AFFAIRS ACCOUNTABILITY TO VETERANS ACT  
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, this afternoon, the President will be signing an Executive order to increase ac-countability within the Department of Veterans Affairs. For several years, I have been calling on the VA to hold bad actors within the VA accountable. In my view, in too many instances, that has not occurred. There are far too many examples of those who com-mit wrongdoing while working at the VA, and even crimes against veterans and other VA employees have occurred without any consequence. On his first day in office, I wrote the President urging him to make account-ability within the Department of Vet-erans Affairs one of his top priorities. We see too many examples, and unfor-tunately one of those examples—one of those egregious examples—is in my home State of Kansas, where we face a terrible example of a VA employee vio-lating the trust of veterans. Yet the VA seems to have no real sense of ur-gency in holding this person account-able or committing to fix the process by which he got into the position that he could commit the acts he did. In 2015, we learned from local news-paper reports—not from the VA—that a physician’s assistant at the Leaven-worth VA hospital had been sexually abusing veterans. Shortly after that news broke, Leavenworth County pros-ecutors charged this individual with multiple counts of sexual assault and abuse against numerous veterans. He is currently awaiting trial. The stories continue to come into our office and to the prosecutor about other victims. Veterans who sought services at the VA—the place they would expect to be cared for, respected, and the place they certainly should find safe—found something exactly the opposite. As the story unfolded, we learned that Mr. Wisner—the person now charged with crimes—targeted vulner-able veterans suffering from PTSD, post-traumatic stress syndrome; he prescribed opioids that inhibited their thinking, and he used his position to deepen their wounds of war rather than to heal them. Although Mr. Wisner is now beyond the reach of the VA, he and others like him who fail our veterans are not be-yond the reach of Congress. It is ridicu-lous that taxpayers continue to fund pensions of VA senior executives and personnel convicted of crimes that harmed our Nation’s veterans when they should have been serving and car-ing for them. In the last Congress, we led signifi-cant efforts to develop, introduce, and pass legislation. Most of those efforts were with the Senator from Con-necticut, Mr. BLUMENTHAL , and we passed some legislation unanimously here in the Senate. That legislation in-creases the accountability of the De-partment of Veterans Affairs to make certain that senior VA executives and certain healthcare employees con-victed of a felony do not receive the same benefits as those who diligently and honorably serve our Nation’s vet-erans. Not as an aside but as a separate sen-tence, let me take this moment to say thank you to those people within the Department of Veterans Affairs who conscientiously care for and fulfill their responsibilities to our Nation’s veterans each and every day. How sad-dening it must be that they have to work side by side with people who com-mit crimes—and other failures for our veterans—and receive no consequence for that behavior. We want to protect our veterans. We also want to make sure that those who work at the Department of Veterans Affairs know that their profession is honorable and that they are doing the right thing. It is difficult to reach that conclusion when surrounded by individ-uals who have not fulfilled that respon-sibility. In light of the situation with Mr. Wisner—and other cases of wrongdoing so awful that they have been found guilty of a felony—we will not tolerate crimes against veterans that cause harm to their personal safety or that involve corrupt, backroom dealings with senior VA executives. That legislation passed the U.S. Sen-ate on the final day of our session last year. It passed unanimously. Unfortu-nately, that legislation did not then pass the House of Representatives, de-spite what we were told was significant support for it. It just didn’t work in the schedule. So today I am back on the Senate floor. A hotline request is pend-ing in which we ask—I ask—that legis-lation unanimously passed by the U.S. Senate on the final day of the previous session would pass today. That will then give the House of Representatives the time and the mechanics to see that this legislation becomes law. In fact, the very first piece of legisla-tion I introduced in this session, the 115th, was Increasing the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability to Veterans Act of 2017. We today call for its swift passage. I am hopeful this leg-islation will provide an ounce of justice to those victims who have suffered at the hands of this VA employee, and I call on my colleagues to once again stand with me in passing this legisla-tion. In addition to the issues of account-ability of wrongdoing employees of the Department, this legislation also has additional provisions. Those provisions include holding VA leaders accountable for Department mismanagement, hir-ing well-qualified people and address-ing employee performance, preventing employees from conflicts of interest, and improving manager training. We have a duty. Of all people in this country, whom should we pay respect and honor to? Whom should we care for? For whom should we make certain we live up to the commitments that were made? One would think that those who served in our military, who pro-tected our freedoms and liberties are the ones we would put on a high ped-estal and make sure everything pos-sible to protect them is done. We have a duty to taxpayers, as well, to make sure funds are not going to employees who are convicted of crimes against those veterans that they are charged to protect and to serve. There have been a number of VA scandals, corruption, and illegal activ-ity in nearly every State. Whether it has been a secret wait-list in a hospital that delayed critical care, opioid over-medication that led to death or suicide, or physical abuse and neglect, crimes must come to an end. There must be accountability for us to be able to say we are doing everything possible to bring those crimes to an end. This legislation is an important step in making the VA worthy of the serv-ice of those who have sacrificed for this Nation. Given the previous unanimous support, I can’t imagine—I hope there is no reason this legislation should not again pass today. I call upon my col-leagues in the U.S. Senate to stand with me and Senator B
LUMENTHAL and others as we work to make certain the VA is a department worthy of the vet-erans it serves. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Acosta has ex-cellent credentials and is well qualified for the position. He understands that a good-paying job is critical to helping workers realize the American dream for themselves and for their families. After immigrating to the United States from Cuba, Mr. Acosta’s parents worked hard to create more opportuni-ties for their son. Alexander Acosta be-came the first person in his family to go to college, and from there he has had quite an impressive career. He has already been confirmed by the U.S. Senate three different times: He served as a Republican member of the National Labor Relations Board, he

served as Assistant Attorney General for the U.S. Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and he served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Mr. Acosta’s most recent role was serving as dean of Florida Inter-national University’s law school. The school’s president told the Miami Her-ald recently, ‘‘Alex has a destiny in public service. . . . He’s a person of in-tegrity, conscientious, thoughtful, he doesn’t overreach.’’ On March 22, Mr. Acosta had a hear-ing in the Senate Labor Committee that lasted two and a half hours. Fol-lowing his hearing, he answered 380 fol-low-up questions for the record—604 questions if you count the sub-ques-tions. Then, on March 30, our com-mittee approved Mr. Acosta’s nomina-tion, readying the nomination for con-sideration by the full Senate. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have printed in the R

Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the supporters include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federa-tion, the National Federation of Inde-pendent Business, the National Asso-ciation of Manufacturers, the Inter-national Franchise Association, the Associated Builders and Contractors, and the American Beverage Associa-tion. Here are some examples of what these groups had to say about Mr. Acosta. The International Franchise Association said, ‘‘Franchise owners around the country are facing a great deal of regulatory uncertainty as a re-sult of the wreckage created by the previous administration’s out-of-con-trol Department of Labor. Mr. Acosta’s exemplary record handling labor issues as a member of the NLRB has shown the appropriate balance needed to pro-tect the interests of employees and em-ployers.’’ The National Federation of Inde-pendent Business said, ‘‘Alexander Acosta is an experienced public servant with a distinguished record. His knowl-edge of labor issues and his service as U.S. Attorney make him an especially strong candidate to take on the en-trenched bureaucracy, which has im-posed unbelievably severe and costly regulations on small business in the re-cent years.’’ The National Retail Federation said, ‘‘Mr. Acosta’s diverse experiences in both public service and the private sec-tor position him well to be an effective and pragmatic leader at the Depart-ment of Labor.’’ Why is this nomination so impor-tant? In his new book, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman uses the term ‘‘Great Acceleration’’ for all of the technological, social, environ-mental, and market changes simulta-neously sweeping across the globe and argues that we are now ‘‘living through one of the greatest inflection points in history’’ as a result. Add Ball State University’s finding that automation is responsible for the loss of 88 percent of our manufacturing jobs. Add globalization. Add social, cultural, cli-mate changes, and terrorism, and you get a big mismatch between the change of pace and the ability of the average American worker to keep up and fit in the accelerating forces shaping the workplace. Earlier this year, after a group of senators listened to a group of sci-entists talk about the advances in arti-ficial intelligence, one Senator asked, ‘‘Where are we all going to work?’’ Tom Friedman says that probably the most important governance chal-lenge is a great need ‘‘to develop the learning systems, training systems, management systems, social safety nets, and government regulations that would enable citizens to get the most out of these accelerations and cushion their worst impacts.’’ One of the federal government’s chief actors in this drama should be the U.S. Secretary of Labor. In fact, as many have suggested and the House of Rep-resentatives has done, the title of the job for which Alexander Acosta has been nominated should be changed to the Secretary of Workforce, not Sec-retary of Labor. Labor union membership in the pri-vate sector today is down to less than

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2588 April 27, 2017 
7 percent. The issue for workers today is not whether they belong to a union. It is whether they have the skills to adapt to the changing workplace and to find and keep a job. To be accurate, to create and keep a job. My genera-tion found jobs. This generation is more likely to have to create their own jobs. In his inaugural address, President Trump said he heard ‘‘forgotten men and women’’ who are struggling to keep up and fit into today’s changing world: ‘‘[F]or too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted out factories scat-tered like tombstones across the land-scape of our nation . . . ‘’ That is what President Trump said in his inaugural address. Ten days earlier, in his farewell ad-dress, President Obama said he, too, heard those same voices: ‘‘[T]oo many families, in inner cities and in rural counties, have been left behind . . . if we don’t create opportunity for all peo-ple, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come. . . . ‘’ That was President Obama. What can we do about this? The most important thing is to work with em-ployers and community colleges and technical institutes and find ways to increase the number of Americans earning post-secondary certificates and two-year degrees or more. Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce says that by 2020—3 years from now—65 percent of the jobs in this country will require some college or more. And at the rate we are going, Georgetown predicts the United States will lack 5 million work-ers with an adequate post-secondary education by 2020. Unfortunately, too many of the fed-eral government’s actions over the last few years have made it harder for American workers to keep up, to adjust to the changing world, and to create, find, or keep a job. President Obama’s Department of Labor issued 130 percent more final rules than the previous administra-tion’s labor department. Overall, the Obama Administration issued an aver-age of 85 major rules. These are rules that may have an impact of $100 mil-lion or more a year on the economy. Eighty-five major rules a year. Presi-dent Bush, on the other hand, averaged about 62 a year. That is a 37-percent in-crease under President Obama. Take the overtime rule. In my state, its costs would add hundreds of dollars per student in college tuition and it would force small businesses across the country to reduce the jobs that provide the stability that families need. This rule has been delayed by the courts until at least June 30th of this year. Take the so-called joint employer policy. This is a policy that affects franchising and makes it more likely that a parent company will own and operate its stores instead of allowing franchisees to own and operate those stores. A Republican majority at the National Labor Relations Board can start undoing the damage caused by this harmful decision. Then, there is the fiduciary rule, which is going to make it too expensive for the average worker to obtain in-vestment advice about retirement ben-efits—again making it harder, not easi-er, to adjust to the changing world of work. The Department of Labor under the Trump administration has delayed this rule for 60 days, until June 9, 2017. Some parts of the rule are delayed until January 1, 2018. One rule after another from the Obama administration has stacked a big wet blanket of costs and time-con-suming mandates on job creators, caus-ing them to create fewer jobs. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s EEO–1 form will require employers to provide to the govern-ment 20 times as much information as they do today about how they pay workers. Earlier this month, the Sen-ator from Kansas, Senator P
ATROB-
ERTS , and I asked the Office of Manage-ment and Budget to rescind this time- wasting mandate. There is the ridiculously complex 108- question FAFSA, the federal aid appli-cation form that 20 million families fill out every year as students go to col-lege. It turns away from college many of the very students who most need to adjust to this changing world. The Affordable Care Act defined full- time work as only 30 hours, forcing em-ployers to cut their workers’ hours or reduce hiring altogether in order to es-cape the law’s mandate and its unaffordable penalties. Many of these rules, like the per-suader rule, which chills the ability of employers to retain legal advice during union organizing activities, seemed de-signed for the purpose of strengthening the membership and the power of labor unions. We are fortunate to have a nominee in Mr. Acosta who can use his good judgment to reevaluate labor policies that make it much harder to create jobs and to find jobs. We know that Mr. Acosta has support from members of both political parties, and that raises a question for me: Why did the Senate yesterday have to vote to invoke cloture on Mr. Acosta’s nom-ination? The vote was bipartisan, with 61 senators voting to end debate so Mr. Acosta could have had an up or down vote. He could have been approved by majority vote yesterday. That has been the tradition in the U.S. Senate for 230 years. There never has been a Cabinet member denied his or her position by requiring them to get more than 51 votes. There have been some cloture votes for delay or to take some extra time, but no one has ever been denied the position by requiring more than 51 votes. During most of the 20th century, when one party controlled the White House and the Senate seventy percent of the time, the minority never filibus-tered to death a single presidential nominee. The practice in the Senate since the Senate’s beginning has been that the President nominates and the Senate decides by majority vote wheth-er to approve the nomination. Why are we having these cloture votes? We are getting into more and more of a dif-ficult situation with these votes. It is a bad habit and both sides, Republicans and Democrats, have caused the prob-lem. During the Obama administration, over the 8 years, there were 173 cloture votes on nominations, and I voted to invoke cloture 41 of those times. For 10 of those nominees, I voted to end de-bate so that their nomination could have an up or down vote even though I opposed their confirmation. No one has ever disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who was in charge, to use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to delay and ex-amine, sometimes causing nominations to be withdrawn or even defeating nominees by a majority vote. What I would like to suggest today is that if we continue the trend of requir-ing cloture votes on presidential nomi-nees—cabinet members and others— that may work fine as long as we have a president and a Senate of the same political party, but if we have a presi-dent and a Senate of different political parties and everybody has become ac-customed to voting no on cloture, to requiring a cloture vote and voting no, the Senate may never be able to con-firm any cabinet members or any sub- cabinet members when the Senate and the president are of different political parties. I would suggest to my friends on the other side of the aisle that the Senate is a body of precedent, and I think it would be wise for us to stop and think, as we proceed, about whether it is wise to require cloture votes for presidential nominees. Why don’t we simply go ahead and approve them or not approve them by majority vote? We have an excellent nominee in Mr. Acosta. We are fortunate that someone of his intelligence and experience is willing to serve as our U.S. Secretary of Labor. I look forward to voting for and to the Senate approving his con-firmation later today. I yield the floor. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Alexander Acosta to be Secretary of the Depart-ment of Labor. Our Nation’s Labor Secretary has a responsibility to protect the safety and legal rights of the American workforce. From prosecuting civil rights viola-tions to monitoring workplace safety, the Department of Labor ensures fair treatment. The Labor Secretary must also evaluate our economy and advo-cate for fair and equal pay and benefits for American workers. The Department provides the data and expertise for pol-icymakers, employers, and workers to make economic decisions.

Unfortunately, Mr. Acosta’s testi-mony on these points at his confirma-tion hearing was disappointing. He would not commit to support updating overtime rules to make sure that em-ployees get fair pay for the hours they work. He would not commit to prioritize closing the gender pay gap. He would not commit to keeping work-place safety inspectors on the job. Moreover, when Mr. Acosta led the Civil Rights Division of the Depart-ment of Justice during the George W. Bush Administration, the GAO re-ported that there was a ‘‘significant drop in the enforcement of several major antidiscrimination and voting rights laws.’’ The Secretary of Labor must be a vigilant defender of the rights of workers. In a Cabinet where too many depart-ment heads are looking out for million-aires and billionaires, we need a Sec-retary of Labor who will look out for the American worker. I am not con-vinced that Mr. Acosta will do that job. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. 
COAL MINER PENSION AND RETIREE HEALTH  
BENEFITS  
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is no great secret that the American peo-ple do not have a great deal of con-fidence in their government. It is no se-cret that the American people think the Congress is way out of touch with their needs and aspirations. In fact, just confirming that point, a recent poll appeared in the Washington Post and ABC News, and it found that 58 percent of the American people believe that President Trump is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today; 62 percent of the American people believe that the Re-publican Party is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States; and 67 percent of the American people believe that the Democratic Party is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today. Those are numbers that should cause a great deal of concern to Mem-bers of the Senate and the House, to Democrats and Republicans, to every-body. I think one of the reasons is that there is a world outside of Capitol Hill where people are in pain; where people are working longer hours for lower wages; where people are scared to death about facing retirement because they have, in many cases, no money in the bank; where people today are pay-ing 40 percent, 50 percent of limited in-comes for affordable housing; where single moms can’t afford childcare for their kids; where young people can’t af-ford to go to college; where other peo-ple are leaving college deeply in debt. And all of that is taking place within the context of almost all new wealth and income going to the top 1 percent. We have the absurd situation today where the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and 52 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 per-cent. The middle class is shrinking. There are 43 million Americans living in poverty, and the very wealthy are getting wealthier. In the midst of all that, my Repub-lican colleagues and President Trump are desperately trying to provide hun-dreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top 1 percent and cut back on programs that working fami-lies desperately need, whether it is Pell grants to make it easier for kids to go to college, whether it is afterschool programs, whether it is the Meals on Wheels program, whether it is afford-able housing, or whatnot—tax breaks for billionaires, cutbacks on programs that people desperately need. The American people will not regain confidence in the U.S. Congress unless we keep promises that were made to them. Today I want to talk about promises that were made to coal min-ers. For decades, coal miners contrib-uted to their pension funds with the promise that when they retired, they would receive a pension and retiree health benefits that would last for a lifetime. Those were the promises to the people who went underneath the ground, who worked incredibly dif-ficult jobs, who died of black lung dis-ease or a myriad of other diseases or injuries. Promises were made to those workers, and those promises were bro-ken. If Congress does not act by tomor-row, the retiree health benefits of more than 22,000 coal miners will be elimi-nated. We cannot allow that to happen. It is not only unfair to the retired coal miners and their families, it once again will tell the American people that they cannot trust their government. Prom-ises were made, but they were not car-ried out. My understanding is that an agree-ment to protect these retiree health benefits may be included in the con-tinuing resolution to keep the govern-ment from shutting down. As I have walked the hallways here in the Sen-ate, I have met with members, retirees of the United Mine Workers, who have been back here week after week after week, and I applaud them for their per-sistence. Let us hope that, in fact, the con-tinuing resolution does contain an agreement to protect those retiree health benefits. It is absolutely imper-ative that the agreement contain those benefits and that those promises be kept. Even if we do put that provision in the CR, it still does not address an-other problem faced by retirees in the coal industry and retirees all over the country, and that is the fact that we are doing nothing to protect the pen-sion benefits of coal miners and tens and thousands of other workers. This is an issue that is of major crisis propor-tions all across this country, and it is an issue that must be addressed. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Miners Protection Act. That is also why I will be introducing legislation on May 9 to protect the pensions of not only 90,000 coal miners throughout this country, but the retirement benefits of 10 million workers in multiemployer pension plans—10 million workers. Over 40 years ago, the Federal Gov-ernment made a solemn commitment to the workers of this country. If a re-tiree is promised a certain pension ben-efit after a lifetime of hard work, a company could not renege on that promise. Making that commitment 40 years ago was exactly the right thing to do. When someone works for their entire life, when they give up pay raises, when they work overtime, when they work weekends in order to make sure that he or she has a secure retire-ment, it is absolutely unacceptable to pull the plug from that worker’s ben-efit. Guarantees were made, and those guarantees must be kept. This is not the negotiating of wage increases. This is not the negotiating of overtime. This is a promise made to workers and paid for by workers, which simply cannot be nullified if people are to have any faith in our political system. But more than 2 years ago behind closed doors, a provision was slipped into a must-pass spending bill that now makes it legal to cut the pension bene-fits of about 10 million workers and re-tirees in multiemployer pension plans. As a result, retirees all over this coun-try are waking up to the unacceptable reality that the promises made to them could be broken and that the pension benefits they are receiving today may soon be cut by 30, 40 or even 65 percent. What this means is that retirees who are currently receiving a pension ben-efit of $18,000 a year are in danger of seeing their benefits cut by $3,843, a 21- percent cut. Retirees who are currently receiving a pension benefit of $36,000 a year could see their pension benefits cut by up to $21,000, a 60-percent cut. In other words, tens of thousands of retirees all over this country who today are in the middle class, who worked hard their entire lives, who gave up on wage increases, who worked overtime in order to protect those pen-sions may be seeing significant reduc-tions in what they anticipated. We are talking about retirees who will no longer be able to pay their mortgages. We are talking about retirees who will not be able to pay their utility bills. We are talking about families who may have to go on food stamps to feed their families after working their entire lives. That is unconscionable. We can-not allow that to happen. In my view, we have to send a very loud and very clear message to the Re-publican leadership in Congress and to the President of the United States, and that is when a promise is made to the working people of this country with re-spect to their pensions and retiree health benefits, that promise must be kept. Today, about 150 multiemployer pen-sion plans are in trouble financially, but let’s be clear. The retirees are not

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2590 April 27, 2017 
the reason these pension plans are struggling financially. The reason many of these pension plans are in trouble is because of the greed, reck-lessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street that drove this country into the worst recession since the Great Depres-sion of the 1930s. Let us never forget, when the largest financial institutions were on the verge of collapse 7 years ago, it was the taxpayers of this coun-try who bailed them out. I didn’t vote for it, but a majority of the Members of Congress did. Congress gave Wall Street some $700 billion in financial assistance. The Federal Reserve provided $16 trillion in virtually zero-interest loans to every major financial institution in this country and to foreign banks through-out the world because they were, as we will all recall, too big to fail. If Con-gress can bail out Wall Street, if Con-gress can bail out foreign banks, we have to protect the pension benefits of American workers. The legislation that I will be reintro-ducing on May 9 would prevent the re-tirement benefits of about 10 million workers and retirees from being cut by repealing the anti-pension rider that was included in an appropriations bill 2 years ago. It establishes an emergency fund within the Pension Benefit Guar-anty Corporation to make sure that multiemployer pension plans can con-tinue to provide every pension benefit owed to every eligible American for decades to come. It is fully paid for by closing two tax loopholes that allow the wealthiest Americans in this country to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. Closing these loopholes will allow us to protect the earned pension benefits of every worker and retiree in multiemployer pension plans in this country. At a time of massive wealth and in-come inequality, when half of all older workers have no retirement savings at all, when 20 percent of seniors are liv-ing on less than $13,000 a year, we have to do everything we can to protect and expand the fine pension benefit plans in America.

Without objection, it is so ordered. REGULATORY REFORM AND THE BUDGET  
PROCESS  
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, there is a lot of conversation about all that is moving this week in the Senate and the House and the executive branch. There is a lot of conversation about 100 days. It is somewhat of a look back, and it is reasonable for Americans to be able to look back and say the beginning of a new Presidency or the beginning of a new session of Congress has begun and what has al-ready happened. There has been quite a bit that has actually happened, but let me highlight one specific area. I want to highlight an area that has moved and to, quite frankly, highlight an area that has not. What has moved has been a lot of conversation about regulation. When I walked into Congress just a few years ago, I had a lot of people in my State who would catch me and ask for one specific thing. They said: I don’t want anything other than to make it stop. Because every time they get news, every time they open up something from an association or try to be able to track something, all they got was a new regulation. Some of them were large and some small, but it seemed like every time they opened the mail, they had a new requirement from some entity they had never heard of, 1,000 miles away, telling them how to oper-ate their business or to submit some new form. Whether they are a school or a hospital or a small business or a large business, whether they are doing manufacturing or are service-oriented or technology, the flood of regulations coming out of Washington, DC, caused people around my State to say: Make it stop; we are trying to catch up. And literally they are hiring more people for compliance than they are to actu-ally do what their business is designed to do. At some point, they want to hire somebody to actually do their business. A dramatic shift happened starting January 20 of this year when the ad-ministration stepped in and for a mo-ment said: Pause on regulations. And literally the Nation could take a deep breath. They didn’t turn anything back. They didn’t turn anything off. America didn’t become less safe. They asked a simple question: How can peo-ple actually get involved in the proc-ess? And before a regulation comes out, we make sure that it is, No. 1, con-sistent with the law, and No. 2, that the people who are affected by it actu-ally get a chance to raise their hands and say: When you do a regulation, make sure you consider this. It doesn’t seem unreasonable. If we are going to be a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people, it is a good idea to have people involved in the process of the regulations that af-fect them. The government should not be their enemy. The government should be their ally. It should be the way to make sure that we have fair rules, that everyone has a consistent set of guidelines and that those guide-lines don’t change all the time. Before this year, there had been only one time in the past decade that the Congressional Review Act was used. The Congressional Review Act was ac-tually due to a fellow Oklahoman named Don Nickles who, in the Senate years ago, passed a simple piece of leg-islation to say that if a regulation is promulgated by an administration— any administration—that is not con-sistent with the desires of Congress, that Congress can pull it back out in the first few days after it was passed, and most of the time, it is legislative days—it is actually months in calendar time. In the first few months it is in existence, Congress can pull that regu-lation out and look at it and say: Is this consistent with what Congress passed? If it is not, Congress would have a fast-track process to be able to look at it and say: This is inconsistent with what Congress desired when it passed the law; that it had to go through the House, the Senate, and then to the White House to be signed. That has happened only one time. In the past few months, Congress has passed now 13 Congressional Review Acts—13 different reviews of different regulations that were put down by the previous administration in their final months, some of them in their final days of—the administration—an ad-ministration that lasted 8 full years. These were the things they crammed into the very end, what are called mid-night regulations. Those regulations cost billions of dollars, and some had very little review. Thirteen different times this Congress has pulled those out. It is literally billions of dollars in regulations that were laid on the econ-omy and millions of hours of work on people filling out compliance forms and submitting things to Washington, DC, that most likely no one will ever read. Those thirteen bills that have now been signed into law have helped free up our economy, and it has started a process that is very simple: What do we do to make sure that we have good reg-ulations as a nation, that they stay consistent and have the maximum number of people involved? The administration has also laid out something that many called a radical idea; that is, for every one regulation that goes in, an agency would pull two out; to go back and review old regula-tions and say: Are there other regula-tions that need to come out? For those who have called this a radical idea, I have had to smile and say: You realize the United Kingdom has done that for years. Canada has done that for years. Australia has done that for years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2591 April 27, 2017 
It is not a radical, crazy idea; it is a simple statement to say that when reg-ulations go in, we need to have consid-eration for those who are already regu-lated and say: Are we burying them in new compliance requirements? Is there an area where we can help free them of things that are not needed anymore, that are old, that are not used or not even appropriate anymore? It is a rea-sonable thing to be able to look at. It is not in statute, it is an Executive order, but it is one of those things that I think are wise for agencies to be able to take a look at. Every administration over the past several decades has said they are going to do what is called a retrospective re-view—go back and look at it. This ad-ministration has said: We are really going to look at it. If a new regulation goes in, we have to go back and review and see if two can come out at the same time, to force that retrospective review. Many other areas of regulations are coming out, but the primary issue that has come out is very simple; that is, slowing down the process and making sure it is wise to be able to impose new regulations. We should have them in health and safety areas, but we shouldn’t do regulations just because someone in Washington, DC, thinks it is a good idea to be able to run every-one else’s business. With any set of decisions made by the executive branch, we should resolve many of these things in law. The Con-gressional Review Act—those are all in law. Those have all been settled. The executive actions like the ‘‘one in, two out’’—that is an executive action. A fu-ture executive can flip it back around and say: We are not going to go back and review it at all. I proposed a whole series of issues that we need to deal with on regu-latory actions. I chair the Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee, in fact. We have had very bipartisan conversations to say: Where can we find common ground, and what do we need to do to be able to resolve this issue of regula-tions just showing up? So we have set out a simple set of ideas, one beginning in small business. If we are going to start with regulatory issues, let’s start in the area where we have the greatest amount of agree-ment; that is, on small businesses. Small businesses should have an oppor-tunity to have a voice at the table. Now, when regulations are put out, often those regulations are put out and only the largest businesses are con-sulted on them—those that might have lobbyists or government relations or have a team of attorneys to be able to go engage with the Federal Govern-ment and get their input considered. We required years ago that small businesses get a voice. The problem is, many agencies actually don’t do it. We need to be able to press the issue and put into statute an absolute require-ment that small businesses be con-sulted. So when a regulation is created, the people who are affected the most— like in my State of Oklahoma, where 97 percent of the businesses are small businesses—that those folks actually get a voice. It may shock some people in this Chamber to know that small business owners in Oklahoma don’t wake up every day and read the Federal Reg-ister to see if there is an area they have to give notice and comment to. It may be stunning to know that they don’t have a team of lawyers at every small business. In fact, there are towns in Oklahoma where there are many small businesses but there is not a law-yer in that town. We should not require every business to hire attorneys and to read the Federal Register every day for them to be able to stay in business. We should actually reach out to them and say: We are not opposed to small busi-nesses; we want to make sure we facili-tate them. Here is a simple idea of many ideas in the small business bill that I have—not only getting greater input and to make sure they are in consideration, but how about this simple idea: If there is a pa-perwork violation for a small business, they are not fined immediately. They have forgiveness for that first-time of-fense. Many of them didn’t even know there was a certain amount of paper-work that had to be turned in. It showed up as a requirement in the Fed-eral Register. They are running their small business. They weren’t tracking it. Someone comes in and evaluates and says ‘‘There is a piece of paper you haven’t turned in’’ and drops a $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 fine on them for not sub-mitting something, and they had no idea what it was. First-time paperwork forgiveness is a simple idea. To actually be engaged where the Federal Government can go to a small business and say ‘‘Hey, you missed one,’’ and if they are not health or safety related issues, we give them forgiveness in the process—why should that be so hard for us to do? We have another piece of legislation we proposed called early participation in regulations. Before a regulation is written by an agency, this would re-quire that they actually put out the word that they are thinking about writing a regulation on a certain topic and get as much input as they can, so before they even write the regulation and we are fighting over whether we should use ‘‘or’’ or ‘‘and’’ in a section, we actually talk about whether it is needed at all, or if they are going to write it, make sure it has these certain issues in it—again, getting more people involved in the process. Just a week ago, there was a march through this town and through many towns saying: We need to have great science in our Nation. I could not agree more. We should have quality science in our research. We should have en-gagement from science when we put policy papers together. One of the challenges we currently have and one of the things we are try-ing to correct with another piece of legislation is just on using best science, just requiring agencies, when they make a decision about something in a regulation, to actually use peer-re-viewed, good science that can be shared with other people. We bump into issues now commonly with agencies where they say they have made a decision on some of the regulations, and we ask for the science behind it, and they say that the science is proprietary and they can’t share it with us or the American people. The American people aren’t good about withholding a secret on something that actually affects their day-to-day life. Don’t lay a new re-quirement on them and tell them: Trust us—we have thought about this, and this is the right way to go. Ameri-cans aren’t great with that. They just want to be able to know the facts be-hind it so they can see that science themselves. So getting best science is something we have talked about within the frame-work of the Administrative Procedures Act for a long time—something many administrations for the past several decades have said we should do. Well, let’s go ahead and do it, and let’s re-quire that we actually have best science out there. This body, with a voice vote, just a year ago, passed a bill called TSCA. That TSCA bill dealt with chemicals and how we are going to approve chemicals and how the EPA can do it. We put new language in that requiring good science, peer-reviewed science, and on a voice vote from everyone in this body, we agreed that is the best way to handle science on chemicals. So what did I do? I took that exact language that we all agreed to on TSCA and said: Let’s apply that to every agency so that whenever an agency of any type makes a decision that is science-based, it has good trans-parency and it is peer-reviewed. We have agreed that the EPA should do it dealing with chemicals; let’s agree that everyone should do it. Let’s agree on how we handle guidance, to not allow agencies to be able to create guidance documents. Let’s have good trans-parency and simplicity. We have a simple bill, as odd as this may sound, that just says that for whatever regulation is out there, the agencies also have to put a description out on it in plain language that a non- attorney can understand in just 100 words, just a 100-word description of what it is. Right now there are folks who actually do try to research things, and if you are not a trained attorney, you can’t even understand what it means. So just plain-language descrip-tions of regulations are called for. These should all be areas of common ground. These should all be straight-forward issues that aren’t partisan issues but are commonsense issues. We have made progress on regula-tions over the past 100 days. The Amer-ican people have now been able to take a breath as regulations are not coming

out at rapid speed. We still need them, though. In the days ahead, we need to do good regulations, so let’s figure out a good way to do it. Let me make one more note on the opposite side. We have made progress in regulations, with a ways to go. Where we have not made progress in the past 100 days is on how we do budg-eting. There is a group of us who have talked for several years now and have said that we have to change the way we do budgeting. Year after year, the American people have said: Are we going to have another continuing reso-lution? Are we going to have another omnibus bill? Are we going to be late again on budgeting? Year after year, Congress has said: Yes, we are. Folks around my State occasionally catch me and say: This is different. I smile at them and say: No, it is not different. The way we do budgeting was created right after Watergate in 1974 to create a more transparent process. What they actually created was a process so dif-ficult that it has only worked four times since 1974—four times. So if it feels like every year you are saying ‘‘How come the budget process didn’t work again?’’ it is because every year but four, since 1974, the budget process didn’t work. At some point, we have to say: The budget process is not in the Constitu-tion. Let’s change the way we are doing the process. They were well- meaning in 1974 when they made that process; it just didn’t work. So let’s fix it instead of saying that once again it didn’t work. We will never get a better product on our budget until we fix the process of our budget. We will never be able to solve the budget debt and deficit issues we have with this continuing resolu-tion autopilot system and with an om-nibus system that seems to just perpet-uate the same issues over and over again. We have made specific proposals: doing the budget every 2 years, getting time to get more predictability, to get more time to be able to walk through the research of it; eliminating budget gimmicks, and there are a mess of budget gimmicks that are out there; and getting a better long-term view. The budget has what is called a 10-year window now, where we have to budget over 10 years. So what happens? Con-gress creates a budget that blows up in the 11th year. Well, that has been done year after year after year, and we have a lot of eleventh-hour years now stack-ing up and a lot of major problems that are out there. We need to find a way to prevent us from ever having to get in a conversa-tion about a government shutdown. We have a bill called the government shut-down prevention bill that would keep us from ever having that, and it would put the pressure back on Congress and the White House to resolve the issues but would prevent us from ever having a government shutdown fight. We shouldn’t argue about whether the gov-ernment is going to be opened or closed. We should argue about how we are going to handle the issue of budg-eting and how we are going to actually be able to get us back to balance. There are a lot of simple, common-sense things that are out there that we can do, but we as a body have agreed that we are going to actually tackle the way we do budgeting. That is going to involve some focus and some time commitment and a risk to say: How it was done in the 1970s is not the way we should do it now. It didn’t work. Let’s change the system so we can actually get us back on track and bring some predictability again to what we are doing. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REMEMBERING JAY DICKEY  
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise to address the urgent crisis taking place in Sudan, but, first, I wish to take just a moment to remember former Congressman Jay Dickey, who, as many in Washington and Arkansas now know, passed away last week. Jay was a native of Pine Bluff and represented Southern Arkansas in the Fourth Congressional District for four terms between 1993 and 2001. Jay was known as a fierce advocate for Arkan-sas and worked hard to ensure that our State had a strong voice in Wash-ington. A successful business owner and at-torney, Jay was a well-respected mem-ber of the Pine Bluff community. He served as Pine Bluff city attorney and had a brief tenure on the Arkansas Su-preme Court. Jay was a friend to many and built a warm relationship with al-most everyone he met—even those who disagreed with him politically. He also wore his faith on his sleeve as a proud born-again Christian. I will always appreciate Jay’s kind-ness to me when I first started serving in Congress and truly valued his friend-ship. He was a loving father, a dedi-cated public servant, and he will be missed by many. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends as they mourn his loss, but I know they are also incred-ibly proud, as I have been, of the legacy Jay leaves behind, which will continue to have an impact on us all in the years ahead. 
SOUTH SUDAN  
Mr. President, the Trump adminis-tration has stated it will pursue a for-eign policy focused on American inter-ests that puts our national security first. I appreciate the President’s com-mitment to a stronger and more re-spected America and stand ready to work with him to achieve that goal. A stronger, more respected America does not mean we disengage with the international community. In fact, it means just the opposite. While there are many important issues we must ad-dress here at home, we cannot lose sight of the places around the globe that are in need of American engage-ment. As we have seen with Syria and North Korea, it makes a difference when the United States acts, but not every international crisis gets front page headlines like Syria and North Korea do. One such crisis with little at-tention but in desperate need of U.S. leadership is South Sudan. Hunger emergencies are on the rise across Afri-ca, but the situation in South Sudan is so grim that it has led the U.N. to use the word ‘‘famine’’ for the first time since 2011. ‘‘Famine’’ is not a word the U.N. or the international community throws around lightly. In order for the U.N. to officially declare a famine, a popu-lation must reach certain death rate, malnutrition, and food shortage thresholds. In blunt terms, a formal famine declaration means that many people have already started dying of hunger. The famine in South Sudan is almost entirely manmade. The much heralded August 2015 peace agreement has failed to bring peace to South Sudan, which has been mired in a civil war almost entirely throughout the young nation’s lifetime. Thousands of civilians have been killed and millions more were dis-placed as a result of the civil war in South Sudan. Millions of those who are left in the country are facing a severe hunger crisis. Fighting between rival factions has left an estimated 4.9 mil-lion people—more than 40 percent of the country—in urgent need of food. That total is expected to rise to over 5.5 million people—5.5 million people— by summer if the international com-munity doesn’t act quickly. These in-nocent civilians are victims of com-peting groups that use hunger as a weapon of war while accumulating wealth by exploiting South Sudan’s re-sources. Millions are suffering in South Sudan, but that is not due to shortage of food. It is because they are being de-nied food by a small few getting rich off the country’s oil, gold, and live-stock. Meanwhile, humanitarian aid work-ers trying to reach the hungry are being kidnapped and held for ransom. Some have even been killed. Food ship-ments are being blocked, crops are being torched, farmers and herders are being forced from the land, and civil-ians so fear for their lives, they have been driven away from the violence in population centers to remote locations where aid workers can’t reach them to provide the relief they need. There is plenty of evidence to show that when people don’t have enough to eat, they get desperate. Desperation fuels conflict. Conflict in a young country, in an unstable region, poses the risk of spillover into neighboring countries, further exacerbating human suffering. This is why U.S. leadership is needed.

By that, I don’t mean throwing money or military personnel into a conflict zone. In fact, that would likely exacerbate the situation as the struc-tural causes will remain once the money dries out and the troops head home. The approach I am advocating is two- pronged. First and foremost, there ab-solutely is a need for the United States to take a lead in coordinating relief with NGOs and our international part-ners like the World Food Program—aid which has proven effective channels, the dedication and compassion of doers, not takers. Along with helping those who des-perately need humanitarian aid, the international community must also take action to end the unchecked cor-ruption that fuels the conflict in South Sudan. This is the structural cause of the crisis. We have to address this problem at its root. If we want to have any chance at long-term stability in South Sudan, we must seriously con-sider options that would end the cor-ruption which enriches those in power at the expense of the citizens. I believe President Trump would sup-port these efforts. The President under-stands how dire the situation in South Sudan is. The administration recently announced the continuation of the na-tional emergency declaration for South Sudan, which was set to expire earlier this month. Earlier this week, Ambassador Haley rightfully called out the warring par-ties in South Sudan and urged the U.N. Security Council to move forward with further sanctions and an arms embar-go. The Ambassador’s words urging the Council to take action to break the cycle of violence in South Sudan are extremely encouraging. They show the administration understands that the United States must remain engaged in corners of the world that need our lead-ership. It is my hope that Congress and the President can work together to exert that leadership and put an end to the corruption that is causing so much suffering in the country. There is a role for soft power in a hard-powered administration. Human suffering is never in our national inter-est, no matter where it is happening. U.S. leadership, through diplomacy and smart foreign aid programs, help pre-vent situations which lead to serious threats to our national security. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L
ANKFORD ). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, House Republicans have revived their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. As a reminder, the original effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act—char-acterized by some as the TrumpCare bill—was so unpopular that it had to be withdrawn from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. That is be-cause, after the Congressional Budget Office took a look, it would have taken away health insurance from 24 million Americans. Think about that for a moment. The Republican answer to ObamaCare—the Affordable Care Act—was to remove health insurance protection and cov-erage from 24 million Americans. It would have devastated the Medicaid Program. The Medicaid Program, of course, is one that is easily character-ized as a health insurance program for those who are in low-income cat-egories, but that statement doesn’t tell the real story. For example, in my State, half of the children who are born in Illinois are covered by Medicaid. Their mothers and the kids are covered by Medicaid. So when it comes to new babies, par-ticularly in low-income families, Med-icaid provides the prenatal care, deliv-ery, and care after the child is born, but the most expensive part of the Medicaid Program is the help it gives to senior citizens—mothers and grand-mothers who are in nursing homes who have only a little bit of savings, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid cover their medical expenses. The Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act would have decimated the Medicaid Program across the United States. It would have increased costs for the av-erage person for health insurance by $3,000, and particularly for people in upper ages—I guess I fit in that cat-egory—these folks would have seen a change in the calculation of premiums. The Affordable Care Act protects pre-miums so they cannot be more than three times the lowest premium for any individual. The Republican ap-proach said: Let’s make that five times. If it goes up to five times, it can mean almost doubling the premiums paid by many senior citizens—those ap-proaching, I should say, being senior citizens, from 50 to age 65. It also would have cut off funding for women’s health centers, all while pro-viding a massive tax cut for upper in-come, wealthy people and big busi-nesses, including tax cuts for drug companies. What a deal—to eliminate health insurance for 24 million Ameri-cans, to devastate the Medicaid Pro-gram, to increase the cost of health in-surance for the average individual, to cut off funding for women’s health cen-ters in order to give a tax cut to wealthy people and drug companies. The new bill does all those things as well—and then something I didn’t think was possible. The new version of the Affordable Care Act repeal Repub-licans are now considering in the House allows insurance companies to im-pose—get this—an age tax and charge seniors significantly higher premiums than younger people. It says that in-surance plans do not have to cover hos-pital visits, prescription drugs, mater-nity care, substance abuse treatment, or mental health services. The Affordable Care Act defined these as essential services so, if you are buying health insurance, you know you are buying that kind of protection. Well, Republicans have said: That is too much insurance for people. We ought to let them buy stripped-down versions of health insurance that may be cheaper. The obvious question, What happens to those people when they need coverage for substance abuse treatment? What if that son or daugh-ter in high school begins an addiction to opioids, leading to heroin, and now your health insurance plan saved you money by not covering it or didn’t cover mental health counseling? It guts protections for people with preexisting conditions. Is there a per-son alive who doesn’t know someone or have someone in their family with a preexisting condition? That used to be grounds for denying insurance coverage or charging outrageous premiums. We did away with it with the Affordable Care Act. It is back, my friends, with the new Republican approach to the repeal of affordable care. It allows insurance companies to once again charge unaffordable premiums if someone in your family has a history of asthma, cancer, high blood pressure, or diabe-tes. Republicans made these changes to win the votes of the most extreme con-servative Members of the U.S. House, the so-called Freedom Caucus. What they are fighting for is for freedom from individuals getting protection when it comes to healthcare. These changes may appeal to a handful of ex-treme people who conveniently see their health insurance policies—their personal policies—protected under their bill, but these sorts of approaches don’t appeal to anyone in the medical community. Who opposes the new Republican re-peal of the Affordable Care Act? The American Medical Association—that would be the doctors—the American Heart Association, the American Nurses Association, the American As-sociation of Retired Persons, as well as every major medical and patient group out there. Every one of them opposes the changes proposed by the Repub-licans in the House to our healthcare system. Of course, we have a bottom line that we measure proposals against. We go to the Congressional Budget Office, and we say to them: What impact will this have? No one has sent this bill to the Con-gressional Budget Office, and no report has been given. So we don’t know the impact on premiums of this new version. What is going to happen to seniors, to middle-income families? Ramming through a bad bill that will harm Americans just because the President wants to have something to say on the 100th day of his Presidency is a bad idea. It is time to stop this

I hope that many people will tell the President and tell those who support it that this is no way to celebrate 100 days—by taking health insurance away from 24 million people. 
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES  
Mr. President, during the Senate’s consideration of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education, I asked a basic question: As Secretary of Education, would she side with corporate and other for-profit interests or would she be on the side of the students and their families? I was concerned that the record of Secretary DeVos indicated that she was on the side of corporate interests, looking for opportunities to profit off of students and often exploiting them in the process. Months into the job, now that she was approved by a historic tiebreaking vote by the Vice President, we are be-ginning to see which side the Secretary is on. A recent Chicago Tribune article entitled ‘‘Targeted by Obama, DeVry and other for-profit colleges rebound-ing under Trump’’ put it this way: 
Less than 100 days into Trump’s presi-dency, the Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos has delayed imple-mentation of gainful employment rules . . . withdrawn key federal student loan servicing reforms . . . and signaled a less onerous reg-ulatory environment for the essentially tax-payer-financed career education [or for-prof-it] sector. 
A group of State attorneys general, including Lisa Madigan of Illinois, warned of a return to ‘‘open season’’ on students in a letter to Secretary DeVos if she rolled back all of these protec-tions. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that letter from the State attorneys general be printed in the R

We are deeply concerned that rollbacks of these protections would again signal ‘‘open season’’ on students for the worst actors among for-profit post-secondary schools. As the chief consumer law enforce-ment agencies in our states, our offices han-dle thousands of complaints concerning high-er education every year. We also enforce laws to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices perpetrated by higher education providers. 
I. BACKGROUND : THE NEED FOR RULES TO PRO -
TECT STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS FROM UN -
FAIR AND DECEPTIVE PRACTICES BY FOR - 
PROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION PROVIDERS  Over the last ten years, student loan debt has soared from $450 billion to nearly $1.4 trillion. A major driver of this increase has been for-profit colleges. Of the top 25 schools where students hold the most student loan debt, over half were for-profit schools in 2014. This is up from only one for-profit institu-tion in the top 25 in 2000. In addition to driving the increase in stu-dent loan borrowing, for-profit institutions also have significantly more loan defaults than other types of institutions. Since 2013, for-profit institutions accounted for 35% of all federal student loan defaults, but en-rolled just 27% of all borrowers. Many for- profit schools are almost entirely dependent on federal grants and loans. In December 2016, the U.S. Department of Education (‘‘ED’’) found that nearly 200 for-profit schools derive more than 90% of their income from federal sources. The only reason that many of these institutions are in compliance with the federal 90/10 Rule is that certain categories of federal money, including GI Bill money, are excluded from the rule and thus count toward the 10% that is supposed to be non-federal money. Over the past fifteen years, millions of stu-dents have been defrauded by unscrupulous for-profit post-secondary schools. With accreditors asleep at the wheel, State Attor-neys General Offices have stepped in to stop some of the worst abuses. The list of State Attorney General investigations and enforce-ment actions against for-profit colleges is long, including actions against: American Career Institute; Ashford University/ Bridgepoint Education, Inc.; Corinthian Col-leges, Inc.; Career Education Corporation; Education Management Corporation; Daymar College; DeVry University; ITT Tech; National College of Kentucky; and Westwood Colleges, among others. These schools, and others like them, engaged in a variety of deceptive and abusive practices. Some promised prospective students jobs, ca-reers, and further opportunities in education that the schools could not provide. Many schools inflated job placement numbers and/ or promised career services resources that did not exist. Many nationally-accredited schools promised that their credits would transfer, even though credits from nation-ally-accredited schools often do not transfer to more rigorous regionally-accredited schools. Many students were placed in loans that the schools knew from experience their graduates could not pay back. The schools were overseen by accreditors who failed to take action to protect students or the tax-payers who funded their federal student loans, despite ample evidence of these and other problems. In short, the entire for-prof-it education system was failing students and taxpayers. As investigations and prosecu-tions initiated by our offices shed light on these problems, ED began to take steps to remedy these harms, issuing new regulations and reformulating policies to help protect students and taxpayers. Three of these recent steps—the Gainful Employment Rule, the policy of vigorous federal oversight of accreditors, and the Bor-rower Defense to Repayment Rule—are es-sential to protect both consumers and tax-payers from fraudulent actors in the for- profit education sector. The Gainful Employ-ment Rule is a measure of graduates’ debt- to-income and is designed to ensure that pro-grams produce graduates that are able to pay back their student loans. Prospectively, the federal government recognizes accreditors who have standards sufficient to show that the schools they accredit provide a quality education and should have access to federal student loans and grants. Finally, where other protections fail and students are defrauded by bad actors, the Borrower De-fense to Repayment Rule provides a formal process for students to assert a defense to re-payment of their federal student loans. 
II. CORINTHIAN COLLEGES : AN EXAMPLE OF THE  
HARM FACED BY STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS  The egregious conduct of Corinthian Col-leges illustrates how each of these three poli-cies is necessary to avoid harm to both stu-dents and taxpayers. In March 2016, after an extensive review of published job placement rates at Corinthian campuses nationwide, the Department of Education found that the job placement rates were fraudulent for hun-dreds of cohorts from 2010–2014. Corinthian was telling the world that far more of its students obtained jobs than actually did, in-ducing students to enroll. Many of these stu-dents were left without jobs in their field of study. Without these jobs, many are saddled with debt they cannot repay, defaulting on loans funded with taxpayer dollars. Had the gainful employment regulations been in place, Corinthian’s programs that weren’t producing jobs for students would have been shut down because the median debt-to-income ratio would have shown that students were not making enough money to pay down their loans. Had Corinthian’s accreditors reviewed the school’s self-re-ported job placement data on a regular basis, the fraud would have been discovered and stopped much earlier, saving students and taxpayers billions of dollars. The absence of policies in place to protect prospective students from Corinthian’s fraudulent practices also demonstrates the

need for an effective process for students to assert a defense to loan repayment. This de-fense was established in the 1990s when Con-gress passed legislation allowing students to assert claims against their schools as a de-fense to repayment of their federal student loans. There was little detail, however, on the process for asserting such claims. The regulations set to take effect on July 1, 2017 give borrower defense to repayment set proc-esses so that students, schools, and tax-payers have an orderly process, and a degree of certainty, moving forward. Without the Gainful Employment Rule, meaningful oversight of accreditors, and an orderly borrower defense process, we face the prospect of for-profit schools continuing to line their pockets with taxpayer dollars while students and taxpayers experience an-other crushing wave of defaulted student loan debt. 
III. THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE  ED’s gainful employment regulations are designed to further a simple idea—that stu-dents who attend career training programs should be able to repay their federal student loans once they graduate. The Rule allows prospective students to compare debt-to-in-come ratios across schools. By doing this, the Rule creates an incentive for schools to make good on their promises to students, and protects students from programs that will leave them saddled with debt and with-out job prospects in the careers for which they trained. The Rule generally applies to vocational programs at for-profit institutions and to non-degree programs at community colleges. If graduates’ annual loan payments exceed 30% of discretionary income and 12% of total earnings in two out of three consecutive years, the program loses access to Title IV federal student loans and grants. A program can also lose access if graduates’ annual loan payments exceed 20% of discretionary in-come and 8% of total earnings for four con-secutive years. Data released on January 9, 2017 indicate that over 800 programs fail the Department’s Gainful Employment metrics. For-profit in-stitutions are responsible for 98% of the fail-ing programs. But these 800 programs are only a portion of the for-profit school pro-grams that have failed their students. With the Gainful Employment Rule pending, for- profit institutions have already eliminated hundreds of programs where students did not make enough money to cover their debt obli-gations, sometimes closing entire institu-tions that would have failed to provide stu-dents with gainful employment under the regulations. It is essential that the Gainful Employ-ment Rule be kept in place. Removing the Rule would open students and taxpayers up to the worst excesses of the for-profit higher education sector. It would greatly increase the regulatory and enforcement burden on states and accreditors by removing a central protection from the federal leg of the triad that oversees higher education in the United States. 
IV. VIGOROUS OVERSIGHT OF ACCREDITORS BY  
ED The federal government and states need strong partners with specialized knowledge of higher education to provide prospective quality assurance of schools in order to pro-tect students and taxpayers. Accreditors are the organizations tasked with this role. Our experience, however, has shown that without substantive oversight by the federal govern-ment, some accreditors are negligent in their role. The primary example of this dereliction of duty to students and taxpayers is the Ac-crediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). As noted in our April 8, 2016 comment to the National Advisory Com-mittee on Institutional Quality and Integ-rity (NACIQI) opposing ACICS’s application for renewal of recognition, a recent study found that only 35% of students enrolled in ACICS accredited programs graduate, the lowest rate for any accreditor. NACIQI, a bipartisan panel, voted to re-voke ACICS’s recognition in June 2016. The Senior Department Official at ED agreed with NACIQI and revoked ACICS’s recogni-tion as an accreditor in September, 2016. ACICS appealed the decision to the Sec-retary of Education, and in December 2016, the Secretary denied ACICS’s appeal. An accreditor’s failure to verify program quality at its accredited institutions jeop-ardizes the effectiveness of state enforce-ment efforts and regulations, exposing each state’s students to subpar educational pro-grams that provide little value, but for which each student may borrow tens of thou-sands of dollars in student loans, that are nearly impossible to discharge in bank-ruptcy. A prime example of the harm that stems from lax accreditation was brought to light by state action against Westwood College. The Illinois Attorney General’s Office sued Westwood College for systematically mis-representing the ability of its criminal jus-tice graduates to pursue careers in law en-forcement. Thousands of Westwood students in Illinois borrowed up to $75,000 each for ca-reers they were unable to pursue because many police departments in Illinois, includ-ing the Chicago Police Department and the Illinois State Police, did not accept credits from nationally-accredited schools. Grad-uates of Westwood’s criminal justice pro-gram have a median salary below the median salary of a 25–year old with a high school di-ploma, in part because they were locked out of the career they had been promised. This combination of high debt and limited job prospects is a crushing blow not only to stu-dents, but to taxpayers who bear the burden of defaults on these loans. Despite the Illi-nois Attorney General’s January 2012 suit against Westwood, ACICS accredited Westwood up to the day it closed its doors in March 2016. Similarly, on September 8, 2016, a Hen-nepin County Court found that the Min-nesota School of Business and Globe Univer-sity systematically misrepresented their criminal-justice program as allowing stu-dents to pursue careers as Minnesota police officers or probation or parole officers. The Minnesota School of Business and Globe Uni-versity were accredited by ACICS through-out the time period of the fraud determined by the Court, and their Chief Operating Offi-cer during that time was in fact the Chair of ACICS’s board of directors. Terminating ACICS’s recognition is a responsible action that will protect students and taxpayers for years to come. V. THE BORROWER DEFENSE TO REPAYMENT  
RULE  In order to fairly and efficiently redress the harms suffered by for-profit college stu-dents, the borrower defense to repayment rule promulgated by ED must be allowed to take effect on July 1, 2017. As we noted in our August 1, 2016 comment to the proposed rule, students need a fair and transparent process to apply for borrower defense to re-payment, and that process is missing from the existing regulation. The regulation final-ized by ED also contains significant protec-tions for taxpayers, including the require-ment that schools cannot use arbitration agreements to bar students from bringing borrower defense claims directly against the school in court. It is important to note that these regula-tions do not create a new defense to repay-ment. Congress established the borrower de-fense to repayment in the 1990s. Further-more, over the last two years, ED has cre-ated substantial documentation of what con-stitutes a valid borrower defense claim under the existing regulation. Not only will the de-fense continue to be available, but it is like-ly that claims will continue to be asserted, particularly if regulations surrounding for- profit institutions, such as gainful employ-ment, are loosened, allowing the bad prac-tices of the past to return. Because the de-fense will continue to exist, a formal, trans-parent process to assert the defense, as re-flected in the new repayment rule, is essen-tial. A basic sense of justice requires that the borrower defense to repayment rules be al-lowed to take effect. Millions of students paid tens of thousands of dollars each in fed-eral student loan money to for-profit schools and received worthless degrees in return. Federal student loan debt is non-discharge-able in bankruptcy. These students cannot be left without a clear recourse. The new borrower defense to repayment regulations provide that recourse and should be allowed to take effect. Our extensive experience in the higher edu-cation field, and our participation in the process of developing these recent policies and regulations, gives us unique insight into the abusive and deceptive practices of for- profit schools over the last ten years. We cannot overemphasize the harm to students and taxpayers that a rollback of federal pro-tections would cause. Our offices hear from former for-profit students on a daily basis; sadly, many are hopeless. They have little hope of paying off their student loans with-out the career prospects promised by their schools. They have little hope of continuing their educations without the ability to transfer their credits from the many nation-ally-accredited for-profits to more rigorous regionally-accredited schools. Allowing for- profit schools unfettered access to federal student loan money without reasonable over-sight and accountability is a mistake that American students and taxpayers should not be made to pay for again.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we know what open season means when it comes to these students. Gilbert Caro of Chi-cago can tell us. He was profiled in the Chicago Tribune article that I men-tioned. Gilbert received his master of business administration degree from DeVry University. It is possibly the second largest for-profit college in the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2596 April 27, 2017 
He took on nearly $100,000 in debt for his master of business administration degree. He believed that debt was worth it because it was going to unlock the door to a high-paying job and fi-nancial security. Do you have any idea what Gilbert Caro is doing now with his DeVry mas-ter of business administration degree? He is a prison guard in Joliet, IL. While Gilbert has a good job, he cer-tainly didn’t need $100,000 in debt to be a prison guard. It is far from what he was promised by DeVry when he signed up. Gilbert, like so many other stu-dents who go to for-profit colleges, was lured in by an amazing marketing cam-paign, flashy advertisements and empty promises. In 2016, DeVry University, a for-profit school, agreed to a $100 million settle-ment with the Federal Trade Commis-sion for misleading ‘‘prospective stu-dents with ads that touted high em-ployment success rates and income lev-els upon graduation.’’ DeVry is not alone. For-profit college giants like Corinthian and ITT Tech collapsed after they were caught en-gaging in similar deceptive, disgusting practices. The predatory practices of these and other for-profit colleges have left tens of thousands of students across the country, just like Gilbert Caro, with worthless degrees and a mountain of debt. In fact, during the early part of this century, when for-profit colleges acted with near impunity, just the students from the for-profit colleges and univer-sities accounted for 47 percent of all student loan defaults. Ten percent of the students coming out of high school went to for-profit colleges, and 47 per-cent of the student loan defaults were those same students—10 and 47. Why? Because they were overcharged for worthless degrees. That is why. The University of Phoenix students held almost $35 billion in cumulative debt. When I look at their flashy adver-tising and the commercials about how life is going to be perfect if you sign up at the University of Phoenix, it is hard for me to imagine how many of those students are burdened with debt they will never be able to repay. We also know what open season means for the for-profit college indus-try and its executives and investors. Between 1998 and 2008, enrollment at for-profit colleges exploded by 225 per-cent—a lot of advertising, a lot of mar-keting, a lot of recruiting. With it came exploding profits for these schools. By 2009, the seven largest publicly traded for-profit college companies were worth a combined $51 billion— 2009, $51 billion. In 2010, the University of Phoenix alone enrolled nearly half a million students, more than the combined en-rollment of all the Big Ten univer-sities. When former Senate HELP Com-mittee Chairman Tom Harkin released his seminal report on the industry in 2012, for-profit colleges had grown to take in an incredible $32 billion a year in Federal taxpayer dollars, 25 percent of all Federal aid in education, despite enrolling only 10 percent of the stu-dents that went to college after high school. For-profit colleges and universities are the most heavily subsidized private businesses in America that exist. No one rivals them. No other industry is even close, and 80, 85, 90, 95 percent of the revenue of these so-called private, for-profit universities ends up coming out of the Federal Treasury. John Murphy, the cofounder of the University of Phoenix, talks about those days by saying that what started off as a serious venture to educate stu-dents soon became too focused on ‘‘chasing stock prices.’’ To pump up those stock prices, com-panies needed students and they needed Federal student aid dollars. They proved that they would do and promise nearly anything to get ‘‘the juice,’’ as Mr. M
URPHY , the cofounder of the Uni-versity of Phoenix, called it. Boy, is this industry itching for the Trump administration to return to those bad old days. The Chicago Trib-une reports that since the November 8 election, the stock prices of DeVry University, a for-profit college, have increased 52 percent. In a recent New York Times article by Patricia Cohen entitled ‘‘For-Profit Schools, an Obama Target, See New Day Under Trump,’’ the paid spokes-man for the for-profit college industry, former Congressman Steve Gunderson, said he ‘‘has repeatedly spoken with members of Trump’s transition team . . . White House domestic policy ad-visers . . . and congressional Repub-licans.’’ He is truly an insider. Mr. Gunderson promised: ‘‘We’re going to get some regulatory relief.’’ Sadly, it looks like he is right. Take for example the delay of the gainful employment regulation. The Obama administration spent years writing and rewriting regulations to ensure that career training programs meet the statutory requirement to prepare stu-dents for ‘‘gainful employment.’’ Is that a radical idea—that if the Federal Government is going to pro-vide grants and loans for a student to go to a school, the school should pro-vide education and training that would lead to ‘‘gainful employment’’? My colleague from Oklahoma was on the floor a little while ago talking about overregulation, too many rules, and the impacts on small business. I would say that I am prepared to stand up and defend what the Obama admin-istration did in saying that if you were going to lure a young man like Gilbert Caro into a school and put him $100,000 in debt for a master’s of business ad-ministration, he ought to at least end up with a job that is consistent with his education. Today, Mr. Caro is a prison guard with $100,000 of debt and a business ad-ministration degree of no value to him. The gainful employment rule cuts off title IV funding for programs where graduates’ ratio of student debt to earnings is too high. Literally, the stu-dents are too deeply in debt. Prior to leaving office, the Obama Department of Education released the first set of gainful employment data. It showed that the graduates of public un-dergraduate certificate programs, like community colleges, earn $9,000 more than their for-profit counterparts on average. Think about that. You go to the vir-tually free community college, get a certificate, and you are going to earn $9,000 more than if you get deeply in debt at one of the for-profit schools seeking the same degree. Of the pro-grams that saddle students with too much debt compared to the income its students receive after their program, 98 percent of the violators were for-profit colleges. This is not just a chance occurrence. It is a pattern. The rule is meant to protect students from taking on debt to attend programs that don’t lead to a good-paying job. The rule is also meant to prevent billions in taxpayers’ dollars on worthless programs. Many for-profit colleges receive more than 90 percent of the revenue straight from Federal taxpayers. My Republican colleagues are committed to the free market system. So am I. I am com-mitted to capitalism. I believe in it. Though, I think there is need for us to have regulation when it gets out of hand. That is why we have an antitrust division, for example. In this circumstance, to argue that these are just private companies that are doing what ordinary people do when they start a business is to ignore the obvious. These for-profit colleges could not exist if they weren’t receiv-ing 80, 85, 90, and 95 percent of their revenue directly from the Federal Treasury. In recent testimony before a House subcommittee, the Department of Edu-cation inspector general agreed that the gainful employment regulation ‘‘is a good rule in terms of protecting [stu-dents] and protecting taxpayers.’’ I sent a letter—along with Senators P
ATTY MURRAY , E LIZABETH WARREN , and nine other colleagues—expressing our concerns to Secretary DeVos about her delaying this rule. In our letter, we made clear that these delays under-mine the rule and are going to be a danger to students and taxpayers. It is also a betrayal of students not to ensure that they are treated fairly after they have been taken advantage of by for-profit schools. Today, POLITICO reported that the Trump administration has dramati-cally slowed, if not stopped, processing applications from tens of thousands of students seeking to have their Federal student loans discharged after they have been defrauded by for-profit col-leges. Think about that. A student is about to sign up for a for-profit school.

Maybe he doesn’t know much about higher education. His parents say: Lis-ten, if you can get a Pell grant and a Federal student loan, this must be a really good school. He is defrauded into signing up for a school that is too expensive and offers a worthless degree, and then they turn around and that school goes bankrupt. Now the student has the debt, no de-gree, and we are left holding the bag. What has happened in previous cases is the Federal Government stepped in and discharged the students from the debt if they were defrauded into signing up for the college. Secretary Betsy DeVos has decided to slow that down—to slow down the discharge of these students’ debt. Stu-dents who were misled or defrauded by their schools are eligible for discharge of their Federal student loans under the Higher Education Act—the law as it now exists. Yet during her confirma-tion process, Secretary DeVos would not commit to providing this relief to students—relief already specified in law—and has now effectively stopped processing the claims. On the day before President Trump took office, more than 3,200 Illinois students applied to the Department of Education for relief. While the Depart-ment fails to process these claims, these students are left in the lurch. It adds insult to injury that students taken advantage of by for-profit col-leges, nominally supervised and regu-lated by the Federal Government, are now being ignored by the Federal Gov-ernment’s Department of Education. That is unacceptable. It is unfair, and the Trump administration should change it. We’ve started to see the true colors of the administration and Secretary DeVos when it comes to these students who have been victimized. As feared, the Department has thus far put for- profit and other commercial interests ahead of students and taxpayers. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B

T–45 GOSHAWK FLEET  
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about a troubling issue for our Navy, our national de-fense, and a problem that should be of concern to Members of this body. Our Navy pilot training installations, in-cluding Naval Air Station Meridian in my home State of Mississippi, produce some of the finest pilots on the planet. They trained on the T–45 Goshawk. On Friday, March 31, a significant number of T–45 instructor pilots at NAS Meridian, NAS Kingsville in Texas, and NAS Pensacola in Florida decided not to fly because of safety concerns. As you can imagine, this was an almost unprecedented act and brought considerable attention to a problem plaguing the Navy’s tactical fighter community: a dramatic and sustained increase in so-called physio-logical episodes, or PE events, across the FA–18 Hornet, the EA–18 Growler, and the training jet T–45 Goshawk fleets. Physiological episodes occur when air crew experience diminished inflight performance related to loss or con-tamination of oxygen, depressurization in the cockpit, or other factors. There are some technical terms I am going to mention to my colleagues. Hypoxic hy-poxia occurs when pilots are getting in-sufficient oxygen. A more serious phe-nomenon called histotoxic hypoxia oc-curs when they are breathing contami-nated oxygen, and of course depressuri-zation occurs when the cabin pressure drops. I have been assured that solving this physiological episode problem is now naval aviation’s No. 1 one safety pri-ority. As chairman of the Armed Serv-ices Committee’s Seapower Sub-committee, I intend to continue the committee’s oversight on this issue and, if necessary, include provisions in the upcoming Defense authorization bill to help. I applaud the work of our full committee chairman, Senator MCCAIN, on his efforts so far. In fact, Senator M
CCAINknows NAS Meridian very well, having served there as an in-structor pilot. The airfield named ‘‘McCain Field’’ is in honor of Senator M
CCAIN’s grandfather, ADM John McCain. The Navy has told Congress and the American people repeatedly that its ef-fort to mitigate and solve the problems of these PE events, including histotoxic hypoxia, are ‘‘resource un-constrained.’’ In other words, the Navy has told us that money is no object in solving this problem, time is no object, and personnel is no object. As chair-man of the Seapower Subcommittee, I intend to put that claim to test. I would like to update my colleagues on the situation—my factfinding trip to Meridian, the state of play, and the plan going forward. Beginning around 2010, a significant increase in reported PE events oc-curred, which led to the establishment of a Physiological Episode Team to identify root causes, develop mitiga-tion efforts and solutions. This team mainly addressed the less serious prob-lem of hypoxic hypoxia, but in recent months, there has been an alarming uptick in histotoxic hypoxia, a rel-atively new phenomenon involving con-taminated oxygen in the cockpit. This has presented new challenges. The Navy has not identified a root cause for either type of hypoxia but has taken steps to mitigate effects through new maintenance rules, equipment changes and redesigns, and by adding data col-lection tools. However, there is cur-rently not adequate mitigation for the more serious type of hypoxia, which has led to this halt in training. As a search for the root causes con-tinues, data collection is worth stress-ing. These aircraft do not have auto-matic sensors. In effect, the pilot is the sensor. Maximizing data collection on every training flight is critical. The collection of more data can help in the analytical effort, which will get us closer to finding the root cause. After the instructor pilots’ boycott—which I stress they had every right to do—the Navy issued a safety standdown and stopped all training flights for a period of days. This tactical pause allowed the Navy to send senior leadership to visit the training installations and hear di-rectly from the instructor pilots and students. I respect the considered deci-sions of both of these groups, the in-structor pilots who continued to fly and the ones who engaged in the boy-cott. After meeting with Pentagon experts on this matter, I then made a fact-finding trip to NAS Meridian on April 8. I met with VADM Mike Shoemaker, the commander of Naval Air Forces. Admiral Shoemaker is the air boss who commands operational naval aviation forces. I also met with RADM Dell Bull, who is the chief of Naval Air Training, and I met with NAS Merid-ian’s excellent installation leadership. Perhaps most important, I convened two focus groups: one group of instruc-tor pilots who chose to fly and another group who chose not to fly. Both groups agree that a serious commu-nication problem existed. The meetings with pilots demonstrated that some in the Navy hierarchy did not fully appre-ciate that this histotoxic hypoxia, con-taminated oxygen, was a new and dif-ferent phenomenon. In addition, the ef-forts of the Navy leadership were not being communicated effectively to the instructors and the students. In other words, the message was not getting down to the flight line, and the people on the flight line did not feel the mes-sage was getting back up to the hier-archy. Many felt their concerns were being ignored. The lack of action on the relatively new emergence of histotoxic hypoxia in the Goshawk only exacerbated the feeling among some that the Navy’s actions were not matching its rhetoric. Following my visit on April 8, the Navy took the important step of estab-lishing a Physiological Episode Team for the T–45 alone. This is an important action which should bring more focused attention to the Goshawk community. The Navy ended the safety standdown on April 14 and resumed flying the next week under restricted conditions, such as flying at lower maximum altitudes and pulling fewer Gs. Of course, this is not the optimal way of training. Then, following a subsequent PE in-cident in Kingsville and feedback from instructor pilots on the mitigation plan, the Navy has chosen to restrict training flights even further. This is a problem. The Navy tells us the current practice would allow a student to com-plete only about 20 to 25 percent of the curriculum. That is the status today. The Navy is already short on pilots, and continuing the status quo could further constrict the pilot production pipeline. Where do we go from here? The Navy has brought three T–45s that have ex-perienced physiological episodes to

Naval Air Station Patuxent River, MD, for extensive engineering investigation and analysis. They are taking the air-planes apart at Pax River. I applaud this action. Initial results of the test-ing should be available next week with more information to follow as the data is processed. At the same time, engi-neers have teamed up with pilots from both the test community and the train-ing command, including at least one Meridian instructor pilot. They are in-vestigating possible mitigations, such as alterations to pilot masks. This will allow our instructors and student pi-lots to get back to what they want to do most; that is, to fly and train new pilots to fly. In addition, on April 21, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Moran, di-rected Admiral Scott Swift, com-mander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, to lead a month-long review of the facts, circumstances, and processes sur-rounding the recent episodes and how the Navy has addressed them. The Swift review will evaluate the Navy’s organizational structures and processes and make recommendations for addi-tional action. These efforts are desperately needed. Still, we have no real diagnosis. Still, we have no real solution in the works. Senators should know this: As of 3 weeks ago, problems with histotoxic hypoxia at our naval training bases have earned the full attention of the top leadership in the Navy. These prob-lems also have the full attention and oversight of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Seapower Sub-committee. I look forward to continued inter-action with the Navy leadership on this very important issue. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. 
ANTIQUITIES ACT  
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate an important day for Utah and the western way of life. Just yesterday, the President signed an Ex-ecutive order calling for review of monument designations across the United States, with a specific focus on two national monuments that have caused significant damage in my home State of Utah: Bears Ears and the Grand Staircase-Escalante. Yesterday’s Executive action is the culmination of countless hours of hard work and close coordination with the White House. When I first spoke with President Trump in the Oval Office during his first week on the job, I asked for his help in addressing the Bears Ears debacle. From day one, our President has been committed to help-ing us fix this disaster and ensuring that our smallest counties get a fair shake. Throughout my Senate service, I have fought to give voice to the needs of our rural communities in the debate over public lands. Too often, past Presidents have ignored the concerns of Utah’s families in declaring massive monuments that threaten the western way of life. Too often, Presidents have abused the authority under the Antiq-uities Act to satisfy the demands of an extreme environmental agenda but no more. Following yesterday’s Executive order, I look forward to working with the Trump administration to address past abuses and restore the original meaning of the Antiquities Act. The Executive order directs Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke to review dozens of national monuments. This is a wel-comed opportunity to set a new prece-dent for the responsible use of the An-tiquities Act—a precedent that will take into account the needs of locals and foster greater trust between the States and the Federal Government as we work toward a shared goal of pre-serving our cultural antiquities. For decades, I have sought to rein in Executive abuse under the Antiquities Act. That is why I traveled to Bears Ears just last week to hear firsthand from the local residents and Tribal members who have been hurt most by this monument designation. That is why, in the opening days of his Presi-dency, I met personally with President Trump in the Oval Office to discuss the public lands issue at length. I made clear to the President that Utahns have had enough of monument designa-tions that come down unilaterally with zero support from locals, State offi-cials, or Congress. Many of my own constituents have had their lives up-ended by this abuse of Executive power. For too long, Utahns—many of whom depend on public lands for their very livelihood—have been at the mercy of out-of-touch bureaucrats who have lit-tle knowledge or personal connection to the land. President Obama only made their situation worse when he spurned the men and women of San Juan County by declaring the Bears Ears National Monument last Decem-ber. In doing so, he defied the will of the State legislature, the Governor, and the entire Utah congressional dele-gation. President Obama’s last-minute monument designation imposed even greater land use restrictions on a re-gion that is already predominately controlled by the Federal Government. As I have said before, in opposing the Bears Ears National Monument des-ignation, I am in no way opposing the protection of lands that need to be pro-tected. Indeed, there are many cultural sites in Utah that warrant preserva-tion, and I am committed to working with the President and with Congress to protect those sacred places for fu-ture generations. But as I have also said previously, I believe that it is both unlawful and undemocratic for any President to seize millions upon mil-lions of acres of land through the An-tiquities Act—a law that was geared to give the President only narrow author-ity to designate special landmarks, such as a unique national arch or the site of old cliff dwellings. We desperately need a new process for creating national monuments. Con-gress and impacted local communities, not the President alone, should have a say in decisions that restrict access to millions of acres of federally owned land. In making such decisions, the voice of the people is paramount. Let me be clear: Abusing the Antiq-uities Act at the expense of local com-munities is not a sustainable public lands strategy. This strategy is counterintuitive because it puts Antiq-uities Act authority at great risk. The Antiquities Act was designed to pro-vide specific protections for objects of antiquity, but out West, particularly in Utah, the law has become synonymous with land grabs and Federal overreach. Restoring the legitimacy of Antiq-uities Act authority in the eyes of westerners requires a more measured approach to monument designations, an approach that takes into account the needs of locals and restores trust between States and the Federal Gov-ernment. To be clear, I have no objection when Presidents use the Antiquities Act ac-cording to its original purpose, which was to protect cultural antiquities by designating the minimum acreage nec-essary. Take, for example, the great State of Washington, which is home to several national monuments that were created in line with the law’s original intent. The State’s beautiful San Juan Islands cover only 970 acres, while the Hanford Reach encompasses 195,000 acres. At first glance, this amount of acreage may seem large, but compared to Utah’s two most prominent national monuments, it is a tiny speck on the map. In fact, the total acreage of the San Juan Islands and Hanford Reach combined is only 6 percent of the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase- Escalante National Monuments. In the State of Washington, Presi-dents have used the Antiquities Act within reason. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for my home State of Utah, where Presidents have repeat-edly abused their authority under the law to declare eight national monu-ments that together span more than 3.3 million acres. In Utah, national monu-ments cover roughly 10 percent of all Federal land in a State where 67 per-cent of the land is already owned and dominated by the Federal Government. By contrast, only 28 percent of the land in the State of Washington is owned by the Federal Government. Of that Fed-eral land, only 1.6 percent is locked away as a national monument. It is no wonder, then, that Utahns feel more threatened by the Antiquities Act than Washingtonians. This is a law that past Presidents have brandished as a weap-on to cut up entire sections of our State. This is far from the first time I have taken to the floor to speak out against Antiquities Act abuse. It certainly won’t be the last. But I am encouraged by yesterday’s Executive order with President Trump and Secretary Zinke

on our side. I believe we can plot a path forward to correct past abuses and forge a new precedent for future monu-ment designations. The President’s Executive action sig-nifies a critical milestone in the effort to include local voices in the manage-ment of our public lands. As the Trump administration reviews various na-tional monuments, we must replace the top-down approach of past administra-tions with a grassroots strategy that engages local leaders, State officials, and Members of Congress in the deci-sion-making process. Bringing all stakeholders to the table is essential to establish a new precedent that will undo the decades of abuse we have en-dured under, I think, false interpreta-tions of the Antiquities Act. I am eager to continue working with the President and the Secretary of the Interior to preserve our Nation’s cul-tural treasures in a way that honors the original meaning of the Antiquities Act. I am likewise eager to involve locals in that process. With all parties working together, I firmly believe we can restore a relationship of trust be-tween the States and the Federal Gov-ernment in the management of public lands. I am grateful for a President who is willing to work with us to reset the status quo. Better than any of his pred-ecessors, President Trump understands the lasting damage wrought by past Presidents under the Antiquities Act. Indeed, in all my years of public serv-ice, I have never seen a President so committed to reining in the Federal Government and so eager to address the problems caused by these over-reaching monument designations. I wish to thank President Trump and Secretary Zinke for taking concrete steps to rein in abuse through yester-day’s Executive order. I also wish to thank the President’s Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, who helped make yesterday’s victory pos-sible. Reince has done exceptionally well in one of the toughest jobs in all of Washington. The President is lucky to have Reince in the White House. I am lucky to call him a friend. I also wish to thank my former chief of staff, Ron Porter, who is now a spe-cial assistant to the President and the Staff Secretary at the White House. Rob is an invaluable asset to the Presi-dent’s team and ours as well. Without him, yesterday’s Executive order would never have come to fruition, at least in my opinion. Rob was among the finest men ever to serve as my chief of staff. I have enjoyed watching him succeed at the White House. Yesterday we took a meaningful first step to fix past abuses under the Antiq-uities Act. Yet there is still much work to be done, and I look forward to work-ing with the White House every step of the way. With that, I am grateful for all those who have participated in helping us to right the wrongs that have been going on for far too long, as some of the Presidents have played pure politics with public lands at the expense of the States involved, especially my State. It is easy to pick on a State that is 67 percent owned by the Federal Govern-ment and up to well over 70 percent owned by the Federal and State gov-ernments. It is easy to pick on these States—a small State indeed. But our State is resilient. We have some of the better people in Congress, and we also have the ability to be able to raise all kinds of hell here. All I can say is that I just want my State treated fairly. I want to make sure the bureaucrats here in Wash-ington don’t walk all over the West be-cause they think they can because of the wide expanses of territory and the many, many other aspects of the West-ern States that make them vulnerable to this type of inappropriate activity. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
VA ACCOUNTABILITY  
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, one goal we share in this body, which is a very bipartisan goal, is keeping faith with our veterans, making sure no vet-eran is left behind. I had the great honor to work as ranking member with Senator I
SAKSON , the chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, on a bill called the Vet-erans First Act that unfortunately failed to cross the finish line during the last session. One of the major goals of that bill was to ensure account-ability at the Department of Veterans Affairs so employees of the VA who fail to do their job are held accountable. That goal of accountability is one of a number that must be pursued and will be sought during this session, including ending the backlog of appeals and pro-viding better healthcare, ensuring skills training and job opportunities for our veterans. Today the President signed an Execu-tive order at the Department of Vet-erans Affairs to designate an individual responsible for accountability and whistleblower protection, a worthwhile first step. It is a commendable step to-ward accountability. But that indi-vidual and the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection must have real responsibility and power and must be insulated from any kind of po-litical interference through establish-ment through statute. That office should be established by statutory au-thority. That is why I will be advo-cating and likely introducing legisla-tion that involves supporting and training employees and listening to veterans about what they want from the VA through that Office of Account-ability and Whistleblower Protection, to provide real accountability to the Congress by requiring reporting to Congress about what it finds and real whistleblower protection, so that any-body who complains about the VA’s misdirected or misguided action is as-sured protection against any kind of revenge or retaliation, which is the es-sence of whistleblower protection, and a Senate-confirmed director so that the accountability function is, again, ac-countable to us. That kind of statutory embodiment is necessary to make sure that the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection has power and reporting requirements so that it is accountable to us as elected rep-resentatives and advocates for our vet-erans. My hope is that the Senate and House will adopt that provision, one that was contained in the Veterans First bill that Senator ISAKSON and I championed during the last Senate and which I hope we will pursue again in a very bipartisan way. I also hope that the Senate will take up and pass S. 12, the Increasing the Department of Veterans Affairs Ac-countability to Veterans Act of 2017. My colleague, Senator M
ORAN , a co-sponsor with me, spoke about it earlier today. It would provide reduction of benefits for senior executives and cer-tain healthcare employees of the De-partment of Veterans Affairs if they have been convicted of a felony in con-nection with their work. VA employees who commit serious crimes in connec-tion with their employment should not be receiving pensions. That is one of the key provisions to activate a deter-rent to misconduct and also to assure that misconduct is adequately pun-ished. Accountability for leaders who man-age the Department of Veterans Affairs Employee Affairs would be another goal of this legislation, S. 12, so that the men and women who hire and fire are themselves evaluated when they do those jobs. These kinds of details are impor-tant—as important as any new office with an individual whose unspecified powers may include them or not. Right now they do not, under the Executive order, specifically include such enu-merated powers. That is our job, to make sure that this office of account-ability is real in its responsibility, is clearly assigned in its functions, is held accountable for its performance and has real teeth, not just rhetoric. I am hopeful that we will move ahead with this very, very important office to make sure that our veterans receive what they deserve—real account-ability, a genuine assurance that the people who serve them will do their jobs, not just adequately but excel-lently. That is the goal that I believe we will share. I welcome this Executive order. I be-lieve we can and must do more to make sure that the VA keeps faith with our veterans and leaves no veterans behind. Thank you, Mr. President.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST —JOINT  
RESOLUTION  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, col-leagues, it is my understanding that the four corners who are working on the omnibus appropriations are very, very close to agreement. We still need a few days to process the larger bill. The House has posted a 1-week CR to keep the government open. We are pre-pared to clear the 1-week CR on this side of the aisle. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the text of a joint resolution, which is at the desk—that is, a 1-week continuing resolution—be printed in the RECORD ; further, that if the Senate receives a joint resolution from the House, the text of which is identical to the text of the joint resolution printed in the R
ECORD , the joint resolution be considered to have been read three times and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered to have been made and laid upon the table; pro-vided further, that if the language is not identical, then this order be viti-ated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, re-serving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, col-leagues, I am objecting because we still have to resolve the issue of poison pill riders before Democrats can agree to the short-term CR. Let’s make no mistake about it, we are indeed making great progress. I thank the majority leader. He has been cooperative and extremely helpful throughout the process. I thank Chair-man C
OCHRAN and Senator L EAHY the same. But our position has been clear, and it is nothing new: no poison pill riders. The sooner we can resolve this issue, the quicker we can have an agreement on appropriations for 2017. So I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. The majority leader. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I would only add—not to prolong the dis-cussion, but I don’t think the failure to pass the 1-week CR necessarily impacts in a positive way the concerns the Democratic leader has. But that is his call to make. This 1-week CR is cleared on our side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, there is a simple way to resolve it, and that is, the Republican leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the House just agree to no poison pill riders. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Kansas. Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I sug-gest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M

CCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to make sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that if we don’t pass the 1-week extension, the miners’ healthcare expires, but it is in the 1-week extension. If we don’t pass the 1-week extension, the miners’ healthcare revision expires. Mr. SCHUMER. We are aware. Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to table the motion to recon-sider. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to.

25TH ANNIVERSARY VERMONT SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Vermont Small Business Development Center, VtSBDC, is joining SBDC’s across the country in celebrating its 25th anniversary as a crucial resource for entrepreneurs. These centers pro-vide services to facilitate the creation, sustainability, and growth of viable businesses. In Vermont, it is no secret that we take particular pride in our local businesses. Our entrepreneurs and their businesses are at the heart of our vibrant communities, and they are the roots of a thriving economy. Over the past 25 years, VtSBDC has helped countless businesses capitalize on their potential. From glassblowers to forestry and sugarmakers to res-taurants, VtSBDC has delivered thou-sands of hours of professional business counseling and training that is focused on strategic planning, business devel-opment, financial planning, and cash flow management. After the devasta-tion of Tropical Storm Irene, VtSBDC reached out with State and Federal partners to offer small business owners the assistance and support necessary to undergo full recovery efforts. I am reg-ularly reminded of VtSBDC’s worth to entrepreneurs through client testimonials, regularly highlighting that, without the assistance of VtSBDC staff, their business would not have been able to reach the next levels. In addition to working with individuals to achieve their dreams, VtSBDC has also supported business incubators, or coworking spaces, where fledgling busi-nesses and industries find their footing alongside other new businessowners. Founded as a pilot program run by the Small Business Administration in 1977, national small business develop-ment centers have a long history prov-ing public-private partnerships and,

when done right, are a successful tool in expanding local pilot programs that benefit communities and States across our Nation.

I want to congratulate the Vermont Small Business Development Center on their 25th anniversary and thank their dedicated staff for their commitment, energy, and time working to make sure that Vermont’s small businesses re-main strongly grounded and growing in Vermont.

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for April 2017. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, S.Con.Res. 3. This information is nec-essary for the Senate Budget Com-mittee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending leg-islation. The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Con-gressional Budget Office, CBO, pre-pared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. My last filing can be found in the R
ECORD on March 1, 2017. The informa-tion contained in this report captures legislative activity since that filing through April 25, 2017. Republican Budget Committee staff prepared Tables 1–3 of this report. Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee ex-ceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the most recently adopted budget resolu-tion. This information is used for en-forcing committee allocations pursu-ant to section 302 of the CBA. For this reporting period, 14 of the 16 author-izing committees are in compliance with their allocations. The two com-mittees out of compliance are: the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, for spending $1 million more in budget authority and outlays than allowed over each enforcement window due to passage of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017, P.L. 115–10; and the Committee on Vet-erans Affairs, which violates its outlay allocation by $200 million over both the fiscal year 2017–2021 and fiscal year 2017–2026 periods. The latter violation— the largest of this reporting period— stems from passage of a bill to amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and Ac-countability Act of 2014 to modify the termination date for the Veterans Choice Program, and for other pur-poses, P.L. 115–26. This measure re-moved the August 7, 2017, sunset from the program to allow funds previously appropriated to be fully exhausted. Tables 2–3 remain unchanged from the last report as no new appropria-tions activity has occurred for the fis-cal year 2017 cycle. In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget totals approved by the Congress. CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017, which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA section 311. In its report, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the latest con-tinuing resolution, which provides funding through April 28, 2017. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the com-mittee views current-law levels as being $953 billion and $583.2 billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respec-tively. Revenues are consistent with the lev-els assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017. Over the fiscal year 2017–2021 and fiscal year 2017–2026 pe-riod, however, revenues are $1 million below assumed levels due to the enact-ment of H.J. Res. 83, P.L. 115–21, a reso-lution considered under the Congres-sional Review Act for disapproving of the rule by the Department of Labor relating to ‘‘Clarification of Employ-er’s Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness.’’ Social Security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in S.Con.Res. 3. CBO’s report also provides informa-tion needed to enforce the Senate pay- as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate’s PAYGO scorecard currently shows in-creased deficits of $202 million over the fiscal year 2016–2021 and fiscal year 2016–2026 periods. For both of these pe-riods, outlays have been increased by $201 million, and revenues have been reduced by $1 million. The Senate’s PAYGO rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con.Res.21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate’s budget enforcement activity on the floor. No budget points of order have been raised since my last filing. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the ta-bles be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The enclosed report shows the effects of Congressional action on the fiscal year 2017 budget and is current through April 25, 2017. This report is sub-mitted under section 308(b) and in aid of sec-tion 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended. The estimates of budget authority, out-lays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017. Since our last letter dated March 1, 2017, the Congress has cleared and the President has signed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–10). That act has signifi-cant effects on budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 2017. Sincerely, K

Includes the budgetary effects of enacted legislation cleared by the Congress during the 114th session, prior to the adoption o f S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017. Emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget a nd Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes.

cDivision A of P.L. 114–254 contains the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding for those agencies within the jurisdiction of 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills through April 28, 2017; those amounts are shown under the ‘‘Continuing Resolution’’ section of this table. Certain provisions in Division A provide funding until or beyond the end of fiscal year 2017; those amounts are shown in the ‘‘Previously Enacted’’ section of this table. In addition, Division B of P.L. 114–254 contains the Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding until or  beyond the end of fiscal year 2017 for overseas contingency operations; those amounts are shown under the ‘‘Previously Enacted’’ section of this table. 
dSections 193–195 of Division A of P.L. 114–254 provided funding, available until expended, for innovation projects and state re sponses to opioid abuse. CBO estimates that, for fiscal year 2017: The $20 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 193 would result in an additional $5 million in outlays f or FDA innovation projects; The $352 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 194 would result in an additional $91 million in outlays  for NIH innovation projects; The $500 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 195 would result in an additional $160 million in outlay s for state response to opioid abuse. Consistent with sections 1001–1004 of P.L. 114–255, for the purposes of estimating the discretionary budget authority and outla ys for these provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Act of 1985, these amounts are estimated to provide no budget authority or outlays. 
eFor purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate,  does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level does not include these items. 
fExcludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in outlays assumed in S. Con.

This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally that has been, and continues to be, an important force for polit-ical stability and economic progress. Greece intends to use these defense articles and services to modernize its armed forces by in-creasing its rotary-wing transport capa-bility. This will contribute to the Greek military’s goal to upgrade its capability while further enhancing greater interoper-ability between Greece, the U.S. and other allies. The proposed sale of this equipment and support does not alter the basic military bal-ance in the region. There is no principal contractor as the sys-tems will be coming from U.S. Army stocks. There are no known offset agreements pro-posed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S. Government or contractor rep-resentatives to travel to Greece for equip-ment de-processing/fielding, system check-out and new equipment training. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.

The total estimated cost is $137.6 million. This sale will contribute to the foreign pol-icy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a major contributor to political stability, se-curity, and economic development in the Western Pacific. Australia is an important Major non-NATO Ally and partner that con-tributes significantly to peacekeeping and humanitarian operations around the world. It is vital to the U.S. national interest to as-sist our ally in developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense capability. Australia is requesting these missiles for its Electronic Attack EA–18G Growler air-craft. The proposed sale will improve Aus-tralia’s capability in current and future coa-lition efforts. Australia will use this capa-bility as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. Aus-tralia will have no difficulty absorbing these additional missiles into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support does not alter the basic military bal-ance in the region. The prime contractors will be Orbital ATK (OA), Ridgecrest, CA, and Raytheon Missile Systems Company, Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connec-tion with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to travel to Australia. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. TRANSMITTAL NO . 17–11 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The AGM–88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) weapon system is an air-to-ground missile intended to suppress or destroy land or sea-based radar emitters associated with enemy air defenses and pro-vides tactical air forces with a lethal coun-termeasure to enemy radar directed, surface- to-air missiles, and air defense artillery weapons systems. Destruction or suppression of enemy radars denies the enemy the use of air defense systems, thereby improving the survivability of our tactical aircraft. It uses a multimode seeker that incorporates global positioning system/inertial measurement unit (GPS/IMU) midcourse guidance, a radio frequency (RF) radiation homing receiver, an active millimeter wave seeker, an Inte-grated Broadcast Service Receiver (IBS–R) and a Weapons Impact Assessment (WIA) transmitter.

Destruction or suppression of enemy radars denies the enemy the use of air defense systems, thereby improving the survivability of our tactical aircraft. The AGM–88B HARM when assembled is classi-fied CONFIDENTIAL. The HARM Guidance Section (seeker hardware), and Control Sec-tion with the Target Detector are classified CONFIDENTIAL. 3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements of this pos-sible sale, the information could be used to develop countermeasures which might re-duce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 4. A determination has been made that the Government of Australia can provide sub-stantially the same degree of protection for the technology being released as the US Gov-ernment. The sale is necessary in further-ance of the US foreign policy and national security objectives as outlined in the Policy Justification of the notification. 5.

ANTIQUITIES ACT Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, appar-ently the Trump administration couldn’t let its first 100 days go by without going after America’s National Monuments. Anybody who cares about protecting some of the greatest treas-ures in Oregon and across the country ought to be worried. The President is lining up an Execu-tive order requiring a review of the boundaries of all National Monuments designated since 1996. It might sound bureaucratic, but it is more than that. The President’s Executive order is a short-sighted attempt to roll back pro-tections for some of America’s most cherished landscapes. The Executive order flies in the face of a century-old tradition that has en-sured generations of Americans can enjoy natural treasures like the Cas-cade-Siskiyou National Monument in my home State. Colleagues, for over 100 years, Presi-dents from both parties have used au-thority granted by the Antiquities Act to permanently protect special Federal lands as National Monuments, to pre-serve natural, cultural, and historic values for the benefit of everyone. Two of Oregon’s most cherished areas were established as National Monuments through the Antiquities Act: Oregon Caves and Cascade-Siskiyou. Both of these areas have a remarkable diverse range of biological, geological, and his-toric objects. I am proud to have worked with President Clinton to establish the original boundaries of the Cascade- Siskiyou National Monument in 2000. I am proud to have worked with Senator MERKLEY to expand the monument ear-lier this year and to expand the bound-ary of the Oregon Caves National Monument in 2014. There are two important points to make about this debate. First, it is important that the indi-viduals who live near and recreate on these lands have an opportunity to make their voices heard. As public lands everywhere, they ultimately be-long to all of the people. Some people, the President included, say these monuments are an example of overreach and designated without the right process. On this issue, the President is wrong. These monuments are not the result of administrative overreach. The bound-aries of these monuments are based on years of collaboration between the ad-ministration, States, and local stake-holders. The second point to make is about rural economies. National Monuments, National Parks, and public lands across the United States are important eco-nomic generators for rural commu-nities. According to a report released just this week, public lands generate bil-lions of dollars in consumer spending and millions of jobs every year. In Or-egon, the outdoor recreation economy generated $12.8 billion in consumer spending in 2012 and over 140,000 direct jobs. Nationally, the numbers are even bigger; in 2012, the outdoor rec econ-omy generated $889 billion nationwide and over 7 and a half million jobs. Colleagues, there is an agenda behind this Executive order, and it puts some of our greatest outdoor treasures and a lot of jobs in danger. Some members of this administra-tion—including the Secretary of the In-terior—have said the right things about public lands, and that was reas-suring to millions of people who care about recreation. I hope it wasn’t just talk, and I certainly hope the Presi-dent’s Executive order is not the first step in dismantling America’s National Monuments and public lands. f 
70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ‘‘EXO-DUS 1947’’’S ARRIVAL IN HAIFA Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, July 18, 2017, marks the 70th anniversary of the day that the ship Exodus 1947 arrived in Haifa, Israel. The story of Exodus 1947 is as impor-tant today as it was 70 years ago. In 1947, the world was horrified and out-raged by the British policy of violently preventing Holocaust survivors from reaching Palestine and forcing their re-turn to Europe and refugee camps in Germany. Watching the British Navy ram the Exodus 1947, which had 4,515 Holocaust survivors on board, inflamed world opinion and prompted the United Nations Special Committee on Pal-estine, UNSCOP, to scrutinize the ac-tions of the British. Eventually the British were forced to end their policy of preventing Jewish immigration to Israel, and the State of Israel was born. Why is the story of the Exodus 1947 so important that we are still talking about it 70 years later? After all, geo-political transitions have launched multiple large-scale refugee migrations around the world in the 20th century, including Armenians in 1915, Russians in 1917, Chinese in 1949, Hindus from Pakistan and Muslims from India in 1947, East Germans between 1945 and 1961, Bosnians in the 1990s, Rwandans in 1994, Syrians in 2016—and many more. The story of the Exodus 1947 is impor-tant to remember and consider today because it reminds us of our responsi-bility to protect human rights, help people outside of our own borders, stand up for Americans values, and work with our allies and international organizations to advance our goals. It reminds us that our work is not fin-ished. It reminds us that, while it was the Jews on the Exodus 1947 70 years ago, political outrages around the world continue to require our leader-ship and our action. As a U.S. Senator from Maryland and vigilant friend of the Chesapeake Bay and Maryland’s Maritime history, I would like to highlight the fact that, prior to its service in support of Jewish refugees from the Holocaust, the Exo-dus 1947 was called the President War-field and it sailed the Chesapeake Bay for the Baltimore Steam Packet Com-pany. The President Warfield changed hands many times, from the Baltimore Steam Packet Company to the British Navy to the U.S. Navy to the Potomac Shipwrecking Company, which was ac-tually acting as clandestine purchasing agents of the Haganah who wanted the

ship because the conditions that made it ideal for navigating the Chesapeake Bay, shifting sand of 3 feet or less in depth, made it ideal for getting immi-grants quickly and closely up to the coastal areas of Palestine. After the Haganah secured the ship, she was retrofitted in Baltimore from where she sailed towards France to pick up 4,515 Holocaust the refugees and deposit them in Palestine—a plan which was destroyed after the British rammed the ship, prevented the refu-gees from disembarking in Palestine, detained them in inhumane conditions, and eventually returned them to Ger-many. The world witnessed the inhumane treatment of the Exodus’s passengers and some righteous people cried out. We continue to talk about the Exodus 1947 to remind ourselves never to forget both our suffering and our empower-ment. I would like to acknowledge all who have made the creation of this memo-rial possible. Along with a series of as-sociated commemorative projects, the Exodus 1947 memorial is the culmina-tion of decades of tireless effort by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, JASHP, to recognize the historic events that led to the forma-tion of Israel. In particular, I applaud the work of Dr. Barry S. Lever, chair-man of the 50th Anniversary Com-memoration of the Final Voyage of the SS President Warfied—Exodus 1947, the Jewish Museum of Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay Museum, and the indi-viduals and organizations here and abroad who have aided in the efforts to honor the Exodus 1947 and its pas-sengers. Thank you.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LEWISTON-AUBURN ROTARY CLUB Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on May 1, 1917, the International Association of Rotary Clubs welcomed a new member into its growing global network of neighbors, friends, and leaders working together for positive change in their communities and around the world. I rise today to celebrate the 100th anni-versary of the Rotary Club of Lewis-ton-Auburn in my home State of Maine. There are more than 35,000 Rotary Clubs worldwide. The Lewiston-Auburn club was the 291st to be chartered and is part of the first great wave of expan-sion that took the Rotary movement from major American cities to smaller communities and to Canada and Eu-rope. It is remarkable that what began as a small group of civic leaders in Chi-cago in 1905 has grown to a service or-ganization of 1.2 million dedicated members in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. In any language, Rotarians live up to their motto of ‘‘Service Above Self.’’ Rotary International is a powerful force for good around the world. The global effort to eradicate polio is con-sidered to be the most successful public health campaign in human history, one that would not be possible without Ro-tary’s commitment. When Rotary launched its PolioPlus program back in 1985, it was described as a ‘‘gift from the 20th century to the 21st.’’ It has been just that. In addition to its strong support for PolioPlus, the Lewiston-Auburn Club is part of a Rotary International effort to make affordable and safe water more widely available in Haiti. As a result of this effort, a tanker truck was pur-chased to address this great humani-tarian need. Locally, the Lewiston-Auburn Ro-tary Club has a special focus on fami-lies and children. The club has been a leader in the creation of Lewiston’s Universally Accessible Playground, which will provide recreation for all, regardless of physical or developmental limitations. The club also sponsors an annual event to benefit the Autism So-ciety of Maine and awards scholarships to area high-school graduates pursuing higher education. ‘‘Service Above Self’’ has a special meaning to the members of the Lewis-ton-Auburn Rotary. The application for membership in Rotary Inter-national was signed on March, 21, 1917, by Frank W. Hulett of Lewiston. On June 6, 1918, Captain Hulett gave his life in the defense of freedom during the World War I Battle of Belleau Wood in France. Hulett Square in Lewiston, the Frank W. Hulett VFW Post, and the Lewiston-Auburn Rotary Club all help to preserve the memory of this great hero. When Paul Harris led the way in founding Rotary International 112 years ago, he said this: ‘‘Whatever Ro-tary may mean to us, to the world it will be known by the results it achieves.’’ The results are inspiring and the world is grateful. The Rotary Club of Lewiston-Auburn, ME, is part of that effort, and I congratulate its members for this accomplishments and contributions. Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 100th anni-versary of the Rotary Club of Lewis-ton-Auburn, ME. There are over 35,000 Rotary Clubs worldwide, with the LA Rotary being the 291st. Since 1917, the LA Rotary has demonstrated a com-mitment to community and global service by supporting local organiza-tions, awarding scholarships to local students, and providing clean water to communities in Haiti. In their 100 years of service, this exceptional orga-nization has gained members who rep-resent the unique and diverse business community of the Lewiston-Auburn area. The LA Rotary was founded by Cap-tain Frank W. Hulett, who gave his life during WWI on June 6, 1918, at the Bat-tle of Belleau Wood in France. Since Captain Hulett signed the application for membership of Rotary Inter-national on March 21, 1917, the LA Ro-tary has made great contributions to the worldwide Rotary organization of business and professional leaders. The LA Rotary has upheld an international presence by providing humanitarian service, encouraging high ethical standards in all vocations, and helping to build and maintain goodwill and peace throughout the world. I applaud the LA Rotary’s emphasis on local and global charity and giving back to their local communities. The LA Rotary is sponsored by the many donors who attend their successful fundraisers, including one that takes place at the famous Lewiston Hot Air Balloon Festival. The money raised from these fundraisers has gone to-wards several valuable projects like the Autism Movie Events, an ongoing project in partnership with a local movie theatre and the Autism Society of Maine. The LA Rotary has sustained their all-inclusive pattern by donating to the construction of the Lewiston Universally Accessible Playground Project. The playground will be barrier free, with smooth and level surfaces to make it easier for those with physical limitations, and is meant to provide an attractive and meaningful space for all, regardless of physical or sensory development. Another example of their excellent charity work is that, each May, the LA Rotary also gives back to local students by choosing seven high school seniors throughout the State to award $1,000 college scholarships. I wish to join the communities of Lewiston and Auburn, as well as the State of Maine, in congratulating the LA Rotary for this remarkable achievement. I look forward to fol-lowing their continued growth and service, and I thank them for their commitment to bettering Maine and the world.

and women instead have chosen to dedicate themselves to military service in defense of our rights, our freedoms, and our country. They should know that they have the full support of this Senate Chamber and the American peo-ple, who are with them in whatever challenges may lie ahead. It is thanks to their dedication and the dedication of an untold number of patriots just like them that we are able to meet here today in the U.S. Senate and openly debate the best solutions to the problems that confront our coun-try. It is thanks to their sacrifices that the United States of America remains a beacon of hope and freedom in a dan-gerous world. We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to their parents and their communities for instilling in them not only the mental and physical abilities our Armed Forces require, but also the character, the values, and the discipline that leads someone to put service to our Nation over self. I would like to personally thank these 374 graduating seniors for volun-teering to risk their lives in defense of our Nation. We owe them, along with all those who serve our country, a deep debt of gratitude. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the R

TEVE has been serv-ing Ohio as a soldier for 30 years.

TRIBUTE TO DR. CANDACE KENDLE Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the contributions of Dr. Candace Kendle, recipient of the 2017 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for Corporate Growth, Cincinnati. As the visionary cofounder of one of the largest international providers of drug development services to the bio-pharmaceutical industry, Dr. Candace Kendle is being honored for her achievements in founding and growing Kendle International, Inc., from a small, private startup in 1981, to a global clinical research organization traded on NASDAQ, KNDL, and ac-quired by INC Research in 2011. Under Dr. Kendle’s leadership, Kendle International delivered a wide range of clinical development and clin-ical trial services to biopharmaceutical companies around the world, including the development of Celebrex. Prior to founding Kendle Inter-national, Inc., Kendle held senior fac-ulty positions at several leading aca-demic institutions, including the Uni-versity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine; the University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine; Philadelphia College of Phar-macy and Science; and the University of Cincinnati College of Pharmacy. A first-generation college student, Dr. Candace Kendle earned a bachelor of science and doctorate in pharmacy from the University of Cincinnati, Col-lege of Pharmacy, and was awarded an honorary Ph.D. in science from the University of Cincinnati in 2010. Dr. Candace Kendle is recognized worldwide as a leader in the CRO in-dustry and is a founding member and past chairperson of the Association of Clinical Research Organizations. She has served as a mentor for the For-tune—U.S. State Department Global Women Leaders Mentoring Partnership and as a member of the Committee of 200, where she served on the board of directors for its foundation. She has also served on biotechnology task forces for the U.S. Department of Com-merce, as well as for two Ohio Gov-ernors. Dr. Kendle serves on the boards of di-rectors for USP, Emerson, and the H.J. Heinz Company. She is cofounder of Next Chapter Press and ReadAloud.org, an organization to encourage children and adults to read aloud to encourage lifelong learning. She is also a former trustee for the University of Cin-cinnati, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, and numer-ous other nonprofit organizations. f 
TRIBUTE TO DAVE SHOJI Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate retiring Univer-sity of Hawaii women’s volleyball coach Dave Shoji on an outstanding 42- year career. In 1975, at just 28 years old, Dave Shoji tallied his first win as head coach of the Rainbow Wahine volleyball team. Since then, he has gone on to compile one of the most decorated re-sumes in collegiate volleyball history. In fact, there has been no such thing as a losing season during Dave’s tenure with the Rainbow Wahine. In 2013, he earned the title of the National Colle-giate Athletic Association’s alltime winningest coach. In 2016, he became just the second coach in NCAA history to win 1,200 matches. He departs the university with an as-tonishing record of 1,202 wins, 204 losses, and 1 tie, including 4 national titles, 25 conference championships, and more than 30 postseason national tournament appearances. Coach Shoji leaves the confines of the Stan Sheriff Center with a legacy much larger than the numbers. It is fitting that Coach Shoji’s tenure began just a few short years after the enactment of title IX, a law now named for Hawaii Congresswoman Patsy Mink who championed its passage. Title IX seeks to ensure equal opportunity and prohibit sex discrimination in higher education. It is most widely known for expanding opportunities for women in collegiate athletics. Coach Shoji’s ten-ure at the helm of Rainbow Wahine volleyball has clearly demonstrated the value of opportunity for young peo-ple—not just young women—in Hawaii. His teams have been examples of what can be achieved through hard work, professionalism, and teamwork. That example has led many local players to aspire to 1 day don the green and white Wahine jersey, play in front of sold-out crowds, and look to Coach Shoji in the center of the huddle during a nail-bit-ing set. Parents were always hopeful, too, that they would witness their daughter’s transition from girl to woman in the care of Coach Shoji and company. During his tenure, Coach Shoji’s has coached 86 All-American selections, 35 conference players of the year and, 175 all-conference picks. His players’ suc-cesses extended beyond the court. More than 100 players have earned all-aca-demic conference recognitions under his guidance. Over the past 42 years, Coach Shoji has built a reputation for excellence built on hard work, integrity, and love for the game. He has helped shape countless student athletes and brought pride to their families and legions of fans. Coach Shoji has set the standard for those who follow. Hawaii extends our warmest aloha and mahalo nui loa to Coach Shoji for his passion and commitment to not only the sport of volleyball but the State of Hawaii. ‘‘Let’s go ’Bows!’’ f 
TRIBUTE TO TERESA SHOOK Ms. HIRONO, Mr. President, one of the life lessons that I try to keep in mind is that one person can make a dif-ference. Today I wish to recognize one of these remarkable people—Hawaii resi-dent Teresa Shook. Most of my colleagues probably don’t know who Teresa Shook is, but I am certain all of them know what dif-ference she has made. Teresa lives in the idyllic but iso-lated community of Hana on Maui. Fol-lowing the recent Presidential elec-tion, like many Americans, Teresa had concerns about where our country was headed. She felt that it was time to pursue real action. Unsure of where to begin, she took to social media, posing the following question: ‘‘What if women marched on Washington around Inauguration Day en masse?’’ Little did she know what that simple Facebook post would lead to. She cre-ated a public events page, which caught the attention of 40 people in the first few hours of its posting. She woke up the following morning to find that the event had garnered international attention, and more than 10,000 individ-uals had pledged their attendance. The numbers and support would only go up from there. On January 20, 2017, the President de-livered his inaugural address in which he painted a grim picture of America. The next day, millions across the United States and around the globe took to the streets to demonstrate against his bleak view of our shared fu-ture. Coined the Women’s March on Washington, the event united women, men, and children of all ages, races, and religions. From Hilo to Hanalei, San Francisco to New York City, the march assisted in generating meaning-ful conversations about how to combat the hateful rhetoric and discriminatory agenda of the new President. It has helped and encouraged everyday citi-zens, many of whom have never been involved in politics, to get outside of their comfort zone and participate. The need for progressive solutions to reform our criminal justice system, protect and expand access to affordable health care, improve immigration, fight climate change, and protect a woman’s right to choose are just a few of the many reasons why Teresa and many others alike decided action need-ed to take place. The Women’s March on Washington was one event, but the network it gen-erated remains engaged. It is now a global movement against nationalism, discrimination, and hate. It all started when a retired attorney, grandmother of four, and breast cancer survivor de-cided to speak up. While demonstra-tions are integral to democracy, the Women’s March on Washington pointed

to the need for everyday individuals to take their desire for political advance-ment beyond the streets. Teresa started a global movement from her rural Maui home, showing us the difference one person can make. It is up to all of us to keep that momen-tum going, to stay engaged. For those who feel as though their voice has no place within a conversation to pursue change, Teresa has shown a path for-ward. If there is anything to learn from Women’s March on Washington, it is that we are not alone. There is no greater time than now to mobilize your communities and make your voices heard. Teresa, who has been honored by the Maui County Council and continues to be recognized by many internationally, is a shining example of what we call ‘‘Living Aloha.’’ A heartfelt mahalo nui loa to Teresa.

REMEMBERING PAUL LEVENTHAL Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, this year we mark the 10th anniversary of the untimely passing of our friend Paul Leventhal. Paul was a trailblazer when it came to addressing the dangers of nuclear power and nuclear weapons. I personally relied on Paul’s insight to craft my approach to preventing the spread of dangerous nuclear technology and nuclear weapons. As a Senate staffer during the 1970s, Paul made major contributions to our Nation’s security by working on two landmark laws. The first was the Energy Reorganiza-tion Act, which created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the agen-cy that later became the Department of Energy. Before this legislation, a single agency, the Atomic Energy Com-mission, was responsible for both pro-moting nuclear energy and regulating the nuclear industry, to the detriment of public safety. Paul was also instrumental for pas-sage of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, which required countries to adopt full-scope safeguards from the Inter-national Atomic Energy Agency before they could receive civilian nuclear technology from the United States. This requirement later became an international standard when the Nu-clear Suppliers Group adopted it. During the 1980s, Paul played an im-portant role in helping to kill the Clinch River Breeder reactor, which shut down U.S. efforts to develop a full plutonium fuel cycle. Throughout this time, he was also a strong proponent of my efforts to close loopholes in U.S. nuclear nonproliferation law, including tightening nuclear export controls af-fecting China following Tiananmen Square. He actively worked to ensure House passage of the Nuclear Prolifera-tion Prevention Act, which imposed sanctions on those who knowingly con-tribute to efforts to acquire unsafeguarded fissile material or nu-clear weapons. Paul was ahead of his time in raising alarms about the threat of nuclear ter-rorism. His warnings about the need to reduce reliance on highly enriched ura-nium and to limit the use of plutonium for commercial nuclear power later formed the core of the global nuclear security agenda. His warnings about the flaws in nuclear cooperation agree-ments continue to reverberate in to-day’s debates over the export of nu-clear technology. Today’s ongoing nuclear challenges remind me of our solemn responsibility to carry out Paul’s legacy. The nuclear industry continues to push against stringent safety stand-ards. The Trump administration wants to promote the export of nuclear tech-nology and walk away from the Obama administration’s nuclear security mis-sion. The India nuclear deal continues to increase the risk of a nuclear clash in South Asia. Plans for commercial- scale plutonium reprocessing in East Asia threaten to create a new nuclear arms race in the region. All of these challenges will require us to take inspiration from Paul’s work to promote nuclear security and non-proliferation. To honor Paul, we must rededicate ourselves to fighting these threats to international peace and human survival.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO NEIL SMIT ∑Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a great Penn-sylvanian and a great American: Neil Smit. Neil has made extraordinary con-tributions to our country through his service as a Navy SEAL, his leadership and innovation in the business world, and his dedication to community serv-ice. Neil has served as a leader in the business community for decades with Comcast, Charter Communications, AOL, Pillsbury, and Nabisco. His nota-ble career began serving his country as a member of the elite Navy SEAL Team Six. He retired from Active Duty as a lieutenant commander. He has never lost his commitment to his coun-try and his comrades. In the private sector, he has worked on behalf of vet-erans by championing Comcast’s pledge to hire veterans and to help Active- Duty servicemembers transition from the military to the civilian workforce. In all of his roles, Neil has always ex-emplified the best traits of a leader. During his time as CEO of Comcast Cable, Neil led his team to innovate and develop game-changing products and businesses that benefited con-sumers. His devotion to his community is evi-dent in his role with the executive committee of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s board of trustees. Neil is also a member of the board of visitors for Nicholas School of the Environ-ment at his alma mater, Duke Univer-sity. He also serves as chairman of the executive committee and is a member of the board of directors of C–SPAN. Neil’s life of service and leadership is an inspiration to many, and we thank him for his service to our great coun-try.∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO EMMA HOMER ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct honor of rec-ognizing Emma Homer of Ashland for the many years she has helped children in eastern Montana. Her generosity and compassion is commendable. Emma began fostering children in 1979. For nearly 38 years, she has opened her home, and her heart in order to help the local community. The longevity of her noble accomplishment is truly remarkable. Over the years, Emma has directly helped to improve the lives of over 40 children through her service as foster parent. The chil-dren she has cared for have varied in age from infants just a few months old to teenagers in high school. In addition to her contributions as a foster parent, since 1981, Emma has worked in the food service department at St. Labre Indian School. During that time, she has helped prepare hun-dreds of thousands of nutritious meals for the students and staff. A loving home and a warm meal are essential elements in every Montana community. Emma has helped provide both of these essentials to many chil-dren for well over a generation. Thank you, Emma, for the outstanding exam-ple you have set for the next genera-tion.∑

REMEMBERING CLYDE SEE, JR. ∑Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Clyde See, Jr., a noble veteran, a dedicated community lead-er, and a beloved member of my home State of West Virginia. Clyde and I were friends for many years, and I witnessed his unwavering dedication to public service, firsthand. Clyde was born in Hardy County and continued to give back to his commu-nity throughout his life. He was a high school dropout, who received his GED after serving in the U.S. Army. With use of his G.I. Bill, Clyde earned his un-dergraduate degree from West Virginia University and then attended WVU’s Law School. He served as an attorney in Hardy County for 47 years. Clyde always took great pride in helping others achieve their goals. From 1975 through 1984, he served in the West Virginia House of Delegates, with 6 years as speaker of the house. Among his many achievements and roles in leadership, he served as presi-dent of the board of directors of the Mutual Protective Insurance Associa-tion for the 20 years, serving on its board for more than 40 years. He ran unsuccessfully for Governor in 1984 and 1988, but never gave up the opportunity to give back to the State he loved. He was a member of the Moorefield Volunteer Fire Company and fought

fires years ago because he believed so deeply in public service. He knew that, if you can count your blessings, you can share your blessings, and he did in-deed share them with the Moorefield region and with our entire State. Clyde was especially passionate about the passage of Hardy County School Bonds that would enable new schools to be built in the county. He worked tirelessly for this cause and was so very proud to see the passage of the bond for the new Moorefield High School. Clyde knew that our students are the future of our State and Nation and that we must do everything in our power to equip them with the tools they need for success. He had great compassion for students who needed support and was very proactive in mak-ing sure they were prepared for the fu-ture. One of Clyde’s favorite projects was Brighton Park, located just outside of Moorefield. It is a project that came to fruition, thanks to Clyde’s design, de-velopment, and funding efforts, as well as with his determination to create something special for the entire region to enjoy. Clyde often enjoyed walking through this beautiful park, and now it remains in our hearts as a place to cherish his memory. Clyde had the most wonderful sense of humor and such a quick wit. He was also one of the most brilliant and elo-quent speakers I have ever heard. It is my hope that his friends and family have found comfort in one another and in the support of our entire home State for their loss. What is most important is that he lived a full life, surrounded by his loved ones. Clyde was a true West Virginian, always willing to help a neighbor in need. I extend my condolences to his loving companion, Marion Marshall, his children Josh, Lucas, Jenny, and Amy and their families, and to his brother Jack. Again, I am honored to recognize Clyde’s memory, as well as the unwavering love he had for his fam-ily, friends, and our home State. ∑

REMEMBERING DR. ROLANDO ALUM, SR. ∑Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the memory of the late Dr. Rolando Alum, Sr., of West New York, NJ. At the age of 104, Dr. Alum passed away on March 27, a month ago today, leaving behind a leg-acy of community service and a family full of achievements. I had the distinct pleasure of knowing Dr. Alum person-ally. He was my constituent from when I first served in the New Jersey State Assembly over 25 years ago to when I became U.S. Senator. I could not be more impressed with the accomplished life of Dr. Rolando Alum, Sr., and his embodiment of the American spirit. Dr. Alum was born and raised in Ha-vana, Cuba. He began his career as a professor and dean at a local technical college, educating his students on lit-erature and grammar. He then went on to become a dentist, treating patients with whom who he would keep in touch throughout his life. In 1961, Dr. Alum and his family fled Cuba in pursuit of liberty and a better life after the Cas-tro brothers turned the island-nation into a Soviet-modeled totalitarian country. When Dr. Alum came to the United States, he decided to settle and raise his family in Hudson County, NJ. His first job was at a cardboard box factory in Essex County. Wanting more for his family, Dr. Alum worked tirelessly to become a successful research scientist for a pharmaceutical company, eventu-ally joining a research team that in-cluded a Nobel Prize winning doctor. At his company, Dr. Alum established important quality control measures and developed influential drugs. The light of Dr. Alum’s life was his family. Rolando and his pre-deceased wife, Sara, raised a truly exceptional family by any measure. I have worked side by side with his oldest son Roland Alum, Jr., on many civic and commu-nity engagement activities to better the State of New Jersey. Dr. Alum’s youngest son Luis is an accomplished attorney and a leader in New Jersey’s legal community. Rolando’s grandson, Alexander, is the Assistant U.S. Attor-ney in Puerto Rico. Janelle, Dr. Alum’s granddaughter, is a school teacher in my hometown of Union City. With such a successful family, I have no doubt that Dr. Alum was proud of each and every member of his family. One of Dr. Alum’s dreams was to one day see democracy in Cuba. Fearing vi-olence from the Castro regime, Dr. Alum, like countless other Cubans who fled from the Castro regime, never re-turned to his native land. As a U.S. Senator of Cuban descent, I have dedi-cated my entire career to fighting for the Cuban people and will continue to work towards bringing freedom to Cuba. Dr. Rolando Alum, Sr., was a model U.S. citizen and is a testament to what Cuban Americans, Latinos, and immi-grants contribute to our great coun-try.∑ f 
RECOGNIZING THE ALASKA ACES ∑Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Alaska’s one and only professional sports team and an organization that has become part of the fabric that makes up the Alas-kan society, the Alaska Aces. The team started as a small semi- professional hockey team in the late eighties known as the Anchorage Aces, but quickly gained the support and popularity of the community and rose through the ranks to become a profes-sional hockey organization in 1995. In 2003, after becoming the Alaska Aces, the team joined the East Coast Hockey League and almost immediately be-came one of the league’s powerhouses, winning three ECHL Kelly Cups in 2006, 2011, and most recently 2014. The Aces have produced some of the biggest Alaskan professional athletes such as Scotty Gomez, who went on to win two Stanley Cups and became an NHL All-Star on multiple occasions, and Eagle River’s Brian Swanson, whose hockey career took him to the National Hockey League, Europe, and finally back home to the Aces before he retired in 2012. As good as the team has become, it is their dedication to the community that made them a staple with multiple generations of Alaskans. Whether it was their ‘‘Skate with the Aces’’ events in which families could skate with the players and get to know them after home games or the ever-popular military appreciation games, this orga-nization has made a lasting impact on the lives of many hockey players and fans alike. The Aces are full of fond memories and traditions such as the cowbell crew, which is the name given to its enthusiastic fan section. Then there is Bobby Hill, also known as ‘‘The Horse-man,’’ who is not only the Alaska Aces superfan in charge of keeping the en-ergy alive at every home game by going up and down the length of the ice riding a hockey stick, but is also a Spe-cial Olympics Gold medalist. The Alaska Aces will be dearly missed in what is certainly an unfortu-nate end for such a storied franchise. Economic times have taken a hit on many sectors of the Alaskan economy, and we have seen the impact with our sporting events, but Alaskans are resil-ient and our sports teams and athletes are no different. Hockey has a rich his-tory in Alaska and is culturally in-grained in the fabric of our State. Alas-ka has over 45 hockey associations, re-flecting the passion and involvement shared by Alaskans of all ages. It is this passion and dedication to the sport that will surely keep the spirit and memory of our Alaska Aces alive. I want to commend the leadership of the team’s owners, the dedication of its fans and players, and the community for making the Alaska Aces one of the league’s best franchises and perennial contenders for the ECHL Kelly Cup every season. The Aces play their very last game on April 8, 2017; however, the memories that countless Alaskans have with our hockey team will not fade, but will last a lifetime. ∑

REMEMBERING DR. ANDRE LARSON ∑Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Andre Larson, who passed away on March 24, 2017, at the age of 74. Dr. Lar-son grew up in Brookings, SD, and graduated from the University of South Dakota, USD, in Vermillion with a BFA in music education and later, a MM degree in music literature. A lifelong advocate for fine arts and music, Dr. Larson created the re-nowned National Music Museum in Vermillion, on USD’s campus. Today it has the most complete collection of well-preserved and historically impor-tant musical instruments in the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2614 April 27, 2017 
The National Music Museum houses and preserves over 15,000 rare musical instruments: Stradivarius violins, and one of the only two Stradivarius man-dolins that exist, dombaks and didgeridoos, the oldest playing harpsicord, more than a dozen saxo-phones made by the instrument’s in-ventor, Adolphe Sax, bouzoukis, hurdy- gurdies, and a bombardon, a 1772 bowlback mandolin, a Javanese gam-elan, lutes, flutes, harmonicas, and zithers, the world’s oldest cello, called the King cello and created around 1550 A.D., Johnny Cash’s guitar, and every-thing in-between, including a substan-tial collection of historic instrument documents. Dr. Andre Larson was inspired by his father, Arne B. Larson, who was a high school music teacher, bandleader, and later a college music professor. Arne began collecting musical artifacts and instruments while serving in World War II, and his passion for music was not lost on his son, Andre. Wanting to share his and his father’s passion, Andre conceptualized, planned, and im-plemented the development of the Na-tional Music Museum in Vermillion. In 1972, he was hired as the first director of the museum, then named the Shrine to Music Museum, with his father’s 2,500 instruments as the foundation. Andre served as director of the mu-seum until his retirement in 2011. Under Dr. Andre Larson’s leadership, the museum expanded significantly from one room in the Carnegie Library to now occupying the entire building today. His intelligence and great knowledge of instruments and history enabled him to select the best instru-ments for the collection. He also had a very unique skill in matching instru-ments to generous donors who would allow the museum to showcase their purchases. In addition to teaching at the Uni-versity of South Dakota and running the museum, Dr. Larson also created, produced, and marketed many musical events every year that sometimes in-cluded internationally known musi-cians performing music with the mu-seum instruments. He also created the Nation’s only graduate degree program in the history of musical instruments. Throughout his life, Dr. Larson also served three terms as the president of the American Musical Instrument So-ciety. He edited its newsletter for 18 years, and he was honored with the Curt Sachs Award, the highest honor given by the American Musical Instru-ment Society. In 2016, he was elected to the South Dakota Hall of Fame for his contributions to the arts in South Da-kota. Dr. Andre Larson’s commitment to excellence and his dedication to music have inspired thousands of students and music lovers, not just across South Dakota, but throughout the entire Na-tion. His work in creating the National Music Museum will continue to inspire others for as long as there is music and there are people.∑ TRIBUTE TO ALEC D IFRUSCIA ∑Mr. THUNE.

TRIBUTE TO ALTER WIENER ∑Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to honor Alter Wiener, a selfless Oregonian who endured the horrors of the Holocaust and has shared his powerful story with countless students and adults. I would like to share his story with the Senate so that my colleagues can hear how he survived the Nazi atrocities and came to live in Hillsboro, OR, teaching young men and women in my home State the dangers of intolerance and exclusion. Alter Wiener’s story begins more than 90 years ago in the Polish town of Chrzano´w, where he was born on Octo-ber 8, 1926. Like many Jewish children, he attended both public and religious school and was taught the importance of family and faith. What was a happy childhood ended abruptly when the Nazis invaded his hometown in Sep-tember of 1939. Mr. Wiener fled with his mother and siblings, but his father, forced to stay behind, was ultimately murdered by the Germans. Barred from practicing his faith or attending school, Mr. Wiener was even-tually ripped from his home in the mid-dle of the night and deported to Blechhammer, a forced labor camp. He saw and experienced unimaginable hor-rors as he was moved from labor camp to labor camp, spending 3 long years in five concentration camps. When the Russian Army freed him in May 1945, he weighed only 80 pounds. Mr. Wiener made his way to New York City, where he joined his cousins, the only other members of a family that numbered 123 to survive the Nazi atrocities. In New York, he worked tirelessly to rebuild his life, earning his high school diploma at age 38 and then a degree from Brooklyn College. He got married, started a family, and worked as an accountant. Through it all, he rarely spoke of surviving the Holocaust or the atrocities he had wit-nessed and endured. He says now that he simply didn’t feel others would un-derstand. In 2000, Mr. Wiener moved to Hills-boro, OR. The Oregon Holocaust Re-source Center asked him to share his story, and, though he hesitated at first, he ultimately agreed to speak at Cen-tury High School. To his surprise, Mr. Wiener received hundreds of letters from students thanking him for chang-ing their lives. Mr. Wiener has since gone on to vol-unteer his time and energy to Holo-caust education, giving more than 850 presentations to a wide range of audi-ences. In 2007, he published his auto-biography ‘‘64735: From a Name to a Number,’’ detailing his harrowing expe-riences under the Nazi regime and his life thereafter. Many of my colleagues have heard me talk about my own family’s experi-ence: how my parents fled Nazi Ger-many, how not everybody made it out, how we lost family in Kristallnacht and at Theresienstadt. Tolerance and inclusiveness are issues the Wydens take very seriously. That is why it is so special for me to be able to pay trib-ute to Alter Wiener today and to honor his work. There is a concept in Judaism called tikkun olam, which means to repair the world. Truly, I can think of no big-ger way to describe Alter Wiener’s work than repairing the world. Every time he shares his story, more people understand the horrors of Nazi persecu-tion and the inhumanity of the Holo-caust. People also understand the im-portance of tolerance, pluralism, and inclusion, and they see the power of the human spirit to endure. Today I offer my deepest affection and a heartfelt thank you to Alter Wie-ner for using your voice to teach gen-erations to come to never, ever forget. ∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. B
ROWN , Mrs. F EINSTEIN , Mrs. G
ILLIBRAND , Mr. M ERKLEY , Mr. S
ANDERS , Ms. W ARREN , Mr. W
HITEHOUSE , Ms. H IRONO , Mr. S
CHATZ , Mr. L EAHY , and Mr. N
ELSON ): S. 959. A bill to restore protections for Social Security, Railroad retire-ment, and Black Lung benefits from administrative offset; to the Com-mittee on Finance. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President. Every day, Social Security provides vital ben-efits to millions of Americans who worked and paid into the system. To ensure workers would receive full ac-cess to these fundamental lifeline bene-fits, for many years, the law protected these earned benefits from attempts to recover debts. However, 20 years ago, Congress suddenly reversed course, and made a change to the law that allowed the government to cut Social Security and other hard-earned benefit pay-ments in order to collect student loan and other federal debts, like home loans owed to the Veterans Adminis-tration, and food stamp overpayments. Now, more and more seniors are find-ing themselves subject to government garnishment of their already modest Social Security benefits in order to re-coup student loan debts. In fact, the New York Times published an editorial recently titled, ‘‘Haunted by Student Debt Past Age 50’’ that highlighted the worsening struggle that seniors face with student debt. Student loan debt is becoming an in-creasingly serious problem in Oregon and across the Nation, with students and their families burdened by crush-ing student loan debt. Even in the best circumstances, many families will struggle to pay off crippling loans for years to come. However, for people who rely on benefits like Social Security after retirement, disability, or the death of a family member, making pay-ments on student loans or other Fed-eral debts can become an insurmount-able hardship. Because of the lifeline nature of these earned benefits, for more than 40 years the law prevented all creditors from collecting hard-earned Social Se-curity, railroad retirement, and black lung benefits to recoup debts. The only exceptions included unpaid Federal taxes, child support or alimony pay-ments, and court-ordered victim res-titution. These protections helped en-sure that our social safety net pro-grams were functioning as intended— something I think we can all agree is essential to preserving Social Security and other earned benefits. Astonishingly, when the law changed as part of a 1996 omnibus budget bill, these changes were never fully debated in Congress. This means Members of Congress never had the chance to real-ly explore how this policy would affect beneficiaries. The legislation ulti-mately included some protections for the most vulnerable, but even those protections have not been updated in 20 years. We now realize what a profound ef-fect the loss of these protections has had on retirees and individuals with disabilities, who often live on fixed in-comes. More and more seniors and peo-ple with disabilities are having their Social Security and other lifeline bene-fits taken away to pay federal debts. For example, according to a GAO re-port, in 2004, about 8,000 seniors were living in poverty after having their benefits garnished to recover a student debt. In 2015, over 67,000 seniors were subject to garnishment for a student debt and living in poverty. Congress should restore sanity to the system, and reestablish the protections that these beneficiaries deserve. That is why I, along with Senators B
ROWN , M ERKLEY , FEINSTEIN , HIRONO , S
CHATZ , LEAHY , NELSON , WHITEHOUSE , G
ILLIBRAND , SANDERS , and W ARREN are reintroducing the Protection of Social Security Benefits Restoration Act. The bill would restore the strong protec-tions in the law that prevented the government from taking away earned benefits to pay federal debts, and guar-antee beneficiaries will be able to maintain a basic standard of living by receiving the benefits they have earned. The bill is supported by Social Security Works, the Arc of the United States, Latinos for a Secure Retire-ment, Puget Sound Advocates for Re-tirement Action, PSARA, AFL-CIO, the Economic Opportunity Institute, the National Organization for Women, Justice in Aging, Gray Panthers NYC, Alliance for Retired Americans, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Global Policy Solutions, AARP, the American Fed-eration of Government Employees, and the International Union, United Auto-mobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Im-plement Workers of America, UAW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
S. 959 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

URBIN ): S. 974. A bill to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and bio-similar versions of those drugs and bio-logical products; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the past few years, the national headlines have been dominated by stories about the high cost of pharmaceuticals. We have seen jaw-dropping examples, such as the unconscionable price increase overnight by Turing Pharmaceuticals of their drug for patients with HIV, from $13.50 to $750 per pill. Pharmaceutical companies should be compensated for their important work developing lifesaving treatments. But when companies engage in predatory practices at the expense of consumers, we must act. That is why today I am reintroducing the Creating and Restor-ing Equal Access to Equivalent Sam-ples, or CREATES, Act, bipartisan leg-islation to end inappropriate delay tac-tics that are used by some brand-name drug manufacturers to block competi-tion from more affordable generic drugs. I am glad to be joined by Sen-ators GRASSLEY , KLOBUCHAR , LEE, and F
EINSTEIN , and several other Senators of both parties in introducing this bill today. The first delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the with-holding of drug samples that generic manufacturers need to gain regulatory approval. Federal law requires generic competitors to prove that their low- cost alternative is as equally safe and effective as the brand-name drug with which they wish to compete. Unfortu-nately, some brand-name companies are preventing generic manufacturers from obtaining the samples they need to make the necessary comparison. This simple delay tactic uses regu-latory safeguards as a weapon to block competition. The FDA has reported re-ceiving more than 100 inquiries from generic product developers who were unable to access samples of a brand- name drug to compare their generic product. The second delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the devel-opment of shared safety protocols. For some high-risk drugs, Federal law re-quires a generic drug manufacturer to join the brand-name drug manufac-turer in a single, shared safety protocol for distribution of the drug. Despite this requirement, some brand-name companies are refusing to negotiate shared safety protocols with potential generic competitors, again under-mining those competitors’ ability to gain FDA approval for their generic versions of such drugs. The revised version of the CREATES Act also allows the FDA more discre-tion to approve alternative safety pro-tocols, rather than require parties to develop shared safety protocols. Any safety protocol approved by the FDA must meet the rigorous statutory standards already in place. These exclusionary practices thwart competition and deny consumers the benefit of lower drug prices. I share the concerns of Vermonters and Americans across the country that many prescrip-tion drugs are simply too expensive. When brand companies can artificially raise the price of drugs by using preda-tory practices, patients suffer. Illnesses get worse. Families, government pro-grams, and other payers in the healthcare system ultimately bear those added, unnecessary costs. This legislation is not a silver bullet to address all of the complex problems driving the high costs of medications. In addition to the delayed entry of ge-neric drugs, I am troubled by the rising cost of treatments for opioid overdoses, which remain expensive for local law enforcement agencies, even though there are generic competitors. In Vermont, many patients are grappling with the extremely high cost of a new drug for hepatitis C that will likely have years of market exclusivity be-fore generic alternatives can be made. Last year we learned the price of EpiPen had increased by almost 500 percent since 2009, now costing roughly $600 for a two-pack. The sharp increase in price combined with the relatively short shelf life of the product—1 year to 18 months—has put this lifesaving drug out of reach for many. Think for a moment about the im-pact of price hikes on the family of a patient facing a life-threatening ill-ness. Across the country, hardworking Americans feel like the system is rigged against them by corporations that are looking to make a profit at any price. With examples like Turing and Mylan, it is no wonder they feel that way. The CREATES Act is one piece of the puzzle, addressing anticompetitive be-havior that delays the creation of af-fordable generic drugs. Drug afford-ability is a bipartisan issue that affects each and every American. These re-forms will make a difference. I hope other Senators will join us in sup-porting these bipartisan reforms.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2620 April 27, 2017 
which occupational therapy is ordered by the physician, along with speech language pathology and/or physical therapy services, and skilled nursing care is not required. Our bill will help ensure that Medicare beneficiaries re-ceive timely access to essential home health therapy care. Occupational therapists have long been recognized as a valuable compo-nent of our Nation’s healthcare work-force and a critical aspect of home healthcare because of their focus on pa-tients’ functional capabilities and their expertise in home safety. Physicians frequently order occupational therapy as part of an initial plan of care for pa-tients requiring home health care, alongside the qualifying services of physical therapy, speech-language pa-thology, and skilled nursing. Under certain circumstances, an occupational therapist is allowed to perform the comprehensive assessment to deter-mine a Medicare beneficiary’s con-tinuing need for home healthcare. How-ever, under current Medicare law, occu-pational therapists are not permitted to conduct the initial assessment for home health cases, even when occupa-tional therapy is included in the physi-cian’s order and when the case is exclu-sively related to rehabilitation ther-apy. Additionally, occupational thera-pists are not allowed to complete the comprehensive assessment unless occu-pational therapy is the qualifying serv-ice. By permitting occupational thera-pists to perform initial home health as-sessment visits and comprehensive as-sessments in limited circumstances, the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act can help prevent delays in the time it takes for Medicare beneficiaries to receive essential home healthcare, es-pecially in underserved areas where ac-cess to physical therapists and speech language pathologists may be limited. On January 13, 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released the final conditions of partici-pation, or COPs, for home health agen-cies participating in Medicare and Medicaid. These new COPs expand the content of the home health comprehen-sive assessment to include the pa-tient’s functional, psychosocial, and cognitive status, all of which are areas of expertise for occupational thera-pists. The new COPs also require the creation of a patient-centered plan of care that is informed by the com-prehensive assessment. As a result of their comprehensive education and unique training, occupational thera-pists are qualified to perform the nec-essary assessments to adhere to these new CMS home health guidelines. It is important to note that the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act would apply only to rehabilitation therapy cases in which skilled nursing care is not required. Nurses would still be required to conduct the initial as-sessment for all home health cases in which skilled nursing care is ordered by the physician. Also, although the legislation would allow occupational therapists to conduct the initial home health assessment visit and com-prehensive assessments, it would not alter the existing criteria for estab-lishing eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator H
ELLER and to support the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act to correct the discrepancy in Medicare regulations between therapy providers and to help ensure timely access to es-sential, high-quality home health ther-apy care for Medicare beneficiaries. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R

By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. S
ANDERS , Mr. M ARKEY , and Mr. B
OOKER ): S. 987. A bill to transition away from fossil fuel sources of energy to 100 per-cent clean and renewable energy by 2050, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to address the important urgency of addressing climate change. Across the country, we are seeing the impacts of the warmer climate, and it is having devastating consequences on our for-ests, on our farming, on our fishing, and on our urban populations. Years ago, people talked about what we might see if we continued to burn fossil fuels and continued to put carbon dioxide into the air, but no longer do we have to talk about what we might see, because it is here. The facts are on the ground right now. We can look at my home State of Or-egon. In Oregon, we have the challenge of forest fire seasons that are longer by several months than they were just decades ago. We have the challenge of warmer winters, resulting in pine bee-tles doing more damage to our trees. The fact that we have lower snowpacks in the Cascade Mountains means warm-er trout streams and less water for irri-gation. We have had the worst-ever droughts in the Klamath Basin in the past 15 years. Over on the coast, we have a big impact on oysters. Because we have burned so much in fossil fuels to create so much carbon dioxide that has been absorbed by the oceans and turned into carbonic acid, the oceans have acidified. They are 30 percent more acidic than they were 150 years ago, meaning our oysters are having trouble reaching out and pulling the molecules out of the water to form a shell. In fact, it takes so much energy to do so that they are dying. That is what is happening. That is just in Oregon. We can look across the United States and see impact after im-pact. If we were in Minnesota, we could talk about the tick populations that are killing the moose because it is not cold enough in the winter to kill the ticks. If we are in Maine, we can talk about the fact that the lobsters are mi-grating to Canada because that is where the colder waters can be found. If we are in Florida, we can talk about sunny day floods, because the ocean levels have risen and the ocean water— the saltwater—is contaminating the freshwater that cities depend on. If we are up the Atlantic coast, we can talk about Hurricane Sandy and how its devastating power was enhanced by an ocean that is much warmer than it was decades ago. If we are in Texas, we can talk about the spread of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus affecting folks. So the list goes on and on. But it is not just in the United States of America. It is on the entire planet. As we are talking about oysters on the west coast of the United States, across the globe folks are talking about coral reefs. The Great Barrier Reef has virtually died over the last few years. Scientists say 80 percent of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia has died in the last 3 years. If we are looking at the mountainous regions of the world, you can trace the flow of glaciers and find that across the globe glaciers have diminished by an enor-mous amount. Some say that if you

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2625 April 27, 2017 
want to see a glacier in Glacier Na-tional Park, you better get there soon. That is just in the United States. If we turn north to the upper reaches of Canada and the permafrost, you can visit what are called the drunken for-ests, because the permafrost is melting and the trees are starting to lean in every which direction. If you turn to Alaska, you are finding that Native populations are having to relocate be-cause of changing circumstances of a warmer Alaska. Go to the Arctic Ocean and what you see is a massive amount of missing ice, and, because that ice is missing, the ocean is absorbing more energy from the sun, and it is creating a feedback loop that is having further devastating consequences. And so the list goes on and on. It is not just time to address climate change boldly. It is time to address it aggressively. It is time for 100 by 50. What that means is 100 percent clean and renewable energy to power the economy by the year 2050 and the steps to get there in between and to have 50 percent of our energy clean and renew-able by the year 2030. That is not far away. That is just 13 years away, and for 2050, add another 20 years. We have to act quickly because right now human civilization is failing the test. Our responsibility is to stop burn-ing fossil fuels and to stop putting car-bon dioxide into the atmosphere. That is why we have to rapidly transition from an energy economy based on fos-sil fuels to one based on clean and re-newable energy. Why do I say we are failing the test at the moment? We are failing the test because if you look at the flow of car-bon dioxide into the atmosphere from human civilization, the rate of carbon dioxide pollution has not leveled out. In fact, the speed of pollution and the amount of pollution per year is in-creasing. So we have a tremendous challenge ahead of us. We have to take and not only reduce the amount but re-duce it enormously in a short period of time. Now some say this vision is too bold. Some say this vision is too difficult, that it is too hard. It makes me think of President Kennedy’s call. He said decades ago: 
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win. 
I tell you today that we must, as a Nation, be willing to accept the chal-lenge of transforming our energy econ-omy. We must be unwilling to postpone tackling this challenge of transforming our energy economy, and this chal-lenge is one where we must be com-mitted to winning. It is not just time. It is way past time. I came to the Senate floor last Sep-tember to lay out the concept of 100 by 50—100 percent clean, renewable energy by 2050. I come today to the Senate floor to say that today a group of Sen-ators are introducing a bill to lay out a roadmap to get there. Just as President Kennedy laid out the vision of putting an American on the moon, NASA went to work and laid out a plan on how we would get there. They didn’t know at first how it would be done. They hadn’t proceeded to in-vent the staged rocket that would en-able someone to escape the gravity of Earth in a fashion to get us to the moon. They didn’t know how to create a lunar landing operation to put people safely on the planet surface. They weren’t even sure of the composition of the surface of the moon, but they fig-ured it out. They put forward a draft. They reworked that draft. Today we are putting forth a road-map. I thank my colleagues who are standing with me today to be the origi-nal cosponsors: Senator BERNIE SAND-
ERSof Vermont, Senator E DMARKEY of Massachusetts, and Senator C
ORY B
OOKER of New Jersey. I know other colleagues will join us as time pro-gresses, but it is important not to wait until we have, if you will, a large popu-lation to begin the conversation—a large set of sponsors to begin the con-versation of laying out a roadmap. It is important to lay it out now. It is im-portant to lay it out now because it is a statement of values. It is important to lay it out now so that there is a vi-sion that can be discussed—a detailed vision of how to take on different sec-tors of the energy economy that can be discussed and debated. So we are focused not on whether to get to 100 by 50, but on how we are going to get to 100 by 50. I invite and encourage that debate because each of us can envision a roadmap that is slightly different. So let’s have that conversation, but let’s not forget the importance of getting to this destina-tion—100 percent clean, renewable en-ergy—and getting thereby the year 2050. Yes, it is audacious when you think about how we use energy today, to think about how we can transform it in just a few decades, but we have many of the tools we need right now. With fo-cused research and development, we can add the other tools that we need. Let us not fail to accept this chal-lenge, because our planet is crying out in anguish. In addition to the facts on the ground that I have been men-tioning, we can simply take the tem-perature of the planet. Month after month after month, year after year, in the past 2 years we have been setting new records for having the hottest month—not the hottest month in Washington, DC, not the hottest month in the United States of America but the hottest March in the history of the planet, the hottest April since we have been measuring the temperature of the planet—May, June, and so on and so forth. So the time for conversing about whether we have a problem is over. Now is the time to say how we will achieve this vision. One important element of achieving this vision is greening the grid. That means that we need to phase out elec-tricity that is generated by fossil fuels. We need to invest in clean and renew-able energy that puts green electrons in the grid instead, and we need to ad-vance and develop the deployment of technologies that contribute to this, including high-voltage transmission lines that will move energy between different parts of the United States. We certainly need to develop the ability to store electricity and to use automated demand management and automated supply management so we can match the supply of green energy to the de-mand at different times of the day or just the demand of different times of the day to make renewable energy fit to the operation of the economy. Now, we have some specific powerful gifts in this effort. One is that we have a dramatically declining cost of solar energy. A second is that we have a dra-matically declining cost in wind en-ergy. A third is that we have a dra-matically declining cost of battery storage. This isn’t an accident. This has happened because of the innovation economy where these ideas were devel-oped and promoted and researched and advanced right here in the United States of America. But it really helps change the conversation. There have been many who are deeply invested in the fossil fuel world who would like to say that advancing to a clean and re-newable energy economy will hurt the economy. But now we are coming to the point that it is less expensive to generate renewable energy than to gen-erate fossil fuel energy. The fact is that we can create a tremendous num-ber of jobs as we rebuild this energy economy. If we turn specifically to the issue of a Federal emissions vehicle standard— because that is one of the pieces of this puzzle—it means that we have to make national investments in electrical re-charging stations along our roads and highways to support these vehicles. There are already half a million plug- in electric vehicles on our roads today, and these vehicles—these cars—are be-coming cheaper as the numbers con-tinue to grow. One of the factors that is enabling the car to become cheaper is the drop-ping cost of lithium in the batteries that power them. They are getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper. So in the same space you can put more energy with less weight to drive cars further. Since 2008, the cost of these batteries per kilowatt hour has fallen fourfold. They will continuously grow. Having more of these cars on our roads and our highways as the costs keep falling, it is vital that we have an infrastructure in place to support them. We need to ensure that everyone is part of this clean and renewable energy resolution, including low-income and disadvantaged communities. We ad-dressed that in the 100 by 50 legisla-tion. To do this, we established grants

to bring affordable clean energy and energy efficiency to individuals’ homes and communities. We invest in zero emission public transportation that is affordable and accessible. We also want to ensure that no workers are left be-hind in this transformation, especially the workers in the fossil fuel industry. That is why we need to provide a just transition for those workers and job training programs. We need to have a strategy to ensure that there are op-portunities to move from jobs in the fossil fuel world to positions in the clean and renewable energy industry. Those industries are, in fact, booming, with jobs in solar and wind growing 12 times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy. Already, the number of clean and renewable industry jobs has sur-passed those in the fossil fuel industry by a margin of 5 to 1. We want to enable everyone to have the skills they need to succeed in these emerging industries, but to move to this future, we must come to a point at which we stop investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure. We cannot proceed to make this pivot quickly to a clean-er, brighter, renewable future if we continue to tie ourselves and our gov-ernment to a fossil fuel-powered past. To achieve this clean break, the 100 by 50 Act ends future fossil fuel invest-ments at the Federal level. That would affect projects similar to the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, and we would end the tax sub-sidies for the fossil fuel industry. This burning of fossil fuels is de-stroying our planet. We must stop sub-sidizing the destruction of our planet. This burning of fossil fuels is destroy-ing our forests, which our rural com-munities depend on. We must stop sub-sidizing the destruction of our forests. The burning of these fossil fuels is driv-ing droughts, reducing irrigation water, and hurting our farmers. We must quit subsidizing the destruction of agriculture in America. The burning of fossil fuels is also impacting our fishing—from warmer, smaller trout streams to a fishing industry that de-pends on the critical ecosystem in the ocean. We must stop subsidizing the de-struction of our fishing industry. It is also important to make sure that America remains a leader in the energy economy and leads in the effort to make sure that we do not have a dis-advantage with regard to manufac-turing in other countries. What that means is that, with regard to countries that are not pursuing this on the same aggressive level, we need to have an ef-fort to drive this transaction. We need to make sure that if there are addi-tional costs, those are offset with a border tax so that we do not encourage the movement of production out of our economy here at home. We have done so with trade policy—in a massively destructive way—to the middle class of America. If we do not make things in America, we will not have a middle class in America, and we need to make sure that we do not do that in the tran-sition of our energy economy. To fund this plan, we propose a new source of revenue. When I say a ‘‘new source of revenue,’’ that is a little mis-leading because we are taking a cue from history, specifically World War II, and modeling bonds—climate bonds— on the war bonds that helped fund our fight against totalitarianism—to fund our fight against Germany and the So-viet Union. Auctioning off climate bonds is a way to raise the funds to drive the grants to power this trans-formation—to accelerate this trans-formation—and make sure that we do not leave out disadvantaged commu-nities but, rather, bring them fully into this transition. The 100 by 50 Act is ambitious, but the circumstances re-quire no less. Furthermore, we cannot, simply, pro-pose a Federal Government strategy because we live in the United States of America, where important things are done at many different levels. Here in this Chamber—right now in the U.S. Senate—we do not have a committee chair who is going to say that we need to have committee hearings in order to take on this issue. We do not have a committee chair on the House side who is going to drive this conversation. We do not have a President who under-stands the damage that is being done to our forests and our fishing and our farming and to our planet and who is going to lead the battle. We have to turn to the wisdom of the American people. We have to turn to the wisdom of the States and the wis-dom of the counties and the wisdom of the cities and the wisdom of individ-uals across America who are willing to go to the leadership of their mosques or the leadership of their temples or the leadership of their churches, who are willing to go to the leadership of nonprofits that they are a part of, who are willing to go to their city councils or their county commissions, who are willing to go to their State legislators. They are going to say that we need to have a 100 by 50 resolution for our non-profits, for our religious organizations, for our cities, for our counties, for our States because we need to own this issue. We Americans at every level need to own this issue. This is an issue that depends upon citizens across the globe taking hold of this in a powerful way that cannot be blocked by the dark money of the fossil fuel industry. In so doing, by passing that 100 by 50 resolution for the city or the nonprofit or the church or the mosque or the syn-agogue or the temple, we will also adopt an action plan that involves the specific steps that local organizations are going to take over the next 2 to 3 years. This year, maybe they are going to convert their hot water heaters to electrons rather than burning natural gas. Maybe they are going to sign up for green electrons from their local utilities, which is an option that is of-fered in many places across America. The following year, maybe they are going to invest in energy-saving retro-fits of their buildings. The year after that, maybe they are going to say that we have to revamp our fleet of vehicles and start using rechargeable vehicles, like the Volt or the Bolt or the LEAF or a whole set of cars that has been ap-pearing in the economy over the last few years. One can charge them up and, thereby, run them off green electrons rather than off fossil fuels. These are things that can be owned and done. In fact, it is already hap-pening. It is happening with local orga-nizations across this country that are committing themselves to 100 percent clean and renewable energy. More than 25 cities across the country have al-ready adopted this vision—from Madi-son, WI, to Abita Springs, LA; from San Diego, CA, to Salt Lake City, UT; from Georgetown, TX, to Greensburg, KS—cities that are working toward a 100 percent clean and renewable future. There are 88 major businesses that are getting in on the action as well— Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Nike, Coca-Cola, General Motors, and Apple. These are only a few of the major companies that have committed to powering themselves with 100 percent clean and renewable energy. What is driving this move toward clean and renewable energy? It is that Americans everywhere are seeing the effects on the ground. They are calling for action, and community leaders and business leaders are responding. We need to respond here in the U.S. Sen-ate. We should be holding hearings on how to put this plan into action. We should be taking the best ideas from the city actions and the business ac-tions and the nonprofit actions from across the country and from the ideas generated on the right side of the aisle and the left side of the aisle because the destruction we face—the threat we face—is not a blue issue or a red issue; it is a human civilization issue. America has been a driver of the technology that can transform our economy and also the technology that we can sell to the world. In adopting this vision and in fighting for this vi-sion, America can be a leader with other nations around the world. It has been beyond strange to have other countries lecture us over the last few months to maintain our commitment as a Federal Government to this vision. Other countries are saying: America, you have to be part of the solution. You have benefited enormously from the burning of fossil fuels, perhaps more than any other economy in the world. You have one of the highest per capita footprints for carbon. You must be part of this effort because every country in the world is affected. More than 40 countries have now adopted the vision of clean and renew-able energy, so there is no time for America to step out and not be part of the solution, not be part of the leader-ship, not be part of the driving force, not benefit from being on the cutting edge of this transformation of the en-ergy economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2627 April 27, 2017 
Just as President Kennedy laid out the vision for going to the Moon, Americans from every walk are coming together to lay out the vision for a 100 percent clean and renewable energy economy. They are adopting a frame-work—a time, a goal—as to where we are going and when we are getting there; 100 by 50 sums it up. After President Kennedy laid out the vision, America went to work to make it happen, and we landed American citizens on the Moon. Now it is time for all of America to get to work and implement this vision and ensure that we succeed in transforming our energy economy within the next few decades by taking important steps every single year—driving ourselves forward, under-standing the urgency, applying the technology, accelerating the imple-mentation—to achieve 100 percent clean and renewable energy by 2050. If there were an asteroid coming to-ward the Earth, we would not be talk-ing politics or political advantage. We would all be working together to take it on—destroy it before it destroyed us. We have the equivalent of an asteroid that is coming at the Earth in global warming. The time to play politics has passed. The time to play partisanship has passed. It is time for every citizen and every organization at every level— every chair representing every Senator from every State in the Union—to come together to take on this chal-lenge together. I call upon my fellow Senators to be part of, perhaps, the most important effort we have to solve the biggest challenge to the health of America and the health of the planet—global warm-ing. Step forward and be part of the ef-fort. Thank you, Mr. President.

S. R ES. 147 Whereas Saturday, April 29, 2017, marks the 25th anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest; Whereas the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest is also referred to as the 1992 Los Angeles riots, the South Central riots, the Rodney King riots, the Los Angeles uprising, the 1992 Los Angeles civil disturbance, and ‘‘Sa-I- Gu’’, which means April 29 in Korean; Whereas the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest began in South Central Los Angeles, Cali-fornia, following the acquittal of 4 Los Ange-les Police Department officers who were charged with using excessive force against an African-American taxi driver named Rod-ney King; Whereas the acquittal immediately re-sulted in the formation of large crowds and a public outcry over concerns of racial injus-tice and police brutality, which soon led to civil unrest at the intersection of Florence Avenue and Normandie Avenue in Los Ange-les and continued throughout Los Angeles; Whereas, during the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest, more than 60 individuals lost their lives amid the looting and fires, more than 2,000 individuals suffered injuries, and more than 11,000 individuals were arrested; Whereas more than $1,000,000,000 of prop-erty damage was incurred during the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest, with approximately 3,600 fires set and destruction to over 1,100 buildings throughout Los Angeles; Whereas the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest continued for a total of 6 days, during which the unrest spread through multiple neighbor-hoods, including Koreatown, Inglewood, Hawthorne, Lynwood, Compton, and Long Beach; Whereas the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest ended following the deployment of thousands of United States Armed Forces personnel; Whereas, on May 2, 1992, an estimated 30,000 individuals gathered in a peace march in Koreatown during the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest, calling for healing and sup-porting merchants in Koreatown whose busi-nesses were decimated; and Whereas, on April 29, 2017, local leaders, business owners, and individuals in the Afri-can-American, Latino, and Korean-American communities will join together to remember the lives lost during the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest and to discuss continued work to promote unity in Los Angeles: Now, there-fore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) recognizes and offers condolences to all who lost their lives, suffered injuries, and suffered losses to their businesses and prop-erty during the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest; (2) recognizes and commends the commu-nities throughout Los Angeles for the work done to bring different constituencies to-gether to recover and rebuild Los Angeles, improve police oversight, and continue the momentum for change gained in the ensuing months and years following the 1992 Los An-geles civil unrest; and (3) expresses hope that the memory of the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest will promote greater dialogue, civility, and unity among all of the communities throughout Los Ange-les. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to introduce a Senate resolution to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest. On March 3, 1991, an African Amer-ican named Rodney King was driving on a Los Angeles interstate when offi-cers attempted to pull him over for al-legedly speeding. By the time he pulled over and exited his car following a high-speed chase spanning 8 miles, there were multiple LA police depart-ment units on the scene. King was tasered two times, and camcorder video footage recorded by a civilian witness—George Holliday— from his nearby apartment balcony de-picted the brutal beating of King by four officers who surrounded him. The officers struck King repeatedly until he was bloodied and disfigured with a frac-tured cheekbone, 11 broken bones at the base of the skull, and a broken ankle. The video footage shows King being struck by batons over 50 times, Holliday’s video was sent to news outlets and aired around the world. It shook the Nation and raised outcries about excessive force by police officers. But even before the videotape had be-come public, community leaders in Los Angeles had highlighted on numerous occasions the use of excessive force by LAPD officers. In fact, in the immediate aftermath of the Rodney King beating, then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley formed

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2629 April 27, 2017 
the Christopher Commission to thor-oughly examine thousands of excessive force complaints made against LAPD officers in the late 1980s. So when—a year later on April 29, 1992—the four LAPD officers caught on tape were ac-quitted after standing trial for using excessive force against Rodney King, the entire Nation was in shock. The verdict appeared completely incompat-ible with the brutal videotape footage that flooded our TV screens at the time. When the verdict became public, hun-dreds gathered at the Los Angeles County Courthouse to protest, and a national debate immediately began over racial injustice and excessive use of force by police against racial mi-norities. Shortly thereafter, at the intersection of Florence and Normandie in South Central Los Ange-les, the public’s frustration boiled over and violence erupted, setting off a flash point that the police simply could not quell. Looting, vandalism, and physical attacks became rampant, and I will never forget the image of Reginald Denny being dragged out of his semi- trailer truck to be severely beaten in the middle of the street. From then on, the unrest overtook the city, including neighborhoods like Koreatown, Hawthorne, Compton and Long Beach. The city, quite literally, was on fire. For 6 days, the city was in a state of emergency. All told, there were more than 60 in-dividuals who lost their lives amid the looting and fires, and thousands of in-dividuals were injured or arrested, while countless more lost their busi-nesses and places of employment. Over 3,600 fires were set and over 1,100 build-ings in Los Angeles were damaged or destroyed. Images of the smoke clouds over the city evoked the devastation felt by so many Angelenos. The 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest was felt so deeply and so personally by so many communities throughout the city. The African American community decried not only the verdict returned against Rodney King but also mourned the death of high-schooler Latasha Harlins and so many other victims of violence and excessive use of force. The civil unrest was symptomatic of the deep frustrations felt by the African- American community against a crimi-nal justice system that continually failed to protect them. Similarly, the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest was sharply felt by the Latino community in Los Angeles. According to one report following the unrest, one-third of those killed and half of those arrested were Latino, and countless Latino businesses were looted or destroyed. The Korean-American community in Los Angeles was also deeply impacted, referring to the unrest as ‘‘Sa-I-Gu,’’ to commemorate the date ‘‘April 29’’ in Korean to mark it as a significant date in Korean history. Amidst the torched and decimated businesses, 35 to 40 per-cent of the property damage was suf-fered by those businesses owned by Ko-rean-Americans—with estimates of up to 1,600 Korean-American-owned stores completely destroyed. There is no question that those fate-ful 6 days have impacted generations of Angelenos. We must resolve to never forget the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest and what emerged from those fires. We must offer our condolences for the families who lost their loved ones or who bear the scars, both mental and physical, from that time and commend those who have worked so hard to come together to heal community rifts, re-build a stronger Los Angeles, and con-tinue to promote ongoing dialogue, ci-vility, and unity among all commu-nities. That is the purpose of this resolution we are introducing today. I want to thank Senator H
ARRIS for working with me on the resolution to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of this historic event in California. I yield the Floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2630 April 27, 2017 
floor for months now to recognize someone in my State who has made a difference, someone who has devoted time and energy to making Alaska a better place to live for the community and for others. We call these individ-uals our Alaskan of the week. It covers Alaskans from all over the State. As I have said repeatedly in every one of my ‘‘Alaskan of the Week’’ speeches, I believe Alaska is the most beautiful State in the country—I would argue, in the world. I urge everybody in the room—the pages, the Presiding Of-ficer, and the folks watching on TV—to come see for yourself. It will be a trip of a lifetime, I guarantee it. But it is the people who truly make Alaska unique, people who are helping each other, people who face tough odds and conquer them, strong-willed, warm- hearted, tenacious people who have carved generous lives and sometimes in very extreme conditions. Today, our Alaskan of the week is going to be a twofer. We are going to do two today. So I would like to recog-nize two Alaskans, Madison Englund of Fairbanks and Jennifer Troutman of Anchorage, as our Alaskans of the week. These are two special athletes who have made all of us in Alaska very proud. Last month, Madison and Jennifer returned to Alaska with a slew of med-als from the 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games in Austria. First, these young women did everything in their power, including training their hearts out, to qualify for these world Olympic games, and when they got there, they excelled. Madison won a Gold Medal in the advanced super-G snowboard race and added a Silver Medal in the advanced giant slalom. Jennifer claimed a Silver Medal in Monday’s advanced super-G ski race, as well. Jennifer has been an athlete with Special Olympics for 11 years. During her freshman year of high school, she participated in bowling, track and field, and floor hockey through the Partners Club. During her junior year, she found a passion for skiing and has been excelling on the slopes ever since, as you can see from these incredible medals from the Special Olympics. She also works at Petco during her free time. Madison has been part of Special Olympics for 7 years. Aside from sports, she enjoys other hobbies, to in-clude playing the cello, camping, fish-ing, and caring for animals. She is proud of her dogs, and she has three of them. She also loves to make jewelry. She said it is her favorite hobby. In ad-dition to all this, she has also won the Good Citizens Award from the Daugh-ters of the American Revolution. Since its founding nearly 50 years ago and subsequent growth to all cor-ners of the globe, the Special Olympics has brought hope and joy and self-es-teem to countless children and adults with intellectual disabilities and, of course, to their families and friends and their supporters like me. Special Olympics has shown what can happen when a group of people get together and sweat it out and work hard in the name of fair competition, camaraderie, and perseverance. These Special Olym-pians—all Special Olympians, really— make us in Alaska proud. I want to thank Jim Balamaci, who has been the Special Olympics Alaska head for many years, and his whole team for giving so many Alaskans the opportunity to get out to the field or the slopes and experience the fulfill-ment of sports for all. In Alaska, we love our Special Olym-pics athletes. They are an inspiration to all of us, whether it is when they are competing or even participating in the Polar Plunge in the icy waters of Alas-ka every winter to raise money for Special Olympics. Congratulations again to Jennifer and Madison on your hard work and in-credible achievements and representing Alaska so well. Congratulations. You have earned it, being our Alaskans of the week. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alaska.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF THE HONORABLE STEVE STIVERS 
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, as the Dean of the Ohio Republican delegation (M
ARCY KAP-
TURhas served a few more years in total), it’s my honor to recognize S
TEVE STIVERS for his service to the House of Representatives, and also to our nation. Since being elected in 2010, S
TEVE has brought an enthusiasm and dedication to his work in Washington, and back home in Ohio. He is not only an incredible asset to this body and to his constituents, but he also has a gre-garious personality that draws people in and puts them immediately at ease. To put it an-other way, you always know when S
TEVE  S
TIVERS enters the room. But, perhaps the most impressive thing about S
TEVE is his service in the Ohio Army National Guard. Having served his country with great distinction both here at home and overseas in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and Djibouti, he was recently promoted to the rank of Briga-dier General. And fortunately, Mr. Speaker, S
TEVE brought the leadership skills he learned in the military to Congress, and we are all bet-ter for it.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE FOURTH ANNUAL LAX FOR A CAUSE EVENT 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Southwestern Youth Associa-tion (SYA), the Chantilly Youth Association (CYA) and an outstanding young woman, Tatum Bulger, whose collaborative efforts have made ‘‘Lax for a Cause,’’ a local, annual pre-season lacrosse tournament for charity, a tremendous success. This year, the event raised $22,000 for Special Love, a nonprofit organization that provides support and re-sources to children in the Mid-Atlantic region with cancer. The tournament originated in 2014 when Damien LaRuffa, the Commissioner of SYA Lacrosse, Scott Stewart, the Vice Commis-sioner of SYA Lacrosse, and Chris Saben, the Commissioner of CYA Lacrosse, came to-gether to brainstorm ideas for charitable sport-ing events in Northern Virginia. Since its in-ception, the annual event has been a tremen-dous success, previously donating proceeds to the Wounded Warrior Project, the Fisher House Foundation, and more. This year, Tatum Bulger, a sixth grader at Virginia Run Elementary School and avid lacrosse player, who was diagnosed with Ewing Sarcoma last year, approached the organizers with the idea of donating the proceeds to Special Love, and the SYA and CYA immediately moved forward with the idea. Tatum is truly a special and inspirational young woman. She has used her individual battle to benefit others and increase aware-ness about pediatric cancer. Additionally, as a member of the SYA Lady Warriors, she has maintained her commitment to her lacrosse team, attending weekly practices and games, and she has a unique and special impact on her teammates and friends. Throughout the years, local sponsors and community members have covered the major-ity of the expenses for the all-day ‘‘Lax for a Cause’’ tournament, which has enabled a ma-jority of the donations to go to charity. And while the event organizers were extremely sat-isfied with this year’s event, they hope that other teams and youth organizations will host similar charity games or tournaments. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me as we recognize ‘‘Lax for a Cause’’ and the chari-table efforts set forth by the SYA, the CYA, and Tatum Bulger. Dedicating their time and efforts to helping children and their families fight an unthinkable battle with cancer attests to their unselfish character and determination to better their community. I wish them all of the best in their future endeavors. f 
TOM NOLAN, UPON HIS RETIRE-MENT FROM THE BOARD OF THE SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that long-time board member Tom Nolan is leaving after having served on the board of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency since 2006 and as Chairman since 2010. I want to add my con-gratulations to those of countless others for the contributions that Tom made during his decades of public service. Tom has been a longtime friend and col-league and I have always admired his ability to bring peace to the negotiating table and to get to yes. He is truly a regional thinker and a transportation visionary. He was my col-league on the San Mateo County Board of Su-pervisors during the 1980’s, and it was from this position that he first became immersed in the subject of public transportation. While San Francisco has long had a well-developed pub-lic transit system, San Mateo County lagged far behind. Tom was instrumental in creating the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, the operator of Caltrain. He successfully fought for extension of BART to San Francisco airport and served the entire region as a mem-ber of the MTC. Even Santa Clara County owes a debt of gratitude for its transit system to Tom Nolan, as the light rail system relies upon a segment brought into the system by Tom’s advocacy. He could have rested on his laurels when he left San Mateo County to become a resi-dent of San Francisco, but instead he decided to once again become a leader in transpor-tation issues. It takes the genius of a heart surgeon and the patience of a saint to serve on the MTA board. Tom met these standards with his tireless advocacy for service improve-ments, sound labor relations, a vast bicycle network to reduce reliance upon cars, bike sharing, replacement of the bus fleet, and sup-port of the staff and transit system when the economic downturn brought painful adjust-ments. Every board member deserves our thanks for his or her dedication to the public, but the enormity of these responsibilities is often ap-parent only in hindsight. Few cities in America have tried to do what the MTA is doing over time: Create a transportation system that re-lies upon multiple modes of movement to cre-ate a modern city and to extend economic op-portunity to all neighborhoods of San Fran-cisco, all the while integrating this system with the region’s needs. The new Central Subway and the T Third Line are just two of the latest examples. Tom’s advocacy was essential to creating these options, just as his persistent advocacy led in the creation of Caltrain and the airport extension. When a pedestrian is not hit while crossing a busy intersection, Tom Nolan’s advocacy is in part responsible for this wonderful outcome. When a father is on time picking up his child from daycare, he probably never stops to thank Tom Nolan for the bus ride that brought him to the center, but he should. When a housing advocate rises to support the creation of workforce housing along a transit corridor, I doubt that Tom’s name ever comes up as one of the reasons that robust service exists along that particular public right of way. As the Giants fans pull into the 4th and King station, I’ll bet that exactly zero riders pause to won-der who made that trip possible. In part, it was countless professionals and advocates over decades, but in large part it was Tom Nolan. As Tom leaves his position on the MTA board, his legacy is evident in concrete and steel, as well as painted bike paths and floral dividers between bikes and vehicles. It is evi-dent in the quality of life that is led by San Franciscans and those in the Bay Area who quietly go about their business each day. Long before San Francisco had Uber, our region had Tom Nolan. One trades on a public stock exchange and is highly valued by finan-cial analysts while the other quietly serves in modest but influential public service. There is no doubt in my own mind which is more valu-able. Let us all give thanks for Tom Nolan, the ultimate transportation app because he doesn’t require a smartphone, a charged bat-tery or a good cell phone connection to get the job done. He’s just a guy with a big heart and a mighty vision who delivers value to the public the old fashioned way: He earns it.

TRIBUTE TO PUNAHOU SCHOOL NATIONAL SCIENCE BOWL TEAM 
HON. COLLEEN HANABUSA 
OF HAWAII  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Punahou School’s win in the Ha-waii Regional Science Bowl and for earning the opportunity to compete in the National Science Bowl for the second year in a row. Created by the Department of Energy’s Of-fice of Science in 1991, the National Science Bowl is one of the largest and most pres-tigious academic competitions in the United States. Over 265,000 students have partici-pated throughout the National Science Bowl’s 26 years. This year, over 14,000 students competed for a coveted spot in the National Science Bowl. Each team completed a series of daunting hands-on challenges that tested their knowledge. This meeting of some of the brightest student minds has encouraged thou-sands to expand their understanding of mathe-matics and science and pursue careers in such fields. This week, Punahou School will compete against 62 other high schools in the National Science Bowl. To the Punahou School team— John Winnicki, Andrew Winnicki, Anna Kimata, Deborah Wen, Conrad Newfield, and Coach Warren Huelsnitz—all the best in this year’s competition. They are a great example to their peers and I wish them continued success in their education and careers. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent these students and their families in the United States Congress and I know all my colleagues in the House will join me in congratulating them on competing in the National Science Bowl Finals 2017.

COMMEMORATING NATIONAL MINORITY HEALTH MONTH 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, I am here to recognize the month of April as National Minority Health Month. The Afford-able Care Act is a transformative piece of leg-islation that has helped millions of uninsured people to acquire affordable health insurance who otherwise would not have access to qual-ity patient-centered care. This legislation was not just relegated to help the poor and the needy but also the 177 million employer spon-sored insured employees with additional health benefits that never existed before the Affordable Care Act. For instance, ACA pro-hibited insurance companies from discrimi-nating individuals with pre-existing conditions, and imposing lifetime cost caps on patients. Under ACA, parents can keep their children on their insurance plan up to the age of 26. Also, insurance companies are required to spend 80 percent of all premium dollars to-ward direct medical expenses and 20 percent toward insurance companies’ administrative costs. Otherwise, they must reimburse the customer some of their money back. Cur-rently, ACA has allowed more than 20 million U.S. residents to have health insurance cov-erage, which has improved the racial and eth-nic disparities among minority population. The purpose of the Affordable Care Act con-sisted of five basic goals: 1. Expand health insurance coverage for nearly 50 million uninsured people in the United States, which consist of 44 percent Whites, 32 percent Latinos, 16 percent African Americans, 6 percent Asians, 2 percent Native Americans and 0.4 percent Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders. 2. Reduce health care costs by establishing marketplaces called exchanges where federal and state-based marketplaces will have a sin-gle process to determine whether someone is eligible for tax credits to reduce the cost of premiums, in the form of cost sharing, Med-icaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program. ACA requires a minimum standard of essential health benefits to include ambulatory patient services, prescription drugs, emergency serv-ices, rehabilitative and facilitative services, hospitalization, laboratory services, maternity and newborn care, preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management, mental health and substance use disorder services (including behavioral health treat-ment), and pediatric services (including oral and vision care). Whereas before, ACA’s es-sential benefits did not exist, thus leaving the prospective patients without quality access to care. 3. Reduce health care fraud and abuse 4. Improve health care quality through sev-eral initiatives: (1) a national quality strategy; increased reliance on value-based purchasing; expansion of meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs); better care coordina-tion; development of quality measures for Medicaid and Medicare; and measures of quality in the marketplace. 5. Improve population health that includes reducing racial and ethnic disparities among the minority population. One aspect of the ACA helping people of color to reduce dispari-ties is by requiring health plans to cover cer-tain preventative services such as blood pres-sure and cholesterol screening, mammograms and Pap smears, and vaccinations, with no cost-sharing. The ACA increased funding for community health centers, which provide qual-ity primary and comprehensive services to un-derserved communities. They served approxi-mately 25 million people in rural and urban centers where more than half of the patients were members of various ethnic and minority groups. We need more doctors and allied health professionals to assist a healthcare system that for decades was not adequately address-ing health disparities among millions of racial and ethnic minority Americans. Many of our minorities are disproportionately more likely to suffer deleterious health disparities just be-cause they are low-income wage earners, poorer in health and suffer worse health out-comes, and are more likely to die prematurely and often from preventable causes compared to their White counterparts. Some of the ex-amples of these health disparities include the following: The infant mortality rate for African Ameri-cans and American Indian/Alaska Natives are more than two times higher than that for whites; African Americans with heart disease are three times more likely to be operated on by ‘‘high risk’’ surgeons than their White counter-parts with heart disease; Hispanic/Latina women have the highest in-cidence rate for cancers of the cervix; 1.6 times higher than that for white women, with a cervical cancer death rate that is 1.4 times higher than for white women; Puerto Ricans have an asthma prevalence rate over 2.2 times higher than non-Hispanic whites and over 1.8 times higher than non- Hispanic blacks; Together, African Americans and Hispanics account for 28 percent of the total U.S. popu-lation, yet account for 62 percent of all new HIV infections; American Indian/Alaska Natives have diabe-tes rates that are nearly 3 times higher than the overall rate; and Of the more than one million people infected with chronic Hepatitis B in the United States, half are Asian-Americans and Pacific Island-ers. In addition to the unacceptable costs of human suffering and premature death, there are significant economic repercussions of al-lowing health disparities to persist. A 2010 study from the Health Policy Institute at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Stud-ies found that the total costs of health dispari-ties were $1.24 trillion over a three-year pe-riod. This same report found that eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities would have reduced direct medical care expenditures by $229.4 billion over the same three-year period. Many analysts over the past several years have reported that investments through the Af-fordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 have helped double the number of clinicians in the National Health Service Corps by providing scholar-ships and loan repayments to medical stu-dents and primary care physicians and other healthcare professionals as incentives for them to practice in underserved communities. The ACA helped bridge some of the gap in workforce diversity to include dentists and other primary oral health care providers. Increasing the proportion of African-Amer-ican dentists is critical because studies show that they are more likely to serve in under-served communities than their white cohort. In 2010, underrepresented minority (URM) Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino of any race, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander-stu-dents composed 13 percent of the overall ap-plicant pool for dental school programs. For the 639 URM applicants who enrolled in 2010, the enrollment rate increased only by 1 per-cent since 2009. A statistic that shows that progress is needed. Dental schools today are graduating 300 Black dentists out of 5,000 each year. Today, 5 percent of dentists are Af-rican-American. Black dentists treat nearly 62

IN CELEBRATION OF MRS. PEARL BIGGS’ 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my sincerest congratulations and Happy Birthday wishes to Mrs. Pearl Biggs, who is celebrating her 100th birthday on Tuesday, May 2, 2017. A birthday celebra-tion will be held for Mrs. Biggs on Saturday, April 29, 2017. In 1917, the United States entered World War I, women did not yet have the right to vote, and segregation was rampant in the South. This is the year Mrs. Pearl Biggs was born to Mahaley Jones and Wiley Bunkley. In-deed, Mrs. Biggs has seen much in her life-time and through it all, she has relied on her faith in the Lord. Mrs. Biggs began working as a cook at a young age and so it was inevitable that she would become known as a very good cook. In 1937, she married Pedro Biggs and they would spend the next 76 years together until his passing in 2014. Pearl and Pedro Biggs opened one of the first Black-owned businesses in the Geneva and Box Springs area in Southwest Georgia. They owned several businesses, including Biggs Sandwich Shop, a movie theatre, and a pulpwood company. They were also farmers. Mrs. Biggs loves to sing and she sang in the choir at her church. Her favorite song is ‘‘Let Jesus Lead Me.’’ She loves collard greens and the color pink. She enjoys fishing and talking on the phone. Mrs. Biggs has never met a stranger—she always wants to feed people and no one ever goes hungry around her. George Washington Carver once said, ‘‘How far you go in life depends on your being ten-der with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and toler-ant of the weak and strong because someday in your life you will have been all of these.’’ Mrs. Biggs has advanced far in life because she never forgot these lessons and always kept God first. As she celebrates 100 years of life, Mrs. Biggs will be surrounded by her sons, Monroe and Allen; daughters-in-law, Mildred and Cyn-thia; grandchildren, Timothy, Kelton, and Amelia; and great-grandchildren, Jackson and Christopher; plus a host of other family mem-bers and friends. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, along with my wife Vivian and the almost 730,000 people of Georgia’s Second Congres-sional District, in honoring an outstanding cit-izen and woman of faith, Mrs. Pearl Biggs, as she, her family, and friends celebrate her 100th birthday. IN RECOGNITION OF VISTA MARIA AND ITS 2017 WOMAN OF ACHIEVEMENT HONOREE GLEN-DA REED HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vista Maria and its 2017 Woman of Achievement Honoree Glenda Reed. As founder and CEO of Crossroads Learning Center, Ms. Reed has dedicated her life to protecting children, teens and adolescents. Founded in 1883, Vista Maria is a private, non-profit agency that provides treatment and care for vulnerable youth with emotional and behavioral problems resulting from neglect or abuse. Since its establishment by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, the organization has evolved into a multi-service agency that pro-vides comprehensive support to children and their families. In addition to its community youth assistance programs, Vista Maria runs two on-campus charter schools at their 37- acre Dearborn Heights campus, as well as a health clinic, residential treatment programs, and foster care initiatives. Collectively, these initiatives provide critical services to support and improve outcomes for high-risk youth and adolescents. Vista Maria also raises aware-ness and recognizes outstanding women in the community at its annual Celebrating Women event. Vista Maria’s 2017 Woman of Achievement Honoree is Glenda Reed, an educator who founded the Crossroads Learning Center, an early childhood education facility in Detroit. Crossroads provides high-quality childcare and after-school care for children ages 0–12. In addition, Ms. Reed runs Once Upon a Time, a nonprofit organization that recognizes and supports survivors of childhood abuse. Her ef-forts to support these individuals have helped empower them to take control of their lives and fulfill their potential. She has also traveled around the country as an advocate for these women, and her exceptional work on their be-half is more than deserving of this prestigious honor. It is my hope that Ms. Reed and Vista Maria continue to build on their legacy of serv-ice on behalf of these youth. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Vista Maria and its 2017 Woman of Achievement Honoree, Glenda Reed. Their work has had a tremendous impact and helped improve the lives of countless women.

HONORING LONNIE CARPENTER OF WEST VIRGINIA 
HON. EVAN H. JENKINS 
OF WEST VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, Lon-nie Carpenter. Lonnie, a lifelong Wayne Coun-ty resident, served his country as a seaman onboard the USS Ault destroyer during the Korean War. After his service, Lonnie returned back to his home in the beautiful hills of West Virginia and started a family with his wife of more than 63 years, Edna Davis. Together they had three wonderful children, and Lonnie provided for them through his career in the banking and finance industry. Lonnie is a proud Mason, having been conferred the 33rd Degree, and chronicled the history of Freemasons in many articles for the Scottish Rite. Lonnie also served a term as a councilman for the town of Ceredo and volunteers his time for numerous organizations that have im-proved the lives of the people of his commu-nity. I thank Lonnie for all he has done for the people of West Virginia and for his service to our nation.

HONORING JOHNSON CHAPEL 
HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Johnson Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church and its pastors for 100 years of teaching, preaching the Gospel, and making strides in our community. The Johnson Chapel A.M.E. Church was founded in 1915 by John Fair, James Craig, Roxie Graves, Cora Martin, Ed Ackers, and Nancy Craig. It was formally established in 1917 with Reverend S.E. Edwards as its first pastor. Originally a small congregation meet-ing in a house on State Street, the church is now highly regarded within the community and has relocated to a significantly larger building on Hamilton Street in El Centro, California. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was formed out of the Free African Society, established in 1787. African Americans faced unending discrimination while trying to practice their faith in American Methodist churches. Some churchgoers went as far as pulling Afri-can Americans off their knees as they prayed. Black members of St. George’s Methodist Episcopal Church split off to create their own African congregation. Wanting to avoid dis-crimination and obtain religious autonomy, many black Methodists began to switch over to African Methodist Episcopal churches. Currently, the A.M.E. Church has member-ship across twenty Episcopal Districts in thirty- nine countries, on five continents. Although the church was founded by people of African descent and heritage, it is open to people of any background or race. They place emphasis on the plain and simple gospel and tirelessly work to spread the word of Jesus Christ. The Johnson Chapel A.M.E. Church has been led by thirty-one dedicated ministers over the past 100 years. They have worked to improve the church and build a community around it. Not only does the church take care of their own members, they have also pro-vided educational programs and outreach to benefit youth in their area. I would like to recognize the Johnson Chap-el A.M.E. Church for their 100 years of dedi-cated teaching and service within our commu-nity.

IN RECOGNITION OF FREEDOM HIGH SCHOOL’S CHARITY PROM 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the students, faculty, and Principal, Doug Fulton, of Freedom High School located in Loudoun County, Virginia, for their leader-ship and efforts to raise money and aware-ness for pediatric cancer. For the second year in a row, Freedom High School will be for-going a lavish, expensive prom and instead will be hosting the event in their cafeteria and gymnasium, where the proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to pediatric cancer orga-nizations. Two years ago, Principal Fulton and several students saw an opportunity for the school to engage with their community and join the fight against childhood cancer when they learned about the Prom Challenge, an initiative set forth by St. Jude Children’s Research Hos-pital. Through this initiative, St. Jude Chil-dren’s Research Hospital provides schools with the tools needed to transform their normal prom events into pediatric cancer fundraisers. Last spring marked the first time that Free-dom High School partook in the challenge, and this unique event truly sparked interests and efforts of the entire student body, faculty, and community. When the decision was made to transform the school’s cafeteria and gym into a dining room and ball room in an effort to save money on a venue, many students were at first skeptical and disappointed. Yet once they learned about the challenge, they became excited and very eager to raise money and awareness for the event. Addition-ally, the Hilton Washington Dulles Airport Hotel, the venue that had already been ar-ranged for the event prior to the conception of this charity ball, generously returned the school its $5,000 deposit. The theme of last year’s prom was ‘‘Hats on to Fight Pediatric Cancer,’’ inspired by Ellie’s Hats, a local charity in Loudoun County that provides hats to children who lose their hair during cancer treatments. To raise awareness students were asked to wear hats to the event, and some of the proceeds were in fact donated to this local organization. At the event, the food provided was all donated by Whole Foods and the National Conference Center, and the musical performers and pho-tographers each volunteered their time. Lastly, the prom king and queen were not chosen by the student body, but they were instead se-lected based on who raised the most money in their name. Every final detail and moment of this event was thoroughly planned with the intent of assisting those with pediatric cancer, and ultimately, the event raised $48,000. Mr. Speaker, while the students and faculty take great pride in last year’s tremendous prom, they now hope to make this event a permanent tradition at Freedom High School and hope that other schools will follow their lead. I ask that my colleagues join me in hon-oring Freedom High School’s students and faculty for their extraordinary work on last year’s charity prom and their continuous ef-forts to champion this initiative. Dedicating their time and efforts to helping children and their families fight an unthinkable battle with cancer attests to their unselfish character and determination to better their community. f 
RECOGNIZING MS. KATHY O’KEEFFE, A RECIPIENT OF THE FBI DIRECTOR’S COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP AWARD FOR 2016 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ms. Cathy O’Keeffe—the Director of the Braking Traffik organization, who is being recognized in Washington, D.C. as a re-cipient of the FBI Director’s Community Lead-ership Award for 2016. As the Director of Braking Traffik, Cathy has made remarkable contributions to our commu-nity, helping bring justice and resources to vic-tims and survivors of labor and sex trafficking. Through education, legislative advocacy and community partnerships, Braking Traffik has helped raise awareness about this important issue and has strengthened trafficking laws in both Iowa and Illinois. Cathy has devoted her drive, energy and fierce determination to this organization since 2011, and has tremen-dously helped make our community a safer place to live. I’m very proud of Cathy’s work on this issue and am pleased she’s gained the recognition of the Director of the FBI. Mr. Speaker, I want to again formally congratulate Cathy on her award, and I join the rest of our community to wish her every success in the future. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF EDWARD J. DONLEY 
HON. CHARLES W. DENT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Edward J. Donley, former Chair-man and Chief Executive Officer of Air Prod-ucts and Chemicals, Inc. in Allentown, Penn-sylvania. Ed was a dear friend and mentor to me. After 95 years of life, many of which were spent as a prominent figurehead in the Lehigh Valley’s business community and as an im-passioned advocate for early-childhood edu-cation, he passed away in Bethlehem, Penn-sylvania on April 1, 2017. As a testament to Ed’s legacy, his son John wrote a tribute to him, a portion of which I summarized and would like to include in the Record today: Ed Donley was born in Detroit on November 26, 1921. During the Depression, his family moved back to their farm near Richmond, Michigan. After graduating from high school, Donley won a scholarship to Lawrence Insti-tute of Technology (now Lawrence Techno-logical University) in Detroit and earned an en-gineering degree in 1943. Shortly before grad-uating, Donley was hired by a new industrial gas company, Air Products, located in Chat-tanooga, Tennessee, to design portable oxy-gen generators for Allied bombers in World War II. Donley met his future wife in Chattanooga: Ms. Inez Cantrell. They wed on October 24, 1946 and were happily married for 66 years until Inez passed away in 2013 from Alz-heimer’s disease. The couple had three chil-dren—Martha, Tom, and John, ten grand-children, and a growing bevy of great-grand-children. Air Products relocated to the Lehigh Valley in 1949, and Donley became Vice President of Sales in 1957, President and Chief Operating Officer in 1966, Chief Executive Officer (1973– 86), and Chairman of the Board (1978–86). During his time at Air Products, he was espe-cially proud of his commitment to promoting employee safety, recruiting top students each year, and creating long-term shareholder value. In the Lehigh Valley, Donley led many local projects. In the 1960s and 70s, he was a trust-ee of Cedar Crest College, the Allentown Art Museum, and WLVT public television. He and his wife Inez gave their time and financial sup-port to Community Services for Children, the

Allentown Library, KidsPeace, Lehigh Carbon Community College, and the Da Vinci Science Center. Additionally, Donley served on many busi-ness and non-profit boards, including a stint as director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for 11 years. He was active in the health care industry as well, helping to create the prede-cessor of the Lehigh Valley Health Network in the 1970s and working with the Rotary Club to found Lehigh Valley Hospice, Inc. in 1980— just the second hospice in the U.S. at that time. Similarly, Donley held a great passion for early-childhood education. In addition to lead-ing education initiatives, he and his wife gave most of their assets to The Donley Founda-tion, a trust now run by their children and grandchildren, which supports the work of lit-eracy and early-childhood education groups. While philanthropy and a strong business acumen served as catalysts for many of Ed’s lifetime endeavors, his commitment to his wife, his children, and his grandchildren and great- grandchildren will ultimately be how he is re-membered. Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House please join me in celebrating a giant of a man and a life well lived, as well as expressing sympathy to his family and our community, both of which have been made better by his outstanding life and legacy. Rest in peace, dear friend.

RECOGNITION AND COMMEMORA-TION OF THE ARMENIAN GENO-CIDE 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, I joined with over 80 of my House col-leagues in calling upon President Trump to properly recognize the Armenian Genocide for what it is—a genocide. Unfortunately, the president continued to ex-tend U.S. complicity in Turkey’s denial of the Armenian Genocide by failing to properly char-acterize the near annihilation of the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire as a genocide. The facts are indisputable. Over 1.5 million Armenians were massacred during the first genocide of the 20th century. As crimes of genocide continue to plague this world, Turkey’s policy of denying the Ar-menian Genocide gives license to those who perpetrate genocide everywhere. As we recognize and commemorate the 102nd Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide I join my colleagues in calling upon the Turkey government to ends its campaign of denial and urge the administration to end American complicity of this crime against humanity.

REMEMBERING WILLIAM ADAMS KIMBROUGH, JR. 
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-member the life of Mr. William Adams Kimbrough, Jr. Billy, as he was known, was a leader in the Mobile community and a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ala-bama. Billy was born in Selma and grew up in Thomasville. He attended the University of the South, or Sewanee, where he was a member of the football team and active in campus af-fairs. He later graduated from the University of Alabama School of Law. Under President John F. Kennedy, Billy served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney before working in the legal department at the GM&O Railroad in Mobile. He later joined the law firm of Stockman & Bedsole. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ala-bama. He held his position until 1981. Fol-lowing his service as U.S. Attorney, Billy joined the law firm of Turner Onderdonk where he practiced law until his retirement in 2012. Billy was a proud Mobilian and participated in many groups and organizations around Southwest Alabama. He was active in politics throughout his life and took part in many polit-ical campaigns. He also worked with the Greater Gulf State Fair, of which he was the President in 1967. He was also a man of strong and steady faith. He sang in the choir and taught Sunday School at Dauphin Way United Methodist Church in Mobile. He took great pride in see-ing his church grow and flourish. Sadly, Billy passed away on March 31st after a lengthy illness. Billy was more than just a colleague and fellow member of the Mobile Bar Association; he was also a friend of mine and my family. On behalf of Alabama’s First Congressional District, I want to share my deepest condo-lences with his wife of 58 years, Kay, his two children, Mary Elizabeth and Will, and his en-tire family. I hope you can take great comfort in the many memories together and the fact that Billy had such a profound impact on our community, state, and country. f

OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the distinguished service of the United Way of Midland as they celebrate their 70th Anniversary. For the past 70 years, The United Way of Midland has been dedicated to enriching the Permian Basin through their various outreach programs. UWM works directly with program providers in supporting over 50 programs and services that target individual needs through-out the community. These initiatives focus on three building blocks to a better life, which are: promoting quality education that leads to sta-ble employment; empowering individuals to achieve economic stability and financial secu-rity through proven methods like job training and financial planning courses; and vital health services that promote healthy lifestyles and choices. Through their work, UWM assists roughly 65,000 people annually and invests over $3 million back into the community. As a Lifetime Member of the Board of Direc-tors for the United Way of Midland, I have been fortunate enough to see firsthand the great work that this organization does for the Permian Basin community. I wish them best of luck with their future endeavors. f

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize and thank an exceptional North Caro-linian, Curtis Rhyne, who has served our state well here in Congress. After getting his start in my office several years ago, he worked for several Chairmen of the Republican Study Committee and later with my colleague, Rep. R
ICHARD HUDSON . He brought conservative Carolina values to that service, which were in-stilled in him by his parents, Jerry and Elaine Rhyne, and his entire family during his forma-tive years in Statesville, N.C. As an East Carolina University Pirate and graduate, Curtis was well prepared intellectu-ally for his work here in Washington, which was primarily on energy, trade, and other pol-icy issues. He is well known in Washington for his personal attention to individuals and issues and is held in the highest regard for his pro-fessionalism and knowledge. Regardless of where he resides, I’ll always think of Curtis as a constituent and wish him well as he moves on to serve our state as a Policy Advisor for North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore in Raleigh.

U.S. WANTS TO COMPETE FOR A WORLD EXPO ACT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. ERIK PAULSEN 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 25, 2017 Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, it’s been more than three decades since the United States hosted a World’s Fair, even as there has been a recent upsurge in local and national interest to do so. Under rules from the Bureau of Inter-national Expositions, the U.S. is effectively prevented from hosting Expos and World’s Fairs because we are no longer a part of the organization. That’s why I’m joining with my fellow Min-nesotans, led by Congressman E
MMER , and a bipartisan coalition to authorize the U.S. to re-join the BIE. This effort also urges U.S. gov-ernment assistance in advancing Minnesota’s bid to host EXPO 2023. I believe my home state of Minnesota is the perfect place to usher in a new era for Amer-ican membership in the BIE. Business, civic, and community leaders in Minnesota have al-ready created the Minnesota’s World’s Fair Bid Committee to start preparing for this unique opportunity to show what our state, our region, and our country have to offer. We should work with the appropriate federal departments and agencies, and take the nec-essary steps to ensure the United States re-joins the BIE so that we are not at a disadvan-tage and so our great cities and states can ex-perience being on display on the world stage.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to your attention the outstanding achieve-ments of Rev. Patricia Bruger and her con-tributions to the Center of United Methodist Aid to the Community (CUMAC) on this spe-cial day, Thursday, April 27, 2017. Born and raised in Washington, DC, Patricia is a graduate of the University of Maryland, where she earned her BS in Education in 1969. She worked for the Girl Scouts of Amer-ica and was a public school teacher. From 1969 until 1972 she served as a high school teacher in Silver Spring, Maryland. She later moved to New Jersey, and served as a sub-stitute teacher in Bergen County from 1985 to 1991. She then received her Masters of Divinity at the Drew Theological Seminary in 1995 with over 25 years of experience in social and civic ministries. She is an ordained Elder of The United Methodist Church, a certified Mentor for the Board of Ordained Ministry, a certified counselor for the Clergy Partnership on Do-mestic Violence, and a member of the Bishop’s Task Force on Urban Minorities. Patricia is a committed social servant dedi-cated to the eradication of hunger and poverty through direct source and broad advocacy ef-forts. Patricia has been the Executive Director of CUMAC for over 26 years. She has led the organization through a tremendous period of growth from operating out of an abandoned church to purchasing its own 28,000 square foot facility and from a small food pantry to a multi-service agency serving over 40,000 peo-ple in need every year, providing food assist-ance, disaster relief, job training, supportive housing, and hope to a community facing per-vasive poverty. She was a founding and active member of the Emergency Food Coalition of Passaic County (newly operating as a CUMAC pro-gram), the NJ statewide Anti-Hunger Coalition, and the Paterson Alliance. Patricia has been a leading voice for her community, advocating for hunger to be addressed in the state budg-et, as well as rallying support for SNAP bene-fits and Breakfast after the Bell, to feed hungry students so they can concentrate on their edu-cation instead. Patricia’s forward-thinking and leadership abilities has encouraged and inspired staff and volunteers to partake in CUMAC’s mission of taking care of others. She has raised aware-ness about pervasive poverty through this or-ganization, and strives to fulfill the needs of people who do not have the adequate re-sources to function in their daily lives. She has worked closely with other feeding programs throughout Passaic County and northern New Jersey to bring about change in the commu-nity, and to assist in eradicating poverty. The job of a United States Congressman in-volves much that is rewarding, yet nothing compares to recognizing and commemorating individuals who have dedicated their lives to serving the people. Patricia has truly left an everlasting mark on my hometown of Paterson. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our col-leagues, family and friends, all those whose lives she has touched, and me, in recognizing the work of Rev. Patricia Bruger and her strong desire to help those in need across the world. f

FINANCIAL LITERACY MONTH 2017 
HON. JOYCE BEATTY 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as Co-Chair of the House Financial and Eco-nomic Literacy Caucus in recognition of Finan-cial Literacy Month. Every day, Americans are faced with finan-cial decisions that impact their lives and their families. That is why promoting financial and economic literacy is so important and why we draw attention to it each and every April. Financial literacy is a lifelong journey, whether writing a monthly budget, managing your credit, or saving for retirement, every American needs to understand the basic prin-ciples of planning, saving and investing for the future. In that spirit, I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor/support bipartisan House Resolution 243, which promotes the ideals and goals of Financial Literacy Month, and to also partici-pate in tomorrow’s Financial Literacy Day on the Hill. Let’s ensure more Americans can build a better financial future this Financial Literacy Month and all year round.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. JACK W. SCHWARTZ 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Jack W. Schwartz on his 102nd birthday. Mr. Jack W. Schwartz is from Hanford, Cali-fornia. Growing up, Mr. Schwartz graduated from Hollywood High School at the age of fif-teen and went on to earn both his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Science degrees in Civil Engineering from California Institute of Tech-nology. After working in various engineering jobs, Mr. Schwartz joined the United States Navy in 1940 as a Lieutenant Junior Grade in the Civil Engineering Corps. His first Navy as-signment was at Pearl Harbor, and he was later transferred to Guam in January 1941. Barely a year later, on December 8, the Japa-nese Navy attacked Guam. On December 10, 1941, Guam became the first American territory to formally surrender to an enemy in World War II. Lt. Schwartz and the sailors and Marines on the island became prisoners of war (POW) for nearly the next four years. Lt. Schwartz and the other officers were sent by boat to the Japanese port of Tadotsu on the island of Shikoku to become slave laborers for Japanese corporations. Upon arrival in mainland Japan, Mr. Schwartz was taken to the Zentsuji POW Camp nearly 400 miles west of Tokyo. While in this camp, Lt. Schwartz was beaten and denied food, water, and medical service whenever he de-fended and advocated for those under his command. In September 1942, he was trans-ferred to Tokyo 2B Kawasaki and later sent to Zentsuji in August of 1944. His final transfer was in June 1945 to POW Camp 11–B Rokuroshi. This camp was located in the Jap-anese Alps, where food was scarce, condi-tions were overcrowded, and winter clothes were unavailable, leading many to believe they would not survive the harsh mountain winter. However, the camp was discovered and liberated on September 8, 1945, several days after the formal surrender of Japan on September 2. After the war, Lt. Schwartz re-mained in the United States Navy and later re-tired in 1962 as a Commander. At the age of ninety nine, Mr. Schwartz was invited to take part in the Fifth Delegation of American Former POWs of Japan where he met with Japanese officials, students, and vis-ited the sites of former POW camps. He felt the experience was important for remem-brance and reconciliation. Mr. Schwartz served as the Public Works Director and City Engineer for eighteen years in Hanford, California. Since his retirement in 1980, Mr. Schwartz has been active on many city and council projects including serving eight years as City Planning Commissioner and five years on the Kings County Grand Jury. The most prideful accomplishment of Mr. Schwartz’s long career in public service is his work in helping to procure the funds to create and design Hidden Valley Park in Hanford. Today, Mr. Schwartz has a son, a step-daughter, and a grandson. His favorite hob-bies are woodturning and making things out of wood, reading, and writing with the Remington Ramblers, a local writing workshop. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in wishing this extraordinary American, Mr. Jack W. Schwartz, well on his 102nd birth-day and thanking him for his years of military and public service.

HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an accomplished individual, a dis-tinguished pillar of our community, and a per-sonal friend, Pastor Wallstone E.

passion, his vision and his dedication to scrip-ture and service, not just with his church but with the entire community. Pastor Francis was born in Nassau, Baha-mas, and moved to the United States in 1971. After earning a Bachelor of Theology and Bachelor of Arts Degrees from American Bap-tist College of American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee and an Honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree from Selma University, in Selma, Alabama, Pastor Francis began his ministry in Smyrna, Ten-nessee and later Franklin, Kentucky. On May 3, 1992, Pastor Francis was in-stalled as pastor of Shiloh Baptist Church. In his two and a half decades of service, Pastor Francis has become known as an incisive teacher of the Scripture, a dedicated minister to his congregation, and an upstanding leader in his community. In addition to his Christian ministry, Pastor Francis gives back through his service on the Waukegan Civil Service Com-mission and as a volunteer Chaplain at Victory Memorial Hospital and the Lake County Jail. Pastor Francis has been blessed with more than forty years of marriage to Mrs. Angelia Rene Otey William. Their loving family in-cludes grown children and grandchildren, in-cluding children who came to the family as foster children. I am also honored to celebrate their commitment to foster care. Illinois’s Tenth District and the Waukegan community is lucky for Pastor Francis’s leader-ship. On this moment of anniversary, I wish him, his family, and the entire Shiloh Baptist Church community all the best in the years to come.

TRIBUTE TO FORMER CONGRESSMAN EARL E. HILLIARD 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 27, 2017 Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend, former Con-gressman Earl Hilliard, who will celebrate his 75th birthday this weekend, at a gathering of his family and friends in Birmingham, Ala-bama. While a Member of this body, Earl and I worked very closely together, preserving the integrity of historically black colleges and uni-versities and supporting the preservation and restoration of historic sites and buildings. At his weekend gathering they will establish a scholarship in his honor in order to help more rural Alabama young men and women have opportunities to further their education. I want to congratulate my friend for reaching this milestone in his life, a place I got to more than a year ago, and wish him a happy birth-day and further success in establishing more benefits for young men and women throughout Alabama. Family: Former Congressman Earl Frederick Hilliard was born in Birmingham, Alabama on April 9, 1942 to Iola Frazier and William Hill-iard. In 1967, Earl Hilliard married Mary Frank-lin. Both were the first person on both sides of their families to attend and graduate from col-lege. They have two children: Alesia Hilliard- Smith (R. J. Smith) and Earl Hilliard, Jr. (Janine Hunt-Hilliard) and four grandchildren: Roderick Smith, Jr., Reginald Smith, Earl Hill-iard, III and Nya Hilliard. In June 2016, the couple celebrated their 50th wedding anniver-sary. Education: Earl graduated from Western- Olin High School in 1960. Because of his ex-periences growing up in segregated Bir-mingham, he chose to attend historically black colleges and universities. He received a B.A. from Morehouse College in 1964, a J.D. from Howard University School of Law in 1967, and an M.B.A. in 1970 from Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University) School of Busi-ness. He was awarded an Honorary Degree— Doctor of Humane Letters—in 2000 from Talladega College. Civil Rights/Black History: While a student at Morehouse College, in Atlanta, Georgia, Hill-iard met Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The meet-ing had a powerful effect on him, and he be-came ‘‘one of King’s foot soldiers in the war for racial equality. He worked with voter-reg-istration drives and participated in many pro-test marches. He continued his work when he was elected to the Alabama House of Rep-resentatives where he chaired the first Ala-bama Black Legislative Caucus. Political Career: In 1974, Earl F. Hilliard was elected to the Alabama House of Representa-tives where he chaired the Alabama Black Legislative Caucus. In 1980, he was elected to the Alabama State Senate and chaired the Alabama State Judiciary, Commerce, Trans-portation and Utility Committees. His Senate career focused on helping the urban poor, who constituted the bulk of his Birmingham- area constituents. He earned a reputation as a hard-fighting, tactical legislator. In 1992, Hilliard won a seat in the U.S. Con-gress, becoming the first black Representative from Alabama since Jeremiah Haralson left of-fice after Reconstruction. ‘‘We have not had a voice in 117 years,’’ Hilliard declared upon his first election. ‘‘I will be able to articulate the views and opinions of a group that hasn’t had representation in a very long time. His district included three major cities—Selma, Mont-gomery, and Birmingham—all of which were battlegrounds at the heart of the 1960s civil rights movement. Hilliard’s initial focus in Congress was cre-ating economic opportunity for his constitu-ents. He supported legislation that would help Alabama’s urban poor. He called for a South-ern Rural Development Commission, modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission to assist economic development in rural commu-nities in ten southern states. Congressman Hilliard reestablished Gees Bend Ferry. He at-tempted to protect and expand the Alabama military installations used by the U.S. Army and the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-ministration. He worked to protect a Tusca-loosa-area airport that was difficult to sustain because of the region’s sparse population. ‘‘Tuscaloosa and the surrounding communities would suffer terribly without local air service, and this travel option will become increasingly important as industrial development continues in the area,’’ he wrote to a colleague. Due in large part to Congressman Hilliard’s lobbying, the House and Senate Appropriations Commit-tees diverted limited funding to Tuscaloosa in the Essential Air Service legislation. He suc-cessfully pushed funding to support Alabama’s historically black colleges and universities and provided scholarship money for minority stu-dents. Hilliard was also crucial in convincing a Korean-based car manufacturer to open a plant outside Montgomery. While in Congress, he served on the Agriculture, Small Business, International Relations and Foreign Affairs Committees. An active member of the Con-gressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hill-iard was elected vice chairman of the organi-zation for the 105th Congress (1997 through 1999). Academic Career: Earl F. Hilliard began his career as a teacher at Miles College (1967 through 1968) and later was an assistant to the president of Alabama State University (1968 through 1970). While in Congress, he didn’t forget what he’d learned and the impor-tance of procuring funding to support Ala-bama’s historically black colleges and univer-sities and to provide scholarship money for mi-nority students. Over the years, he has helped countless relatives, friends, and constituents achieve their educational goals by providing fi-nancial support to students who desired to pursue advanced degrees, but were financially unable to do so. He has mentored an innu-merable amount of people, from high school and college students to seasoned profes-sionals. Awards/Honors: In 1974, Earl F. Hilliard re-ceived Omega Psi Phi’s Businessman of the Year Award and he was given Delta Sigma Theta’s Distinguished Service and Achieve-ment Award in 1975. He was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Award, in 2010, from Morehouse College National Alumni Associa-tion. In 2011, Earl F. Hilliard received an Out-standing Alumnus Award from National Alumni Council of the United Negro College Fund and in 2015, he was one of the recipients of an Alabama Majesty Award from Miles College. Community Involvement and Associations: Earl Hilliard holds Life Memberships in Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. and the National As-sociation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He also holds or has held memberships in the National Bar Association, the Alabama State Bar Association, the Amer-ican Civil Liberties Union, the Alabama Law-yers Association, the Morehouse College Alumni Association, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Morehouse Athletic Foundation, Inc., of which he was one of the incorporators. He has served as Trustee of both Miles College Law School and Tuskegee University. He currently serves as a Deacon, Elder and a Sunday school teacher for the Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church of North Pratt and previously served as Chair-man of both the Deacon and Trustee Boards.
