Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the memory of Bancroft ‘‘Nick’’ Littlefield, a dear friend and dedicated public servant who passed away last week. Few in our country could match Nick’s ca-reer. From stages on Broadway to classrooms at Harvard Law School to courtrooms in New York City and eventually to the halls of this Capitol as an aide to my uncle Senator Ted Kennedy—Nick did it all. Always guided by the simple principle that our laws should help and protect our citizens, his fingerprints can be found on every page of landmark legislation such as the Children’s Health Insurance Program, Americans with Disabilities Act, Family Medical Leave Act and the 1996 minimum wage increase. As Senator Kennedy’s Staff Director for the Senate Health, Education and Labor Com-mittee from 1989 until 1998, he worked tire-lessly behind the scenes to enact bipartisan reforms to our health insurance market and mental health system that would ultimately lay the foundation for the Affordable Care Act. Each day he arrived at his Senate office, he brought a contagious enthusiasm for his work and extraordinary empathy for the people he served. For all of his peers, regardless of political party, and for me as well, he will always be an inspiration because of his faith in what our government can accomplish when we work to-gether. Even while battling the multiple system atro-phy that would leave him unable to walk, talk, write and sing, he considered himself ‘‘not en-tirely unlucky’’ to have the disease because it allowed him to ‘‘truly sympathize’’ with others who had disabilities. Mr. Speaker, because of Nick’s devotion to our country, those effected by once incurable illness have been healed, families struggling to care for a loved one are able to keep their job, millions of children have received the health care they need, and millions more who work for a living have been able to ensure that they do not live in poverty. His intelligence, compassion, and dedication were matched only by his devotion to his fam-ily. In this difficult time, my thoughts and pray-ers are with Nick’s wife, Jenny Lyman, as well as his stepchildren Frank, Tom and Kate. Our nation has lost a good man, but we are all better for the life he lived. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.

RECOGNIZING KEEP TENNESSEE BEAUTIFUL ORGANIZATION 
HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 17, 2017 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, it’s with great honor that I rise today to recognize the Keep Tennessee Beautiful organization for re-ceiving the Keep America Beautiful State Affil-iate Innovation Award for their publication of Nancy and Sluggo Love Tennessee: A Story About Keeping Tennessee Beautiful. Written and illustrated by Guy Gilchrist, this story showcases the remarkable attractions, natural resources, and historic landmarks of the great state of Tennessee, all while pro-moting the importance of taking care of our community by recycling and not littering. Nancy and Sluggo Love Tennessee is a treas-ured keepsake that educates children and in-stills a sense of pride in being a Tennessean. As proven by their achievement, Keep Ten-nessee Beautiful does outstanding work in in-novatively educating and engaging the young minds in our community and I applaud their dedication to our state.

HONORING DR. JOHN ‘‘JACK’’ MANNING 
HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY III 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 17, 2017 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the memory of Dr. John ‘‘Jack’’ Manning who passed away last week at the age of 96. A life-long resident of Massachusetts, Jack attended Coyle High School in Taunton before enrolling at Boston College and earning his Medical Degree from Tufts University. Imme-diately after his graduation, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served aboard six warships from 1946 through 1950 as the only doctor. When he returned home, he started a family with his beloved wife, Lily, and opened a pedi-atric office in Fall River. While continuing to operate his own private practice, Jack volun-teered to become the Medical Director at a school for children with development disabil-ities. Through nearly 50 years at the school, he never accepted a penny for his services. Caring for those children became the cause of his life and he continued to fundraise for the school through the end of last year. More than his professional and community service work, it was his love for his wife and his family that always guided him. Shortly after opening his pediatric office, Lily contracted paralytic polio. At the age of 33, she would never walk again, and Jack would never leave her side. After two years in hospitals through-out Massachusetts, Lily returned to a ren-ovated home that accommodated her every medical need. Together they raised their sons, Jack and Mike. A little over a decade ago, when Lily re-turned to the hospital for the last time suffering from pneumonia, Jack was asked how he took care of his wife and their boys for so long. He replied that, ‘‘Ours is not a sad story. I love her just as much today as I ever did, and I know she would have done the exact same thing for me.’’ If only we could all be so lucky. On behalf of all the children who Dr. Man-ning treated and all of the people he inspired, I extend my thoughts and prayers to his family in this difficult time. f
