Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the situation we are currently facing regarding the House version of the farm bill. The House farm bill, traditionally, for over 40 years, is one of the most bipartisan things that we do here in Congress, Democrats working with Republicans throughout the various regions of America. This is the third farm bill that I have had the opportunity to participate in, working together. So where are we today? We are exactly where we should not be. We are facing a vote this week on a partisan farm bill that is both, in my view, bad policy and divides us even further as a country. This bill does not promote or demonstrate the successful programs, I think, necessary to strengthen our trade in the agricultural sectors across the country. America trades throughout the world, and our agricultural economy is dependent, in large degree, on our ability to produce more food than we can consume; and, therefore, trade becomes very important. American agriculture needs a farm bill that supports and promotes not only trade, but, now perhaps more than ever with looming escalation of a trade war sparked by the administration’s efforts with steel and aluminum, we see tariffs taking place on a host of products grown in the Midwest—sorghum, corn, and wheat—and in California potential increases in beef and pistachios and almonds. So that doesn’t fare well. This version of the farm bill also does not adequately support the dairy safety net. Of course, our dairy economy is big throughout the Midwest and in California, actually, the largest dairy State in the Nation. Nor does it do enough for our specialty crop farmers who grow the fresh fruits and vegetables that are a part of a healthy diet. California grows half of the Nation’s fruits and vegetables. This bill also proposes to make changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as SNAP, which will likely devastate parts of the food program that are working well. This, after all, is America’s safety net, and we have a lot of not only children and elderly, but people who are disabled who depend and rely on these important food nutrition programs. We do all believe that ablebodied people should be working, and all of us have the same goal in ensuring that those ablebodied people are selfsufficient. If we want people to become self reliant, let’s give them a SNAP program that does just that. We have 10 pilot projects in 10 different States that are working, and they are to report back next year on what best works to get ablebodied people working and what doesn’t work. But this proposal in this House version is doomed to failure, and the House CBO has scored it accordingly. Instead, it will likely cause our SNAP education to create training programs that will collapse, costing billions of dollars, creating a new Federal bureaucracy that was never given a chance to succeed. We should not be in this position, Mr. Speaker. Where should we be? We should be working together, as we have with previous farm bills, Democrats and Republicans, deliberate, negotiating, and, yes, even disagreeing over ideas and approaches, but coming together with important compromises. The farm bill is America’s food bill. It is also a national security item. People don’t think about it that way, but the ability to produce all for America’s dinner table every night the most healthy, nutritious food in the world is a national security issue, I believe. Therefore, we must support our food security and safety for our fellow Americans. Our Nation’s food policy must feed Americans and ensure our 
farmers, our ranchers, and our dairy producers can all be successful. b1015 It should not serve some and abandon others, and it should not further divide us as a country. As I have said, this is the third farm bill that I have had the privilege to work on. We have worked through these differences in the past, and we have worked through the challenges. It is my hope that Congress can do this again. But it will not happen if we allow the partisan armtwisting to ram this bad policy through the House. A vote against the House version of the farm bill is a vote for something better, which is the Senate version, where they are working together, traditionally, in a bipartisan fashion— that is what we should be doing—and not engaging in these partisan games that create bad policy. Therefore, a vote against the current bill on the House version is one that is a good vote, and it is one that protects our past farm policies as they have worked. A ‘‘no’’ vote is a vote for more support for our farmers and for our families. It is demanding that Congress do better because we can, and we must, do better. The Senate version is currently the version that I think, ultimately, is going to succeed. I look forward to continue working with our colleagues on the other side—Republicans and Democrats—who are fostering a bipartisan bill—Senator ROBERTS and Senator STABENOW . I look forward to moving past this version of the farm bill so that we can set aside this outrageous effort in partisan politics and get back to work on America’s food bill, a national security issue, to be sure. 
UNDIAGNOSED GYNECOLOGICAL CANCERS IN AMERICAN WOMEN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform the House about our team’s work on behalf of women in my district and across the Nation. Last month, data from Yale University gynecologists demonstrated that between 2 percent and 10 percent of American women undergoing gynecological operations end up having missed cancers. It is shocking to think that these cancers are found only after women undergo these surgeries. These missed cancers are at high risk of being spread by the very surgeries these women are undergoing to help them. My physician constituents, like the Reed family, tell me that this represents an unacceptable and seismic epidemic of undiagnosed gynecological cancers that are prone to spread and upstaging with catastrophic results. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I have asked the CDC to immediately consider guiding gynecologists towards the use of more precise preoperative tissue biopsy methods in order to identify the women at risk. I am now awaiting a response from CDC leadership with a plan of action aimed at containing what is likely to be a shocking epidemic of undiagnosed gynecological cancers in American women. Mr. Speaker, we must stay focused on this situation in order to protect all women from this grave health risk. NATIONAL POLICE WEEK  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week, and I am proud to recognize a member of the law enforcement community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, whose quick thinking delivered justice to a survivor of abuse. Officer Michael Marks of the Middletown Township Police Department promptly and professionally investigated an allegation of abuse of a nonverbal patient who had suffered blunt force trauma. His diligence led to a grand jury inquiry, which ultimately brought charges against a caretaker, who was later found guilty. Because of the work of Officer Marks, this individual will no longer be able to prey on the defenseless members of our community. Mr. Speaker, I would like to personally thank Officer Marks for his work in defending our community and send a message to all of my neighbors in Middletown Township that they are undoubtedly safer for having him on our police force. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, over the past year, women all over our country collectively raised their voices and are continuing to change our culture for the better. Today, I would like to recognize a group of women in our district actively working to make Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a better place. The Makefield Women’s Association in Yardley last month donated over $27,000 to local charities, including: A Woman’s Place, the Family Service Association Emergency Homeless Shelter, the Penndel Community Food Pantry, Wrapping Presence, and the YardleyMakefield Volunteer Fire Company. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of the Makefield Women’s Association, which greatly improves the quality of life for our community. I would especially like to thank the organization’s president, Jennifer Ketler, for her leadership and for her service. 
FARM BILL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to my colleague from California talk about his deep concerns and reservations about the farm bill that is slowly grinding its way, perhaps, toward the floor being considered today by the Rules Committee. While we have somewhat different perspectives and different districts, we are united in the fact that this farm bill does not remotely reflect the needs of the American public. One of the problems is that we fail to address the disparate array of subsidies under the farm bill, benefiting a few States, a few districts, a few types of farming operations, and ignoring the rest. The famous nutrition professor, Marion Nestle, of NYU has written a great essay, ‘‘The Farm Bill Drove Me Insane,’’ dealing with her attempts to try to understand and rationalize it. One of the most memorable portions is how she describes what an American diet would look like if it was based on the way that our farm bill subsidies are arrayed. The diet would consist of a giant corn fritter because 78 percent of the farm bill resources goes to the production of industrial corn and soy, not fruits and vegetables, which would be a tiny microscopic part of that plate. There would be a little hamburger patty because that is less than 5 percent, and there would be a little cup of milk. And she points out that that meal, based on the farm bill allocation, would be accompanied by a giant napkin because 13 percent of the farm bill is allocated to cotton subsidies. The farm bill shortchanges the vast majority of American farmers and ranchers, who are not heavily subsidized, who produce food—the fruits, vegetables, and orchard, products that deal with nurseries. The majority of States and the majority of farmers and ranchers are shut out. There is an area of crop insurance subsidy. I will tell you, I was stunned when I read the Statement of Administration Policy because they are concerned with two areas, one dealing with a necessary subsidy for people with nutrition assistance. They are afraid that a few poor people would have access to lower cost food through the Food Stamp program. They want to crank that down, limit it, and force people to work. Well, if you look at the farm bill that they are supporting, they are doing nothing to encourage wealthy farming interests to rely less on subsidization. They are concerned about expanding the subsidizes for people under the SNAP program. At the same time, we are given a farm bill that explodes the limits on the amount of subsidy that can flow to wealthy farming and ranching interests, and it expands the subsidy so that nieces and nephews and cousins are eligible. People who aren’t working on the ranch are somehow eligible for Federal largesse, but they would deny hungry people, or near hungry people, lowincome people, that same sort of benefit. There are also concerns that they want to crank down on the environmental programs; they want to make them more productive. Yet this farm 
bill ignores the fact that we right now do not have enough money for the conservation programs to help farmers and ranchers who want to improve the environment. Only one in four grants gets funded, some of them swallowed up by big industrial agricultural interests that could afford to take care of their own environmental problems. But more telling is that they allow payment for things that don’t even improve the environment. Why allow large agribusiness to compete for scarce environmental funding for things like hog lagoons and fences. That is the cost of doing business. That doesn’t improve the environment. Mr. Speaker, I have introduced legislation that would correct this in terms of cutting down, capping, and containing unnecessary subsidies; reducing overly generous crop insurance; and making conservation programs performance driven. I hope the day will come when we might be able to debate something like that on the floor of the House. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning, during National Police Week, to recognize and remember the men and women in blue, who protect and serve our local communities each and every day. Law enforcement officers leave the safety of their homes each day not knowing if they will pass back through their own front doors when their day is done. They leave their families behind to ensure the safety of our loved ones at schools, in neighborhoods, and on roadways. These individuals are true public servants who answer the call and put their lives on the line. Among their many roles in the community, law enforcement officers serve as role models for our children, keep the peace in our neighborhoods, direct traffic for football games, and are the first to respond when help is needed. Far too often we take their services for granted. This week, I am proud that the House is taking up a number of important bills to support our local law enforcement. From legislation to prevent attacks on our officers to providing funding for additional resources, we are working to ensure that these dedicated individuals have the tools they need to do their jobs and keep us safe. See, our law enforcement officers are heroes who put their lives on the line each day to keep our citizens from harm’s way. National Police Week is a time for us to stop and show our appreciation to these heroes for all that they do for our communities. Our law enforcement officers serve selflessly, facing the many dangers of the job with courage and bravery. Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to ride along with members of the Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office in southwest Alabama. It was an eye opening experience. At every single traffic stop, the deputies had no idea what to expect. Every call was different, but each one came with an inherent risk of the unknown. Despite the uncertainty, the deputies always conducted themselves with respect and professionalism. Whether it is a routine traffic stop or responding to a domestic call, these officers have no idea how their encounters will turn out. There is always the risk their interaction on the job can turn hostile and, in some cases, even deadly. National Police Week is also an opportunity to honor the heroes who have lost their lives while serving our communities. In 2017, 136 officers were killed in the line of duty. Already this year, 54 officers have lost their lives while serving our communities. Sadly, one of these deaths occurred in my home State of Alabama earlier this year. Mobile Police Officer Justin Billa paid the ultimate sacrifice when he was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call on February 20. At just 27 years old, Officer Billa left behind a loving wife, Erin, and a 1 yearold son, Taylor. In such a time of immense grief, we saw the city of Mobile rally together to support the family and friends of fallen Officer Billa. You see, these officers are much more than enforcers of the law; they are an integral part of the community. Mr. Speaker, I loved seeing the community wrap Officer Billa’s family up in a shield of prayer and love, but we shouldn’t just do that when we lose an officer, and we shouldn’t just do it during National Police Week. Each and every day, we should show our deep appreciation to members of law enforcement, at every level, who put their lives on the line so that we can live in safe communities. May we not forget that we get to lay our heads down on our pillows at night feeling safe because of the brave men and women out there patrolling the streets. Mr. Speaker, as we observe National Police Week, I can think of no better way to show appreciation for our men and women in blue than encourage every American to take the time to say ‘‘thank you’’ to your local law enforcement officers. May their sacrifices never be forgotten. 
b1030 TINDER FIRE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, Arizona’s First Congressional District is home to some of the most beautiful forests in the country, including the Grand Canyon, but paired with the dry conditions and high heat, the First District is historically home to some of the worst wildfires in the country. Earlier this month, my constituents in rural Arizona faced off against the Tinder Fire, which spread more than 16,000 acres before being mostly contained. It could have been far worse. I rise today to commend the hundreds of brave first responders, community leaders in Arizona and across the West, public safety officials, who worked tirelessly over the past 3 weeks to contain the fire and protect residents and their homes. It was their quick thinking and expert training that prevented this fire from spreading even further and destroying hundreds of homes. The fire, which was reported on April 27 by Coconino Forest officials, and before the fire even reached 50 acres on the second day, the decision was made to bring in the Type 1 Southwest Area Incident Management Team to oversee the firefighting efforts and safety efforts. This is unheard of for fires of this size, but it turns out that it was the right call. The Type 1 IMT team was able to set up a strong line of defense and get hotshots and firefighting crews on the ground to save hundreds of homes, ranches, and lives. This was not the only proactive measure that was taken during the early stages of the fire, Mr. Speaker. During my visit to the Type 1 incident command center earlier this month and to the fire site, the team shared with me their work. I have to extend my sincerest gratitude to the Coconino National Forest, Coconino County Sheriff’s Office, and the county staff in their work. They saw the dry conditions in the area, they saw the weather report of high winds coming, and the decision to evacuate residents was made before the fire grew to a significant size. It was made correctly. They made this decision as that fire moved towards large subdivisions, and it was moving at a rate of 3 miles in 1.5 hours. The wind speeds were up to 50 miles an hour. This contributed to one of the smoothest evacuation efforts these teams have ever seen, and it made a difference. It saved lives. My team worked with local county and State officials to deliver information and resources to those who were evacuated to the centers. In addition to the more than 800 personnel on the ground, I want to thank the communities who stepped up to help from all across the Western United States and from all across Arizona. In both Coconino and Navajo Counties, businesses opened up their doors to evacuees and their livestock and their pets, and volunteers signed up to assist at evacuation shelters. It was interesting when I visited the site, the trees were not burned except for underneath. The fire was moving so 
fast, that the crown fire did not occur, but you could see where the trees were bent and the needles on the tree were all pointing in the direction of the wind. The fire spread out throughout and then hit those homes, and then the homes went up in fire, over 3 dozen homes. Fighting efforts were aided by the work of homeowners. These residents over time had personally cleared fuel, like small trees and underbrush, from their home. They followed firewise community planning. Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank all of the brave men and women who worked to contain this fire. I would advise anybody to look into this more to understand the difficult conditions that they have to work in: 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours on the line, going back to pup tents to sleep for a few hours, and then going back out into the field to save lives and save homes. Then after this fire, they will move right on to another one. That is, sadly, the condition of our forests in the West. This fire and the prevention of loss of life and death from other destruction was to be accomplished only by professionals who did this in a way that brought honor to their service. 
TENNESSEE FARMER OF THE YEAR, JOHN VERELL, III The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Verell, III, of Madison County, Tennessee. Johnny, as he is better known to his friends, was named Farmer of the Year by the University of Tennessee. Johnny is a third generation farmer who began farming in 2005, 40 years after his grandfather started the family business. Farmers from across the State were nominated for the honor by their county extension agents. Johnny’s commitment to land stewardship, community service, and savvy business tactics stood out among all other nominees. The Verells’ farm is over 5,000 acres of wheat, soybean, and corn. Johnny manages all the land for sustainability, including installing wildlife food plots, planting buffer strips along streams, and using best practices that reduce the amount of fertilizer and pesticides applied to the crops. He has even planted 20 acres designated as pollinator habitat to help native bee populations survive and thrive. With the help of technology and precision agriculture, the Verells have been known to produce in excess of 300 bushels per acre. That is the way things are done in west Tennessee. Congratulations to Johnny, his wife, Crissy, and their daughter, Emmi. MIGHT CANNOT MAKE WRONG RIGHT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to stand in the well of the House. I consider this an extraordinary privilege. Mr. Speaker, there are seminal moments in time, moments in time that can impact the rest of time; seminal moments, sometimes where wrong is placed on the throne, where might is used to justify wrong; seminal moments in time, but, Mr. Speaker, might cannot make wrong right. Might cannot make wrong right; it can only prolong wrong. Seminal moments in time, where might is used to justify wrong. Might did not make slavery right. There were those who used false religiosity to try to justify slavery. They had the might, they had the power, they could impose their will, but might will not make wrong right. Might did not make segregation right, to force people to go to separate areas, to use a level of power to impose an indecency upon a people. Might can never make wrong right. Mr. Speaker, might has not made invidious discrimination right. It still exists today. No matter how much power we have, we will not make it right simply because we have the power to try to justify it with the might that we have. Finally, Mr. Speaker, might will not make bigotry emanating from the Presidency right. It will not. There are many who want to just let it go, let it go, the bigotry, put it behind us. Bigotry emanating from the Presidency impacts this country. It gives this country a stained image in the world. The President represents this country. He represents every one of us. We may differ with him, but he is the standardbearer. The bigotry that emanates from the Presidency is something that we all have to concern ourselves with. We can’t just say it is all over with, let’s let that go. Yes, it has happened and it continues to happen, and might will not make it right. He has power, but his power is not going to cause his invidious and harmful commentaries to become right. I am here today to simply say this, Mr. Speaker, that while the President has the power, impeachment is the remedy. A President who has said that there were some good people among those in Charlottesville; a President who would ban Muslims from the country; a President who has said LGBTQ persons shouldn’t be in the military; a President who has called the sons of some professional athletes—called their mother’s dogs, SOBs; a President who has said that in—— The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee). The gentleman will suspend. For what purpose does the gentleman from Pennsylvania seek recognition? Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this type of language is not allowed in the people’s House, directing it towards the Presidency. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this type of language has been accepted on the floor of this House. People address language to the Presidency—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. All Members will suspend. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. The gentleman may continue. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Presidency is about the people. It is about the people’s House. And the people have a right to address this invidious discrimination emanating from the Presidency. I am not going to stand for it. Others may stand for it. You know that there is bigotry emanating from the Presidency, yet you would not want me to stand here and address it. I will address it. This President has exhibited a kind of bigotry that this country ought not tolerate. When he said that there were some s hole countries as he was addressing his immigration policy, he was putting his bigotry into policy. And that is something we all should concern ourselves with, the fact that the President’s policies are based upon his bigotry. Impeachment is the remedy. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f 
AMERICAN SUGAR The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the American farmer. Mr. Speaker, will this body recognize the heritage and culture, the sacrifice of American farmers, who for generations have provided for our country and our world. I rise today in support of one of America’s most important agricultural commodities that supports an industry which produces $20 billion of domestic economic activity annually: sugar. I have the honor of representing southwest Louisiana, where sugar contributes $3.5 billion to our State economy annually and employs over 16,000 hardworking Louisiana citizens. Mr. Speaker, these men and women have come into their lives embracing the heritage and hard work of their mothers, their fathers, their grandmothers, their grandfathers. For generations, by the toil of their labor and the sweat of their brow, they have tilled the soil and raised sugar. The United States has historically been a reliable supplier of highquality, 
lowcost sugar that is used by consumers domestically and internationally. In fact, Americans on average spend over 20 percent less for sugar than consumers in other nations, and manufacturers pay roughly the same price for American sugar that they did in the 1980s. American sugar growers last year produced 32,000 tons of sugar, 13,800 tons of which came from south Louisiana. While sugar prices have remained flat for the past three decades, the cost of farming has not, as equipment, fuel, and fertilizer costs have all risen between 90 percent to 200 percent in that same timeframe. b1045 We must protect the future of American sugar and American sugar farmers, American sugar farm families. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support American farmers and pass H.R. 2, the Agricultural and Nutrition Act of 2018, as amended, by the House Committee on Agriculture. 
RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF CAPTAIN TIMOTHY A. TOBIASZ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement and many distinguished accomplishments of Captain Timothy A. Tobiasz, Commanding Officer of the United States Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Captain Tobiasz has honorably served our country with over 32 years of ActiveDuty military service. His career began in the U.S. Army as a Black Hawk assault pilot, where he served in the 9th Cavalry Brigade, 9th Infantry Division ‘‘Old Reliables’’ at Fort Lewis, Washington. In 1991, he was accepted to the United States Coast Guard’s Officer Candidate School, commissioning as an ensign in 1992. From there, he quickly rose to the rank of captain, and during his 32year military career, Captain Tobiasz amassed over 7,000 flight hours and qualified in nine different aircraft, to include the MH–60 Jayhawk, MH–90 Hornet, HC–130 Hercules, MH–65 Dolphin, and the HC–144 Ocean Sentry. He served at Coast Guard Air Stations Clearwater, Florida; San Diego, California; HITRON–10 Kodiak, Alaska; New Orleans, Louisiana; Savannah, Georgia; and Cape Cod, Massachusetts; and as the commanding officer of two bases. In addition to his remarkable aviation career, Captain Tobiasz served in the U.S. Senate as a military liaison officer, as a budget and program reviewer at U.S. Coast Guard headquarters, a senior military adviser to the U.S. Northern Command/NORAD combatant commander, and a National Security Fellow at the Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. Of his many outstanding achievements during his storied career, I would like to highlight three. In 1999, thenLieutenant Tobiasz was one of only six pilots selected to pioneer Helicopter Interdiction Squadron 10. This successful concept led to one of the most significant policy changes in Coast Guard aviation history through the development of the aviation use of force policy and establishment of a permanent command in Jacksonville, Florida, now responsible for armed counterdrug operations around the entire globe. In 2005, while serving as the operations officer at Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans, Lieutenant Commander Tobiasz led rescue operations during and immediately after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast, and in a 10day period, aircrews under his leadership saved over 1,400 lives. Most recently and just last year, Captain Tobiasz was called upon again to lead air rescue operations following landfall of Hurricane Harvey over Texas and Louisiana. Thanks in great part to his extraordinary coordination and unflappable judgment, he strategically directed 53 aircraft and 415 aviation personnel for 21 different units, saving lives of over 1,700 civilians. Mr. Speaker, I join a very grateful Nation in thanking Captain Timothy Tobiasz and his family for their service and sacrifice, and wish them the absolute very best in their next careers. 
A TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ‘‘DON’’ THOMAS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I would like to recognize one of my constituents in Pennsylvania’s Third Congressional District, Mr. William ‘‘Don’’ Thomas, who will make history this evening when he becomes the oldest student to ever graduate from Butler County Community College, also known as BC3. Mr. Thomas began taking classes at BC3 in the fall of 2010, and this evening, at 80 years old, he will proudly receive an associate of arts degree in history. Furthermore, Mr. Thomas also represents the most senior graduate in the class of 2018 among our State’s four other western institutions within the Pennsylvania Commission for Community Colleges. Now, you have got to know something about Mr. Thomas. He is an Air Force veteran who honorably served our country as an Airman Second Class with the 17th Squadron. I want you to think about something. This man, while serving in France from 1956 to 1959, enrolled in classes provided by the University of Maryland held outside the northeastern French town where he was stationed, and while there, he earned 28 credits. All these years later, following a successful life and career, Mr. Thomas decided to enroll at BC3 in order to finish the degree he started in 1956. Mr. Thomas credits much of his academic success to BC3, which has been rated the top community college in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in backtoback surveys. BC3 president, Dr. Nick Neupauer, is beyond proud of Mr. Thomas and believes his accomplishment is symbolic for the entire community college. Now, additionally, Don Thomas receives an abundance of love and support and encouragement from his beloved wife, Nancy; their six children; their eight grandchildren; and their four great grandchildren. Can you imagine tonight’s graduation ceremony when he stands there with all those people and receives his degree? Now, Mr. Thomas was not a traditional college student. He inevitably faced obstacles along the way, but regardless of the circumstances, he never abandoned his goal of earning his degree. Mr. Thomas reminds all of us that, with faith, hard work, and determination, anything is possible. Mr. Thomas embodies the spirit of a lifelong learner and is a living testament to the saying: ‘‘If there is a will, there is a way.’’ His unwavering dedication, passion, and perseverance in pursuit of his dream is not only inspiring and amazing, it is quintessentially American. It is who we are as the American people. Mr. Speaker, I am so blessed to be able to stand on the floor of the people’s House today and congratulate Mr. Thomas on a job well done and count him as one of our district’s finest constituents. Mr. Speaker, I say to Mr. Thomas: Happy graduation day. Happy graduation day. 
MOTHER’S DAY, GRADUATIONS, DREAMERS, AND PUBLIC HOUSING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to begin discussion on the floor for issues that, I think, against the backdrop of Mother’s Day, the desire to be family friendly in this Nation, and really to answer the question of Americans: Can our government do well by them? So I raise to the body how we can be more constructive, and I do it on the basis, as we all do, when we go home and interact with our constituents, and so I did as I went home this past weekend a couple of days in the midst of the exciting graduations that we all had a chance to go to and to make remarks, and I want to congratulate those students that I had the privilege of being and speaking at their graduations, the 
Historically Black College Texas Southern University, the Lone Star Community College, what an amazing group of graduates. There were large numbers of people who are adults and veterans, and students who were what we call early college graduating. And then, of course, to the system, the Houston Community College, I spoke there. It looks like I was going to graduations and celebrating with their families. That was good. Mr. Speaker, they were diverse, all backgrounds, religions. That is what Houston is all about. At the same time, I visited with and had a press conference with a collective body of humanitarians, Sister Rogers, a Catholic Sister, and many others, about the unfortunate circumstances of where we are with the Dreamers and why we haven’t addressed that question and why would Dreamers, who need to be statused, who are lawyers and doctors, and some are serving in public service—we had a paramedic standing with us—why we can’t get them statused. Why can’t the Nation do what is right? Why can’t the President stand up and work with us and sign the bill? And then I indicated that I am going to introduce the restatusing of TPS statused persons, some who have been here for 20 years with mortgages and people in college, young people in college, and to status them for 2 years to allow the Congress to fix it and that their status be tied to the laws and requirements that they be in sync with those who would get citizenship so they would not be, if you will, awry of the law, that they would be in step with the law, as most of these families are from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti, and beyond. And then I went to stand with mothers at public housing and indicated to them that it is long overdue in all of our communities that we introduce an infrastructure bill of $150 billion to fix our public housing. Because as I was standing with these mothers at Cuney Homes, their air conditioning was out. But we stood there the day before Mother’s Day to salute them and say they deserve to live in quality housing. They are raising their children. Some of their children go off to the United States military. Finally, I think it is important to acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, maybe this is a confused statement by the administration, but I have to speak against, and these are my friends, we want to work internationally—I was here for the permanent trade agreement that was done with China—but it is important to know that our economy is based on innovation. Why would the administration support the Chinese firm of ZTE that our intelligence community has taken note that they have interfered with our innovation and our technology and suggest that he wants the Chinese workers to have their jobs again? I certainly want the best for any country, but I do know it is important to restore the jobs of the American people, and there are many call center American companies that would make a great infusion of energy and dollars in various communities across the Nation. It is important to note that the House Intelligence Committee report of 2012 indicated and concluded that ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus poses a security threat to the United States and our systems. Well, it is odd that this President, who has put extensive sanctions on Iran and North Korea, is now willing to overlook a House Intelligence report indicating, of course, that ZTE cannot be trusted. So I started, Mr. Speaker, by congratulating my graduates, but I indicated throughout that I am baffled by these policies of the administration, but I do say that I have a faith in this institution, and I ask my colleagues: Stand with me on the restoration of a 2year status for TPS so we can get it right. Let us not separate mothers from their children in the immigration structure, and let’s pass a Dreamers bill, and let’s work to introduce funding for our public housing that exists and that mothers are living in across America. Mr. Speaker, your kindness is appreciated. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 59 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Dr. Ted Kitchens, Christ Chapel Bible Church, Fort Worth, Texas, offered the following prayer: Father, we praise You for allowing us to be the land of the free and the home of the brave. We embrace the truth that we are all created in Your image. We all have value and purpose in this life and in this country because of Your love for us. Your Word says: The foundation of prosperity is righteousness and that ‘‘when righteousness increases, the people prosper and rejoice.’’ Would You cause personal and national righteousness to be our banner and our vision, that we might know your good favor across our great country. Father, this House has business to do for ‘‘we the people’’ today, and I pray that all transactions that take place in these halls today would be made with spiritual wisdom resulting in the best for all. I pray in the name of the giver of all grace and good favor, Jesus. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. CICILLINE led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand before you to recognize the 64th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Because of the relentless courage of Linda Brown, her parents, and civil rights leaders, the abhorrent segregationist policy of ‘‘separate but equal’’ education came to an end. As a result, millions of children were afforded the educational opportunities they deserve and their rightful shot at a successful life. Mr. Speaker, as an educator, as a lifelong learner, as chair of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, I believe with all my heart that 
education is the key to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Sixtyfour years ago, the end of legal segregation in public schools recognized that inherent value as well. I honor the courage of those students who brought about that change. 
FIXING AMERICA’S INFRASTRUCTURE (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Americans depend on good roads and bridges to get to work every day and to take care of their families. Good infrastructure drives our economy. Americans depend on water systems to provide clean and safe drinkable water. But in this country, we have failed to make the necessary investments in water infrastructure, in roads and bridges, in essential infrastructure that is important to drive our economy. I will work with anyone on any side of the question on both sides of the aisle to make sure that we invest in America’s infrastructure. It is what we need to do to grow our economy, but, unfortunately, what the President has suggested really puts the burden on State and local governments, communities like the ones I represent. My own hometown of Flint, for example, if they had the money to put into their water system to prevent the disaster that occurred, they long ago would have done this. We need—our communities need a strong Federal partner. And the Democrats, we offer A Better Deal. We have a plan to rebuild America’s infrastructure. This is what the Congress ought to be doing. We ought not wait for the President to offer his suggestion. We should do the work ourselves. It is long overdue. 
IN HONOR OF NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to welcome all the law enforcement officers and their families who have come here to Washington in honor of National Police Week. You know, there is a saying in the law enforcement community: ‘‘In this family, nobody fights alone.’’ When an officer goes down, the whole force feels the loss and carries that burden. It is so moving to see that spirit of solidarity right here in Washington on display this week. This year, the names of 360 fallen officers have been added to our National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, including four from the State of Wisconsin. One of them is Detective Jason Weiland of the Everest Metropolitan Police Department. He was shot and killed in the line of duty last March. His daughter Anna, 10 years old, spoke at his memorial service. She said: ‘‘All of the amazing people in the world will always outnumber the criminals.’’ Those words resonated so much that Anna’s teacher helped her start a group called Be Amazing. They honor her dad’s memory by doing community service projects. Now, how inspiring is that? Another Wisconsin story I want to share is that of Officer Brian Murphy of the Ashwaubenon Police Department. Last July, Officer Murphy was hit by a drunk driver on Interstate 41. He sustained a number of lifethreatening injuries. Yet, just weeks later, he left the hospital able to stand on his own, surrounded by his family and fellow officers. It probably comes as no surprise to you to hear that he is back on the job. This week, Officer Murphy said that the decision to return to work was not difficult at all. It is about a ‘‘good sense of purpose,’’ he said. We have seen this resilience and this devotion of duty right here in the United States Capitol. I don’t think I will ever tire of seeing Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner back at their posts. As Speaker, I have had the chance to work very closely with the dedicated professionals at the U.S. Capitol Police. It has been an incredible honor—it truly has. Mr. Speaker, I know this is a very challenging time for law enforcement. If there is one thing that we have come to recognize, it is that we must not take any of this for granted—whether it is the dangers of the men and women who wear the uniform and wear the badge face, or the sacrifices that their families make, all the long nights, all the holidays that they do not get to spend together. We must not take any of it for granted. It is where our safety comes from each and every single day. We should consider it a privilege to serve those who serve and protect us. To all the cops on the beat and to all your loved ones: You do not fight alone. We are with you. We are behind you always, every day. Thank you, and God bless you. 
REFORM THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, President Trump and the Republicans are forcing the American people to swallow a raw deal. They have voted to dismantle protections for preexisting conditions. They have voted to raise outofpocket expenses. They have voted to take away health coverage from 23 million Americans. And they gave billions of dollars in tax breaks to pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare organizations. Last week, President Trump outlined his plan to further line the pockets of big drug companies and their CEOs. Democrats have A Better Deal. Our plan will fundamentally reform the pharmaceutical industry, will put government on the side of consumers and middle class families—not giant corporations—by cracking down on outrageous prescription drug price increases, allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prices for drugs, and requiring drug manufacturers to publicly release hard data justifying any significant price increase. This is the kind of deal the American people deserve: A Better Deal that will produce higher wages, lower costs, and the tools to succeed in the 21st century—not the raw deal that the President and the Republicans are offering on prescription drugs. f 
AMBASSADOR HALEY SPEAKS AT U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council, Ambassador Nikki Haley spoke truthfully about the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks in Gaza over many years by tunnel and firebombs using human shields financed by Iran. Ambassador Haley explained, as our President said: ‘‘The location of our Embassy has no bearing on the specific boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders. . . . It does not undermine the prospects for peace in any way.’’ ‘‘But let’s remember that the Hamas terrorist organization has been inciting violence for years, long before the United States decided to move our Embassy,’’ Ambassador Haley said. ‘‘This is what is endangering the people of Gaza. Make no mistake: Hamas is pleased with the results of yesterday.’’ The real story I saw in The Jerusalem Post is ‘‘Promises Made, Promises Kept,’’ not the fake news of Hamas sympathizers. In addition, last night, at the Willard, I was grateful to attend the International Republican Institute dinner led by President Daniel Twining where Ambassador Nikki Haley was honored with Secretary James Mattis to receive the Freedom Award. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
RETURN TO DISCUSSION ON THE FARM BILL (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the farm bill and the Republican majority’s scorched earth and irresponsible 
approach to a historically bipartisan bill. Throughout this Congress, the Republican majority has cast aside bipartisan efforts by keeping Democrats out of negotiations. The farm bill is no different. From sabotaging the Affordable Care Act to giving wealthy families and corporations a tax break at the cost of hardworking families, to make deep cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, this bill is on a dangerous path. We need to return to bipartisan discussion that made the farm bill a winwin for both urban and rural communities. If this bipartisan bill becomes law, roughly 265,000 lowincome children will lose access to free school meals, and more than 1 million Americans will no longer receive a benefit they rely on to buy food. We can do better because America’s farmers and children deserve better. We have a farm bill every 5 years. Is it worth kicking children and families off SNAP? No, Mr. Speaker. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Police Week to honor the heroes who dedicate their lives to keep our communities safe and secure. Montana’s courageous law enforcement officers are the epitome of selfless public service. Yesterday marked the 37th annual National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service. It is only fitting that I honor one of Montana’s fallen heroes. One year ago today, Broadwater County sheriff’s deputy, Mason Moore, made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. A routine traffic stop turned into a pursuit of two violent suspects who callously took Deputy Moore’s life. Deputy Moore was a dedicated husband and father of three, including twin teenage boys. His sacrifice to keep his community safe will not be forgotten. Today, Mr. Speaker, I honor the law enforcement community in Montana during National Police Week for their dedication, service, and sacrifice. I am grateful for those in uniform who serve and protect our communities and pray for their safety. 
b1215 GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, every week, we seem to learn more about the sophisticated network of social media bots and online ads used by Russia to spread disinformation during the 2016 election. But, as we approach our next election, the Trump administration refuses to see the very real threats or take the very necessary actions. Earlier this year, we learned the office tasked with countering foreign propaganda, the Global Engagement Center, the GEC, at the State Department had not deployed any of the $120 million it had been allocated to counter Russian information warfare, nor had it recruited a single analyst who speaks Russian. Mr. Speaker, the administration needs to take this threat seriously and act with appropriate urgency. That is why I have introduced legislation with my colleague, TEDLIEU, to clarify responsibilities for the GEC, expand its hiring authorities, and establish stronger congressional oversight. The GEC has a crucial role to play, understanding, exposing, and countering foreign propaganda and disinformation efforts. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us on this legislation to ensure we are better prepared to counter all efforts to interfere in our electoral process. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to remember all members of law enforcement who have given their lives to protect and serve others. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C., displays the names of law enforcement officers who have fallen in the line of duty, dating back to 1791. One of the names added this year was Lieutenant Aaron Allan of the Southport Police Department, the first police officer from the Department to be killed in the line of duty. When responding to an overturned vehicle last summer, Lieutenant Allan was shot and killed by the driver of the vehicle he was trying to assist. Sadly, we already know an officer who will also be listed in the memorial next year with Lieutenant Allan’s name: Boone County Sheriff’s Deputy Jacob Pickett. Last night, I joined members of the Indiana Concerns of Police Survivors, COPS, who are the spouses, children, and parents of fallen police officers. These people selflessly work to provide resources to people like them: families who have also experienced the pain of losing their loved ones in the line of duty. These volunteers help people cope with tragedy and loss and are incredibly strong and inspiring members of our communities. Today, may we honor the valor and commitment of our fallen heroes and support those who are missing their loved ones. CUTS TO SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, 41 million Americans and over 1 million North Carolinians’ ability to put food on the table hangs in the balance this week, as House Republicans push to pass their farm bill with over $23 billion in cuts to the SNAP program. These cuts, Mr. Speaker, quite frankly, could mean food taken off of the table of hungry children—that is no exaggeration—seniors, and veterans. Despite these benefits averaging only $1.40 per person per meal, this program is a lifeline for tens of millions of Americans. It serves as an effective tool for ensuring longterm health and wellbeing, especially for vulnerable children. The farm bill, as it is currently written, includes detrimental changes to SNAP that would make it harder for many people to remain in the program. Over 400,000 households nationwide, and at least 133,000 individuals in North Carolina, would lose SNAP benefits if this legislation becomes law. Even more disturbing is that my Republican colleagues understand what these cuts would do but remain unfazed in their assault on these families. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 2: too bad, too long for our children. 
CONGRATULATING CENTRO MATER CHILD CARE SERVICES (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Centro Mater on celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. This outstanding organization was founded by Mother Margarita Miranda Otero in 1968, with the goal of providing greatly needed childcare services to newly exiled Cuban families in Miami. Mother Otero succeeded and, over the next five decades, Centro Mater has grown and expanded its mission to provide quality healthcare and services to disadvantaged children of all backgrounds. With centers in Little Havana and Hialeah, Centro Mater offers a positive and nurturing environment for over 1,200 underprivileged children. Centro Mater’s staff also offers enriching and educational social programs for the parents of the students, such as English classes and training workshops. These lifechanging services empower children and their families within our greater Miami community. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate everyone involved at Centro Mater for all that they have accomplished in the past 50 years, and I thank them for improving the lives of so many in my congressional district. 
REPRESENTING ARIZONA’S EIGHTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT (Mrs. LESKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you and the Members of this distinguished body for welcoming me. Representing the people of Arizona’s Eighth Congressional District is truly an honor, and I am eager to work with you all to ensure that we accomplish what my constituents sent me here to do: secure our borders, strengthen our military, and create a strong economy. Earlier today, I met with Mike and Colleen Sutter from my district. Mike and Colleen have been smallbusiness owners for over 27 years in Arizona. Due to the recent tax cut package, Mike and Colleen were able to give acrosstheboard pay increases and bonuses to their employees, including a $3 an hour increase for hourly employees. The tax cuts have meant real dollars getting into the pockets of Americans and small businesses. 
PUERTO RICO’S POWER MISSION (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I ask that Federal support for Puerto Rico power restoration must continue until full completion. We still have 20,000 homes without service on the island. Last weekend, Representative LAMALFA and I were visiting one of the towns in Yabucoa. People are still without power on the island, and this Friday, May 18, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA are going to be leaving the island. That is the reason that the current electrical restoration mission through FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers must continue, and the contracts under it, without that expiration date. That is the reason the alarming situation we are still living, just 16 days away from the next hurricane season, must be stopped. I request FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers to extend the mission so crews can remain on the job fulltime until all areas are restored. This is an urgent situation on the island, and I request that FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers deal with it. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police Week. Tens of thousands of law enforcement officers from across the country are in Washington in honor of National Police Week. Established by joint resolution of Congress in 1962, National Police Week pays special recognition to those law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty for the safety and the protection of others. National Police Week is a collaborative effort of many organizations dedicated to honoring America’s law enforcement community. It is also a time where we pause to remember officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice and lost their lives in the line of duty protecting and serving others. This week honors the men and women in blue who gave everything to protect their country and their communities. Our officers put on their uniform each day knowing that they can be in harm’s way at any moment. Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to all of our officers who answer the call to serve, and I wish each and every officer a happy National Police Week. f 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, in addition to National Police Week, it is also National Infrastructure Week. Currently, much of our Nation’s infrastructure is in disrepair. Dilapidated roads, crumbling bridges, and battered levees and dams litter the country from coast to coast. In large rural areas like my district in northern California, the infrastructure gap is even more exaggerated, where funding is even more difficult to come by, as it is in all rural areas of the U.S. We have to stretch every dollar as far as possible. It is not enough to simply put more money into the system, but to make those dollars more effective. Currently, local counties must jump through multiple, duplicative regulatory hoops from both the State and Federal Government. That only wastes time and money, and it makes no sense. We have seen that local agencies have proven to be far more effective than their Federal counterparts. That is why we have to streamline the permitting process to allow States more authority to conduct environmental reviews on their own and reduce the regulatory burden. The President’s MOU to have ‘‘one Federal decision’’ policy, onestop shopping, and, indeed, one lead agency will streamline that vastly and help us get our highways done and our levee projects, multiple things that need to be done to make us safer and more economically sound—basic bipartisan reforms that will make sense for the American people in a timely manner.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 426 of the Congressional Budget and Empowerment Control Act of 1974, I make a point of order against consideration of the rule, House Resolution 891. Section 426 of the Budget Act specifically states that the Rules Committee may not waive the point of order prescribed by section 425 of that same act. Section 3 of House Resolution 891 states that: ‘‘All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.’’ Therefore, I make a point of order pursuant to section 426 of the Congressional Budget Act that this rule may not be considered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts makes a point of order that the resolution violates section 426(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The gentleman has met the threshold burden under the rule, and the gentleman from Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 10 minutes of debate on the question of consideration. Following debate, the Chair will put the question of consideration as the statutory means of disposing of the point of order. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, it was a Republican bill passed in a Republican Congress, but this act was supposed to stop Congress from passing bills that forced huge new costs on State and local governments without giving them the money to pay for those costs. Well, apparently it didn’t work, because the farm bill, which is part of this rule, would impose massive new mandates on State and local governments in the Republican majority’s quest to kick families off of SNAP. For anyone unfamiliar, that is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps to feed millions of struggling American families every day. But one provision in the farm bill would force States to deny SNAP benefits to families with an absent parent unless those households cooperate with child support enforcement agencies. According to the CBO, that is the Congressional Budget Office, it is a nonpartisan group of experts that analyze this stuff. This additional burden on singleparent families would save 
the Federal Government $4 billion, but my Republican colleagues don’t seem to have thought this through, because it would cost child support agencies over $7 billion to recoup those child support payments. So they are spending $7 billion to recoup $4 billion. CBO, that is the group of nonpartisan experts, says that the cost to States, who have no say in this matter, would be over $1 billion. Now, I don’t know who wrote this provision, since it sure didn’t come out of the Agriculture Committee or the hearings that we conducted, but whoever it was, they really need to work on their basic arithmetic skills. When you spend $7 billion to recoup $4 billion, that is what I call a terrible idea, not legislating. Now, another unfunded mandate would require States to offer employment and training services to SNAP recipients as part of the bill’s devastating new work requirements. But according to CBO, again, these are the nonpartisan experts, the bill won’t provide States with enough funds to implement those training programs. So not only are Republicans heartlessly kicking 1 million Americans off of SNAP with these additional burdens, but they also are not providing States with enough money for training programs so that these people can find jobs and get their benefits back. I mean, you seriously can’t make this stuff up. CBO, again, the Congressional Budget Office, those nonpartisan experts, reported yet another intergovernmental mandate that would prevent communities from restricting the use of dangerous pesticides, even if they determine the restrictions are necessary to protect children’s health, like stopping harmful insecticides from being sprayed near schools or hospitals. This bill also requires that every State allow the sale of all legal agricultural products from other States, preempting States’ food safety and environmental standards. Now, you heard me right. The Republicans are preventing local communities from protecting their children from toxic chemicals and forcing States to allow products that break laws meant to protect the health and safety of their own citizens. Now, Mr. Speaker, I thought the Republicans were supposed to be all about States’ rights. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act was a Republican bill, as I mentioned. What about the rules of this institution? It is actually against House rules, believe it or not, to bring a bill to the floor that imposes unfunded mandates on State and local governments. Not a problem, Mr. Speaker. The Republicancontrolled Rules Committee, or as I like to call it, the ‘‘Break the Rules’’ Committee, waived that rule and gave this disastrous farm bill a getoutofjailfree card. But it turns out that waiving the unfunded mandates rule is also against the rules of the House. That is right. Republicans, once the party of States’ rights, are rigging the rules and ignoring the law so that they can pass this disastrous bill. So here is a moment, I think, where liberals and conservatives can come together, where all my Republican friends who oppose unfunded mandates can join with many of us on the Democratic side and actually do something. This is your chance to prove it and to stand up and to be counted. Don’t let the Rules Committee run roughshod over your values in the name of passing this lousy bill. Or maybe unfunded mandates on State and local governments are actually fine with my conservative friends just so long as they are imposed on a process that takes SNAP benefits away from millions of people. As I find myself saying far too often these days, a bad process produces bad policy. And this farm bill is a bad policy, plain and simple. It is not thought out. It is a bunch of unfunded mandates. It is a disaster. It is bad for the millions of working families, children, older adults, and other vulnerable Americans who will be kicked off of SNAP or see their benefits reduced. It is bad for farmers and ranchers, who are already suffering from low prices, low overhead, and market uncertainty, not to mention a new trade war, courtesy of Donald Trump. It is bad for State and local governments, who will have massive unpaidfor costs despite having no input whatsoever on the drafting of this bill. So let’s send it back to the drawing table so we can sit down in a bipartisan way, in the bipartisan tradition of the Agriculture Committee, and come up with smart, compassionate, forward thinking legislation instead of this. So I ask my colleagues to join with us in a bipartisan way against considering this rule, which ignores the costs this bill imposes on State and local governments, in violation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. If you believe unfunded mandates are wrong, then you shouldn’t support this rule. I mean, where are my conservative friends? Where is the Freedom Caucus, who rail about unfunded mandates? Where are you? I mean, I hope you are going to stand up and have the courage of your convictions and vote with us on this and send this bill back to committee, where we ought to do a farm bill in a bipartisan and a thoughtful way. This process has been lousy from the beginning, and now we have a bill that has all kinds of protections, because there are all kinds of unfunded mandates on our States. Wait till your governors begin to read the fine print in this farm bill, wait till your local agencies read the fine print in this farm bill. So if you are for unfunded mandates, then vote against what I am suggesting here today. But if you want to put an end to these unfunded mandates, then you need to take a stand. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the point of order and in favor of consideration of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 10 minutes. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I don’t claim to know as much about the farm bill as my friend from Massachusetts does. He has the privilege of representing his constituents both on the Rules Committee and on the Ag Committee. I represent my constituents on the Rules Committee and on the Budget Committee. I work with CBO day in and day out, as my colleague knows. CBO is absolutely charged with being the nonpartisan scorekeeper in all of these budgetary matters. But as the gentleman recalls, having worked for a former member of the Rules Committee himself, when Republicans passed and President Clinton signed the unfunded mandates point of order, it was designed with one goal and one goal only in mind, and that was to make sure that when Congress acts, it considers the impacts of folks back home. It considers whether or not it is shirking a responsibility in Washington and shifting that responsibility to State and local governments back home. I will tell you with certainty, Mr. Speaker, that not a single Member on this side of the aisle has wavered in that commitment from when this bill passed in 1995 until today. What my friend from Massachusetts references are programs that are implemented by the States in order to receive a Federal benefit. We see this happen all the time, day in and day out. You get all the transportation money that you want, but you need to alter your speed limit if you want to receive that transportation money. You can get all the transportation money you want, but you need to deal with your drinking age if you want to get that money. What we are talking about today at its core, Mr. Speaker, is whether or not, at a time when we have the lowest unemployment rate in my lifetime, at a time when we have more jobs available to be filled in America than ever before in American history, whether it is a burden to say if you want to receive a Federal benefit, that being food stamps, that you should try to find a job first. If you can’t find that job, we should get you enrolled in a job training program so that you can find the job. At the end of the day, the farm bill aims to do two things with the SNAP program: number one, is continue to provide a safety net for families in need. But number two, to make sure it remains that net and tries to lift folks 
out of poverty instead of trap them in poverty for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, this unfunded mandates point of order, I was in Congress at the time that it passed, has been a speed bump, a needed speed bump in the consideration of legislation time and time again. Now, sadly, more often than not, we see it as a dilatory tactic on the House floor. We see it raised as something just to try to slow down the process and gum up the works. That is not what is happening here today. I want to stipulate that that is true. My friend from Massachusetts raises a legitimate concern, but what I would say to my colleagues is this is a task, an obligation that has been placed on the States in consideration of receiving a Federal benefit. Folks are not mandated to do anything at all, but if we are to participate in the program, if folks are to continue to work through the program, if we are to get people back to work, if we are to provide this safety net, if we are to succeed on behalf of our constituents, as we all want to do, then we are going to have a partnership between the Federal Government and the State governments to make that happen. b1245 Again, I respect my friend from Massachusetts, Mr. Speaker. He is an authority on the farm bill and an authority on the SNAP program. But as far as the unfunded mandates point of order goes, I would encourage my colleagues to reject that request today and to vote in favor of proceeding with consideration of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my colleague and anybody else to do something radical: actually read the CBO study. Basically, what it says here is that the bill would impose intergovernmental mandates by amending SNAP eligibility requirements, placing new responsibilities on States as administrators of child support enforcement, and requiring new State activities in the SNAP program. For large entitlement programs like SNAP and child support enforcement, UMRA defines an increase in the stringency of conditions on States and localities as an intergovernmental mandate if affected governments lack authority to offset those costs while continuing to provide required services. The bill’s requirements would increase the workload of State agencies in areas where they have limited flexibility to amend their responsibilities and offset additional costs and, thus, would be intergovernmental mandates. In other words, on a whole range of issues, this bill requires States to do so much more, and the Federal Government does not provide the funding to meet those obligations. So if States want to provide SNAP benefits to their citizens, which I think every State continues to want to do, they are going to have to embrace all these unfunded mandates, add all these additional costs on to what they are already paying. These are big, fat unfunded mandates. And I want to tell you, when your Governors read this bill, when you read this bill, you are going to be amazed about all these additional burdens that are going to be imposed on States and localities. If this isn’t an unfunded mandate, if this wasn’t what that Republican initiative was all about when it was first implemented, I have no idea what it is. But I will tell you, even on the work training programs, this bill would provide maybe about $30 per person for education and training. We are told that education and training programs, on average, range from $7,000 to $14,000 to be effective. So this is an unfunded mandate, plain and simple. If you care about unfunded mandates, you are going to support us in our initiative here today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, again, I recognize my friend’s passion. I tell you, this is not going to be the end of my friend’s passion. We are going to be here for another hour, together, talking about the farm bill, and I suspect we will see even a new degree of passion because my friend from Massachusetts is incredibly committed to his point of view on the SNAP program. What I would tell you, Mr. Speaker— and I will speak on behalf of my Governor from the great State of Georgia; I will speak on behalf of my legislators and my administrators in the great State of Georgia—folks want to be a part of lifting people out of poverty. Nobody wants to be a part of trapping people in a cycle of poverty, and there is absolutely, Mr. Speaker, a degree of complicity that this Chamber has often been involved in by saying: This is the best we can do. We can’t do any better, and we are just going to resign ourselves to the fact that generational poverty will continue. I say nonsense, and this bill is a step in the right direction. I share my friend’s frustration that what should have been a bipartisan farm bill, what traditionally is a bipartisan farm bill, went off the rails somewhere in the process and folks walked away from the table. We can assign blame however we choose to do it; but in this case, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a bill that is going to take a major step forward in lifting folks out of poverty, a major step forward in putting people back to work, a major step forward in making sure that folks who receive Federal benefits are those who need Federal benefits, but those who have opportunities to do more and to do better for their families have partners in both their Federal and State governments to make that happen. I think that is what all my colleagues here want. I encourage my friends to reject my friend’s point of order and to vote to consider this bill today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. The question is, Will the House now consider the resolution? The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 223, nays 181, not voting 23, as follows:

b1316 Ms. KAPTUR, Mrs. NAPOLITANO, and Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas changed their vote from ‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’ So the question of consideration was decided in the affirmative. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CRAWFORD ). The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ) is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), an Ag Committee member and my fellow Rules Committee member, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. I thank my colleagues for standing with me to consider this rule and then these three underlying measures today. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today, House Resolution 891, makes in order three pieces of legislation. The one that you heard discussed already today is H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. Two other measures included in this rule are H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act of 2018, and S. 2372, the VA MISSION Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, as you know, this week is Police Week, and police officers serving our communities every day with distinction get this 1 week a year that we all take a moment to pause and say thank you. President Trump made that point yesterday just outside the Capitol talking about these heroes who put their life on the line absolutely every day. To quote the President, he said: ‘‘Your moms and dads were among the bravest Americans to ever live’’ when he was talking to the children of fallen officers. Of course, he was absolutely right. For that reason I am particularly pleased that the rule today brings up the Protect and Serve Act of 2018. It brings it to the floor under a structured amendment process. The bill makes it a Federal crime to intentionally cause or to attempt to cause serious bodily harm to any law enforcement officer. I say that again, Mr. Speaker. It makes it a Federal crime to attempt to cause or intentionally cause serious bodily harm to any law enforcement officer. Mr. Speaker, we are trying to speak in the absolute strongest terms when we speak on behalf of our men and women in law enforcement uniforms. In fact, just last night in the Rules Committee, my friend, Mr. MCGOVERN  from Massachusetts, said there is virtually no disagreement between the parties and the Chambers on this legislation. Another bill we can agree on, Mr. Speaker, is the VA MISSION Act. In fact, I was with one of The American Legion chapters in our district just Monday talking about the very provisions in this bill and how they can make a substantive difference for our men and women who have served us in the Armed Forces. This is a four corners agreement bill, Mr. Speaker, and by four corners, I mean the chairmen and the ranking members on the House side and on the Senate side have agreed on this legislation. They have worked together on this legislation, and they have put it together in a way that we can all be proudly supportive of that final product. Let me tell you what this bill will do in specifics, Mr. Speaker. It consolidates seven duplicative community care programs into one program that is easier for our veterans to understand and to access. It ensures that the Veterans Choice Program has enough funding to continue working for our veterans for yet another year as the committees continue to perfect that program. I am sure you hear the same constructive counsel that I do, Mr. Speaker. Good for Congress for letting us opt out so that we can get the services we need quickly. But the Veterans Choice Program still has work to do to get those agreements approved promptly and get those doctors reimbursed promptly. The VA MISSION Act, Mr. Speaker, also creates a fair and transparent process for a comprehensive audit of the VA’s physical facilities. Where are those regions of the country that are underserved? Where are those regions of the country where consolidation would better serve? The VA can transform its aging infrastructure. This bill provides a comprehensive audit process so that we can modernize the VA for today’s veterans. It expands the caregiver program, Mr. Speaker, to provide the benefits to pre 9/11 veterans so that they are in parity with those benefits of post9/11 veterans, and it provides VA provider recruitment and retention efforts so that our veterans have access to those medical personnel that they desperately need. These reforms aren’t just supported by those four corners that I mentioned, the Republicans and Democrats who lead the Veterans’ Affairs Committee in the House and who lead the committees in the Senate, but they are also supported by over 30 veterans’ service organizations from across the country, Mr. Speaker, as Chairman ROEhighlighted in the Rules Committee just last night. I don’t pretend that these measures do everything for everyone, Mr. Speaker. They do not. But it is another in a long step of bills making progress on behalf of the American people. Whether we are talking about our men and women in law enforcement uniforms, Mr. Speaker, or whether we are talking about our men and women who have worn our military uniforms, it is another example of how Chairman ROE 
and Ranking Member W ALZ and our colleagues in the Senate are taking steps forward to repay our debts. Finally, Mr. Speaker, as we have already heard discussed, this rule would make in order H.R. 2, our Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. It doesn’t just make in order the base text, Mr. Speaker, it also makes in order 20 amendments that have been offered by both Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber who would like to try to make that bill even better. Twenty amendments have been made in order already, and when we finish debate here on the floor, my colleague from Massachusetts and I will return to the Rules Committee upstairs, and we will consider yet another round of amendments this afternoon so that we can continue to perfect this bill throughout the week. Mr. Speaker, one rule, three bills— three bills that have the ability to make a difference for families across the country north, south, east, and west. I hope my colleagues will support this rule, get involved in that underlying debate, and support those bills on final passage as well. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ) for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia just said one rule three bills, which has become kind of a habit around here where we try to bunch a whole bunch of bills together in one rule so we don’t actually focus on any one issue in a way that is meaningful. It is, I think, an attempt to try to stifle debate. We have a bill that would protect our police. We have a bill that would deal with veterans. And then we have the farm bill. Mr. Speaker, I want to focus on the farm bill, if I may. I have served on the Agriculture Committee since 2011. Historically, it has been one of the most—if not the most—bipartisan committee in the House of Representatives. That is how farm bills are normally crafted, through compromise and through a coalition of Members from urban and rural America coming together to get something done. That is why I have always had faith in this process—faith that minority views would be heard. Even when it wasn’t easy and even when the final product wasn’t perfect, the end product was traditionally bipartisan. Until today. The process for this farm bill was a sham. In no way did it reflect the Agriculture Committee’s long, bipartisan tradition. I am the ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee, and even I wasn’t able to see a word of text until this bill was publicly released. I am not even sure when Republicans on the subcommittee first saw the language. Over the last 21⁄2years, the Agriculture Committee held 23 hearings on SNAP. Apparently, they were just for show, because not a single witness— Democrat or Republican—recommended any of the drastic cuts or draconian policy changes to SNAP included in this Republican farm bill. When our distinguished ranking member on the committee, Mr. PETER SON, was finally asked for Democratic feedback on the nutrition title, he gave a long, thoughtful list of objections and suggested changes. His input was ignored with the majority changing barely a handful of words in this whole bill. The Republican farm bill is filled with controversial provisions, and no one will tell us how they even got into the bill. Believe me, Mr. Speaker, I have asked. I can’t get an answer. Maybe President Trump’s ethically challenged White House opened its doors even wider to lobbyists and let them write key parts of this bill. Or perhaps an archconservative think tank was given the chance to airdrop its wish list into the bill. But I suspect something more mundane and damaging. I think the Speaker viewed this bill as his last chance to enact sweeping cuts to safety net programs before he retires. Even the number of this bill, H.R. 2, was always reserved by the Speaker for his socalled welfare reform bill. So I warn my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: make no mistake. This legislation is a transformation of our social safety net dressed up as a farm bill. It beats up, belittles, and demonizes poor people all across this country. It doesn’t even try to put lipstick on this pig. Mr. Speaker, last week it was reported that the Republican Conference brought in communicator Frank Luntz to try to wordsmith how Republicans can justify supporting this bill. They must be terrified. They know that just explaining the reality would appall and enrage most Americans. Now, Mr. Luntz is the same guy who helped craft Speaker Gingrich’s Contract with America. He earned PolitiFact’s lie of the year in 2010 for one of his debunked claims on healthcare reform and even tried once in an interview to turn the term Orwellian into something positive. Mr. Speaker, he has his work cut out for him here because I don’t even think Mr. Luntz can wordsmith something so cruel into something positive. Now, here is how mean this bill really is. SNAP is our Nation’s premier antihunger program, our first line of defense against hunger. People, including the most vulnerable among us— kids, the disabled, and the elderly— turn to it when there is no other option. For them, there is no plan B when they are struggling to figure out where their next meal is coming from. With this bill, Republicans are cutting SNAP by over $20 billion. Millions of people would see their benefits slashed, and many would be cut off from assistance entirely. b1330 Why are the Republicans doing this? To pay for hoisting their latest unproven and way underfunded State based workforce bureaucracy experiment on the entire Nation. That is why. I say ‘‘unproven’’ because I don’t see any evidence or studies suggesting that any of this will even work. In fact, I have a study here that points out the flaws in this proposal. It expands work requirements for poor parents while making millionaires and billionaires eligible for subsidies even if they don’t live or work on a farm. You can’t make this stuff up. There is no evidence that this approach is effective. We have no idea whether States have the manpower or infrastructure to take this on. We have no idea how much it will cost States to put a recipient through a job training program. This bill would give States just $30 to train each person, when we know it costs thousands of dollars per person to fund robust job training programs. Mr. Speaker, it would be laughable if this weren’t so serious. Currently, States are testing the effectiveness of job training programs as a way to help SNAP recipients move out of poverty. But we aren’t expecting to get the results of these pilot programs until 2021. Shouldn’t we wait to see the results of State pilot programs? Shouldn’t we wait until we know what might work and what doesn’t? Why should we force our Governors and States to gamble on a sweeping, untested bureaucracy that appears doomed to failure? Clearly, the Republicans aren’t going to let a lack of facts stop them from creating this massive, new government bureaucracy that will affect millions of vulnerable Americans. This is from a party that claims to want a government so small, they could drown it in a bathtub. Apparently, they want a government just small enough to leave millions of poor and working Americans with nowhere to turn. This isn’t about helping people; this is about putting up roadblocks that make nutrition assistance difficult, if not impossible, to get. This legislation also severs the link between SNAP and the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. This connection is what has allowed disabled and working families to receive credit for outofpocket heating and cooling expenses without unnecessary trips to the SNAP office. But the changes in this bill would force recipients to make those unnecessary trips, and they would lead to more hassles and avoidable errors and people falling through the cracks. 
I think the Republican leaders in the House are the only people on this planet who believe that creating unnecessary hassles count as some kind of laudable reform. The Republican farm bill would also eliminate broadbased categorical eligibility. This has been a critical option that States have used to help working families with kids and seniors during tough times. More than 40 States today use this option, including 12 States with Republican Governors. Eliminating it would cause 400,000 eligible households—close to 1 million people— to lose their food benefits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 265,000 students will lose access to free school lunches if this bill were to become law. You know, when I was growing up, it was school bullies that went after kids’ lunch money; it wasn’t the United States Congress. This is shameful. But let’s also be clear here that eliminating broadbased categorical eligibility would throw close to 1 million people off of SNAP who work. Basically, it would deny SNAP benefits to people who earn under $16,000 a year. Mr. Speaker, what the hell is wrong with this place? These people can’t get through the year on that. That is not enough to feed one’s self or one’s family. The Republican Congress, who rushed to raise taxes on 86 million middle class families to pay for a tax cut for large corporations and the richest 1 percent, is now trying to stop kids from getting school lunches and taking assistance away from families struggling with hunger. This entire Congress has been one long, slow march toward making life harder for the poor, the hungry, and working Americans. I am tired of a Congress that prioritizes the rich, that looks out only for the wealthy. The legislation we take up here today should reflect our values. But this bill doesn’t reflect my values, Mr. Speaker. This is a farm bill that doesn’t even make significant improvements to our agricultural programs to help farmers who are caught in the middle of the President’s trade war. It is an attack on those living in poverty. It trades in stereotypes to justify shredding our social safety net, and it is hellbent on making hunger worse in this country. This Republican farm bill is disgusting, and the process that got us here is disgusting. By the way, just so Members are clear, the average SNAP benefit is $1.40 per person per meal. I say to my colleagues, you try living on that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say I agree with my friend. Asking single, workingage, healthy, nondisabled men to go to work is going to make their life harder. Going to work every day is hard. But I would also say to my friend that it is going to make their life better. It is a value that we should share, not a value that we should repudiate. This happens to be an area of disagreement, Mr. Speaker. There are so many areas of agreement we could be focusing on. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the good work that was done there and the VA MISSION Act, which improves access to care for our veterans, funds the Choice Program, and expands the caregivers program for pre9/11 veterans. I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for their work on this important legislation. I would particularly like to applaud the inclusion of the VA Medical Scribes Pilot Act. This was legislation that I helped write with Chairman ROEto set up a pilot program for including scribes in primary care teams at the VA. Research in the private sector has shown that allowing scribes to handle electronic health records allows the healthcare providers, the doctors, to do more of what they do best, which is to treat the patients. So we have doctors treating patients rather than spending their valuable time doing paperwork. Chairman ROEjoined me in my district last fall on a tour of the VA clinic in White City, Oregon, where we heard firsthand about the administrative challenges the VA doctors face and how that affects their ability to care for veterans. The underlying bill that we will bring to the floor will help. The entire bill will help. This will help our docs have more time to spend with their patients. We will continue to work with the VA on their implementation of this program, but I am pleased that it was included in the underlying legislation, Mr. Speaker. Once again, I applaud the entire Veterans Affairs Committee on their work to give veterans the access to healthcare they have earned and deserve. I urge support and passage of the underlying VA MISSION Act and approval of the rule. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Under this bill, somebody who is working and earns like $15,800 a year up to like $23,000 a year, who works right now, and who currently receives SNAP would lose it under this. This is how you are rewarding their work. I just find that appalling. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEI DER). Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the cruel and partisan safety net cuts masquerading as the farm bill. The farm bill has long been a partisan cause, offering assistance and security to farmers and needy families alike in a way that both Democrats and Republicans can support. But this extreme bill cuts more than $23 billion from nutrition assistance programs through eligibility restrictions, kicking a projected 1 million households off the SNAP program and reducing benefits for millions more. Let me be clear: these are vital, lifesaving benefits to help Americans put food on the table during moments of need. The average family spends just 10 months on SNAP, receiving assistance just long enough to get back on their feet. At the same time, the program helps set our kids up for success. Hungry children perform worse in school, and studies have shown that children on SNAP achieve higher test scores and are more likely to graduate from high school. Children on SNAP achieve higher test scores and succeed, and they have the opportunity to do well later in life. Mr. Speaker, the partisan approach was the wrong way on tax reform, it was the wrong way on healthcare, and it is the wrong way now. I urge my Republican colleagues to abandon this partyline legislation and instead approach the farm bill in the fair, bipartisan manner we have in the past. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I agree with my friend. I think, as a general rule, partisan approaches are the wrong way. This is certainly not what my chairman desired. It is certainly not where any of us wanted to end up. When folks walk away from the table, it is where we do in fact end up. This is the start of the process. This is not the end of the process. I regret the way that this has sorted out for my ag friends. But we can’t do nothing because folks have gotten up and walked away from the table. We have to continue to do what our constituents have asked us to do, and this is a good step in that direction. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to draw attention to provisions of this bill which attack bedrock environmental laws and recklessly promote logging over clean water, recreation, and wildlife. In a district like mine, where the holdings of the U.S. Forest Service are extensive, this bill is a critical part of helping to protect our economy, our way of life, and the way we enjoy our public lands. Title 8 of the bill includes blatant attempts that undermine the Endangered Species Act, NEPA, and the roadless area conservation rule. This bill allows for congressional exemptions—basically, an earmark—to prevent environmental reviews and public comment periods that actually prevent communities from having a say over what happens quite literally in their backyard. I think that we need to make sure that we involve our local communities. This bill empowers Washington, 
D.C., decisionmakers by taking that control away from our communities. It weakens the Endangered Species Act by eliminating scientific expert opinion about whether projects would harm endangered species and their critical habitats, and it prioritizes logging over recreation, even going so far as shifting incentives to emphasize logging over environmental restoration in other areas that support the outdoor recreation economy, one of the biggest sources of jobs in my district and in my State. Before the ink is even dry on the omnibus, this farm bill threatens to renege on the bipartisan wildfire budget deal with more proposals that weaken protections and mitigation on our public lands. In my State, the 6,000acre congressional exemption or earmark would have a detrimental impact, but it would have an even worse impact on the much smaller Eastern and Midwestern forests, where 6,000 acres would vastly exceed the annual sustainable maximum harvest. When the Forest Service needs to do a 6,000acre project, it already can. It needs to take input from the public nearby in our neighborhoods and in our communities about how they would be affected. Of course, it should consider how water, soil, and wildlife habitat can be protected. For years, congressional debate over forest management has been framed by the need to address hazardous fuels for wildfires. This bill takes a step away from that and makes it clear that reform efforts weren’t actually about wildfire; they are about efforts to give away our public lands to timber and other industries and silence the voice of residents. Congress should stop trying to legislate logging projects and take control. Washington should allow our communities to have a say. The Forest Service has many tools today that include local input. All Americans deserve is a say in how our public lands are managed. Endangered species should certainly not be sacrificed just so more of our forests can be logged. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from over 120 conservation groups opposed to these harmful forestry provisions in H.R. 2, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
MAY11, 2018. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of our millions of members and supporters we urge you to strongly oppose the extreme and divisively partisan federal forest provisions in the Forestry Title of the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2), also known as ‘‘the House Farm Bill.’’ The legislation is replete with provisions that undermine bedrock environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Endangered Species Act (ESA), and Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule). This bill consistently prioritizes the logging industry over all other forest stakeholders. It would cause irreparable harm to our federal forests, the millions of Americans who depend on them for clean drinking water, subsistence, recreation, and economic benefit, and the wildlife that call them home. The federal forest provisions in the House Farm Bill also run contrary to the wildfire funding agreement reached only weeks ago in the Fiscal Year 2018 Omnibus. A deal was only reached after significant environmental concessions to prologging hardliners, even though a comprehensive wildfire funding solution had solid bipartisan support in both chambers going into the omnibus negotiation. Ignoring that compromise, H.R. 2 would allow logging, grazing, and many other activities on up to 6,000acres—almost 10 square miles for each single project—without any NEPA review or disclosure of potential harms. The numerous new exemptions are double the size of the legislated NEPA exclusion just passed in the omnibus deal and they also eliminate the requirement, preserved in the omnibus agreement, to consider cumulative effects and ‘‘extraordinary circumstances’’ such as wilderness areas and endangered species. This partisan bill also goes further than the omnibus deal on the ESA, allowing federal land management agencies to ‘‘selfconsult’’ on whether their actions would harm threatened and endangered species even though such selfconsultation has already been declared unlawful by the courts. Additionally, it attacks the landmark Roadless Rule, makes resource management and forest stewardship dependent on logging revenue, creating a perverse incentive, and jeopardizes firevulnerable communities by deprioritizing hazardous fuels reduction efforts in the Wildland Urban Interface. The harmful federal forest proposals in this legislation solve no problem; they only add controversy to the House Farm Bill and weaken its chances of becoming law. For all of these reasons we strongly urge you to OPPOSE the federal forest provisions in the House Farm Bill and any amendments that further undermine environmental safeguards on our federal forests.

Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the farm economy is the biggest contributor to Georgia GDP. Georgia families wake up every day back home and go out and often, in some cases, are working land that their father worked before them and their grandfather worked before them. We have had the Georgia Farm Bureau in town pleading with us to bring some certainty to ag policy. There are two parts to a farm bill, for all the reasons that folks who got here long before I did can explain: why it is we do a food stamp half of a farm bill and an actual farmer half of the farm bill. It is so often true that the SNAP program gets all the conversation, Mr. Speaker. But as you heard from my friend from Colorado, while the money is not where the farmers and those farm families are, that is certainly where the policy is. It has been true time and time again that, in a collaborative, bipartisan, bicameral way, we have come together as a House and a Senate and moved policy forward to provide market certainty for those farmers. You don’t always appreciate the farmers in your community, Mr. Speaker, when you can go to the grocery store and grab anything you want 
at absolutely any time you want. Those things don’t happen by accident. They happen with a whole lot of sweat equity, a whole lot of risktaking, and, candidly, with a whole lot of prayer going on across farm communities in this land. b1345 This bill responds to some of the marketplace needs that we are finding in the 21st century. You are going to see those collaborative veins throughout this measure, Mr. Speaker. I hope my colleagues will look not just at the SNAP program, but also at the certainty that we will provide to the very hardworking farm families across this country. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia for his comments. I think, again, if the gentleman reads this bill, he and his farmers should be concerned about this bill because it does not increase support for our farm safety net and support prices. So we have a lot of farmers who are deeply concerned about that part of the bill as well. Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge that we defeat the previous question. If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative LAMB’s legislation, H.R. 5805, which provides the fix needed to implement the VA MISSION Act to ensure that it is not hindered by budget caps. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss that proposal, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB). Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, the VA MISSION Act is a good bill. I support it. For too long, our veterans could really question whether this government means it when we say that we value their service. We cannot erase those doubts in one day or in one bill, but we can take a positive step forward, and we are doing that today. Both parties are doing that together. Together, we are finally giving all caregivers the tools they need for the heroic work that they do. We are strengthening VA at its core by attracting the best and the brightest to work there, and we are giving veterans a real choice to seek the best treatment anywhere, whether in or outside of the VA. This is a good bill, but it is not perfect. We owe it to our veterans and to the taxpayers to explain how we will pay for this. There is a strict cap on VA’s budget, and the MISSION Act will bust that cap, so all of the good things in the MISSION Act will trigger harsh, automatic cuts in the rest of VA’s budget. This will force the VA to rob Peter to pay Paul. This is not hypothetical. One year from now, these cuts will be triggered, and a veteran today would be right to ask if his favorite nurse will be laid off or if the old and slow computer systems at the VA will get even older and even slower. The money has to come from somewhere in the VA’s budget. But there is another way. The money we are spending today does not have to count against the budget cap. That budget cap was set before we ever made these improvements to the VA. It is a separate issue, and the cap number shouldn’t hold us back. My bill, H.R. 5805, would simply count the new money as separate so that it does not bust the rest of the VA’s budget. Mr. Speaker, both sides of this House are working together to improve the VA. That is a great thing. Let’s not make it any harder than it already is. Instead, let’s finish the job. We have to spend what it takes to get the job done. No more, but also no less. Our veterans are looking to us to make the VA stronger, not weaker. The workers of the VA are depending upon us to give them what they need for their mission. Automatic budget cuts will not accomplish that mission. I ask my colleagues on both sides to help us, help our veterans, and help our workers. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the motion on ordering the previous question so that my bill, H.R. 5805, can be made in order. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is my first time on the floor with our new colleague from Pennsylvania. I appreciate not just his service here, but his service to our country in general. I feel his pain. It is a good bill, but it is not a perfect bill, and we have got ways to do it. I have been here 7 years. I come down here time and time again to find good bills, Mr. Speaker, and I am always frustrated that we can’t get it there. What I have determined, Mr. Speaker, that I will share with you and with my friend from Pennsylvania is that the reason is because you folks don’t agree with me. That is what I have decided is why I can’t get to those perfect bills, because try as I might, I cannot get 434 other people to agree with me on everything all the time. I will tell my friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. Speaker, the most discouraging day I have had in this institution was after we passed the Budget Control Act and we picked four of our finest Republicans and four of our finest Democrats from the House and also four from the Senate—Republicans, Democrats—and we locked them in a room together for 3 months. We said: Look at some of these mandatory spending programs like you have talked about. Look at the discretionary programs. Acrosstheboard budget cuts are nonsensical. They don’t reflect American priorities at all. So get together, talk to one another, work through it, and figure out a way that we can make the books balance so we don’t mortgage our children’s and our grandchildren’s futures but so that we also keep the commitments that we have made to families today. They met for 3 months, and they walked out of that room having looked at hundreds of trillions of dollars in Federal spending and agreed on not one penny of change together. I cannot tell you, Mr. Speaker—well, you remember how discouraging that day was. Moving these dollars from mandatory spending to discretionary spending is absolutely going to put additional pressures on the budget process—I see my friend from Minnesota nodding his head; he is a true champion for our veterans—but, by golly, we have got to stand up and say yes to those dollars. I got excoriated back home for voting in favor of raising the nondefense discretionary limits, but I have to go home and tell the story of how I am meeting promises to veterans that were not going to get met otherwise. I have got to go home and tell the story about how I am meeting promises for children that weren’t going to get met otherwise. And I have got to go home and tell the story of how I don’t have 218 votes to do it my way, and the only way to get anything done around here is in partnership. Candidly, Mr. Speaker, we don’t have a better example than the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Mr. WALZ’ leadership, Dr. ROE’s leadership. Time and time again, I see these two men go and not follow their own hearts and passions but try to do what is best for everyone, try to find a way forward when folks had bet against them and said you couldn’t find a way forward. I hear the concerns of my new colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. Speaker, and I believe he is absolutely right; we are going to run up against that conversation next year. The question is will we have the courage to stand up together and fund those priorities next year. I am looking forward to the great outpouring of bipartisanship we are going to see in support of the VA MISSION Act today, and I will look forward to the great outpouring of support when the funding time comes to make sure we are as committed to those promises tomorrow as we are together this afternoon. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ), the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts and my friend from Georgia. We are going to see some camaraderie down here. I agree with the gentleman on this. And I thank Mr. LAMB for pointing out 
clearly what needs to be done to this bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule. This is one of those cases, and I think this is important on the rule, because, Mr. Speaker, we may know it in here, but for Americans who are watching this, the rule is how we have this debate. And this is an honest debate. To be absolutely clear, there is no one in this Chamber who disagrees on the care for veterans. How we get there is what is different. On these amendments that Mr. LAMB was proposing to offer or other things that we would like to bring up to fix this, we should debate it here. Dr. ROE, the chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, did this. He had an open rule. I brought up my amendment, it was debated, and I lost. That is democracy. I understand that. But it is the conversation that brings our Members in that gets us to consensus. So, by structuring a closed rule—for the American people watching this, we already know what the score is of this game. We already know what is going to happen ahead of time. It is in this deliberative body that we should be having a detailed debate on this very proposal and then voting it down. I think we say it because of time; we say it because of constraint; we say it because we want to control the flow of what happens here. Well, maybe the American people don’t want that flow a little bit. We should have this debate, and I will accept losing an argument. What I cannot accept is five people up in a room up on the third floor here making something out of order that is clearly in order, and whether it is accepted or not should at least be debated. So I don’t disagree with the gentleman’s assessment. He is right about us trying to find common ground. There is going to be a lot of support on this piece of legislation when it comes up, but I think not having an open rule and an honest debate is selling us short from getting toward a more perfect bill—not perfect, a more perfect bill. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this closed rule. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I do not have any further speakers remaining, so I am prepared to close when the gentleman from Massachusetts is, but I will reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we aren’t done, so if the gentleman would like to yield me some time, that would be great. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying Republican farm bill, which could devastate working families, seniors, and the vulnerable who rely on food assistance. Currently, more than 41 million Americans receive benefits through the Federal food assistance program known as SNAP. Close to twothirds are children, the elderly, and the disabled. However, this partisan bill would reduce SNAP benefits by $23.3 billion, denying hundreds of thousands of American families who rely on this food support. Millions more will see their benefits reduced because Republicans are recklessly increasing the burden on recipients and changing eligibility requirements. In December, Republicans passed a tax bill benefiting the wealthiest Americans and the most powerful corporate special interests. This Republican tax scam increases our national debt by $2 trillion over the next 10 years, and now our Republican colleagues are hypocritically trying to pay for these huge tax cuts for the wealthy by taking away resources for Americans who need them most. Republicans are using this formerly bipartisan process to continue to undermine the wellbeing of children, the elderly, and the disabled to give gifts to the wealthy. This goes against everything we stand for as a country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and to oppose the bill. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, this farm bill is outrageous. What it is doing is breaking what has been traditionally a bipartisan commitment to including a nutrition title that helps people in all of our districts who need the food. This bill has had no process. It is a continuation of an effort to ratchet down any help that Americans need. That healthcare bill was going to help on healthcare by taking it away from 24 million people. This nutrition bill, supposedly, is going to help people by taking $23 billion worth of benefits away from children, veterans, the elderly, and the disabled who need that food. Why? Well, there is a reason. We passed a tax cut. By the way, it wasn’t paid for. $2.3 trillion added to the deficit for a tax bill where 87 percent of the benefits go to wealthy multinational corporations and individuals earning over $890,000 a year. Well, the bill has come due, and we have a proposal here to come up with $23 billion to pay for it, and that is taking meals off the table of disabled people. And, by the way, the work requirement, what is it really? Because that sounds good. By the way, who doesn’t want to work? Everybody wants to work. You need a job. We are going to pay for this socalled work requirement by taking money away from nutrition, paying bureaucrats, and giving them the impossible job of putting people who are not able to work into jobs that don’t exist. Talk about cynical; that is what this bill is. I am from Vermont where we have lots of folks who need help, and we have lots of Vermonters who, with very little money, with enormous volunteer effort, are doing things that put meals, good meals, on the tables of those families. Don’t pass this farm bill that takes that nutrition away from our Vermonters and our American citizens. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Minnesota mentioned folks who might be watching this debate from their offices or from their homes. I think it is a shame that we don’t often get to the core of what some of our disagreements are. As we sit here today, it is a fact that there are more job openings in America than at any other time in American history. That is a fact. It is a fact that, as we sit here getting ready to move further into the new millennium, there are more able bodied single men out of the workforce than ever before—that is a fact—folks who have decided not to work. Now, there is no disagreement in this body about providing food assistance to hungry kids—none. None. The disagreement in this body is whether or not, with more job openings than ever before in American history, with more employers saying they cannot find workers, with more employers saying ‘‘we need to find new visa programs to get unskilled labor into America because we don’t have enough unskilled workers to do the work here in America’’—should the working families who pay the bills in this country support ablebodied, childless, healthy men? b1400 That is part of the question, and I would think that is something on which we can agree. But we are not going to have that pointed conversation, Mr. Speaker, because there are more sympathetic targets to go after. If you walk in to a USDA facility or your State facility that is administrating and you apply for food stamps, Mr. Speaker, if you qualify for food stamps, you will get them. You heard my friend from Massachusetts reference categorical eligibility. That means if you qualify for a different benefit, not food stamps, we will throw in food stamps, too. Well, now, to be fair, that idea came about in some conservative circles, as well, to say let’s eliminate some of the paperwork requirements. Let’s make it easier for folks to apply for a whole host of benefits. But categorical eligibility, as it exists today, Mr. Speaker, says you don’t qualify for the benefit on your own, but you do if you—if you qualify for a second benefit, we will give you this one as well. Mr. Speaker, saying that you are going to eliminate categorical eligibility is to say you are going to give food stamps to people who qualify for food stamps. You are going to give 
SNAP benefits to people who qualify for SNAP benefits. If one wants to expand the pool of people who qualify for SNAP benefits, that is a debate that we can have. But time and time again, Mr. Speaker, there are things on which we agree in this Chamber. Programs should follow the rules that programs have. People who qualify should get benefits. People who don’t qualify shouldn’t. We are going to continue to have this conversation in the next couple of days, and it is going to continue to be highlighted as a source of vast disagreement among us. But if we were having this same conversation back home around the dinner table, if we were having this same conversation back home at a local park or veterans organization, we would say the very same thing: Hungry kids should have access to food, on this we agree; and healthy, childless working age men should have access to a job, on this we agree. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my colleague to read the bill. Broadbased categorical eligibility gives States the flexibility to offer people who are struggling—more people, the SNAP benefit. There are many States, including mine, that basically offer SNAP to people who are at 200 percent of the poverty level. That is about $24,000. This bill changes the criteria. So you could be working and making anywhere from $24,000 to like $15,900, and, right now, you are working and that is what you make and you are eligible for SNAP. This bill says you no longer can get that benefit. These are people who work, and this bill takes this nutrition benefit away from them. I don’t know how anybody could think that that is a good thing to do. I don’t know how that reward works. What that does is punish people. That punishes individuals who are doing everything they possibly can to try to make ends meet. And a lot of people, by the way, who qualify for SNAP who aren’t working, qualify maybe for a month or two because they are out of work for only a month or two. This idea that SNAP creates this culture dependency is just a myth. The majority of people on SNAP work—who are ablebodied work. I want to make that point clear. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER ). Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill. I originally had some things written down on paper, but based on the last comments, I just want to echo the sentiments of my colleague and also share that I served as Secretary of Labor in the State of Delaware. I served as head of State personnel. Jobs are important to us. I had the opportunity to work on WIA, WIOA, all of those great pieces of legislation for workforce development. And I want to talk about some myths. There is a myth that the majority of people on SNAP aren’t working or won’t work in a year. That is a myth. Twothirds of SNAP recipients are children, seniors, and people with disabilities. People don’t realize that. And there are 6 million unfilled jobs. So, for me, the problem with this bill, the biggest problem is that it was a missed opportunity. If we are truly serious about employing people who are returning from prison, people who maybe have a disability— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Delaware. Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, if we are truly serious, then we will come to the table. But when the table is set in stone, then we don’t get an opportunity to really work on those things that will support the American people. The other piece that was disappointing to me is, I came to this as a person who wanted to be on this committee because of its bipartisan nature and that the American people are waiting and watching to see us come together for them. This is a loss of confidence, and it is also a missed opportunity. I am excited and hopeful that we will come together because the people are watching. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter that I wrote to Secretary Perdue, because there were a lot of questions and assumptions that were never answered even in our markup. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, May 11, 2018. Hon. SONNY PERDUE , Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC. DEARSECRETARY PERDUE : I am writing to request that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) respond to my inquiries regarding H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, which is also known as the Farm Bill. As a member of the House Committee on Agriculture, I am one of 46 Members sitting on the committee of jurisdiction for this legislation. Given the breadth of the proposed changes in the Farm Bill, I want to take this opportunity to reach out to the agency that will be responsible for implementing the provisions in the bill. During the markup of the Farm Bill on April 18, 2018, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were only able to direct questions to Chairman Conaway. However, I believe it is essential that we hear from the experts involved in running these programs to ensure we are advocating for policies that are evidencebased. As a result, I respectfully ask that you address the following questions and provide a timely response. 
WORKFORCE PROGRAMS  My understanding is that we would need anywhere between three to five million more slots in workforce training programs across the country if all eligible SNAP participants would like to enroll in SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs. The bill would provide a new federal E&T grant of $1 billion per year to finance the newly mandated work program, which comes out to less than $30 per person per month. Upon what evidence and or best practices has this number been arrived at? Does the USDA believe this is sufficient? If not, what does the USDA think is sufficient to implement a meaningful workforce development program and move people into work? The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis says it would take a decade to set up a program for everyone to get a work slot. If state E&T costs are greater than their annual federal grant, will states bear the additional costs associated with operating the work programs? What breakdown does USDA expect in administration expenses between job training, IT, administrative costs, and other programs? What are the ramifications for states of not fully implementing their work programs? What additional capacity would USDA require to oversee this new work program? Would states experience increased administrative costs under this proposal? When specifically will we hear the results from the 2014 Farm Bill SNAP E&T Pilot Projects? Under current law, what are your expectations for sharing these findings and building them into USDA oversight of state E&T? If H.R. 2 were to be enacted as proposed, when will you be able to incorporate the findings from the pilot projects into the SNAP program, based on how this bill is written? I appreciate your timely consideration and the work you do for farmers, families, and communities across the country. Sincerely, LISABLUNT ROCHESTER , Committee Member, House Committee on Agriculture. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I agree very much with what my friend had to say. She may be a freshman, but she has got a lot of experience working in departments of labor putting people to work, and I think that is a goal that we all share. And, again, it is a missed opportunity. Undeniably, that is true, and there is lots of blame to go around about why it is a missed opportunity. Again, my friend from Massachusetts and I, we are going to go back up to the Rules Committee this afternoon. We are going to make some more amendments in order. We are going to work harder to try to perfect this bill. But walking away from the table has consequences. Setting lines in stone has consequences. We are not going to get the best work product in this Chamber when anybody walks away from the table. I am just going to stipulate that is true. We never ever will. But while my friend identified that the program benefits the elderly, the disabled, and children, and she is right, and it does, and I support that, she didn’t mention those ablebodied, healthy, childless men who also benefit from the program. And we do those men a disservice, not a service, when we make that benefit available in the absence of job searching. Categorical eligibility—we talk about it today like it is a word that we are hearing for the very first time. As my colleagues who were here remember, we have already been to the table 
on categorical eligibility. As my friend from Massachusetts referenced, States that have nothing to lose by giving away Federal money were gaming the system by giving away a dollar in State benefits so that folks could qualify for hundreds of dollars in Federal benefits. Well, we came together in a bipartisan way and said: Hey, that is not right. That is not right. Folks should have skin in the game. We should be working at this together. It shouldn’t be a giveaway program. It should be a helping program. We should be making a difference in people’s lives. We did that in a collaborative way. We can come back and tell the story differently today, but we remember coming together and doing that, and we can come together and do that again, Mr. Speaker. This isn’t going to be our last opportunity. We are going to have another opportunity. Nothing goes to the President’s desk unless we get 10 Democrats in the United States Senate to get on board and do it. Collaboration is not the exception. It is the rule to get things to the President’s desk and to pass new laws of the land. I wish we could talk more about what those successes are, how we found those successes in the past, and how we remain committed to finding those successes again in the future. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 4
1⁄2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Georgia has 10 minutes remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, who are very strongly opposed to this farm bill. 
CONSORTIUM FOR CITIZENS  WITHDISABILITIES , Washington, DC, May 7, 2018. Re H.R. 2, Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (Farm Bill). Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI , The undersigned members of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) urge you to continue the longstanding bipartisan commitment to protect and strengthen the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by rejecting proposals to restrict eligibility, reduce benefits, cap or reduce funding, or make harmful structural changes to SNAP in the Farm Bill. CCD is the largest coalition of national organizations working together to advocate for federal public policy that ensures the selfdetermination, independence, empowerment, integration and inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all aspects of society. In the United States, all too often food insecurity and disability go together. Families that include people with disabilities are two to three times more likely to experience food insecurity than families that have no members with disabilities. Similarly, people experiencing food insecurity have increased likelihood of chronic illness and disability. SNAP is vitally important for people with disabilities and their families. By increasing access to adequate, nutritious food SNAP plays a key role in reducing hunger and helping people with disabilities to maximize their health and participate in their communities. Using an inclusive definition of ‘‘disability,’’ in 2015 an estimated 11 million people with disabilities of all ages received SNAP, representing roughly one in four SNAP participants. Roughly 4.4 million households with non elderly adults with disabilities received SNAP in 2016. Nonelderly adults with disabilities who receive SNAP have very low incomes, averaging only about $12,000 per year in 2016. SNAP benefits are extremely modest, averaging $187 per month for nonelderly people with disabilities in 2016—or just $6 per day. Existing SNAP time limits are harsh, unfair, and harm many people with disabilities and their families by cutting off essential food assistance. Federal law currently limits SNAP eligibility for adults between the ages of 18 to 49 without dependents to just three months out of every three years—unless they can engage in work or job training activities at least half time, or qualify for an exemption. These provisions cut off food assistance at a time when people need it most and do not result in increased employment and earnings. At least 500,000 lowincome individuals nationwide lost SNAP in 2016 due to this time limit. Many people with disabilities are already hurt by SNAP time limits, despite existing exemptions for people who receive governmental or private benefits on the basis of a disability or are able to document that they are ‘‘physically or mentally unfit for employment.’’ For example, in a study of SNAP participants subject to time limits referred to participate in work activities in Franklin County, Ohio, onethird reported a ‘‘physical or mental limitation’’. Cutting off food assistance from SNAP would only make it harder for people to work and increase their economic selfsufficiency. We strongly oppose any action that would cut off or reduce SNAP benefits, narrow eligibility, or force more people to navigate harsh and unnecessary program rules, including people with disabilities and their families. In particular, we are concerned that the Farm Bill advanced by the House Committee on Agriculture on April 18, 2018 includes a number of provisions that would harm people with disabilities and their families. Small increases in the proposed bill are insufficient to make up for significant benefit reductions. New work requirements with highly punitive rules would cut off SNAP benefits for many people—including in families with children, adults, and seniors with disabilities. It may seem simple to assert that ‘‘people with disabilities will be exempt,’’ but converting such a statement into an effective policy process is complicated, expensive, and fundamentally flawed. Many people with disabilities receive SNAP, but do not meet SNAP’s statutory definitions of ‘‘disability’’ or have not been so identified. Under SNAP, states have no obligation to help people prove they are exempt, even if they have difficulty obtaining the necessary records or verification from a doctor. In addition, states are under no obligation to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the full array of services they might need to work—such as accessible transportation, supported employment, and personal care aide services. People with disabilities often want to work, but need additional supports and services to obtain and keep jobs, in addition to facing discrimination and misconceptions about their ability to work. Underfunded work programs would be woefully inadequate to meet training needs. Proposed new investments in SNAP employment and training programs—funded in large part by benefit cuts—amount to only about $30 per person per month. This amount would be grossly insufficient to provide adequate employment services for people subject to proposed new work requirements, including jobseekers with disabilities. New reporting requirements would create major hurdles to benefits. Proposed new reporting requirements related to eligibility, employment and training, and time limits would be extremely difficult for many people with disabilities to navigate and comply with. For example, ending a decadesold simplification measure and instead requiring people to share utility bills with the SNAP office—or else, see their benefits reduced—is harsh, unnecessary, and burdensome both for SNAP participants and states. If Congress wishes to explore meaningful opportunities for SNAP participants to increase selfsufficiency through employment, we recommend awaiting the results of the Employment & Training pilot projects authorized under the 2014 Farm Bill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded pilot grants in 2015, all 10 state programs are operational, and evaluation activities will operate through 2021. Already, a number of pilot states have cited multiple barriers faced by participants, including ‘‘health issues.’’ It will be important for USDA and the evaluators to carefully explore the experiences and outcomes of people with disabilities and their families in these pilot programs. Congress should await the final pilot evaluations before considering any changes in these areas. We call on you to reject proposals that would weaken SNAP’s effectiveness as our nation’s foremost antihunger program by limiting access, reducing benefits, or creating administrative hurdles. We urge all Members to vote no on the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 as approved by the Agriculture Committee on April 18, and instead to work on a bipartisan basis to strengthen and protect SNAP as part of the Farm Bill.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE ). Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against this terrible farm bill. Mr. Speaker, we were working together, Democrats and Republicans, to work on a farm bill. Unfortunately, the Republicans are putting all of our constituents in danger by making this bill purely a political agenda. At the last minute, after working together and reaching consensus, the Republicans decided to include major devastating cuts to SNAP, or food stamps, instead of helping rural and urban Americans. This bill cuts SNAP by $23 billion, which will kick 1 million households off the program. The bill will also kick 265,000 kids out of free school meals and reduce benefits for millions of families. In Michigan 1.3 million people rely on SNAP and it keeps 141,000 children out of poverty. This bill includes so many other programs in my district. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Michigan. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, my district supports urban farmers and food banks so our farmers and people can thrive. We should not put all of this in danger. Mr. Speaker, I call on Republicans today to stop, to remove this terrible proposal for SNAP with this poisonous bill. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a statement from No Kid Hungry, Share Our Strength, an initiative strongly opposed to this bill. 
[From No Kid Hungry, May 15, 2018] CONGRESS MUSTVOTENOO N FARMBILL WASHINGTON , DC.—This week the House of Representatives will vote on the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2), also known as the Farm Bill. The following is a statement from Share Our Strength’s Senior Vice President Lisa Davis about the harmful impact the bill would have on struggling families in America. Share Our Strength officially opposes the bill. ‘‘This week, the House of Representatives will vote on the Farm Bill. On balance, this bill will ultimately increase poverty and hunger in the United States and Share Our Strength cannot support it. Thirteen million children today are growing up in families that worry about hunger. Even more live in families on the brink, just one lost job, one medical emergency, one broken water heater away from hunger. Consider: A study by the Federal Reserve shows that nearly half of all Americans couldn’t come up with $400 for an emergency expense. Another study from the National Center for Children in Poverty shows that nearly half of all children in the United States live ‘‘dangerously close’’ to the poverty line. 6 in 10 Americans will spend at least one year of their lives in poverty. And in another survey recently conducted on behalf of No Kid Hungry, twothirds of lowincome parents said they would not be able to afford enough food for their families if they were hit with a single, unplanned expense of $1,500. These are families trying to do their best to survive. These are the families we all know. It’s the single working mom in California, worried about whether to pay the electricity bill or pay for groceries this month. It’s the grandmother trying to raise her grandkids in Appalachia. And it’s the military veteran trying to find enough work hours to support his son in Central Pennsylvania. And while this legislation includes some needed improvements to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), such as increasing asset limits and indexing them to inflation, these changes are significantly outweighed by harmful ones, such as eliminating Broad Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE) and increasing administrative burdens on states and imposing penalties on adults who are unable to comply with the expanded work requirements in a given month. We believe a good job is the best pathway out of poverty, but there is little reason to think the policies in this Farm Bill will increase employment. It imposes harsh penalties on beneficiaries who drop below the required number of hours in a month, locking them out of SNAP for a full year the first time and 3 years if it happens again. imagine a single mom barely getting 20 hours of work a week whose child gets strep throat or the flu. Or the rural dad whose car breaks down. Or the 55yearold house cleaner whose back goes out. This is all counterintuitive. Adding hurdles and punitive restrictions won’t help people find jobs or get back on their feet. But it will increase hunger and hardship for many families. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office also reports that this legislation will lead to more than 265,000 kids losing free school meals during the school year, a double whammy for poor, working families. Research demonstrates the deep connections between hunger and health, particularly for children. When kids don’t get the fuel they need to nourish their developing minds and bodies, they are more likely to get sick and do poorly in school, and they are much less likely to access a future free from poverty. We urge members of the House of Representatives to take a stand for children and families and oppose this legislation.’’ ABOUT NO KID HUNGRY  No child should go hungry in America, but 1 in 5 kids will face hunger this year. Using proven, practical solutions, No Kid Hungry is ending childhood hunger today by ensuring that kids start the day with a nutritious breakfast, are able to get the nutrition they need during the summertime, and families learn the skills they need to shop and cook on a budget. When we all work together, we can make sure kids get the healthy food they need. No Kid Hungry is a campaign of national antihunger organization Share Our Strength. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from a coalition of over 60 child advocacy organizations opposed to the bill. MAY9, 2018. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : As child advocates in the areas of hunger and nutrition, poverty, health, welfare, housing, and education, we are writing to express our opposition to the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2), which will harm the millions of children who rely on federal nutrition programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for access to consistent, healthy food. In the interests of our nation’s babies, children and youth we strongly urge you to vote NO on H.R. 2. SNAP is a proven antihunger and anti poverty program for children, which also lowers the odds of household and child food insecurity, and of children’s anemia, poor health, hospitalization for failure to thrive, and developmental delays. Research has also found that receiving SNAP in early childhood improved high school graduation rates, adult earnings, and adult health. Today, nearly 20 million children participate in SNAP, representing 44 percent of the program’s recipients and receiving nearly half of every SNAP dollar. In addition, school breakfast and lunch programs provide many of these same children a nutritious morning and lunchtime meal each day. Because children experience both poverty and food insecurity at higher rates than the general population, federal nutrition programs such as SNAP and school meals are critical supports that help them develop, learn, and succeed. To that end, we are very concerned about the impact H.R. 2 would have on our nation’s children. In fact, several provisions in the Nutrition Title of H.R. 2 directly threaten access to vital nutrition programs for the countless children and youth that we represent: Drastic Program Eligibility Changes: H.R. 2 Makes several harmful changes to state options that simplify SNAP eligibility requirements to improve access to SNAP for poor and lowincome families with children. These changes would: Expose LowIncome Children to a SNAP ‘‘Benefit Cliff’’: H.R. 2 eliminates Broad Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE), which gives states additional flexibility and efficiency in granting SNAP eligibility. This change will reinstate a benefit cliff in a majority of states, jeopardizing food assistance for 400,000 households who are scraping by on earnings just above 130 percent of the Federal poverty line. Undermine the Ability of Poor and LowIncome Families with Children to Build Savings: Similarly, the virtual elimination by H.R. 2 of Categorical Eligibility will mean many states will have to introduce a counterproductive and costly process of asset testing for SNAP eligibility. As a result, H.R. 2 would cause many families to lose eligibility solely because of red tape, and force other families choose between meeting their basic need for food and building up the savings and resources that would help them achieve economic mobility. Threaten Poor and LowIncome Children’s Access to School Meals: Under current law, children who receive SNAP are directly certified for free school meal programs. These meals help combat childhood hunger, while playing an important role in improving academic achievement and test scores and reducing absenteeism, tardiness, and discipline referrals. By forcing families off of SNAP due to changes in categorical eligibility, H.R. 2 would break this vital link between SNAP receipt and school meals for lowincome and poor children. As a result, some 265,000 children stand to lose access to free school meals. 
Undermine SNAP benefits for Poor and LowIncome Children Whose Families Rely on the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP): LIHEAP is a program that helps lowincome households afford their monthly utility bills. Under current law, some states allow households to use LIHEAP benefits greater than $20/month as proof of significant energy expenses, creating a streamlined method for families to access a modest increase in their SNAP benefit. However, H.R. 2 removes this option for households that do not have an elderly member, effectively requiring poor and lowincome families with children to provide substantial documentation of energy bills on a frequent basis for caseworkers to determine their utility allowance, which could discourage them from seeking the larger benefit or decrease its size. Harsh Work Requirements: Under current law, existing SNAP work requirements aimed at childless adults already have unintended and harmful consequences for children (for instance, those who rely on pooled resources from extended family and Non Custodial Parents) and youth (such as those aging out of foster care.) Yet in spite of limited supporting evidence, H.R. 2 intensifies and expands work requirements, reduces state flexibilities for exemptions, and requires states to implement costly training and employment programs that will take funds from food benefits to support a bureaucracy that will not provide quality services to people. The consequences of these changes could be devastating for countless children and youth, including: The 13.4 million schoolaged children on SNAP: H.R. 2 takes the unprecedented step of expanding work requirements to adults with schoolaged children. This provision risks the wellbeing of children whose parents or guardians are: 1) acting as a caretaker for a loved one such as a child with a disability; 2) have physical or mental health disabilities that don’t qualify as a disability under the legal definition; 3) face substantial barriers to work, including substance abuse issues or domestic violence; 4) working but struggling to meet the 20 hour per week threshold or the burdensome documentation requirements; and 5) have difficulty obtaining childcare or transportation. For these parents or guardians, losing SNAP translates to a benefit cut for their whole household, meaning there will be less food on the table for their children. Some parents and guardians may also erroneously believe that their inability to meet these new work requirements makes their children ineligible for SNAP as well, and as a result opt out of applying for or renewing benefits for the entire family. In addition, children in very vulnerable families may be impacted by the new requirements, such as: Children in the Care of Grandparents: Today, more than 2.5 million children are being raised by their grandparents or other relatives, in part because families are dealing with parental alcohol and substance abuse issues, which are growing rapidly due to the opioid epidemic. And already, these families face barriers to accessing the full array of benefits and services they need. H.R. 2 would further threaten the ability of grandparents and other older relatives to care for children because it expands work requirements for adults up to age 60 who are caring for children over six years of age. Children in Families with a History of Family Violence: H.R. 2 requires parents fleeing family violence with their children to meet the new work requirements unless they receive a state exemption. In addition, H.R. 2 requires parents to cooperate with state Child Support Enforcement (CSE) efforts in order receive SNAP benefits—a drastic change from current law, under which 45 states, DC, and the Virgin Islands have declined to link the two. Yet H.R. 2 effectively eliminates existing state flexibility around CSE cooperation, meaning parents who would like to apply for SNAP but are afraid of CSE requirements which would link them to their abusers are forced to choose between safety and feeding their children. Children in Military and Veteran Families: Many veteran and military families need help feeding themselves and their children. Today, households that include a veteran with a disability are nearly twice as likely to lack access to adequate food as households that do not include someone with a disability, and sadly, food insecurity rates are nearly double among post–9/11 veterans. Furthermore, currentlyserving military families often experience food insecurity because of financial emergencies, low pay, and crisis levels of chronic unemployment or underemployment of military spouses in a society where most families need dual incomes to live. By subjecting these parents, including those suffering from PTSD, to the new work requirements, H.R. 2 penalizes families in need who have already sacrificed so much for our nation. Youth aging out of foster care and unaccompanied, homeless youth: Youth aging out of foster care often face various challenges, including homelessness, difficulty affording education, and finding employment. Unaccompanied homeless youth and young adults (who lack safe stable housing and who are not in the care of a parent or guardian) experience similar difficulties, especially when they reach age 18. Existing SNAP work requirements already create a substantial barrier for these young people from accessing food assistance, because they technically meet the definition of a childless adult. Under the harsh requirements in H.R. 2, these vulnerable young adults will face even larger obstacles to food assistance. The Farm Bill represents an important opportunity for policy solutions that will strengthen and improve nutrition programs for our nation’s children. Instead, H.R. 2 is slated to reduce spending on SNAP benefits by more than $20 billion over 10 years and will disproportionately hurt children through its harmful provisions. We urge you to protect our nation’s children and vote NO on H.R. 2. Thank you for your time and attention.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the National Education Association strongly opposed to this bill. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, May 15, 2018. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the three million members of the National Education Association and the 50 million students they serve, we strongly urge you to VOTE NO on the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2) and oppose any amendments that further weaken the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This bill makes unnecessary changes to eligibility requirements that could reduce the number of students certified for free school meals. The bill also imposes additional work requirements for adults that will make it harder for some people to get or keep critical nutrition benefits. Votes associated with this issue may be included in NEA’s Report Card for the 115th Congress. The Farm Bill, as this reauthorization is commonly known, provides funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is our nation’s largest anti hunger program. By providing monthly benefits to eligible lowincome people to purchase food, SNAP plays a critical role in reducing hunger, malnutrition, and poverty, and improving family security, child and adult health, and employment. SNAP reaches key vulnerable populations—78 percent of SNAP households include a child, an elderly person, or a person with disabilities; 84 percent of all SNAP benefits go to such households. SNAP lifted 3.6 million Americans out of poverty in 2016, according to the Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure. By providing much needed economic support, SNAP allows families to have sufficient nutrition during times of unemployment, fluctuating incomes, and low wage work. Children living in households that receive SNAP benefits are eligible to receive free school meals. The healthy meals that lowincome children receive at school fight hunger, improve academic performance, and help reduce absenteeism, tardiness, and discipline referrals. According to the Food Research and Action Center, linking children in SNAP households to school meals is so important that Congress required all school districts participating in the National School Lunch Program to directly certify their students for free school meals. H.R. 2 undermines the important link between SNAP and free school meals in the 28 states that have chosen a broad based categorical eligibility option under current 
rules that expands SNAP eligibility to assist working families that still struggle to make ends meet. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), this could impact as many as 265,000 students nationwide. While students could apply for school meals via a burdensome paper process, there is no guarantee that they will still be eligible for the program or recertified in a timely manner. This would cost their families even more when they have just lost SNAP benefits. Further, this puts an enormous administrative burden on schools to revert to a costly paperbased system, Direct Certification for SNAP also provides the foundation for the Community Eligibility Provision, a hugely successful option that allows over 20,000 highpoverty schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to their students. The provision eliminates the need for schools to collect and process school meal applications, which allows schools to focus on providing healthy and appealing meals instead of processing paperwork. Schools are eligible to implement community eligibility if at least 40 percent of their students are certified to receive free school meals without submitting an application. Reducing the number of students who are directly certified by changing the rules for broadbased categorical eligibility means that fewer schools will be eligible to implement community eligibility, and many schools that are eligible will find that it is no longer financially viable, because fewer of their meals would be reimbursed at the free rate. This would increase unnecessary paperwork for schools and inhibit student success. The proposed changes in H.R. 2 to broad based categorical eligibility will result in working families losing much needed food benefits. It also means that their children could lose free school meals, amplifying the negative impact of the cut. It will mean more children go hungry at home as well as at school. The bill further imposes aggressive new work requirements, which are unnecessary, unworkable and likely to do more harm than good. It would require SNAP participants ages 18 through 59 who are not disabled or raising a child under 6 to prove—every month—that they’re working at least 20 hours a week, participating at least 20 hours a week in a work program, or a combination of the two. These new requirements would force states to develop large new bureaucracies that would need to track millions of SNAP recipients, but likely would do little to boost employment, particularly given that the new funding provided in the bill for job training and work slots would amount to just $30 per month for those recipients who need a work slot to retain SNAP benefits, according to the CBPP. Further, the requirements would leave lowincome people with barriers to employment—such as limited job skills or family members with illness—with neither earnings nor food assistance. We also have particular concern about amendments filed for Rules Committee consideration that would undermine the nutrition guidelines for school meals programs. These guidelines are currently being implemented in schools, and have already led to increased fruit and vegetable consumption by students. Good nutrition is particularly important for students from lowincome families, who may eat as many as half of their calories every day at school. Additionally, USDA has only recently published an interim rule for school meals that provides additional flexibility on the guidelines for schools. These amendments would only add uncertainty to this process and threaten the nutritional quality of the meals offered to students. We urge you to oppose any amendments that could threaten mandatory safety net programs beyond SNAP, such as Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The bill further includes $65 million in loans and grants administered by the Department of Agriculture to support Association Health Plans (AHP) offered through organizations that will eliminate coverage of essential health benefits (categories of care). These plans may appear to be a less expensive option than current small group market plans that include comprehensive coverage and consumer protections. However, in light of recently proposed rules, AHPs will soon not be required to cover services such as prescription drugs, mental health and maternity care leading to insufficient and inadequate care for children and adults. We strongly urge you to Vote No on the Farm Bill, any amendments aimed at weakening the healthy guidelines for school meals, and any amendments that make it even more difficult for SNAP participants to receive critical nutrition benefits. Sincerely, MARCEGAN, Director of Government Relations, National Education Association. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ). Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, and I rise in opposition to the rule. SNAP is a lifeline for 40 million lowincome Americans and millions of working families. It is the most effective antihunger program in the country. It is a proven pathway out of poverty for America’s most vulnerable families, and yet, instead of protecting successful programs like SNAP, this cruel bill would take over $23 billion in benefits away from children, seniors, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and working families struggling to make ends meet. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that the requirements in this farm bill would help people find work. But if they are really interested in promoting jobs that allow people to care for themselves and their families, I would invite them to consider legislation to raise the minimum wage, ensure fair work scheduling, provide paid family and medical leave and paid sick days, and address basic living standards. Instead, we are considering a callous farm bill that cuts benefits for those who need it most in order to pay for massive handouts to corporations in the top 1 percent. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to serve on the Agriculture Committee. I am the ranking member in the Nutrition Subcommittee, and I sat through 23 hearings. I heard Republican witnesses and Democratic witnesses, and all of them said the same thing: the SNAP program is important; don’t mess around with it. I didn’t hear anybody—anybody hint at embracing what is in this farm bill under the nutrition title, a title, by the way, which I, as the ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee, didn’t even see until it was made public. My friend from Georgia talks about bipartisanship. I mean, give me a break. I mean, you can say it all you want, but the bottom line is that it doesn’t exist in the Agriculture Committee. The process was offensive, and even more offensive is what the end product is going to do to vulnerable people in this country. You know, this is not a debate about ablebodied adults who aren’t working. You know, that is a very complicated population. I actually asked for a hearing on that population, and I was denied that right. You ought to know who this population is. It is a complicated population. Many of these ablebodied adults without dependents who are not working or who are not in the job training programs are our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan having difficulty reintegrating in the community; they are young people graduating out of foster care; they are people with undiagnosed mental illnesses. If we did a hearing, you would know who this population is. This is more than a press release. I am sick and tired of people being stereotyped all the time. And by the way, you punish people who are working. You know, by eliminating broad based categorical eligibility, there are people right now who are working, who make, you know, between $50,800 a year and maybe $24,000 a year, they work, and they get this benefit to put food on the table. b1415 And yet you are making changes that will deny them that benefit. They are working. You say you want to reward work. Well, what are you thinking when you take this nutrition benefit away from these people, who are doing everything right. When you take this SNAP benefit away from adults, you are taking it away from their children as well. And you heard over and over and over again that when people lose their SNAP benefit, their kids lose access to a free breakfast and lunch at school. This is awful. Send this bill back to committee. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I told you when we started this debate, Mr. Speaker, you were going to hear some passion from my friend from Massachusetts because he is, in fact, passionate. He is a public servant, and he serves his constituency well. But I want to read to you from Politico, one of our Washington, D.C., newspapers, that follows what goes on here 
in politics. I don’t sit on the Agriculture Committee, as my friend from Massachusetts does, but Politico reported this, as talks around the farm bill broke down in March: 
There were bipartisan negotiations. Those negotiations stopped, Mr. Speaker. 
Thursday afternoon, after House Agriculture Committee ranking member Collin Peterson— 
—faced pressure from fellow Democrats, who complained that discussions about changes to the food stamp program were being kept secret. 
My friend from Massachusetts mentioned that. I have that same frustration on committees that I serve, Mr. Speaker. Very often, the chairman of the committee, who is a Republican, and the ranking member, who is a Democrat, and their subcommittee chairmen very often they get together and have negotiations before rankand file Members get involved. It happens, and I am frustrated about it, and my friend from Massachusetts is frustrated about it. 
—is a considerable blow to the sweeping bill, which was seen by many as one of the only real chances for bipartisanship in this Congress. Congress is supposed to reauthorize the farm bill every 5 years, but political wrangling has threatened its fate. Current law expires September 30. Peterson’s decision— 
—to pause talks comes after House Democrats demanded that he stop negotiations until the text of the bill is made to everyone. 
The Democratic Members have made clear that they unanimously oppose the farm bill’s SNAP language as it has been described to them or reported in the press. Well, Mr. Speaker, if when you hear things you don’t like, or see things you don’t like, you leave the negotiating table, I promise you we are going to get a worse result every single time. I go up to this Rules Committee, right up here on the third floor, and we debate and talk and debate and talk and debate and talk hour upon hour upon hour, late into the evening, often into the next morning. I hear things I don’t like. I hear people say things I know are not true. But I don’t pick up my toys and go home. I stay at the table, I debate the issues, and I work through the issues. If it was easy, someone would have done it before this Congress got here. All that is left is hard. My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right, Mr. Speaker. He is absolutely right. He is absolutely right. If we are to reform the social safety net, we are going to have to expand benefits, not restrict them. He is absolutely right. But if we can’t stay at the table to have that conversation, we are never going to bring people together to get that done. You can’t blame people who follow their selfinterest. If the rule says you don’t have to work, you don’t have to work. If the rule says if you work too much, you will lose your benefits, then you don’t work too much. That is crazy to encourage people to stay home. You ought to be encouraging people to seek that next promotion, take on those extra hours, work that overtime. That has always been who we are and what we have done, and we have not taken on that challenge in welfare reform. I believe we can. I believe we can. I need my colleagues to support this rule today. I need them to support the rule so we can bring up not just the farm bill, so that we can bring up the VA MISSION Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will go to the President’s desk and change the lives of veterans. I need my colleagues to support this rule, not just so we can bring up the farm bill, not just so we can bring up the VA MISSION Act, but so that we can make the harming or threatening the harm of a law enforcement officer a Federal crime, to give the men and women who wear blue across this country the protections they deserve. This is a bipartisan bill, Mr. Speaker, that is going to make a difference for our constituents back home. These are going to be issues that get folks exercise, Mr. Speaker. The most difficult issues we take on always do. But if we pass this rule and take up this legislation, we will be one step closer, not just to succeeding for our veterans, not just to succeeding for our law enforcement officers, not just to succeeding on behalf of our farmers, but one step closer to taking on what is a collaborative challenge of how to return the incentives to work to the American people, while keeping the social safety net strong for all of the families that depend on it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia just mischaracterized the very partisan process that occurred in the Agriculture Committee in which Democrats were totally shut out. I want to know: What are the remedies that we have at this point in the debate to be able to correct the record so we can correct the misrepresentations? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated a parliamentary inquiry. That is a matter for debate. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim the time that I have yielded back. I would be happy to yield a portion of it to my friend. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, could I inquire how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), my friend. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman that nobody walked away from the table; only after we were totally shut out of the process. As I mentioned in my opening statement—if the gentleman were paying attention—the ranking member, Mr. PETERSON , actually tried to offer suggestions and was totally shut out. I am the ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee. You mentioned the ranking members usually get informed as to what is going on. I didn’t see it until it was made public. This was the most offensive process I have ever witnessed. And, by the way, the product in this ag bill—which I don’t think the gentleman has read, based on some of the things he has said—but this final product does not represent any of the hearings we had. So this process in the Agriculture Committee, which has been, historically, probably the most bipartisan committee in the Congress, was basically thrown into chaos as a result of the behavior of the majority. I just say to the gentleman: You can try to spin this all you want, but the bottom line is that this has never happened before. And COLLIN PETERSON —I just want to say—is probably the most bipartisan Member of this House. If you can’t strike a bipartisan deal with COLLIN PETERSON , you can’t strike a bipartisan deal with anybody. But that is not what this was about. This was about advancing an agenda, quite frankly, that is going to hurt millions of vulnerable people in this country, and I find it offensive. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for granting my unanimous consent request to reclaim my time. I do believe that we advantage all of our causes, rather than disadvantage them, by promoting debate. But I want to take issue, Mr. Speaker. I didn’t mischaracterize anything. I read the media reporting. I will be the first—when you want to have the fake news conversation—there is too much fake news in this country—I will be happy to join you and have that debate with you. But I didn’t mischaracterize a thing. I agree with what my friend had to say about COLLIN PETERSON from Minnesota. He is a fabulous Member, who works as hard as he can on behalf of his constituents to get work done. Nothing in the article I read said COLLIN PETER SONwalked away from the table. Everything in the article I read said he 
was pressured by his Democratic colleagues to walk away from the table. Mr. MCGOVERN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WOODALL. I will not yield again to my friend. I am going to close. I take umbrage at the fact that we would have an opportunity to use each other’s time, and you would use it to continue to say I mischaracterized, that we would have an opportunity to have a discussion, and you would continue to use it to say that folks just aren’t as well informed as you are about those issues. We have opportunities in this Chamber to make things better, and we have opportunities to make things worse. And I will say to my friend, Mr. Speaker, if we take advantage of our opportunities to make things better, I believe that we will. If we take advantage of our opportunities to make things worse, I am absolutely certain that we will. I choose the latter. I choose the latter. A vote in support of this rule is a vote for the latter. I am sorry, I am choosing the former. I am choosing the former. My colleagues out there are saying: Hey, I know WOODALL ; that is not right. He is not choosing to make things worse. I choose the former, Mr. Speaker. I choose the former. A vote for this rule is a vote for the former. Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the Chair for my confusion. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 891 O FFERED BY  MR. MCGOVERN  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 5805) to designate certain amounts authorized to be appropriated for the provision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of hospital care and medical services in nonDepartment of Veterans Affairs facilities pursuant to contracts as changes in concepts and definitions for certain budgetary purposes, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority members of the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs and the Budget. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 5805. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on ordering the previous question will be followed by 5 minute votes on: Adoption of the resolution, if ordered; and The motion to suspend the rules on S. 35. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 230, nays 184, not voting 13, as follows:

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. REICHERT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week. Yesterday was National Peace Officers Memorial Day, a day that we stop and pause 
and honor the fallen officers across this Nation who have given their lives to protect our families and communities across this great Nation. Some of you, last year, experienced this bravery and courage firsthand. All of us were affected by the friends who were present when they were in danger and our Capitol Police came to their rescue. As some of you know, I had a 33year law enforcement career before coming to Congress. I lost two of my best friends. One was shot and one was stabbed. These are brave, courageous people, but they are not only that. They have been blessed with the heart of a servant. They have been blessed with that gift to put other’s lives before theirs, and that is what you saw last year, those of you on the baseball field. There was no hesitation. They were there for you, as were my friends for the citizens that lived in their patrol district. Mr. Speaker, I have embraced the families, the friends, the partners, the children, and the spouses, and there are no words in that moment when the world is spinning out of control. There are no words when the world comes crashing down. There are no words. There is only silence and tears. Mr. Speaker, this is my last year in Congress. This is my last time that I will ask you all to join with me in a moment of silence and tears with the families who have lost their loved ones in the line of duty. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will Members and all visitors in the gallery please stand and join us for a moment of silence.

PROTECT AND SERVE ACT OF 2018 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 891, I call up the bill (H.R. 5698) to amend title 18, United States Code, to punish criminal offenses targeting law enforcement officers, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee). Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the bill is considered read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5698 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protect and Serve Act of 2018’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘§ 120. Crimes targeting law enforcement officers ‘‘(a) INGENERAL .—Whoever, in any circumstance described in subsection (b), knowingly causes serious bodily injury to a law enforcement officer, or attempts to do so— ‘‘(1) shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years, fined in accordance with this title, or both; and ‘‘(2) shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life, fined in accordance with this title, or both, if— ‘‘(A) death results from the offense; or ‘‘(B) the offense includes kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, or an attempt to kill. ‘‘(b) CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED .—For pur poses of subsection (a), the circumstances described in this subparagraph are that— ‘‘(1) the conduct described in subsection (a) occurs during the course of, or as the result of, the travel of the defendant or the victim— ‘‘(A) across a State line or national border; or ‘‘(B) using a channel, facility, or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce; ‘‘(2) the defendant uses a channel, facility, or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce in connection with the conduct described in subsection (a); ‘‘(3) in connection with the conduct described in subsection (a), the defendant employs a firearm, dangerous weapon, explosive or incendiary device, or other weapon that has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce; ‘‘(4) the conduct described in subsection (a)— ‘‘(A) interferes with commercial or other economic activity in which the victim is engaged at the time of the conduct; or ‘‘(B) otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce; or ‘‘(5) the victim is a Federal law enforcement officer. ‘‘(c) CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT .— ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL .—No prosecution of any offense described in this section may be undertaken by the United States, except under the certification in writing of the Attorney General, or a designee, that— ‘‘(A) the State does not have jurisdiction; ‘‘(B) the State has requested that the Federal Government assume jurisdiction; ‘‘(C) the verdict or sentence obtained pursuant to State charges left demonstratively unvindicated the Federal interest in protecting the public safety; or ‘‘(D) a prosecution by the United States is in the public interest and necessary to secure substantial justice. ‘‘(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION .—Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of Federal officers, or a Federal grand jury, to investigate possible violations of this section. ‘‘(d) DEFINITIONS .—In this section: ‘‘(1) LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER .—The term ‘law enforcement officer’ means an employee of a governmental or public agency who is authorized by law— ‘‘(A) to engage in or supervise the prevention, detention, investigation, or the incarceration of any person for any criminal violation of law; and ‘‘(B) to apprehend or arrest a person for any criminal violation of law. ‘‘(2) STATE .—The term ‘State’ means a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.’’.

The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the question of adopting the amendment to H.R. 5698 may be subject to postponement as though under clause 8 of rule XX. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material to H.R. 5698. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. b1515 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. On October 15, 1991, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial was dedicated to honor Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of our Nation and its people. The memorial features two curving, 304footlong, bluegray marble walls. Carved on these walls are the names of more than 21,000 officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to the first known death in 1791. Each spring, law enforcement officers from around the country gather in Washington, D.C., for Peace Officers Memorial Day. For a week, these men and women attend events to celebrate and honor those law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Each year, there is a memorial service in which the names of fallen officers are added to the long, curving marble walls of the memorial. Unfortunately, the list of names keeps growing and shows no signs of slowing down. That is why today I am pleased we are considering the Protect and Serve Act. This bill is designed to ensure those who seek to harm police officers face swift and certain justice. In recent years, the brave and dedicated men and women in blue who serve our communities are facing increased levels of hostility and violence. The increasing levels of hostility towards the law enforcement community have given rise to an increase in ambushstyle attacks on police officers. In 2016 alone, 64 police officers were shot and killed in the line of duty, 21 of whom were killed in ambushstyle attacks. According to CNN, in the first 17 weeks of this year, 21 law enforcement officers across the U.S. have been shot and killed in the line of duty. That averages out to more than one death every week. Only a few weeks ago, on April 19, 2018, two sheriff’s deputies were gunned down and killed in a suspected ambush while they were eating at a restaurant in Gainesville, Florida. To address this threat to the brave police, who put their lives on the line each day across our country, the Protect and Serve Act allows for Federal prosecution of criminals who knowingly assault law enforcement officers and cause serious bodily harm or attempt to do so. This bill applies to both Federal law enforcement officers and State and local officers where there is a nexus to interstate commerce. Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this legislation recognizes that most often these crimes are wholly within the jurisdiction of a State to prosecute. Therefore, in addition to other requirements in the bill to ensure a Federal connection, H.R. 5698 states specifically that prosecution under this new statute may only be pursued if the Attorney General certifies that, one, the State does not have jurisdiction; two, the State has requested that the Federal Government assume jurisdiction; three, the verdict or sentence obtained pursuant to State charges left demonstrably unvindicated the Federal interest in protecting the public safety; or, four, a prosecution by the United States is in the public interest and necessary to secure substantial justice. This is a critical part of the bill. It will ensure that the Federal power is 
reserved for particularly egregious cases. At the dedication of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, President George H. W. Bush aptly stated: ‘‘Carved on these walls is the story of America, of a continuing quest to preserve both democracy and decency, and to protect a national treasure that we call the American Dream.’’ Today, we continue to recognize this special role police officers play in our society. The Protect and Serve Act sends a uniform message that our country will not tolerate attacks on police which purposefully attempt to undermine the State, sow chaos in our communities, and wreck the lives of many of our finest citizens and their families. I urge my colleagues to send a uniform message today by addressing the grave crisis threatening both our communities and the brave men and women in blue who put their lives on the line each day. I would like to thank my Judiciary Committee colleagues, especially career law enforcement officers Sheriff RUTHERFORD and Chief D EMINGS , for sponsoring this bill. In addition, I want to thank Congressman BUCK for his years of tireless work to ensure that those who target law enforcement officers are punished. Finally, I want to recognize the police organizations who have worked with us so diligently on this and many other bills, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Major County Sheriffs of America, the National Sheriffs’ Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and the Sergeants Benevolent Association, among many others. I thank them. We all salute them for their steadfast commitment and dedicated service. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Protect and Serve Act, while rooted in laudable goals, will not strengthen protections for law enforcement officers, and it fails to make meaningful reforms that would improve policecommunity relations. Although I will not oppose the bill, I believe that its consideration today reflects a wasted opportunity. This legislation would create a new offense under title 18 of the U.S. Code for the crime of targeting law enforcement officers. Current law, however, at both the Federal and State level already makes it a crime. It is not clear why this bill changes the law in any meaningful way. No Member of Congress questions the difficulty, danger, and stress associated with being a police officer. A white paper commissioned by the Ruderman Family Foundation reported that, last year, 129 peace officers died in the line of duty—46 from shootings—with an additional 140 reported officer suicides. Since the start of this year, 2018, at least 36 law enforcement officers across the United States have died while on duty, with 24 of the deaths caused by gunfire. Our hearts go out to the families of those officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. As a result of the risk inherent to policing, there is no profession more widely protected under Federal and State law than working in law enforcement. All 50 States have laws that enhance penalties for crimes against peace officers and, in some instances, crimes against the broadly defined category of first responders. In fact, section 2 of the bill clearly acknowledges that States have primary jurisdictions for attacks on State and local police officers and lays out very narrow circumstances where a Federal nexus would exist. This presents an open question as to whether there would be any instances at all in which the Department of Justice would exercise jurisdiction under this legislation. I would note that my own State of New York has four separate criminal statutes addressing attacks on law enforcement officers. Moreover, Federal laws already impose a life sentence and, in some circumstances, even the death penalty on persons convicted of killing State and local law enforcement officers or other employees assisting with Federal investigations. Simply put, the legislation under consideration today does not improve upon this existing legal framework and does not provide any more stringent punishment for anyone under existing law. I want to be clear about the respect that we have for the difficult work undertaken by our law enforcement professionals. While attacks on law enforcement officials are completely unacceptable, the existing framework for prosecuting these crimes is more than adequate at both the Federal and State level. If it were not, I would be an ardent supporter of this legislation. Rather than advancing a bill that amounts to an empty gesture during Police Week, the Congress should instead be focusing on real reform measures that would actually protect law enforcement officers and first responders. We should act on the related problem of welldocumented unconstitutional policing practices in communities of color across the United States that have eroded trust between those communities and the law enforcement officials sworn to protect them. The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department currently has 19 consent agreements with troubled police departments nationwide. Dating back to the mid1990s, every region of the country has suffered some kind of high profile incident. Adding to community concerns are the increasingly welldocumented incidents of unjustified deadly force against unarmed victims in policecivilian encounters. More than 50 percent of the unarmed victims in these fatal encounters with police were people of color. The goal of protecting police officer safety would be well served by working to foster law enforcement reforms aimed at helping local jurisdictions meet their constitutional obligation of fair and unbiased policing and the resulting better trust between the communities and the police in their midst. As we have debated the Protect and Serve Act, I have been encouraged by the expressed commitment by Chairman GOODLATTE and the bill’s sponsor, Representative RUTHERFORD , to work with me on bringing the Judiciary Committee’s balanced work on law enforcement accountability out into the open with hearings and the introduction of legislation. We should care equally about harms by and against police officers and their impact on local communities. We should care about the harms on local communities because of that harm and also because of the fact that it undoubtedly leads to distrust, which in turn leads to greater violence against police officers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ), who is the chief sponsor of the legislation and a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOODLATTE and Representative NADLER for their support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act of 2018. This important bill will enhance penalties for anyone who intentionally causes harm to our law enforcement officers. I can tell you after dedicating 40 years of my life to law enforcement, I know what officers go through every day when they put that uniform on, say goodbye to their families, and walk out the door to protect their communities. Sadly, we have seen a recent rash in increase in violence against officers, especially in ambushstyle attacks. In fact, just last month in Florida, Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy Taylor Lindsey were eating lunch and were specifically targeted and assassinated in that restaurant simply because they were police officers and wore that blue uniform. They are not alone. So far this year, 87 law enforcement officers have been shot in the line of duty, 28 of whom ultimately lost their lives. Mr. Speaker, this is a 75percent increase over last year. For this reason, I introduced bipartisan legislation with my good friend and former Orlando police chief, Representative VAL DEMINGS , that will ensure that there are the strongest possible penalties for anyone who decides to target and harm 
not only Federal law enforcement officers but also local and State law enforcement officers. We worked on this bill closely with the Fraternal Order of Police, and I am proud to have earned the support of the National Association of Police Organizations, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, and the Major County Sheriffs of America, which represents thousands of officers across the country. This week, we remember the officers who have given their lives protecting our communities, and we, as Members of Congress, must show the law enforcement community across the country that we support them and the important work that they do day in and day out. We must also show those who wish to target police officers with violence that those attacks will not be tolerated. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I should mention—I think I would be remiss if I didn’t— that just yesterday morning, in Jacksonville, Florida, as mentioned earlier by my good friend from Washington, Dave Reichert—Sheriff Reichert—held a moment of silence for those officers who have given their lives in service to this community. Yesterday morning, about 4 o’clock in the morning during a horrible storm in Jacksonville, Officer Lance Whitaker gave his life on Law Enforcement Memorial Day in service to our community. I have to say, Police Week and Law Enforcement Memorial Day always remind me of the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said that the purpose in life is not to be happy; it is to be useful. It is to be honorable. It is to be compassionate, and it is to know that you made a difference because you lived and you lived well. Mr. Speaker, I offer this bill in memory of Officer Lance Whitaker, who died yesterday morning living well. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), who is the distinguished ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee. b1530 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I was honored just a few minutes ago to be on the floor of the House with the chairman of the committee, Mr. GOODLATTE ; the ranking member, Mr. N ADLER; the proponent of this bill, Mr. RUTHERFORD ; and our Democratic proponent, Mrs. DEMINGS , to honor those fallen officers with a moment of silence in the most powerful lawmaking body in the world, to acknowledge to the Nation and to the world that we stand united in honoring those who have fallen in the call of duty. I would like to express my deepest gratitude during National Police Week to all the brave men and women who continue to give of themselves selflessly. I also acknowledge my own hometown leadership: Sheriff Gonzalez, and, of course, our distinguished chief of police; all of the assistant chiefs, deputy sheriffs, and leadership; constables and their deputy constables; Texas rangers; and, of course, our Federal officers, over which this committee has jurisdiction. We thank not only them for their service, but also the families whose loved ones have fallen in battle. This is not a discussion of the respect and admiration we have for officers, and there is no argument regarding the difficulty, danger, and stress associated with being a police officer. We all have seen the reports that show, in 2017, 129 police officers died in the line of duty; 46 of those brave men and women were shot, while 140, tragically, committed suicide. That says a lot about the toll this type of profession takes on a person physically, psychologically, mentally, and on their families. The risks inherent in policing resulted in numerous statutes that deal with protecting our law enforcement officers via Federal and State law. Our law enforcement officers are most protected under our laws, and, in some instances, the statutes give life and the death penalty for such crimes. Even crimes against the broadly defined category of first responders are well addressed under Federal and State law. My State of Texas has several criminal statutes addressing attacks on law enforcement officers; therefore, this legislation may be deemed to be a duplicate legal framework. But I want to propose to my colleagues, as I did when we sat together at the Rules Committee, that we can work together in moving forward. I do want to say on this legislation that it does frame itself on the focus of the targeting of law enforcement. As well, it recognizes that the first prosecution level will be State and local laws to protect or bring to justice those who have shot police officers. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DONOVAN ). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear that I respect the bill that is moving forward but recognize that we really need to do more. One of the points that I want to make is this new law does not have mandatory minimums. It does allow the discretion of the judge, but I believe that there are issues that our civil rights groups have raised that are legitimate. This bill is being contemplated during a time when our country is in need of a new look at the Nation’s 18,000 law enforcement agencies. I hope my colleague, Mr. RUTHERFORD , as we have honored those together who have fallen, will join us in the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act that will provide for the opportunity for credentialing, professional development training and counseling, deescalation training that is necessary for our officers, and join in the enhancements of policecommunity relations. This will be a true tribute to our officers and, as well, provide a framework of protecting their lives as we engage the community in more coming together between police and community. I hope, again, that we move together as a committee and that the police working group will produce this kind of legislation. I support the Protect and Serve Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my deepest gratitude during this National Police Week, to all the brave men and women that continue to give of themselves selflessly. There is no argument regarding the difficulty, danger and stress associated with being a police officer. We have all seen the reports that show in 2017, 129 police officers died in the line of duty. 46 of those brave men and women were shot, while 140 committed suicides. That says a lot about the toll this type of profession takes on a person both physical, psychologically and mentally. The risk inherent in policing resulted in numerous statutes with vast protection via federal and state law. Our law enforcement officers are most protected under our laws and in some instances life and the death penalty are imposed for such crimes. Even crimes against the broadly defined category of first responders are well addressed under federal and state law. For example, my state of Texas has several criminal statutes addressing attacks on law enforcement officers. Therefore, this legislation is duplicative in nature and does not improve current legal framework for crimes against law enforcement officers. I want to be clear about the respect that we have for the difficult work undertaken by our law enforcement professionals. However, as Mr. Chairman said at Rules yesterday in agreement with my concerns, we cannot ignore the danger in taking such a onesided approach to the issue of police practices. Many of the civil rights groups have raised legitimate concerns. For example, this bill is being contemplated during a time when our country is in the throes of a national policing crisis, with a neverending stream of police shootings of unarmed African americans captured on video. While I support protection for our officers, I am also troubled by the message this may send to all those impacted daily by the violence perpetrated by the bad apples within law enforcement. We should focus on real reform measures like the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act that will protect law enforcement, first responders, and their communities. Over the years, welldocumented, unconstitutional policing practices in communities of color across the United States have eroded trust between these communities and the law enforcement officials sworn to protect them. Almost 1,000 people were killed by police in 2017 according to the Washington Post. Another outlet estimates over 1,100 policerelated fatalities last year, with people of color representing more than 50 percent of those unarmed during fatal encounters with police. 
In the two years since the creation of the Judiciary bipartisan Policing Strategies Working Group, the Committee has advanced no police reform legislation. The country’s interests would be better served by working to foster law enforcement reforms aimed at helping local jurisdictions meet their constitutional obligation of fair and unbiased policing. Repeatedly pursuing legislation, such as H.R. 5698, will sow seeds of division by ignoring the realities of police accountability issues, thus ultimately undermining public safety. We should care equally about harms by and against police officers and their impact on local communities. Out of respect for all who have lost their lives over the last year—both law enforcement and civilian—we must dedicate ourselves to engaging the difficult issues in reforming police practices to make lasting change in our communities. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE ), a gentleman who can speak well of the role that law enforcement officers play in saving lives. He is the chief majority whip of the House of Representatives. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding. I thank my colleague from Florida for bringing forward this important bill, the Protect and Serve Act, and especially, Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate law enforcement week nationally, a time to really thank those men and women who serve and put their uniform on every day to protect us, protect our communities, and keep our country and communities safe. I know all too well just that value and importance of having law enforcement and why they serve such an important role. Nearly a year ago, when we had the shooting in Virginia where a gunman targeted Members of Congress, it was those very law enforcement officers—in this case, our United States Capitol Police—who were the heroes who went toward the danger and confronted and took down the shooter, along with Virginia police who joined in as well. While they were risking their lives for us, they took on gunfire. They were shot themselves. In this case, it was United States Capitol Police David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who were just recently awarded incredible honors from the President and national law enforcement organizations for their heroic bravery. They went towards the fire, but they were shot and continued to take down and confront the shooter. Why this bill is so important is because it hardens penalties against any criminal who would target law enforcement officers. They deserve this protection. We have seen too often, in the last 2 years, where police officers were targeted by people because they wore the badge and because they are part of the thin blue line. We need to stand with them. We need to make it crystal clear that we are going to be standing with them and we are going to have their back. More often than not, they are the ones who have our back. That is why this bill is so important, Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support and urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD letters from the National Fraternal Order of Police dated May 9, 2018; the National Association of Police Organizations, Inc., dated May 16, 2018; the Sergeants Benevolent Association, dated May 8, 2018; and the National Sheriffs’ Association, dated May 7, 2018, all endorsing this legislation. 
NATIONAL FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE , Washington, DC, 9 May 2018. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. KEVIN O. M CCARTHY , Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY P. P ELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. STENY H. H OYER , Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER AND REPRESENTATIVES  MCCARTHY , PELOSI AND HOYER : I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 5698, the ‘‘Protect and Serve Act,’’ which was favorably reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary earlier today and to urge that it be considered next week during National Police Week. The legislation, introduced by Representative John H. Rutherford (R–FL), a former sheriff, and Val V. Demings (D–FL), a former police chief, would impose Federal penalties on individuals who deliberately target local, State or Federal law enforcement officers with violence. This year 87 officers have been shot in the line of duty and 28 of them were killed. Far too many of these murdered officers were slain in ambush as was the case with Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy Sheriff Taylor Lindsey of the Gilchrist County Sheriff’s Department in Florida. These two officers were having lunch together when they were assassinated by a man who fired through the restaurant’s window to kill them before turning the weapon on himself. Similarly, the violent transnational criminal organization MS–13 called for the assassinations of police officers in New York so the gang could ‘‘take back the streets’’—a move clearly intended to intimidate the men and women in uniform. Ambush attacks like this are increasing at an alarming rate. A report issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the motivations of copkillers revealed that many of these attacks are motivated by a hatred or animus toward law enforcement officers. This same report stated that these killers felt that the communities and elected officials no longer supported their officers and they would not face serious penalties for their actions. We must change this perspective and we believe the ‘‘Protect and Serve Act’’ will do just that. We appreciate, as always, your leadership and your support for law enforcement officers and the families of those who fell in the line of duty. As our nation comes together to honor these heroes during National Police Week, I hope the House will consider taking this legislation up on the floor and passing it. On behalf of the more than 335,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, thank you for considering our view on this important legislation. If I can provide any additional support for this bill or on any other matter, please do not hesitate to contact me or my Senior Advisor, Jim Pasco, in my Washington, D.C. office. Sincerely, CHUCK CANTERBURY , National President. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  POLICE ORGANIZATIONS , INC., Alexandria, Virginia, May 16, 2018. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMEMBERS OF CONGRESS : On behalf of the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to you to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act. NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from across the United States that serves to advance the interests of America’s law enforcement through legislative and legal advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978, NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and associations, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair and effective crime control and law enforcement. The Protect and Serve Act of 2018 provides for new criminal provisions for deliberate, targeted attacks on officers. This bill is critical, as there is a serious and growing trend of armed attacks on law enforcement officers. According to a December 2017 report from the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 2016 saw a significant increase in ambush attacks on unsuspecting officers, with 21 shot and killed. 61% of those officers were not answering a call for service or engaged in enforcement action or performing official duties— they were targeted and killed just for the uniform they wore. 12 officers were murdered sitting in their patrol cars. NAPO has long been fighting to establish stricter penalties for those who harm or target for harm law enforcement officers. Any persons contemplating harming an officer must know that they will face serious punishments. NAPO strongly believes that increased penalties make important differences in the attitudes of criminals toward public safety officers, and ensure protection for the community. On May 13th, 360 American law enforcement heroes, who gave their lives in the line of duty, were honored at the 30th Annual Candlelight Vigil. In memory of those officers and in the hope of ensuring there are fewer names added to the memorial walls next year, we ask that you join us in supporting H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act. Sincerely, WILLIAM J. JOHNSON , Esq., CAE, Executive Director. 
OFNEWYORK, New York, NY, May 8, 2018. Hon. ROBERT GOODLATTE , Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. JERROLD NADLER , Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN AND REPRESENTATIVE  NADLER : I am writing on behalf of the more 
than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department (SBA) to thank you for scheduling the markup of the ‘‘Protect and Serve Act.’’ The SBA strongly supports this important officer safety legislation and we respectfully request that the Committee advance it to the full House of Representatives as expeditiously as possible. Unfortunately for law enforcement officers today, it is a simple fact that they must maintain constant vigilance to the threats posed by those who seek to do them harm for nothing more than the badge and uniform they wear. It is a vigilance borne out of what we have seen in recent years, as far too many officers have made the ultimate sacrifice at the hands of cowardly criminals who have intentionally targeted law enforcement officers for violence. Last month’s ambush attack in Gilchrist, Florida that claimed the lives of Sgt. Noel Ramirez and Deputy Taylor Lindsey is just the latest example of the rise in violence carried out on federal, state, and local law enforcement. We have seen similar attacks in Baton Rouge and Dallas in 2016, as well as the assassination of our own NYPD Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in December 2014. According to a recent joint study conducted by the COPS Program and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, between 2010–2016 there were 81 officers killed in ambushstyle attacks— targeted specifically because they were uniformed police or deputies. Of this number, 25 of the officers attacked were responding to a call for service at the time of the ambush. Because these types of attacks threaten to unravel the basic social fabric of our Nation—the rule of law—they must be met with the harshest of penalties. It is for these reasons and many others that our organization is proud to support the ‘‘Protect and Serve Act,’’ which will help to address the rise in attacks on, and increase the protection of, state and local law enforcement. Specifically, the bill aims to combat targeted violence against law enforcement officers by creating a new federal crime for perpetrating, or attempting to perpetrate, deliberate acts of violence against federal, state, and local law enforcement officers. It would also permit the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to assume jurisdiction and prosecute these heinous attacks on law enforcement in those instances where the state has requested that DOJ assume jurisdiction, or where federal prosecution is in the public interest in order to secure justice. Penalties under the act would range from up to 10 years in federal prison to a life sentence if death results from the offense, or the offense involved kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, or an attempt to kill. On behalf of the membership of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, thank you again for your consideration of this important legislation. Please do not hesitate to contact me, or our Washington Representatives, if we can be of any further assistance. Sincerely, EDMULLINS , President. 
NATIONAL SHERIFFS ’ ASSOCIATION , Alexandria, VA, May 7, 2018. Congressman JOHNRUTHERFORD , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD : On be half of the National Sheriffs’ Association (NSA) and the more than 3,000 elected sheriffs nationwide, we write to endorse The Protect and Serve Act of 2018. We believe that your proposal of this bill is necessary and vitally important to the safety and protection of our country’s federal, state, and local law enforcement. Each day deputies and officers put their lives on the line to protect and serve their communities. They are the mainstays of our communities, and should be treated with respect. Egregious acts such as targeting, injuring, or killing a law enforcement officer should be punishable to the highest degree according to the severity of the crime. The National Sheriffs’ Association strongly supports The Protect and Serve Act of 2018 as it works to punish individuals who commit crimes targeting law enforcement officers. We believe this bill is an essential to further defend the safety of our nation’s law enforcement officers. Sincerely, JONATHAN F. T HOMPSON , Executive Director and CEO. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as I stated at the outset of debate today, I will not oppose this bill, although it merely duplicates existing law. It does not add any protection for the police and does not increase any penalty for someone who assaults a police officer. I am not interested in falling into the trap of opposing what amounts to a messaging bill brought forth during Police Week. But I want to be clear that I believe H.R. 5698 represents a wasted opportunity and appears tonedeaf to some of the real struggles happening in communities across our Nation. This bill is being contemplated at a time when our country is in the throes of a national policing crisis, with a neverending stream of police shootings of unarmed African Americans captured on video. Creating a new, yet superfluous crime for offenses committed against law enforcement is not a great idea because it doesn’t do anything. It is particularly not a great idea when we are ignoring the other problem that adds to the danger for police officers, which is the disconnectedness and estrangement of many police forces from the communities they serve. I hope this Congress will now get back to the difficult work of legislating meaningful solutions. I am encouraged that my Republican colleagues have made a commitment to pursue balanced law enforcement accountability reform with hearings and, hopefully, the introduction of legislation. There is much work to be done. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from various civil rights and civil liberties groups relative to this bill. 
U.S. H OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, May 15, 2018. Re Coalition Opposition to H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act of 2018. DEARMEMBERS OF CONGRESS : On behalf of the 28 undersigned civil rights, civil liberties, faithbased, and government accountability organizations, we write to urge you to oppose H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act of 2018, which creates a new crime for offenses that target law enforcement officers. First, police already have substantial protections under federal and state law, rendering this bill superfluous. Second, this bill signals that there is a ‘‘war on police,’’ which is not only untrue, but an unhelpful and dangerous narrative to uplift. And finally, bills similar to Protect and Serve that have been introduced in states around the country—so called ‘‘Blue Lives Matter’’ bills—appear to be a political response to the growing national movement for police accountability in the face of continued killings and assaults of unarmed African Americans; therefore, this bill is divisive and will have a negative impact on the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve. i. Federal and state criminal laws already offer ample protection to police officers. Federal law already has extremely strong penalties for people who commit crimes against law enforcement officers and other public officials. For example, federal laws impose a life sentence or death penalty on persons convicted of firstdegree murder of federal employees or officers, killing state and local law enforcement officers or other employees assisting with federal investigations and killing officers of the U.S. courts. All fifty states have laws that enhance penalties for people who commit offenses against law enforcement officers, including for homicide and assault. Moreover, there is no record that crimes against law enforcement go unprosecuted or are otherwise treated frivolously There is no record to suggest that prosecutors are unwilling or unable to charge individuals with crimes against law enforcement. In fact, crimes against police officers are treated as among the most heinous criminal acts, given the high degree of culpability and punishment attached to such crimes. II. The Protect and Serve Act does not advance any stated policy goals, because law enforcement is not subject to increasing or widespread attacks. There is no doubt that police work is a dangerous undertaking, but the reality is that there has been a continuing decline in the number of officers killed or assaulted in the line of duty over the last several decades. In the past ten years, the number of officers feloniously killed has fluctuated, yet not significantly increased or decreased, as have ambushstyle killings of officers. Given these facts, this bill perpetuates a false narrative that police are under increasing attack by their communities. Such a message is unhelpful and unsupported. Furthermore, the Protect and Serve Act does nothing to meaningfully improve officer safety and wellness if that is an intended policy goal. For example, it does not call for support services, better training, improved safety measures, increased supervision, or any of the other multiple measures available to law enforcement that are widely accepted as promoting officer safety and wellbeing. III. Protect and Serve Act is polarizing and harms communitypolice relations. This bill is being contemplated at a time when our country is in the throes of a national policing crisis, with a neverending stream of police shootings of unarmed African Americans captured on video. Creating a new, yet superfluous, crime for offenses committed against law enforcement is a particularly disconnected and nonresponsive policy choice. Unfortunately, the Protect and Serve Act is similar to other ‘‘Blue Lives Matter’’ type bills that create new criminal offenses and penalty enhancements for crimes against police. Collectively, these policy efforts, which have sprung up amid the national call for police accountability, appear to be a political response to the powerful activism of grassroots movements that demand fair and constitutional policing. Rather than focusing on policies that address issues of police excessive force, biased policing, and other police 
practices that have failed these communities, the Protect and Serve Act’s aim is to further criminalize. This bill will be received as yet another attack on these communities and threatens to exacerbate what is already a discriminatory system of mass incarceration in this country. Continuing to undermine policecommunity relations in this manner sows seeds of division, which ultimately threatens public safety and undermines the work of law enforcement. For the reasons summarized above, we urge you to vote against the Protect and Serve Act as it comes before the U.S. House of Representatives. There is no justification for creating a new crime for offenses committed against law enforcement. At a time when we need to foster healing between law enforcement and our communities, we should not be considering legislation which not only does nothing to advance the goal of officer safety, but will further erode the relationship between police and communities. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I just want to make it very clear how important this legislation is for protecting law enforcement officers because it sends a message that we are going to handle these cases in a new way. Some have criticized this bill, claiming that it is a hate crime. While I share those individuals’ concerns about Federal hate crime statutes, I am pleased to tell the Members of this Congress that this bill before us did not create a new Federal hate crime. That is because the legislation does not use the language from the hate crime statute that requires the government prove the defendant acted ‘‘because of the actual or perceived’’ status of the victim. What this bill does is penalize knowingly attacking a law enforcement officer. Given the increase in ambushstyle attacks on law enforcement, which was detailed earlier, this bill represents a solution to a growing problem: the killing of police officers. It is narrowly tailored to accomplish that goal. Therefore, I want to assure those Members who may be concerned about its intent that it is definitely not changing our Federal hate crime statutes. This legislation this week, National Police Week, sends an important signal not just to our Nation’s law enforcement officers, 900,000 strong, but far beyond that, to all Americans, that we are placing a very, very high priority on saving the lives of men and women who put their lives on the line to protect us, to protect our freedoms, to protect our opportunities, to protect our families, to protect our communities, and making sure that people who ambush police officers and take police officers’ lives are held fully accountable, which is what this bill does. It is a good bill. It is an important bill. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired. AMENDMENT NO . 1 PRINTED IN PART A OF HOUSE  
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 3, beginning on line 13, strike ‘‘knowingly causes serious bodily injury to a law enforcement officer’’ and insert ‘‘knowingly assaults a law enforcement officer causing serious bodily injury’’. Beginning on page 5, strike line 24 and all that follows through page 6, line 8, and insert the following: ‘‘(1) LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER .—The term ‘law enforcement officer’ means an employee of a governmental or public agency who is authorized by law— ‘‘(A) to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, or the investigation of any criminal violation of law; or ‘‘(B) to engage in or supervise the detention or the incarceration of any person for any criminal violation of law.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This amendment makes two small, but important changes to the underlying legislation. It first clarifies the language of the bill to assure those who are prosecuted are acting with some level of intent in injuring a police officer. It does this by changing the language from ‘‘knowingly causing serious bodily injury to a law enforcement officer’’ to ‘‘knowingly assaults a law enforcement officer causing serious bodily harm.’’ This change will avoid covering situations where someone unintentionally harms a police officer. The amendment also amends the definition of law enforcement officer to ensure it covers all law enforcement officers who are putting themselves in harm’s way each day, including corrections officers. Mr. Speaker, this amendment is important because it ensures that, in practice, this statute can be used more efficiently to protect law enforcement officers. It also ensures that nobody who wears a badge will be unintentionally excluded from the bill’s protections. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, that is good news, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill and on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ). The amendment was agreed to. b1545 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the RECORD  on S. 2372, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, the John S. McCain III; the Daniel K. Akaka; and with great honor, the Samuel R. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018, or the VA MISSION Act. This bill exemplifies exactly how Congress should work. It is a bipartisan, bicameral compromise agreement between the House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committees that was crafted over the last year and a half through regular order and in close coordination with stakeholders and advocates in VA, the White House, the military and veterans service organizations, and the broader health community. It is also aptly named after Senator MCCAIN, late Senator Akaka, and Congressman SAMJOHNSON , three great Americans whose lives and work exemplify service and statesmanship. The MISSION Act is also aptly named in that it would address and reaffirm Congress’ commitment to VA’s core and most important mission: caring for, as President Lincoln said, those who have borne the battle. There are five main components of the MISSION Act. Each of these components on their own would be noteworthy and significant. Together, they are transformational. The first component of the MISSION Act would consolidate and improve VA’s community care programs. VA uses several different methods to refer veterans to community providers today. The most recent and notable method is the Choice Program, which Congress created following the nationwide access and accountability crisis in 2014. All of those methods serve different purposes and employ different business processes, reimbursement rates, and eligibility criteria. That creates a tremendous and increasing amount of confusion and consternation from VA employees, community providers, and VA patients. The MISSION Act would consolidate all of those methods into a single, streamlined VA community care program that is easier to understand, administer, and deliver to veterans who need it. This would increase access to timely quality care in every community across the country and, in doing so, expand VA’s reach and veterans’ choice. It would also return all VA community care funding to the discretionary side of the ledger, thereby increasing transparency and accountability for the hardearned taxpayer dollars that VA receives. 
The second component of the MISSION Act would address the pending shortfall in the Choice fund. When Congress created the Choice Program 4 years ago, it also created the Choice fund and stipulated that the program would end when the fund ran dry. Congress has acted time and time again to prevent that from happening in recognition of the millions of veterans who rely on the Choice Program despite its imperfections. However, Acting VA Secretary Wilkie sent a letter just last week declaring that the remaining funds in the Choice fund will be exhausted as early as May 31, just 2 weeks from today. The consequences of that have the potential to be catastrophic for veterans, with Acting Secretary Wilkie warning that wait times will increase, access to care will decrease, continuity of care will be disrupted, and valuable community partnerships will be damaged. To prevent that, the MISSION Act would authorize and appropriate $5.2 billion to the Choice fund. This would prevent an accesstocare crisis from occurring in the immediate future and provide sufficient funding to allow the Choice Program to continue serving veteran patients over the next year until the new, consolidated community care program is implemented. The third component of the MISSION Act would address VA’s massive and misaligned physical footprint. VA is one of the largest propertyholding entities in the Federal Government with a capital asset portfolio that includes thousands of medical facilities spanning hundreds of millions of square feet. The average VA medical facility building is more than five times older than the average building in the not forprofit system in this country, with some VA facilities being much older than that. For example, the VA medical center in my hometown of Johnson City, Tennessee, was built in 1903 to care for Civil War veterans. It is still seeing patients today. Since being named chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs a year and a half ago, I have made it a priority to travel to VA facilities across the country. While many of them are doing great work, they are operating out of facilities that were designed and built to meet antiquated healthcare needs and delivery models. Those facilities are increasingly impossible to manage and maintain in accordance with modern standards and the everchanging shifts in the veteran population, not to mention that demand for care is growing progressively more costly and complex in Tennessee and across the country. The Asset and Infrastructure Review, or AIR, Act process that the MISSION Act would create is based on a recommendation from the bipartisan Commission on Care that was put together by President Obama. It would create an open, objective, politically insulated process to recommend how VA’s massive physical footprint can be realigned and brought up to date. This would transform the VA healthcare system that we know today into one that is stronger, more efficient, and better able to meet the healthcare needs of veterans, now and for generations of veterans to come. None of us who are lucky enough to have a VA facility in their backyard, as I do, want to contemplate a future where that facility may change or disappear. But without action as bold, brave, and potentially transformative as the AIR Act is, the longterm success and sustainability of the VA healthcare system is in serious question, and veterans will suffer the consequences. I want to assure those who may still be concerned about AIR that they will have nothing to fear from it. I worked closely with a wide variety of veteran service organizations to ensure that the AIR process takes and includes a high level of veteran, VSO, stakeholder, and community involvement— both locally and nationally—and to make sure no AIR recommendation would occur behind closed doors without an open discussion and a review of all the relevant facts, with every option and opportunity left on the table. It is my firm belief that AIR will result in a modern, streamlined VA healthcare system but not necessarily a markedly smaller one. VA is going to remain a presence in communities large and small, and no facility that is needed to care for veteran patients or that has a worthy service to provide them will be negatively impacted. The fourth component of the MISSION Act will be to expand the Family Caregiver Program to the caregivers of pre9/11 veterans. Congress created the Family Caregiver Program in 2010 to provide services and supports, including a monthly stipend payment and healthcare coverage, if needed, to caregivers of post9/11 veterans. Caregivers provide an invaluable service, often at great personal sacrifice, to those veterans who have been seriously injured in the line of duty. Caregivers know no age or era, but for far too long the Family Caregiver Program has been restricted to an inequality based on era of service. The MISSION Act would correct that serious inequity and finally give pre9/11 caregivers the recognition they deserve. The fifth and the final component of the MISSION Act would be to enhance the internal capacity of the VA healthcare system to care for veteran patients internally. Opponents of this bill will tell you falsely that it is aimed at eventual privatization of the VA healthcare system. That misconception is based on nothing but fear and rhetoric, I think. The MISSION Act contains numerous provisions that would make it easier for VA to attract highquality commissions and other professionals and put them to work in VA medical facilities, just as I have done. It also contains numerous provisions that would make it easier for the providers already working in VA hospitals and clinics to see more veteran patients and to be recognized and rewarded for their great work. Together, these provisions would fortify the VA healthcare system and make sure it stays strong and able to provide the care that it is meant to provide. Before closing, I want to take a moment to recognize some people: Chairman JOHNNY ISAKSON and Ranking Member TESTER of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Chairman ISAKSON and Ranking Member T ESTER  have been steadfast partners over the last year and over the last several weeks, in particular. The MISSION Act would not be a reality without their goodfaith efforts to work hand in hand with me and with our veteran service organization partners to overcome our differences and craft a bipartisan, bicameral compromise bill that veterans and their families can be proud of. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank them for their leadership and for their friendship. I am also grateful for the many members of the committee from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol, including Ranking Member WALZ, and to our VSO partners in the community, the VA, and in the White House who have worked hard over the last year and a half to craft and consider many of the provisions that make up the MISSION Act. Finally, I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and steadfast commitment to veterans since taking office. This bill would not have been possible without his vocal leadership. This may well be the most impactful vote that any of us will ever take for our Nation’s veterans. And before I finish, I also want to thank the staffs on both sides of the aisle, both in the Senate and in the House, both Republican and Democrat, for their incredible hard work, the many hours behind the scenes that you never see, that the public never sees, that I certainly appreciate and I believe Ranking Member WALZdoes too, the hard work of our staffs. A ‘‘yes’’ vote is a vote for access, for quality, for choice, for the longterm success and sustainability of the VA healthcare system, for caregivers and for veterans. And for that I would recommend a positive ‘‘yes’’ vote. The MISSION Act is supported by every major military and veteran service organization that rightfully recognizes this as a monumental and historic opportunity to support a bill that will positively impact the daily lives and wellbeing of millions of veterans and their families and fundamentally shape and improve the second largest agency in the Federal Government. b1600 I urge every single one of my colleagues to stand today with me and 
these organizations dedicated to the service of veterans, servicemembers, and their families, and, most importantly, our Nation’s veterans, and support the VA MISSION Act. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from the VSO in support of the MISSION Act. 
MAY7, 2018. Hon. PHILROE, Chairman, House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. JOHNNY ISAKSON , Chairman, Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. TIMWALZ, Ranking Member, House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. JONTESTER , Ranking Member, Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN ROE, R ANKING MEMBER  WALZ, CHAIRMAN ISAKSON AND RANKING MEMBERTESTER : On behalf of the millions of veterans, service members and family members we represent and advocate for, we offer our strong support for the ‘‘VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018,’’ also known as the ‘‘VA MISSION Act of 2018.’’ This historic veterans legislation would consolidate and reform VA’s community care programs; extend funding for the current Veterans Choice Program for one year; strengthen VA’s ability to recruit, hire and retain quality medical personnel; review, realign and modernize VA’s health care infrastructure; and extend eligibility to VA’s comprehensive caregiver assistance program to aging and disabled veterans injured before September 11, 2001. Our organizations strongly support expanding eligibility for VA’s comprehensive caregiver program to all generations of seriously disabled veterans, while maintaining the caregiver benefits that are currently available. Today, this program provides full comprehensive caregiver assistance only to veterans injured on or after September 11, 2001, leaving family caregivers and veterans injured during World War II, the Korean, Vietnam and Gulf Wars ineligible for this critical support. The legislation will help to correct this injustice and we—along with millions of members in our organizations— applaud you for taking this action and look forward to working in the future to ensure that both injured and ill veterans from all eras are eligible for this benefit. The legislation would consolidate VA’s community care programs and develop integrated networks of VA and community providers to supplement, not supplant VA health care, so that all enrolled veterans have timely access to quality medical care. The bill includes funding to continue the current Choice Program for an additional year until the new community care program is implemented as well as important workforce improvement provisions to strengthen VA’s internal capacity to delivery care. This carefully crafted compromise represents a balanced approach to ensuring timely access to care while continuing to strengthen the VA health care system that millions of veterans choose and rely on. The legislation also includes a new Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) process intended to design and implement a comprehensive plan to optimize and modernize VA’s medical care facilities. The AIR process would provide meaningful stakeholder involvement, transparency and other safeguards during the review process to help ensure the final result leads to a stronger and better aligned VA infrastructure able to deliver care to veterans when and where they need it. Since the access and waiting list crisis exploded in 2014, Congress, VA and veterans leaders have debated how best to strengthen and reform the delivery of veterans health care to ensure timely and seamless access for enrolled veterans. The legislation before the Committee would take a major step towards that goal by making improvements to and investments in the VA health care system, creating integrated networks so that veterans have access to care when and where they need it, and providing the further recognition and assistance to family caregivers of severely disabled veterans deserve. As leaders of the nation’s veterans and military service organizations, we thank you for your steadfast leadership in crafting this important bipartisan bill and call on all members of Congress to seize this historic opportunity to improve the lives of veterans, their families and caregivers by swiftly passing the ‘‘VA MISSION Act of 2018.’’ The men and women who have served, are serving and will serve in the future are counting on Congress’ support.

Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say the chairman’s description of how this process was done was absolutely 100 percent accurate. The sense of bipartisanship that went into the writing of this bill, the sense of purpose in shared values on caring for our veterans, the sense of dignity and respect that was given to the minority side in dissenting opinions both from the chairman and his staff was exemplary and what we should all expect out of our leadership. This is a piece of legislation that has components of it that have literally been with me or been on my mind or things that I have tried to effect for literally twothirds of my life—24 years in that uniform and 12 years here. Much of this, I am proud to have been part of the original authors with the chairman in writing that, and it brings me to a strange position today. I am rising personally in opposition, and I say that this will be my last opportunity to vote on the Choice Act. I will be leaving this Congress after this term, and after many positive things—and I have said it time and time again. The leadership that the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) is showing will probably not be parallel in terms of care for veterans in the way that he has approached this. This piece of legislation is critically important— the caregivers piece in it, the piece on dealing with VA assets and how we look at capacity going forward, and, of course, Choice. And I would like to say—and especially to my friend, SAMJOHNSON —very few words need to be said about SAM JOHNSON . We served on the POW/MIA Commission in dealing with finding the lost remains of our warriors and dealing directly with the Russian Government. And when SAMJOHNSON ’s name is mentioned anywhere around the world, people stop and listen. So it is appropriate. I thank the chairman for naming that, and, of course, with Senators Akaka and MCCAIN. My concerns on this. This is not a symptom of the VA Committee. The VA Committee did exactly what it was supposed to do. The chairman did exactly what he was supposed to do. The VSOs did exactly what they were supposed to do. But I think this is my last chance to voice, how do we ever get to the point where we look at longterm stability. How do we ever get to the point—three times we had to do—and the chairman is right. I have no doubt that this body, because of the care for veterans on both sides, will do whatever is necessary when we run short, and we will. And next May, when we hit the discretionary spending caps and things had to be made, I have no doubt, under the chairman’s leadership, we will find a fix, or whoever sits in that chair will try and find that fix. I thought, and still believe to this day, this was our opportunity to look at that longterm care—the issue that was going to be the stability of VA care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this bill is going to cost $47 billion over 5 years. There is not an 
American taxpayer that would not pay every penny of that to go to care of veterans. This is not about trying to figure that piece of it out. Paying for veterans care in the community is going to cost $22 billion on that. I agree that reforming Choice Programs, consolidating the VA’s seven other community care programs is needed. And I agree transferring this funding of the Choice Program to discretionary funding so the VA can budget for the increased cost and all healthcare is paid by that fund. We must ensure the high cost of community care, though, does not force the VA to cut other critical veterans services. It is unfortunate that we have chosen to solve this problem on the mandatory side by exempting VA care from statutory PAYGO, but we are not going to do that in the future on the care in the community. It is not a problem that is going to occur years from now. Everybody in here who is coming back—and the voters will tell you if you are or not—is coming. The cost of community care is so expensive, we will not get through fiscal year 2019 without a similar exemption on the discretionary side. This bill fails to address how VA will fund all of its other programs once this transfer occurs. The Bipartisan Budget Act deal raised VA’s caps by $4 billion to improve VA infrastructure. This increased discretionary funding responsibility for community care is going to undermine that deal, forcing VA to cut its own programs and use money designated for VA infrastructure to fund community care. That is a choice we can make, and it is a choice that has to be made. I am just suggesting today that with the good will, the smart policies, the leadership that was here, maybe we should have gone for the whole one on this. I will take the critique that looking for the perfect and throwing away the good is a fair critique. I am just not sure, in a Congress with a $21 trillion deficit and a discretionary spending budget that could be eaten up across there, when is that hard decision ever going to be made? It could mean that care provided in VA hospitals and clinics, construction and maintenance of those facilities, veterans homelessness programs, and VA research will have to see cuts under the way the law is made to make sure community care is funded. It could cause cuts to programs across the Federal Government, including programs that help veterans with job training, employment assistance, or veterans treatment courts. Even the expansion of eligibility for caregiver assistance for all veterans of all generations—a key part of this bill supported by everyone here—could face cuts if VA hits those spending caps. Now, all of us here, it is the job of this committee to be the authorizing committee, so don’t get me wrong. I am not going to put the pressure where the White House was or to the appropriators, but the fact of the matter is, after this vote, the Caregiver Support Program has zero dollars in it. No dollars in it. They are going to have to come from somewhere, and a budget that the chairman has rightfully told us has increased fourfold in the last 10 years, we are going to have to come to grips with that. I am not suggesting you cut it. I am just suggesting that we budget honestly on this so we don’t run into this nightmare scenario that is coming in May of 2019. There are concerns over longterm sustainability without qualified leadership in place to successfully implement the program. Here is what I am worried about. If this committee and even this Congress were responsible for implementation, but once it leaves here, it goes to the executive branch, I, as the ranking member of the House VA Committee, am not quite sure who to call up there right now in this transition. We have been 40 days without a VA Secretary. We don’t have one, that I know of, scheduled to go in front of the Senate for confirmation at this point in time. So we are willing to capitulate the authority, the ability to give this over there, and decisions that are going to affect generational care in the VA to somebody yet to be placed. That leadership piece scares me. But again, some of it is relieved because I know you have got leadership in this House. I know you have got a chairman who cares, wants to get this right, I trust, to carry that oversight out. The problem is, administrations come and go; secretaries comes and go; Members of Congress come and go. That is why we do statutory requirements on spending. That is why this is now discretionary spending. That is why there are caps in place that cannot be violated, and decisions will be made where that is going to come from. Also, a shortage of 33,000 health providers in the VA and a $10 billion backlog to fix needed facilities that have ‘‘D’’ or ‘‘F’’ life conditions, that we should be doing more to address that internal care. I agree. These reforms are needed. I agree that these programs were debated in a logical, a fair, and open manner. We got much of what needed to be done in this. We got much of what is good. The chairman took this process—exactly what should be expected of us. My responsibility, as the final time that I will stand here to talk about how we fund Choice and how we get going for longterm sustainability, is to ask us to just put in—and we had a couple of amendments that could do this—ask us with some capacity to be able to fix that cap piece in this and look for that longterm sustainability. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SAMJOHNSON ), one of my personal heroes. One of the greatest privileges I have had in the 91⁄2years I have served in this U.S. Congress is to serve with SAMJOHNSON . Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman ROEfor his strong support of our veterans and for the incredible honor he does Senators Akaka, MCCAIN, and myself with the bipartisan bill before us. I am truly humbled by this gesture, and I am sure it also means a lot to my buddy JOHN, his family, and Senator Akaka’s family as well. Both of these men served during wartime. Many folks know that JOHN and I were POWs at Hanoi Hilton, and I will always admire his courage in rejecting the North Vietnamese offer to go home early. They, of course, did this in an effort to break the spirit of other POWs. No one but another POW knows the strength and heartbreak it takes to deny yourself the hope of home when your future and life are uncertain. I say this as a fellow POW who spent nearly 7 years in that hellhole Earth. Mr. Speaker, I served 29 years in the United States Air Force and fought in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, so I understand the sacrifices our servicemembers make to protect the freedom of every American. It is only right that in return for their faithful service, our veterans get the quality healthcare they need and deserve when they return home. That is why one of my proudest accomplishments is the establishment of a VA communitybased outpatient clinic in my hometown of Plano, Texas. This facility was much needed in our community, and I am proud to report it is expanding services for our veterans all the time. But as important as a VA facility is, they are not always convenient for our veterans to visit. To address the fact that some veterans live far from VA facilities or face longer wait times to see doctors, Congress created the Choice Program. Today’s bill makes the Choice Program even better by bringing it fully into the VA health system. That means all veterans actively enrolled in the VA can go to a doctor in their community. You know that is the right thing to do in the spirit, and I think this bill is something we should all support. Politics aside, may we all be mindful that our veterans have answered the call to duty. They put their lives on the line on our behalf, and their families serve alongside them as well. At the very at least, they deserve to be treated with respect and appreciation for their service and their sacrifice. To all our veterans: God bless you and God bless America. I salute you. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for bringing inspiration to everybody in this body and across the country. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), the vice ranking member of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member WALZfor yielding me 
the time and his steadfast leadership on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. He has been tireless in his support of veterans and their families. I am, likewise, inspired by the gentleman from Texas’ service to our country. I thank him for his service. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is the culmination of years of ongoing discussion about how to guarantee veterans have timely access to quality care. It streamlines existing programs that allow veterans to get care in the community, creates a process for aligning VA facilities to meet the changing needs of the veteran population, and it expands the Caregiver Support Program to all veterans. b1615 It should come as no surprise that I have serious concerns with this bill. I voted against it when it was reported out of committee to signal that it is not a perfect bill and that there are still improvements to be made. One of my biggest concerns has to do with funding. In that regard, I share the concern of the ranking member. While previous funding for Choice came from emergency mandatory funding, moving forward, the program will receive discretionary funding and could break the budget caps that trigger sequestration. That is why I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee last night that guaranteed that moving community care funding to the discretionary side wouldn’t count against the bipartisan budget caps we agreed to just a few short months ago. It would help guarantee that we continue to keep our promises to veterans by funding the full range of supports and benefits that they are owed. Unfortunately, that amendment was not made in order for us to consider on the floor today. Without this critical amendment, I am concerned we will be facing difficult choices, and I fear that veterans will ultimately pay the price, and I mean that in a literal sense. I have concerns about the process that brought us here today. I think this bill needs a greater emphasis on building the VA’s capacity, its internal capacity, to provide veterans the specialized care that many of them need. We need to do more to recruit and retain the best providers to care for our veterans. I wish that there were more guardrails in place as we begin asset realignment, and I wish that we had a strong VA leadership in place before moving forward with sweeping reforms. But, at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, I realize we can’t keep doing emergency patches to fund community care. We can’t continue to look veterans in the eye when we don’t offer caregiver support services just because they served in an era before 9/11. That is why I will reluctantly vote in favor of this bill today. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from California. Mr. TAKANO. I will reluctantly vote for this bill today. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, just for clarification, we have been under cap since 2011. The VA budget has grown exponentially since then. We have always done the right thing for our Nation’s heroes and will continue to do that. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ), my good friend. He served until he recently moved to a different committee, as chairman of the Health Subcommittee. He has been an active member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and has been a very valued member. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to follow SAMJOHNSON here at this podium. I have been in Congress 6 years, and to think that he spent 7 years incarcerated as a POW. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the VA MISSION Act. This legislation is about keeping our promises to those who safeguard our freedoms. As a member of the Army Reserve and a doctor in the Army, I am all too familiar with the challenges plaguing the VA today. In 2014, America witnessed the heartbreaking results of hidden VA wait lists, and Congress quickly responded with the Veterans Choice Program to ensure that no veteran was kept from care. Now, with the leadership of Chairman ROE, we are delivering a lasting solution to get our deserving veterans the care that they have earned and enacting real reforms for the VA to succeed in the 21st century. This bill will improve and streamline the VA’s community care programs, those outside the walls of the VA, into one cohesive program and give a patient and their doctor more say in the process. This will create a nonpartisan, transparent process to review the VA’s infrastructure assets, in line with the recommendation from the Commission on Care. This bill will expand the VA’s post9/ 11 caregiver program to all eras of veterans. The VA MISSION Act also includes my legislation, the VA Provider Equity Act, which aims to enhance the ability of the VA to recruit and retain indemand surgical specialists, due, in part, to increased use of IEDs in the last decade of war. Mr. Speaker, if we don’t act by May 31, 2018, the funding for the Veterans Choice Program will run out, and veterans across America will be unable to access healthcare. Finally, I want to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude for the tireless work of the entire VA Committee staff, and specifically Christine Hill and Samantha Gonzalez, for the countless hours that they have put in to getting this across the finish line. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor the John McCain, Daniel Akaka, and Samuel Johnson VA MISSION Act, named in honor of three American veteran heroes, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ), my good friend, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health. Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding, and I thank him, also, for his leadership on the committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the VA MISSION Act because it makes significant improvements to the VA that our Nation’s veterans have long been asking for, which will help deliver better care to the 9 million veterans enrolled in the VA. While I recognize that this bill is not a perfect one, my mission and the Veterans’ Affairs Committee’s mission has always been to provide better access to highquality care for our Nation’s veterans, and this bill advances that goal in a few very important ways. First, the VA MISSION Act consolidates the various community care programs, which will make it easier for veterans to use and for providers to participate in. The bill also expands the caregiver program, which is critical for improving outcomes and quality of life for our veterans. This has been a key priority for our Nation’s veterans service organizations for years. Community nursing homes are five times more expensive than the average cost of the caregiver program. Expanding the caregiver program will save the VA and taxpayers money in the long run, all the while allowing veterans to receive quality care and better care at home from the people they trust the most. The bill also makes important improvements to community care eligibility, which are more closely aligned with the veterans’ needs rather than the arbitrary criteria currently in place. Finally, I am planning to vote ‘‘yes’’ because time is of the essence. As you may know, the acting VA Secretary recently informed Congress that the Choice account will run out of funds by the beginning of June, meaning tens of thousands of veterans could lose access to community care in a few short weeks. The VA MISSION Act will ensure that this does not happen, which is another reason why the legislation is supported by 39 veterans service organizations. With that said, I fully recognize that the bill’s approach to realigning facilities, in my opinion, is flawed. I also share the ranking member’s concerns about the budget caps. Reimposing the sequester would be devastating for the VA and for other Federal discretionary programs. This is a real issue that must be addressed. Since I have been in Congress, we have raised budget caps three times in 
a bipartisan manner. We can and we must do so again in order to avoid devastating cuts to programs our constituents depend on. As the ranking member noted, during the committee markup, Democrats tried to fix this issue, but his amendment was voted down. Today, our new colleague from Pennsylvania also has offered legislation to address this issue, which I supported, but the House did not adopt it. While I am disappointed that the budget cap issue has not yet been fully addressed, I plan to vote for the VA MISSION Act today. It is past that time. Congress must take action to consolidate the community care programs and to expand the caregiver program. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to also support the bill. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ), the vice chair of the committee and a tireless worker on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, what an honor it is, an honor and a privilege, to serve with Mr. SAMJOHNSON , a true American hero. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2372, the VA MISSION Act, which will provide significant reforms and improvements to the Veterans Choice Program. Since its implementation, the Veterans Choice Program has served over 1.7 million unique veterans seeking timely and highquality healthcare for their physical and invisible wounds. Although progress has been made, there is more work to be done to ensure we balance resources from community care and the VA healthcare system. The VA MISSION Act will streamline and consolidate the Veterans Choice Program with the other duplicative VA community care programs to create one new cohesive Veterans Community Care Program. This new program allows eligible veterans to seek care from nonVA providers in the community if the VA is not providing the quality care the veterans deserve, and timely care. It also requires access to community providers if the veteran and doctor believe it is in the veteran’s best medical interest to seek such care. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROE, who did an outstanding job with this bill, for his hard work on this bicameral, bipartisan piece of legislation, which is the result of a long negotiation process, where both sides of the aisle put aside differences and compromised to strike a balance between each stakeholder. This is how Congress should work. I am proud of the work that we have done on this committee. I want to thank the staff, as well. The committee ensured that we have a great work product for our true American heroes. Again, I want to thank the sponsors of the bill. Mr. Speaker, let’s have a great vote for our true American heroes. Let’s pass this VA MISSION Act and get it to the Senate as soon as possible. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, could I inquire how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Minnesota has 151⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Tennessee has 10
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ), my good friend, the ranking member of the Subcommittee of Oversight and Investigations. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak as a cosponsor of the VA MISSION Act. I appreciate the work of Chairman ROEand Ranking Member WALZin putting this bill together. This bill is almost unanimously supported by the veterans service organization community. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation because it will enact needed reforms to the Veterans Choice Program and finally extend benefits to family caregivers for veterans of all eras. I am pleased that the committee retained provisions that Senator SULLIVAN of Alaska and I fought for that would recognize the unique access issues for States that lack a fullservice VA hospital. While I will continue to fight for improved and expanded facilities at our Manchester, New Hampshire, VA Medical Center, it is important to recognize that we have unique challenges in New Hampshire where we do not have a fullservice hospital. I also want to speak to this: the provisions that expand the caregiver benefits provided to post9/11 veterans to veterans of all eras are necessary and long overdue. I have heard repeatedly from Granite State veterans of eras prior to the global war on terror that the differences and benefits are simply unfair. The way these benefits are currently structured essentially pits veterans against veterans. That is unacceptable. I thank Chairman ROEfor working with us on finding a way forward for family caregiver benefits. I am sure thousands of Granite State veterans will agree. While this bill embodies the kind of bipartisanship for which our committee is well known, it is not perfect. As the ranking member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I believe it is important to acknowledge parts of the bill that will need continued oversight. I remain committed to ensuring that the VA follows through in a manner that befits the veterans they serve. Number one, the asset infrastructure review portion of the bill is promising, but I have concerns that it will be insufficient to accomplish its goals. The VA is in desperate need of improved facilities and a realignment of facilities to better serve veterans’ needs. In my own State of New Hampshire, the veterans of the North Country must rely on the Veterans Choice Program, rather than have ease of access to services they would prefer. I am encouraged by the continued work to improve our existing facilities, but Granite State veterans need more, and I hope this bill will further empower the VA to expand services in Manchester and across our State. Recent experiences has shown that the VA’s ability to accurately assess the needs of the veterans’ population is in doubt. I remain committed to ensuring that the VA can paint an accurate picture of veterans’ needs, especially veterans living in rural America. Too often, our veterans in rural America have seen promised infrastructure expansion stripped away from them. I urge the veterans service organizations community to continue to work with us to keep the VA honest. b1630 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to welcome Ms. KUSTER back. She has been out for a little bit due to some work, and I am glad to see her back on the floor. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), my good friend and a very active member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, this is a great day, a great week for America. Here we are celebrating not only our great veterans, who have given us our freedom and our way of life, but also our great police officers, who stand between ourselves and a more chaotic environment. We are grateful for everybody that steps up, not only our men and women in uniform who have represented us, but also our men and women in blue. Mr. Speaker, I represent the Second Congressional District of the great State of Maine. This is the largest geographic district east of the Mississippi River. We have an 8hour drive if you go from Fryeburg to Van Buren over beautiful country roads, all kinds of critters in the roads, including moose, so you have got to be careful when you are driving, but let me tell you, we also have 125,000 veterans in the State of Maine, more than half of which, Mr. Speaker, are in the Second District. We love our veterans in the State of Maine. We absolutely love our veterans. We honor them, but we only have, Mr. Speaker, one veterans hospital in the State of Maine. It is in Togus, the first VA Hospital in America to take care of our veterans coming back from the Civil War. But, you know, if you live in Frenchville, Maine, or you live in Van Buren, you might have a 3, 4, or 5hour drive to Togus at 2 o’clock in the morning when the snow is blowing sideways in February. We need to make sure we give folks an opportunity—who served our country—to get healthcare closer to them. It just makes sense. Now, a lot of people, Mr. Speaker, say, ‘‘Well, we don’t want to privatize the VA.’’ Neither do I, and nobody wants to, but it makes sense to make sure we augment what they can do so our veterans can get healthcare closer 
to home, and that is exactly what this program does. Now, one thing I have to mention to you, Mr. Speaker, is that some of our rural hospitals who have contracted with the VA and provided great services to our veterans have not been getting paid on time. This is a real problem when you have got a small hospital that might not have bills paid for 1 to 2 years. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, we need to make sure all of our rural hospitals in the State of Maine and throughout the country get paid, and this bill says if they are not paid within 30 days, then interest starts accruing on that. This is a great win for our veterans, for our small community hospitals that need to stay open for everybody, and for this country. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ), my good friend and a member of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, who also served a very long time in the California Senate serving veterans there. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2372, the VA MISSION Act. Mr. Speaker, I support the VA MISSION Act because it will improve access to timely care for all our veterans through consolidation and reform of the various care and community programs and through expansion of the caregiver program. Like my colleague from Maine said, in California, we are the proud home to the largest number of veterans in the United States, and we want more of them in California. Let me say that I know there may be some issues with this legislation, but at the end of the day, I have got to ask myself, is this about Wall Street or is this about the beltway? No. This is about Main Street, Main Street Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange County, California. This VA MISSION Act is supported by 38 veteran and military service groups, including The American Legion. One of my constituents, Ken George, the District 29 Commander of the Department of California American Legion, represents more than 8,000 American Legion members in Orange County, he called me and he said: If Congress wants to help veterans and caregivers, there is no better way than to support this legislation. As Ken said, the bill will help veterans and caregivers through expansion of benefits available to our caregivers of veterans of all eras. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation. Yes, there are some issues there, but at the end of the day, if you listen to our veterans, our friends, and neighbors, the folks we represent, this is an ‘‘aye’’ vote. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN), my good friend, a U.S. Army veteran, and an active member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the VA MISSION Act of 2018. This important legislation secures veterans’ ability to access quality healthcare and ensures that we are fulfilling our promise to care for them following their service to our Nation. It builds on the success of the Choice Program by streamlining community care programs so a veteran can access care from a provider outside of the VA when they need to. It also expands caregiver benefits for seriously injured pre9/11 veterans and for their families. The VA MISSION Act includes two healthcare initiatives from legislation that I have introduced that protects our veterans receiving organ transplants and also helps with the opioid crisis. Currently, there are only 13 facilities in the Nation where a veteran may receive a transplant in the VA healthcare system, and none of these facilities performs all types of transplants. Timely organ transplants are often the difference between life and death. The transplant language from my bill included in the VA MISSION Act eliminates the roadblocks that veterans face and increases the access to care for our veterans, the care that they have earned by their service to our Nation. We are also fighting the opioid epidemic among veterans. My legislative initiative increases transparency in opioid prescribing at the VA by allowing doctors to identify high users of controlled drugs who are therefore at risk for addiction. My language in the VA MISSION Act instructs the VA to do what most private doctors already do: connect to the prescription drug monitoring databases nationwide so that no one slips through the cracks. Mr. Speaker, we are standing up and fighting for those who fought for our freedoms. As a surgeon and a veteran, I believe the VA MISSION Act is good medicine and good public policy. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY), my good friend, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the VA MISSION Act of 2018. I am proud to support the VA MISSION Act of 2018, especially because of its important expansion of support for family caregivers of veterans of all service eras. Since my first days in Congress, I have heard from veterans and their caregivers about the important support provided through the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. Family caregivers provide loving and essential care at home for our injured veterans, from bathing and dressing, housework and transportation, to administering physical and medical therapies. Caregivers are true partners in the delivery of healthcare to our veterans, and it is important that we recognize their tremendous service and their worth. In 2010, Congress wisely stepped up to offer the family caregivers of veterans support in performing these vital tasks, but the program was only made available to the family caregivers of post9/11 veterans. Clearly, those who served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, and their families are deserving of the same respect and support. That is why, since being elected to Congress, I have authored legislation in every session to expand this assistance for family caregivers to pre9/11 veterans. Today, this Congress has the opportunity to honor and support veterans of all service eras by voting for this excellent bill. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman RYANCOSTELLO for leading with me on these important caregiver issues. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their hard work on including this vital provision in the VA MISSION Act. Mr. Speaker, it is time that we treat our injured veterans of all eras equally by expanding the VA caregivers program to all injured veterans. I do want to note that I share the ranking member’s concerns with the longterm sustainability of this program. Congress will have to work closely with the VA as this expanded community care program is implemented to ensure that this program is sustainable without cuts to other veterans or other important domestic programs. The bill we are considering today will ensure that our veterans are getting the care they need when they need it, but in addition to timely care, we must ensure that veterans have access to quality care. As we send veterans outside the VA system to private medical providers, we need to ensure that these doctors and other healthcare professionals are capable of delivering the quality care that each and every one of our veterans deserves. So, while I applaud the expansion of care in this bill, I am concerned about the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse as VA begins to send many more veterans outside the VA system to private medical providers. That is why it is vital that Congress remain engaged with the implementation of this program to make sure that our veterans are receiving highquality healthcare from qualified providers and that we in Congress are being careful stewards of the taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for their leadership. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to serve on this committee with such extraordinary public servants who share a commitment to serving those who have been willing to put their lives on the line to defend our freedom. It has been a pleasure and an honor serving with them. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate everyone on their hard work in bringing this bill, admittedly not perfect but very important, forward for our consideration, and I urge my colleagues to adopt it when we have the opportunity to vote later today. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ), a very active member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this opportunity, and I thank Ranking Member WALZfor such bipartisan support and work on this bill. I am very proud to serve on this committee because of the kind of work that goes on here under the leadership of Chairman ROE. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this bill. I can tell you, since coming to Congress, I have had the distinct honor of serving with Dr. ROE, our chairman, and colleagues on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and during this time, we on the committee have heard from veterans services organizations, from the Veterans Administration, and from veterans themselves about the challenges in the VA healthcare system. We have learned about the barriers to timely care, the troubling provider shortage, also the lack of prompt payment to our community providers, and so many other issues. I am proud to say that I believe this is, in the words of 38 VSOs who wrote in strong support of this legislation, truly a ‘‘historic opportunity to improve the lives of veterans, their families, and their caregivers.’’ That is one reason I am very proud to be on this committee. I think this is a historic move. It is our duty as legislators and as Americans to ensure that our veterans receive the best care possible. This bill accomplishes that by streamlining community care programs; improving access to timely care; funding the Choice Program; and, until this new program can be implemented, creating a fair access review process, greatly expanding the VA caregiver program, and improving VA’s own inhouse capacity. One item that I would like to thank the leaders in both Chambers for, but especially Dr. ROEand his staff and the White House, is including in this language on provider recruitment and retention within the VA, sections 301, 303, and 304 of this bill, which is language that I had asked to have placed in there. These provisions expand the tools the VA can use to recruit and retain quality providers by requiring the use of scholarships and improving and expanding the loan repayment system that targets newly graduated medical students. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ), a lieutenant general and an incredibly valued member of our committee. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his tireless effort, along with the committee staff, to highlight that the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee is truly how a congressional committee is supposed to operate: together. b1645 The name of the act is the VA MISSION Act. Any member of the military understands that mission accomplishment is always first, and with this VA MISSION Act of 2018, what you are going to see is some extremely important elements in accomplishing that longterm mission of providing results for the veterans. The community care improvement consolidates seven duplicative community care programs into one cohesive program. It removes arbitrary onesize fitsall parameters in the Choice Program. Previously, the Choice Program limited accessing care to convenient and affordable. It wasn’t good enough. The VA MISSION Act provides Choice funding shortfalls, ensuring that the 1year funding bridge is complete so that the veterans have a continuity of care during the implementation of the new program. It also provides for the Asset and Infrastructure Review. This transforms the VA from relying on outdated inpatient facilities to more modern facilities meant for outpatient care of the future that includes delivery through telehealth, through different and unique circumstances that our veterans expect and deserve today. The VA is one of the Federal Government’s largest property holders and needs to make sure that its resources aren’t wasted keeping lights on in unused buildings. Those limited resources need to be focused on the veterans. And finally, the caregiver expansion, this VA MISSION Act expands caregiver support to both pre and post9/11 veterans. That is essential and long overdue. When you reform the VA and allow for greater veteran choices but do not—and I repeat, do not—privatize, this is making the VA the best it needs to be going forward in support of our veterans. Mr. Speaker, I again thank the chairman for his efforts. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, again, to the chairman, I am not writing his eulogy here, but I would say that is a pretty impressive resume of accomplishments, going back to the Forever GI Bill, appeals reform, Clay Hunt Suicide, as just a few, and then this piece of legislation. The gentleman’s work and tenacity for veterans, Mr. Speaker, is second to none. His dignity and respect for all Members of this House in the process is legendary. And for giving this space today for us to talk about and debate on this floor our shared values, compromise disagreements, but always with the goal that we are in this together, that is created by an atmosphere of leadership. It is created by an atmosphere of respecting our democratic process. It is understanding that this is not about gotcha, who is this and who is that. It is about looking at what is possible. So I congratulate the gentleman for putting together a piece of legislation that serves so many veterans. It has the support of so many folks, and allowing me on this last opportunity to express those longterm concerns to make sure we don’t undermine that, I am forever grateful for that. I appreciate the comments and the gentleman from Michigan talking about the capacity inside the VA, too. We have got incredible providers there serving veterans every day, and many of them veterans themselves. I know his commitment to making sure they have the resources necessary to do their job. It is a priority. I think the concern that I am showing on the budget gap is just to make sure that we don’t pick one over the other or where veterans care is. And, as I said, again, if it were left on the shoulders of the chairman to ensure that would happen, I would sleep well at night. I just worry that when we don’t codify these things, when we have the uncertainty in the VA right now, that is where my concern came from, but not from this process, not from an openness, not from a commitment, and not from the gentleman’s willingness to get this thing across the finish line. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone who was involved in this process, beginning with the staff, who have been heavily involved in this. Both the Republican side and Democratic side worked for the last, really, almost 18 months. I want to thank our Senate colleagues on the other side of this Capitol who worked very hard and the hours that went into this. The real winners here are our Nation’s heroes, the veterans. This VA MISSION Act does a community care where veterans can get highquality care both inside the VA and out when the VA can’t do that. We have heard speakers down here from areas that don’t have a VA hospital. They absolutely rely on that. 
I was in Oregon a few months ago and realized that some veterans had to drive 5 hours to a VA facility. They need the community care bill in their community. We provide the funding for that bill to bridge us over until the new Secretary implements that. We have a caregiver. I am a Vietnam era veteran, and I have seen many catastrophically injured Vietnam veterans whose families struggled for decades. 520plus Vietnam veterans are dying every day. It is time we implement this bill and get these needed benefits to those World War II and veterans up to 9/11. We need to rightsize the VA. Healthcare is not provided like it used to be. It has become much more sophisticated and streamlined. And outpatient, the VA needs to get to be able to do that also. That is what the AIR Act is about. We are increasing the internal capacity so we can train and get new clinicians and providers in. The speaker, SAM JOHNSON , who spoke a minute ago, said it all. We should be able to look at that hero, who is a true American hero, and listen to his speech, which brought tears to my eyes, and vote for this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RUTHERFORD ). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. The Speaker pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 891 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1653 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes, with Mr. MITCHELL in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERS on) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, more commonly known as the farm bill. I do so, proudly, because I still believe that rural America and our farm and ranch familles are the backbone of this country. Our farmers and ranchers ensure that Americans across this great country pay the lowest grocery bills in the world. They also hand us a rare trade surplus, while creating 21 million American jobs. In the heartland, agriculture is the lifeblood of the economy. When agriculture does well, Main Street does well; and when agriculture is suffering, so is Main Street. But beyond the economic contributions, rural America and our Nation’s farmers and ranchers are imbued with the values that I cherish deeply: the values of faith, family, God, country, and duty; of neighbor helping neighbor, hard work, and personal responsibility. In short, Mr. Chairman, rural America and our Nation’s farmers and ranchers make America great. I expect that is why the President of the United States strongly supports this farm bill and urges passage. Times are not good right now in the heartland. Our Nation’s farmers and ranchers are struggling in the midst of a 5year recession, with no end in sight. Net farm income has been cut in half over this period of time. As a result, rural America is not partaking in the economic recovery that urban counterparts are experiencing. There are many reasons behind the hard times in farm and ranch country. I will briefly discuss two. In my hometown of Midland, Texas, we have received 1 inch of rain over the last 195 days. Drought is ravaging my State. Last year, we saw record losses due to hurricanes and wildfires. And to the north, in the ranking member’s home State, farmers are struggling to get into the fields to plant, although it is the middle of May. The fact is the men and women who clothe and feed us in a manner that is absolutely unrivaled in world history are the ones hit hardest and first by Mother Nature. A second reason for the current condition is another factor totally beyond the control of our farm and ranch families: the predatory trade practices of foreign countries. For the sake of brevity, I will offer just one example. In just 1 year, China oversubsidized just three crops by more than $1 billion. To put that in perspective, the entire safety net for all of our farmers and ranchers under this farm bill is expected to cost just 64 percent of the amount China spent on illegal subsidies in just 1 year on just three crops. Mr. Chairman, the global market is awash with high and rising foreign subsidies, tariffs, and nontariff trade barriers, and these are hurting American farmers and ranchers. So what do we do about that? We heed the call of the President of the United States and the Secretary of Agriculture to pass this farm bill. No, this farm bill is not a cure for all that ails rural America and our farmers and ranchers, but this farm bill does provide a safety net to see them through the hard times. For my colleagues interested in the budgetary impacts of this farm bill, H.R. 2 keeps faith with taxpayers, with CBO now projecting more than $112 billion in savings, nearly five times what was pledged back in 2014. There are many other aspects of this farm bill, but I will just briefly touch on three. First, Secretary Perdue has shown great leadership on two particular issues that are extremely important to rural America: the opioid epidemic that is ravaging rural America needs an aggressive, effective response, and the lack of broadband in many parts of rural America puts farmers and ranchers in rural communities at a terrible disadvantage. The Secretary is determined to tackle these problems and has asked for the tools he needs to make it happen. This farm bill provides those tools. Second, it is no secret that we do not have a bipartisan farm bill process at this moment, and that I deeply regret. Ultimately, Democrats and Republicans chose to agree to disagree on the question of whether workcapable adults should work or get free job training for 20 hours per week in order to be eligible for SNAP. I respect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but I do want to be clear about something: This farm bill in no way, shape, or form disrespects Americans who depend on SNAP. To the contrary, the farm bill keeps faith with SNAP beneficiaries, providing needed benefits and something more— the dignity that comes with work and the promise of a better life that a job brings. I want these Americans to realize the American Dream. Finally, in closing, I want to note that there is a cottage industry in this town that is determined to defeat this farm bill. They want this House to ignore the realities of Mother Nature and 
the predatory trade practices of foreign countries and turn our back on farm and ranch families struggling to hang on in the face of these hard times. Mr. Chairman, that should not happen on our watch. I urge my colleagues to stand by the hardworking families that put food on our tables and clothes on our backs and still live every day by the values that made this country truly great. Let’s stand up for rural America. Let’s pass this farm bill. I reserve the balance of my time.

b1700 Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. H.R. 2 is not a work product that I am proud of because it is not one that I or my Democratic colleagues had much of a role in producing. More than that though, I am opposed to H.R. 2 today because it is simply not good enough for American farmers, consumers, or rural advocates. H.R. 2 fails our farmers. The bill does not improve the safetynet programs farmers need to manage a troubled farm economy. It fails to make needed increases to reference prices under the PLC program to address the 52 percent drop in national farm income. It neglects repeated requests to increase funding for trade promotion to help strengthen overseas markets in response to this administration’s actions on trade and renewable fuels. H.R. 2 fails our Nation’s hungry. While I agree that there are changes that need to be made in the SNAP program, this is so clearly not the way to do it. The bill cuts more than $23 billion in SNAP benefits and will result in an estimated 2 million Americans being unable to get help that they need. Within the nutrition title, the bill turns around and wastes billions that the majority cut from SNAP benefits to create a massive, untested workforce training bureaucracy. H.R. 2 fails our conservation goals by reducing the Federal funding for our voluntary conservation programs by almost $800 million. It fails our next generation. It lacks mandatory funding for scholarships at 1890 land grants. It underfunds our programs for beginning farmers, and outreach to socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. H.R. 2, also fails our energy independence goals. Aside from eliminating the entire energy title, the bill hobbles renewable energy and energy efficiency efforts in rural communities by eliminating funding for the Rural Energy for America Program. H.R. 2 fails the farmers, rural advocates, and consumers that we are here to represent on all of these fronts. But what is so incredibly frustrating for me is, the failure of this process. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I would simply say for the record that all of the bill was negotiated—except for the SNAP title—in good faith with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Not once did they mention anything on many of these issues that were just brought up, but we did have an agreement on those nonSNAP titles. It was a SNAP title, quite frankly, that caused the rift. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ), my colleague, the chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee so much for yielding, and for his tireless work on this important legislation in order to support rural America and our most vulnerable. Over the past 3 years, the Agriculture Committee has spent countless hours talking with constituents, performing outreach, and holding hearings with stakeholders to see how we can improve upon the 2014 farm bill. Contrary to the claims of some, this legislation was not created in the dead of night or without input from my friends across the aisle. Mr. Chairman, I have before me a letter that was sent to Chairman CONAWAY and Ranking Member P ETERSON  with priorities identified by the Democratic Members that I am proud to serve with on the Agriculture Committee. I am proud to see—under nutrition specifically—all of these, and I believe all of these titles, these priorities were incorporated into the farm bill. Over this 3year period, we held 21 hearings and heard from 81 witnesses at the Nutrition Subcommittee alone. Members of the Agriculture Committee traveled to every corner of the country to participate in listening sessions and obtain vital input from our farmers, our ranchers, and our growers. As the farm bill was in development at the committee, every Member had the opportunity to provide input and that input was considered during this process. Yet, even with an open process, no amendments were offered during the committee markup by my 
friends across the aisle. That is an opportunity for refinement, as is being on the House floor an opportunity for refinement. From voluntary insurance programs, to conservation in rural development programs, to agriculture research, H.R. 2 contains critical supports for our Nation’s farmers, ranchers, and rural America. On the farm side, I am especially pleased with the continued reforms to the Margin Protection Program for Dairy, as well as the forestry provisions in title VIII. Now, while I could go on about all of these good policies contained in H.R. 2, this legislation ultimately is about supporting American food—both on the farm, and on the consumer side. Food is a national security issue. And whether we realize it or not, every American shakes hands with a farmer at least three times a day. As chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I am proud that we maintain nutrition assistance for our most vulnerable through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Approximately 65 percent of these dollars directly provide food to children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities who rely on benefits of SNAP when times get tough. H.R. 2 also does make historic changes to SNAP by providing new job opportunities for workcapable adults. This bill does this by reinvesting significant dollars within our budget into education and training programs. By providing the States the increased resources to do this, every workcapable SNAP recipient will be guaranteed a slot in a jobtraining program, leading to ultimate food security. By doing this, we can help folks elect a pathway to longterm employment, selfsufficiency, and a way out of poverty. Mr. Chair, I ask that Members support H.R. 2. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT). Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, let me make it very clear at the very beginning, that this is a racist farm bill. Make no mistake about it. The good Lord said: Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. And the truth is that this is, unfortunately, a racist farm bill. Let me tell you why. After the Civil War when the South was utterly destroyed, they established landgrant colleges, and then 30 years later, because there was so much struggle without adequate freedom for my people—African Americans—they established the 1890 landgrant colleges because they had Plessy v. Ferguson, the separate but equal doctrine. Yeah, they were separated already, but never equal. These 1890 colleges have never gotten the financial support that they have needed to even come close to the White 1860s that were there. And so we tried to make amends in this farm bill to come up with a very noble idea. With the shortage of younger people not going into agriculture, not going into science and technology and research to feed the future, we established scholarships to go to the 1890s. But you know what? When they took our bill, put it into the farm bill, they took the money out—just like they did back in the 1890s. Black people in this country have suffered too long, and we need to put a stop to it. I am here. I know that this House will not put the money back in. It was just $1 million a year for each of the 5 years to try to get people in. And these land grants knew. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Every Black man does not necessarily want to play football or basketball. They want to feed the future. This is a terrible bill. The CHAIR. The gentleman is no longer recognized. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. * * * The CHAIR. The gentleman is no longer recognized. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. * * * Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize the fact that this brandspankingnew program that never had any funding is authorized in the bill for discretionary spending to create the scholarship program that has just been referenced. There was no money taken out of the bill, because there was never any money in the program. We simply recognized the need and we set that program up in place as a direct result of the gentleman’s passionate plea for a scholarship program. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King). Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the yielding and the work that has been put in to get this farm bill together. First thing that I am happy about, it has the protect interstate commerce language in it, which passed in committee by simply a voice vote. It is wellestablished. It protects and preserves the commerce clause. We can’t have States regulating interstate commerce. That violates the commerce clause. This restores it. That is item number one. Item number two, in title I, we have in the bill that we protect the PLC program. We improve and protect the ARC program, and we protect the crop insurance. All of that keeps our families on the farm, and if we don’t have that, market fluctuations take them off. We have also increased funding for the MAP program, Market Access Program, and for the Foreign Market Development Program. We have got another FMD program too, and that is the vaccine bank that is in this bill. Putting work into the SNAP program is an important component. All work has dignity. All work has honor. It is a good start for what we need to do to get a lot better turnout of what goes on with our welfare programs. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for putting this bill together here on this floor today. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. FUDGE ). Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman so very much for the fight he put up during this process. Mr. Chair, I stand today with my Democratic colleagues fighting for the very soul of America. Inscribed on the Statue of Liberty are these words: 
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempesttossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door. 
We have lost our way, Mr. Chair. There is no longer a lamp, nor a golden door. And if we fail to protect the weak, the frail, the poor, the children, the seniors, and the disabled, we have lost our soul. We no longer live up to the promise of America and the true meaning of our creed. Mr. Chair, it is just cruel to American families and food producers, those who rely on farm bill programs, to put them at risk, only to carry out a hateful, demeaning, and meanspirited partisan agenda. It is dishonest to promote the idea that SNAP recipients are undeserving; that we are lazy. Sixtyfive percent of our SNAP recipients cannot work. They are children, seniors, and disabled. And most of the others do work—some of them in the very building in which we stand today. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues: What have poor children ever done to you? What have seniors done to you? What have the disabled ever done to you? Republicans are paying for the $2 trillion debt they created in the tax bill on the backs of the poor. It is just sad, Mr. Chair. Really, really sad. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST). Mr. BOST. Mr. Chairman, I hear from my constituents in southern Illinois that rural America is hurting. That is why we need the farm bill, to address the concerns facing agriculture all over rural America. The farm bill does just that. The farm bill protects the farm safety net, including commodity programs and crop insurance, invests in rural broadband, modernizes FSA loan programs for new and beginning farmers and ranchers, and invests in conservation. President Eisenhower once said: ‘‘Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you’re 1,000 miles from a corn field.’’ Those words hold true today, and that is why this bill was crafted with those farmers in mind, because farmers are everyone’s bread and butter. 
The CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. BOST) assumed the chair. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Lasky, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed a Joint Resolution of the following title in which the concurrence of the House is requested: 
S.J. Res. 52. Joint Resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to ‘‘Restoring Internet Freedom’’. 
AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITION ACT OF 2018 The Committee resumed its sitting. b1715 The CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN  GRISHAM ). Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I came to Congress to solve problems and create economic opportunities for New Mexico, which is still struggling with one of the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the Nation. Now, we had a chance in this farm bill to do just that, and I have worked for years on an array of bipartisan initiatives in this bill, including creating a firstever broadband grant program to increase internet access in rural communities; expediting the adoption of innovative conservation and water management technologies; and finally banning the heinous practice of lunch shaming. Unfortunately, the bill the majority brought to the floor today not only jeopardizes all of that bipartisan work, it also includes provisions that will cause so much pain to so many people in my State. This bill creates new restrictions on SNAP eligibility and a massive unfunded mandate on State bureaucracies which will further destabilize an already broken SNAP system in New Mexico. I have spent years working to hold my State accountable for their mismanagement of SNAP and for illegally denying thousands of individuals their benefits. Under this bill, those mistakes will become much more common. Millions of Americans will be needlessly kicked off SNAP, and more children and families will go hungry. Mr. Chairman, it may be politically expedient to bring this partisan bill to the floor that destroys SNAP as we know it, but passing a partisan bill that will undoubtedly die in the Senate does nothing for the Americans who wait for Congress to do their jobs. This bill is the perfect reflection of what is wrong with Washington: that politics will always take priority over progress. I urge my colleagues to recommit to the bipartisan collaborative work that is desperately needed by farms, ranchers, and vulnerable Americans in every single one of our districts. This is the only way we will pass a farm bill and fulfill our commitment to the constituents we have a duty to serve. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER ). Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, America’s farm families have had to weather a 5year recession with depressed prices resulting in a 52percent drop in net farm income. Twothirds of our farming operations today are in economic trouble, and chapter 12 bankruptcies have risen by 33 percent in just 2 years. So it is no secret that our Nation’s farmers and ranchers are struggling. I hear all this talk during the past month about a free market, how everything would be so much better without farm programs. ‘‘We want a complete, total free market,’’ they say. From an intellectual and philosophical standpoint, I would love that. We all would. But here is the problem: that isn’t the real world. There is no free market when you have countries all around the world subsidizing their agriculture production to the hilt. For example, Communist China agreed to a subsidy limit as part of their accession to the WTO in 2001. But what do they do? They exceed that subsidy limit by $100 billion on just three crops alone in 1 year. That is no free market. Farm programs account for 0.24 percent of the total Federal budget, and in return, every individual and family in this country is guaranteed an abundant, affordable food supply, and the very best nutritious food at an exceptionally affordable price. That is, quite frankly, a huge return on a relatively small investment, not to mention what agriculture means to our rural economies and our trade balance with the rest of the world. American agriculture is more than just being the best producers in the business and feeding the world. It is about food security and national security. Once a farm is gone, it isn’t coming back. It is not like your local hardware store that goes out of business; it is not like that space isn’t going to be replaced by another business; it will. Farms, on the other hand, are replaced by developments taking some of our very best farmland out of production. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from North Carolina an additional 15 seconds. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, we have lost 44 million acres of farmland during the past 30 years. Mr. Chairman, passage of this farm bill is absolutely critical to the livelihood and success of our farm families and food supply. I encourage and hope that every one of us will vote for this bill. This farm bill strengthens the farm safety net while making other vital improvements to current law that will benefit our farm families, rural communities, and animal agriculture sector—such as the establishment of a new U.S. only vaccine bank to prevent FootandMouth disease, authorizing $1.1 billion to provide broadband service to hardertoserve rural areas, and providing the Secretary of Agriculture with tools necessary to help combat the ongoing opioid crises which is hitting rural America especially hard. Additionally, this farm bill makes common sense changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to encourage work and provide for job training. The vast majority of Americans would agree that if you work you should be better off than if you don’t work. Under this bill, we simply ask that those who are of working age and are perfectly capable, work 20 hours a week. And, if one can’t find work we will pay for their job training so that everyone can attain the skills necessary to get the job they want. The unfortunate reality is that we have too many SNAP recipients stuck in the program with no pathway to upward mobility. Why? Because current SNAP requirements are outdated and riddled with loopholes that incentivize the status quo and fail to support those who need it most. In fact, more than 2/ 3 of workcapable adults on SNAP are not currently employed. Today unemployment numbers are at 3.9 percent. In the year 2000, the last time unemployment was this low, there were 17 million people on SNAP. Today, we have more than 41 million people on SNAP yet the unemployment is exactly the same. Mr. Speaker, if that doesn’t illustrate the problem, I don’t know what does. We must do better. This farm bill puts this country on the path to do just that. It makes much needed reforms to ensure that recipients of these benefits— those who are perfectly capable of work— have a pathway to upward mobility, can get good jobs, and ultimately use their Godgiven talents to achieve a rewarding career. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), who is the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. We need to talk about what is really happening with this bill. Just months after giving massive tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest individuals through their tax scam, Republicans are now penalizing the most vulnerable among us by cutting one of the most proven and valuable programs that ensures that kids, seniors, and working Americans don’t go hungry. If my Republican colleagues looked at the facts, they would see that SNAP—or food stamps—actually work. They would see that a worker is more likely to keep a job if they can put food 
on the table and at the same time afford to commute to and from work; that a child is likely to do better in school if they have a full stomach to start the school day with; that calling struggling Americans complacent and lazy doesn’t help America’s poverty crisis, but programs like SNAP do help. If they could see all that, then we wouldn’t be here debating a partisan bill that is bad for families, bad for farmers, and bad for our country. Mr. Chairman, the problem isn’t food stamp recipients. The problem isn’t food stamps. The problem is those who claim they want to help American families, and then do everything in their power to hurt them by passing this partisan bill. I will not vote for it. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), who is a valued member of the committee. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Only two times each decade do we in Congress have the privilege to effect productive, meaningful change for America’s farmers and ranchers—those same citizens who help feed and clothe the entire world. Let us not forget that America’s farmers and ranchers make up only 1 percent of our Nation’s population, yet they make sure that dinner tables across the country have food on them. In fact, one farm feeds 165 people in the U.S. and abroad. As such, U.S. farm policy is now a target due to its own success. Politically driven think tanks and antifarmer groups believe that there is no longer a point to have a farm policy in the United States. They fail to realize that America’s farmers and ranchers do business with foreign competitors who do not share the free market values our country adopted at its founding, placing them at a disadvantage; therefore, we have to properly equip our producers to compete with countries that directly subsidize and own the means of production. It is, indeed, an issue of national security. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Florida an additional 15 seconds. Mr. YOHO. Support this farm bill. Defeat all antifarmer amendments that hurt American farm families only to enrich multinational soda and candy makers for more profits. Let us ensure the farmers and ranchers of this great country continue to plant the seeds and raise the herds that secure our national abundance, high quality, and least costly food prices in the world and support the bill. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. NOLAN ). Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to remind my colleagues of the simple truth that process matters. If the process fails, the outcome fails. That is exactly what has happened with this farm bill. Instead of following regular order, as we have done in the past—and I was there personally to be a part of it and witness it—by taking this kind of legislation up through the subcommittees with open rules, giving all the members an opportunity to offer their amendments and their ideas and consider them and have the opportunity to write this bill through the subcommittees, instead, it has come from behind closed doors for the simple purpose of partisan positioning. In fact, members of the committee weren’t even allowed to see this bill for weeks leading up to the consideration, nor were stakeholders and affected parties given the opportunity to review and express their thoughts. The result is a missed opportunity and an abandonment of a bipartisan, collaborative tradition that has worked so well for the farmers and the consumers in this country. It is a meanspirited, bad bill—the result of a failed process—and it should be defeated. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ). Mr. EMMER. Mr. Chairman, in my home State of Minnesota, agriculture is one of the primary drivers of our economy. Right now, farmers, ranchers, and agricultural workers across the country are looking to Congress for a strong farm bill that improves the farm safety net and brings certainty to producers in uncertain times because life on the farm isn’t what it used to be. Today, farmers are suffering some of the worst rates of suicide in the country. General social isolation, downturn of the markets, low farm income, regulatory strains, and a lack of treatment options all make it hard for farmers to get the help they need. That is why I introduced the STRESS Act to boost resources specifically for farmers’ mental health. With the support of Chairman CONAWAY and the House Agriculture Committee, I am proud to see it included in this year’s farm bill. Our farmers who feed the world are feeling the weight of the world on their shoulders. It is time we get them the help and care they deserve. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS ). Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Chairman, passing a farm bill that delivers a better deal to our growers could have and should have been a bipartisan process. But when Democrats arrived ready to work, the doors were shackled shut. Instead of coming together to help our producers struggling with a downturn in the agricultural economy, this hyperpartisan bill hurts everyone from pasture to plate. It cuts $23 billion from a program that feeds children, seniors, and veterans in addition to eliminating mandatory funding for rural development programs which are proven job creators in rural America. This bill also strips farmers, who are facing tightening market conditions, of crop insurance options. This ‘‘harm’’ bill is another step in the wrong direction for rural America. At a time when farmers are already feeling the pain of President Trump’s impulsive trade war and Secretary Pruitt’s attack on ethanol, I urge my colleagues: abandon this ‘‘harm’’ bill and work together on a farm bill that will strengthen rural America. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time remains on each side. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 143⁄4minutes remaining. The gentleman from Minnesota has 18 minutes remaining. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN ). Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. I have the great honor of representing Georgia’s 12th District where agriculture is the number one industry. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, my colleagues and I have worked diligently to craft a farm bill that works for our farmers and provides them the ability to provide a safe, secure, and economic food supply to this Nation. H.R. 2 improves the current farm safety net structure and offers farmers the choice between PLC and ARC for each covered commodity under title I to combat the downturn in the farm economy. It also makes strides in getting Americans back to work by helping those on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance. I am the son of a farmer. I spent 35 years in the business community creating jobs. The greatest joy of my life is to give folks the dignity and respect they deserve to have a good job. How could we deny folks this opportunity? This bill gives them that opportunity. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ‘‘yes’’ for this important bill. Our farmers and our people need us. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), who is the ranking member of the Education and Workforce Committee. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, there is a lot wrong with this bill, but as ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, I am particularly concerned about its impact on students. SNAP eligibility is tied to eligibility for other vital Federal programs, so the proposed cuts in SNAP eligibility will also cut access to free school meals for 265,000 children. b1730 Research has consistently shown that students struggling with hunger have 
lower grades, are less able to focus, and more likely to miss school. This bill would undermine the ability of hundreds of thousands of students to reach their full potential by cutting SNAP benefits for the family and reducing school benefits for children. In the wake of a $1.5 trillion tax cut for corporations in the top 1 percent, it is a shameful statement of priorities when you try to pay for these tax cuts by reducing food assistance programs for lowincome students. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY). Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my strongest support for H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, commonly known as the farm bill. I am proud to serve Alabama’s Second District, where agriculture is the largest employer, responsible for more than 93,000 jobs and more than $11 billion in economic impact. So, Mr. Chair, I know how critically important it is that Congress deliver agricultural policy that actually works for the farmers throughout Alabama, and our country, and makes their important work easier, not harder. That is why I am proud the new farm bill addresses many of the challenges farmers face every day, including streamlining and reducing burdensome Federal pesticide regulations, creating a program to address our Nation’s feral hog problem, and strengthening the existing crop insurance program. In addition to this, the new farm bill makes several needed improvements to our country’s nutrition assistance program by implementing strict work requirements and closing loopholes that allow for abuses of the system. I am proud that the new farm bill maintains vital nutrition for our most vulnerable Americans when they truly need it, while making a commitment to helping these individuals improve their circumstances. I support the legislation. Mr. Chair, I have always believed that we should incentivize ablebodied Americans to work instead of encourage them to remain dependent on the government, so I’m proud that the new farm bill reflects our conservative principles. I am pleased that this legislation provides a commitment to our nation’s farmers while taking important steps towards reforming our food stamps program. I will continue to advocate for policies that give fair treatment to our Alabama commodities like cotton, peanuts, timber, poultry, soybeans, and catfish. I’m eager to cast my vote in favor of the new farm bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER ). Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2 and to express my profound disappointment in the process that has led us to where we are today. As the first New Hampshire Representative to serve on the Agriculture Committee in decades, I am humbled by the responsibility to fight for New Hampshire’s small family farms. When we last considered the farm bill in 2014, I supported the legislation because, while not perfect, that bill provided longterm certitude to our Nation’s farmers and represented a compromise between Republicans and Democrats. The farm bill has always been a bipartisan piece of legislation, but the bill we vote on this week represents a complete departure from that bipartisan process. Democrats were pushed away from the negotiating table by an extreme ideological agenda that would increase food insecurity for millions of Americans, slash mandatory spending on critical rural development and conservation programs, and lead to 265,000 children losing access to free and reduced school lunch. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge support for H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, also known as the farm bill. Rural America needs our support. Farm income has fallen approximately 50 percent since 2013. That is one of the steepest drops since the Great Depression. The costs of production have steadily declined, while commodity prices have fallen. Unfair trade practices, like the dumping of specialty crops into our markets from Mexico, are hurting our U.S. producers. The digital divide caused by inadequate or a lack of broadband services has held back innovation, job growth, and education in rural America. Crises like the opioid epidemic have stricken rural communities across America, just as it has our cities. Mr. Chairman, the farm bill addresses all of these challenges while also taking the first major step in this Congress toward the President’s vision of meaningful welfare reform. This is our opportunity to provide the needed certainty and support for our farmers and producers, while also providing commonsense reforms that will support the President’s agenda of achieving prosperity in our rural communities. Passing a strong farm bill on time is key to this goal. I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this important piece of legislation and oppose those amendments that will hamper its ability to aid rural America and keep our producers feeding not only America, but the world. This bill provides certainty to one of America’s largest job sectors, while also standing for our conservative principles. Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues join me in support of H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, the farm bill. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ), the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I oppose the farm bill. It would hurt low and middleincome families, take breakfast and lunch from children across this country, and fail hardworking farmers. It also undermines one of the Nation’s most successful and popular conservation laws, the Endangered Species Act, by removing the requirement for EPA to consult with expert wildlife agencies on the impact of pesticides to imperiled wildlife. Pesticides are known to have been the cause of the dramatic decline of many species and a threat to public health. It should not be dispensed with in this legislation. The provisions in this legislation that are antienvironment, antipublic health, antinutrition, and antiworking families are cause for opposition. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD ), the chairman of the General Farm Commodities and Risk Management Subcommittee. Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. Let me start by saying that it is not very often that we talk about agriculture in the context of national security. I believe it is next week we are going to be taking up the NDAA reauthorization. While that is very important to our national security, I think it is equally important to consider how vital our agriculture producers are to our national security. A country that can’t feed itself is a country that is not secure. It is inviting danger and peril. All you have to do is look around the globe and see those nations that are in that situation. Most notably in our hemisphere, Venezuela can’t feed themselves. You can see the turmoil that has ensued as a result. But there are other countries around the world. One of the big ones that we don’t talk about very often and, quite frankly, we should, and that is China can’t feed themselves. They have 1.4 billion people. What we should be doing is taking every effort during this debate to thank farmers across the country for what they do and for the security they provide to this Nation, recognizing that, without them, the nutrition programs that we are fighting over couldn’t exist. Let’s get a little different perspective, if we can, and recognize that, first and foremost, we have got to have the food produced, not only to provide a level of security in this Nation, but to be able to feed the 300 millionplus that call this country home. Second, we have to be about trying to secure that food source and making sure that farmers are in a competitive marketplace that gives them equal opportunities to sell their commodities. Certainly, the nutrition part of this is paramount. But I think most Americans across the country—and I think 
there are polls that bear this out— some 75 percent of Americans say, yes, we probably should encourage folks to work and/or get educated as a component of receiving nutrition benefits. That is all we are saying. We are not trying to compromise anyone’s nutrition or threaten a single calorie. One thing I think we need to clarify, too, is the Agriculture Committee has no jurisdiction over school nutrition programs. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I just remind the gentleman that the nutrition program is permanently authorized. It doesn’t even need to be in this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ). Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the 2018 Republican farm bill. As a member of the House Committee on Agriculture, I have participated in countless hearings about the needs of our Nation’s farmers and families that depend on SNAP to fight hunger. Tragically, this bill doesn’t reflect any of that testimony. It is a shortsighted, partisan bill that will have a detrimental impact on communities like mine. I cannot support it. In my home county of Mecklenburg, North Carolina, more than 55,000 households depend on SNAP to eat every day. This bill would rob them of access to quality nutrition programs. In North Carolina, it is estimated that more than 133,000 people will lose their SNAP benefits if this bill passes, including over 51,000 children. Nationwide, 2 million people would be kicked off the program and an estimated 265,000 children would lose access to free or reduced meals at school. No eating at home. No eating at school. Adding new work requirements through an unfunded, untested mandate will bankrupt States and force more needy people out of the program. Let’s scrap this flawed partisan farm bill and let’s work together in regular order to draft a bill that helps America’s farmers and families who depend on nutrition assistance. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a letter from Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, opposing H.R. 2 because of the detrimental effects and impact that it will have on our children and families there. 
MECKLENBURG COUNTY , Charlotte, North Carolina, April 17, 2018. Congresswoman ALMAADAMS , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN ALMA ADAMS : As you markup of the Farm Bill reauthorization, H.R. 2 this week, I write to you in support of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding, formerly known as Food Stamps, which has historically made up a significant part of this legislation. This vital program offers nutrition assistance to millions of eligible, lowincome individuals and families and provides economic benefits to communities. In total, more than 40 million lowincome people depend upon this program to keep their families fed. The Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2) is the legislative vehicle for reauthorizing and reforming the programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023. The last enacted Farm Bill (PL 113–79) is set to expire on September 30. The proposed reauthorization bill is scheduled for markup with the House Agriculture Committee this Wednesday, April 18. It contains several provisions and budget cuts that are troubling and could detrimentally impact our community. The bill includes provisions that expand work requirements and punish the least fortunate members of our community who are often times unable to find employment. Specifically, the bill makes it mandatory that recipients of SNAP, who are ablebodied adults, ages 18 to 59, are either employed or are participating in staterun employment or jobtraining programs. Participants could be denied benefits for not meeting the new work requirements. The first suspension of benefits would be for 12 months, while a second suspension of benefits would be up to 36 months. Under current law, the SNAP program already has work requirements for ablebodied adults aged 18 to 49. Additionally, the new Farm Bill would include spending cuts, which would make fewer people eligible for benefits and directly harm working poor families. Mecklenburg County has real concern that these proposed changes in H.R. 2 would negatively impact some of our poorest citizens and cause serious difficulties for our community’s most vulnerable populations. Mecklenburg has 55,472 households that rely on SNAP to help provide sustenance. The County also has specific concerns with language in H.R. 2 that reduces spending by $5 billion over 10 years through the ending of a broadbased categorical eligibility that allows states to consider working poor beneficiaries with higher incomes that put them above 130 percent of the federal poverty level. We look forward to working with you on this important effort. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Sincerely, DENAR. D IORIO , Mecklenburg County Manager. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on each side. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 9 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Minnesota has 13
1⁄4 minutes remaining. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ), a member of the committee. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my strong opposition to H.R. 2. Some may call this a farm bill, but for my district, this is a ‘‘harm’’ bill. Unfortunately, this year’s farm bill is deeply flawed. This bill lacks a significant commitment to the needs of rural communities, with no guaranteed funding for the rural development title. It is unclear to me how members of the committee say they understand the need of investment in rural America, but decided to cut $517 million from rural development programs. As we work to help communities build stronger economies, we must ensure that we have a plan in place that lends a helping hand to those who need it. In Arizona, this bill will take food out of the mouths of tens of thousands of children and veterans. It is a sad day in America when we are debating a proposal that would make children go hungry. I hope for a robust debate on how we could promote rural economic development and how to improve the business climate for rural communities and work to address resource concerns by improving conservation programs like EQIP. Sadly, this bill was written in a back room and kept secret until the last possible moment. We owe the American people something better. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, but also for his tremendous leadership on this bill and so many other issues. I rise in strong opposition to this disastrous farm bill. This bill cuts the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by $23 billion, taking food out of the mouths of 2 million Americans. Over 265,000 children will lose benefits. Why in the world do congressional Republicans want more Americans to go hungry? This is immoral and it is wrong. These socalled work requirements won’t help anyone work. They punish struggling families who are not getting enough hours at work or decent wages to help feed their families. Nutrition assistance helps 40 million people put food on the table. More than 80 percent of SNAP households work the year before or after receiving aid. The majority of people receiving SNAP benefits are children, disabled, and seniors. When I was young, I was a single mom raising two little boys. I relied on food stamps to help my family during a very difficult time in my life. It was a bridge over troubled waters. I want families to have this bridge over troubled waters now. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to clarify the RECORD . Of the 265,000 children that have been mentioned a couple of times, 95 percent of them would in fact maintain access to reduced lunch prices because their families make too much money to qualify for the free lunch, but 5 percent of that 265,000 would in fact maintain the free lunch program as it currently exists. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), chairman of the Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research. 
b1745 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I have a district that relies on a strong farm bill. Illinois is a leading producer of soybeans, corn, and swine. Our economy relies on a farm bill that supports agriculture. Although we all eat, I realize there are many districts whose Members may not be as enthusiastic as I am about the farm bill. That is why there is something in this bill for every district. For those concerned about the deficit, I have good news. The last farm bill was the single largest cut in mandatory spending that we made in the entire 113th Congress. We built on these sound policy reforms in this bill. If you are a Member who wants to address the cycle of poverty that too many of our constituents are trapped in, this bill is for you. H.R. 2 reforms the system and invests historic amounts in workforce training. Despite our growing economy, we have 9 million more people on SNAP today than we did at the height of the recession when jobs were scarce and unemployment was in the double digits. This isn’t progress. This isn’t helping to end the cycle of poverty. In my home State of Illinois, 67 percent of workcapable adults on SNAP are without work. A long recession left Americans disheartened, people dropping out of the labor force because they lost their job and, after months and months of searching, couldn’t find another one. H.R. 2 makes investments to give many of those same people hope in finding a job again. Four years ago I was a freshman, and the farm bill was my first opportunity to be part of a conference committee and see firsthand our democracy at work, Democrats and Republicans sparring over policy differences. But at least there was a debate. I am incredibly disappointed by my friends on the other side of the aisle who didn’t offer any amendments in committee. Work requirements are not new. They were done in 1996 by a Republicanled Congress and Democratic President during a similar time of economic growth. When do the politics end and the serious policy discussions begin? Let’s put politics aside, pass this important bill for our farmers, for our taxpayers, and for too many Americans trapped in poverty. Let’s show the American people we can govern together. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the leader of the Democratic Caucus. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I especially thank him for his exceptional leadership over the years to honor the historic collaboration that has always existed in our country between urban and rural America that is in all of our interests that our farm countries succeed, and that is in all of our interests that the American people are not food insecure. So I thank you, Mr. Ranking Member, for your outstanding leadership on behalf of America’s farmers and hungry families. Mr. Chair, this bill is just a mystery to me because we have tried so hard over the years to work in a bipartisan way, to come together to write a farm bill that does honor that historic collaboration—urban, rural—meeting the nutritional needs of the American people, and encouraging the economic growth in farm country. This legislation does not do that, and I have some questions as to why. Some of the questions came to mind last week when I was on a farm in Iowa listening to hardworking men and women talk about their challenges with this farm bill: that it does not bolster or preserve the farmer safety net; that the bill reduces investments in agriculture research, conservation, and rural development; and that it cuts nutrition assistance that so many there, even in farm country, and in our country rely upon. When I was in Iowa, as I said, last week, I had the privilege of meeting a wonderful woman named Julia Slocum. Julia works two jobs. She is a third generation farmer and a parttime librarian. Over the years, she has relied on the lifeline of SNAP to put food on the table during difficult times, a farmer relying on SNAP to put food on the table. I challenge House Republicans to explain to Julia why they are abandoning hardworking people like her, abandoning her twice by gutting the farmer safety net and by cutting SNAP. This bad bill steals food off the tables of children, seniors, students. 1.5 million of our veterans rely on the nutrition provision of this bill. It is not just our veterans. That would be reason alone to be concerned, 1.5 million. But 23,000 of the families of ActiveDuty servicemembers need to have food stamps because they are food insecure—and they are hurt by this legislation—individuals with disabilities, working families, our seniors, students, children. Children. Democrats have always supported work initiatives for those who can work. Let’s be clear: This is not a jobs bill. SNAP returns money to farmers, to our economy, and to the Treasury, creating $1.79 for every $1 in benefits, and supports more than 560,000 jobs across the country, including 50,000 in agriculture. Republicans are contending that they are investing in jobs. They are not investing in jobs. They are creating a bureaucracy and ignoring initiatives already in place to measure what really works in relating food to jobs. And they are wasting billions on new bureaucracies that would take decades to implement and that would increase hunger and poverty across the country. It is no wonder that so many faith based groups across the country view this bill as one that does not reflect the values of America. Again and again, Republicans try to ransack the lifelines of working families to pay for handouts and to enrich the already wealthy. This bill abandons America’s farmers when they are in a tough spot. The farm economy is struggling. As you know, farm prices are plummeting. More and more families are in danger of losing the farm, and that was before the Trump tariffs invited retaliation from China. Yet Republicans are creating a selfinflicted crisis farming communities can’t afford and they can’t control. I challenge House Republicans to explain to farmers and ranchers why they propose a bill that weakens the farmer safety net when we should be protecting family farmers—soybean, corn, wheat, pork, and specialty crop growers—from selfinflicted damage of Trump’s trade brinkmanship. Explain why this bill slashes hundreds of millions from rural development initiatives, cuts small business loan guarantees, and adds new layers of bureaucracy to highspeed broadband grants when we should be investing in selfsufficiency for small towns. Explain, my Republican colleagues, why this bill eliminates funding for on farm energy initiatives and biofuels when we should be embracing the American farmer’s role in making America sustainable and energy independent. Explain, my colleagues, why this bill creates new loopholes for millionaires, multimillionaires, and billionaires to receive farm subsidies when we should be investing in the next generation of farmers and ranchers. For the sake of our children, families, and hardworking Americans such as Julia, for our veterans, for our servicemen and women, Americans with disabilities, we must return to the table and craft a balanced, robust, bipartisan farm bill as we have done in the past and the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Agriculture knows is possible. We must return to the historic, decadeslong bipartisan solution that weds our farmers and our hungry families together. Republicans must put aside politics and honor our responsibilities to 16 million men and women of agriculture and the nearly 41 million Americans who are food insecure. That is why I urge a ‘‘no’’ on this dangerous bill. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. P ANETTA ). Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Chair, as I have told you, it is an absolute honor to serve on the Committee on Agriculture, under the leadership of the chairman as well as the ranking member. There is no doubt about that. But I mainly say that based on the work that this committee does, the work that this committee does to serve those in agriculture and what that 
service can do for the backbone industry of our country. However, as a Representative on this committee and as a Representative of the salad bowl of the world on the central coast of California, my country and, yes, my community expected more out of this farm bill. Look, in my area, with its flourishing specialty crop industry, we wanted more funding for the specialty crop research initiative. Because of our specialty crops, we have a labor shortage because of the people who are needed to pick those crops. Therefore, we needed stronger language in the bill for mechanization to help with our labor issues and to bridge that gap from the Salinas Valley into the Silicon Valley. With our burgeoning organic industry, we needed more funding and less cuts for the Organic Certification Cost Share Program so that we can properly invest in beginning producers. In addition to this, the majority is trying to implement an untested and unproven change to title IV of the SNAP provision. Such a change threatens to remove over a million people from the program and deeply affects the 74,000 people who are recipients of SNAP living and working in my community. We can do better by our farmers. We can do better by the families across our country by getting back to our bipartisan roots. That is how we help our agriculture. That is how we help our country. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ). Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. Included in this great bill are two bills I introduced: the WATER Act and the STRESS Act, which was introduced with other colleagues as well. The WATER Act improves water quality by easing access to the Conservation Innovation Grant program and reducing red tape. Iowans expect and deserve clean water, and this bill will help do that. The STRESS Act will help address the farmer suicide crisis gripping our Nation. By opening the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network, farmers facing tough times can get the help that they need. Our farmers feed, fuel, and sustain the world. It is only right we take steps to help them. I was also pleased—and I thank the chairman—that in the farm bill there are positive steps to address the food waste that is out there in our country. Our country wastes 40 percent of our food supply. As a cofounder of the Food Waste Caucus, I am committed to reducing food waste to combat hunger, as well as are many of my colleagues. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman CONAWAY as well for his leadership by putting in the bill the Food Loss and Waste Reduction Liaison at the USDA so we can take another step to reduce food waste by 50 percent by 2030. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time we have on our side. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 91⁄4minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 5
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT  ROCHESTER ). Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chairman, it is with deep disappointment that I stand in opposition to the partisan farm bill. I joined the House Committee on Agriculture because of its reputation of being bipartisan. I represent an entire State—urban, rural, and suburban. The farm bill is vital. That is why I was so disappointed to see this breakdown. The goal of creating a thriving economy and moving people out of poverty is a goal we all share, and throughout my career I have worked to connect people with jobs. As Delaware’s former secretary of labor and deputy secretary of health and social services, I have overseen both workforce development and economic safety net programs. I believe in work. We believe in work. However, the majority’s proposal would essentially force individuals off SNAP to pay for an unproven, untested, severely underfunded program. What happens if your child gets sick or your car breaks down? Should that mean you and your child go hungry for up to a year if you are sanctioned? What makes this even more troubling is that the 10 pilot programs designed to give us best practices in providing employment and training services to SNAP recipients, one of which is in my home State of Delaware, have not been completed or evaluated and won’t be until at least 2019. Why are we putting the cart before the horse? If the majority is really concerned with getting the policy right, why not wait until we have the evidence and the data to make good use of taxpayer dollars? To understand the impact on Delaware, I traveled across my State and met with farmers, emergency food providers, supermarket owners, and State agencies. But the conversation that surprised me the most was one I had recently with a father. He shared how, years ago, SNAP and public housing allowed him and his wife to raise three healthy daughters. Because of support, he was the first in his family to graduate from high school and college and, ultimately, to move out of poverty. He paid that debt back in multiple ways through service. He went on to become a social worker, a school administrator, and, subsequently, was elected city council president. The value of service was then passed down. One daughter went to work in the White House and is now a professor of social work at Rutgers University. The second daughter became an engineer and worked for the U.S. Army, protecting our troops. And his oldest daughter grew up to be a Congresswoman. That dad is my dad. Colleagues, we still have a chance to go back to the drawing board. The hopes, the dreams, the aspirations of 42 million people are in our hands. Let’s not let them down. b1800 Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS ), the former chairman of the committee. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, it is hard to believe, but almost 5 years ago, COLLIN , MIKE, we were on the floor of this very Chamber when we took up the previous farm bill, a farm bill that was well crafted and well intended. And on that day, if you remember, folks of good principle on both extremes of the perspective together managed to bring the bill down. Now, why do I bring that up? Because I simply want to remind all my colleagues, no farm bill is ever simple. They are all hard. Circumstances change from cycle to cycle, crop to crop, but it is always hard to do a farm bill. So why are we here? Why do we keep going through this process? Because, ultimately, we need to pass a comprehensive piece of legislation that will make sure we have the ability to raise the food and fiber that our neighbors need; that we can sell into the world markets to meet their needs; and, yes, that we provide the ability, through this same piece of legislation, so that our neighbors, who, through tough times, through, most often, circumstances beyond their control, have the ability to access enough of that food to meet their needs. So, yes, we have to have a farm bill. We have to have a farm bill. I would say to all my colleagues, this is a step in the long march to ultimately creating a final document that involves the other body and requires a signature by the Chief Executive of this country. Let’s debate and argue and fight out amendments tonight and tomorrow and the next day. Let’s avoid what happened 5 years ago by doing things that would try to kill the process. Let’s keep the process moving forward. Let’s refine. Let’s perfect. Let’s pass a comprehensive farm bill so the people who feed and clothe us have the ability to do it, so those who need help in receiving the resources they need have the ability to do it. We have no less option: Good faith. Do what you need to do, but let’s get it done. There are people depending on us everywhere and around the world today. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, as I spoke earlier on the drawbacks of H.R. 2, I may not have mentioned, before I reserved, that I am very frustrated by the breakdown in this process that has got us to where we are. 
Now, Mr. L UCAS is right, we do have to have a farm bill, but let’s understand what we need to do that actually is required. Title 1 needs a farm bill. Title 2 needs a farm bill. Other titles need a farm bill because they are only authorized for 5 years. SNAP is permanently authorized. If we didn’t do anything, SNAP would go on like it is. Crop insurance is permanently authorized. If we didn’t do anything, crop insurance would go on just like it is. So the part of the bill that we are worried about are these other parts that will expire on the end of September 30. Now, what happens if we don’t get it done? We go back to permanent law. Some of my constituents think that is a good idea because it goes back to 100 percent of parity. Most people in America probably know what I am talking about when I talk about 100 percent of parity, but a lot of old timers in my district know very much what that is. And, you know, it is $9 corn. They would love to have $9 corn. So the permanent law is not an option. So we need to get something done. But my point is that we don’t need to do some of the things that we are doing in these areas that are not required to do anything because they are permanently authorized. So, as I speak today, you know, I refused to give legitimacy to what has been, in my view, an illegitimate process. The chairman said we tried to work on a bipartisan basis. You know, we didn’t raise any issues at the time because he said he didn’t have any money and we were going along with the system. And that is till we got into the situation where this SNAP stuff came forward, you know, and I told you this was not going to fly in our caucus. And you can see over here the feelings that you have engendered with this proposal, you know, and it is breaking apart what we have had here in this country for a long time. I have been here for four farm bills. I have been here as a member, as a chairman, and as a ranking member. Now, as Frank said, each of these bills has had their share of headaches, and they have all, at the end of the day, though, had more common ground than opposition. And in the end, the Agriculture Committee has always produced a product that we could be proud of because we knew we delivered the best deal possible, given the circumstances that we were dealing with. We have always been able to work together for the mutual benefit of farmers, rural advocates, and consumers. Prior to my time here, Senator Dole and McGovern carried the medal—Hubert Humphrey from my State, George Aiken before that. These weren’t ideologues, but they weren’t pushovers either. Each knew where their party stood. Each also knew the value making sure the length between people who grow the food and the people who buy food and make sure that that link was strong. So let me be as clear as I can be. In my opinion, breaking up that coalition, ruining a partnership that predates all of us is a huge mistake. More than that, the closed and onesided nature of this process that we have been through is something that I have to call out. It does not bode well for farm and food legislation to come. No party can do this alone. It is too big of a job. So, as ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee, I want you to know that I am willing to come back to the table but only when the majority has the ability to sit down and figure this out together. I was told on this SNAP stuff by the chairman that he could not negotiate it—it was nonnegotiable. That is what got us into this problem. So, when we get to the point where we can actually start talking about negotiation, I am willing to come back to the table and try to get back to a bipartisan situation. Folks want to do welfare reform. I was there in 1996. I was part of the deal at that time. It should be done as a comprehensive review of all of the programs, not just the farm bill. I just think it is a huge mistake for us to be trying to tell people that, somehow or another, putting work requirements and these other things into the farm bill is going to overhaul the welfare system. That is just not true. Most people don’t get enough money out of the Food Stamp program to make a difference one way or the other. It is not food stamps that are causing people to be on welfare. It is not food stamps that are causing people not to work, you know, and that is my big objection to this. It is just ideology run amuck, and it is screwing up the process here, and I hope that we don’t do so much damage that we can’t pull this back together at the end of the day and get this done. So I am going to vote against H.R. 2, and I urge all my colleagues to do as well, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I, too, am saddened by the loss of the bipartisan work that we have typically done on this committee. I have bragged about being one of the few bipartisan committees in Congress back home a lot, and it is sad. Just as the ranking member just said, that his side refused to negotiate any changes to SNAP, I simply said: Work requirements—strengthening the work requirements is going to have to be a part of what we do. And that was where we are with respect to that. What I heard over and over and over again on the other side is that the non SNAP portions of the farm bill, while maybe less than they would like to have, are nevertheless essential and vital, and I am looking forward to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle working as diligently as they can to defeat all of those poison pill amendments that will have to be offered over the next several days so that we can maintain that safety net for production in agriculture that they need and deserve without the legislative history of a loss on this floor that is totally unnecessary. So I am hopeful that my colleagues over there will be a part of that. Mr. Chairman, the entire State of California is under a work waiver so that no one in California has to work to be able to stay on food stamps. That doesn’t make any sense to me when you have got an unemployment rate of 4 percent across this country. So something has to change in that regard. What I have heard over and over, not only today but throughout this debate, is folks from the other side, they are full out, full throttle in favor of work requirements, couldn’t be more supportive of work requirements—just not these. Over and over and over, they are full out in favor. We have got a legislative history of all of my colleagues on the other side talking about how important it is for job training, for education, for getting folks the skills and tools they need to be able to have meaningful work—just not these. Got it. My ranking member had a letter from his folks that said not to negotiate on SNAP. I took him at his word on that in regard. It is disappointing that we have reached this point. But we are at that point. We now have a bill before us that does make meaningful reforms to the work requirements under food stamps, that does not touch the working poor. Folks who are willing to work 20 hours a week, no matter how long they are in that circumstance, we are going to be shoulder to shoulder with them to try to get the support they need. We are also trying to create a State based Staterun program in which the Federal taxpayer pays for work that the States can do on job training. There is no better spot to locate that than there because we cannot create a onesizefitsall training program here in the United States House of Representatives. I trust our States to be able to do that. Those States have the capacity. They have the bandwidth to make that happen. Comments to the contrary are really misplaced. So, as we move forward through the rest of the debate, I would encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing all of those poison pill amendments that have been presented that would harm the nonSNAP portion of the farm bill and support the work that we have done so that, as my good colleague from Oklahoma just said, we can continue to move this process forward, understand what the Senate gets done, move to conference, and move a bill to the President’s desk by September 30 so that farmers and ranchers across this country, who we are the most keen to support, have that certainty of what the next 5year support system looks like. 
Right, wrong, or indifferent, they deserve that kind of assurance, that kind of confidence that they will have the farm program to back them up and their bankers are supported in that regard as well. So I am asking my colleagues to support H.R. 2 and fend off those poison pill amendments. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. MITCHELL , Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, tonight, as we have every other week for the last few months, I want to talk about the Mueller investigation and the kinds of results that are being developed by the FBI, by the Department of Justice, on a lot of very serious topics. The main topic is the Russians interfering with our elections, particularly the 2016 election. That kind of interference goes to the heart of our Nation. It goes to the heart of our freedom. It goes to the heart of our independence. It goes to the heart of this country’s sovereignty and to be able to make decisions without interference by nations other than the United States of America, other than us as citizens of the United States of America. I think we need to step back and think about this a little bit, because it is clear now. Just today, the Senate Republican chair of the Intelligence Committee said there is no doubt that Russia undertook an unprecedented effort to interfere with our 2016 elections. He says he looks forward to completing the committee’s inquiry and issuing findings and recommendations to Americans. The vice chairman, Senator WARNER  from Virginia, says: 
After a thorough review, our staff concluded that the intelligence community’s conclusions were accurate and on point. The Russian effort was extensive, sophisticated, and ordered by President Putin himself for the purpose of helping Donald Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton. 
In order to protect our democracy from future threats, we must understand what happened in 2016. So, a year ago, Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to look into this affair and what exactly happened and to bring those to justice who broke our laws, who interfered with our sovereignty and our freedoms. But all along the way, the White House has objected, has tried to describe it as a witch hunt, as a hoax, as nothing but a charade, when, in fact, in this 1year period there have been five guilty pleas and 22 indictments. We kind have got to go back to the beginning, Mr. Speaker. 
A year ago, Democrats were asking the President to turn over his tax returns, which all Presidents have done and which candidates do. The President refused and continues to refuse to this day to turn over his tax returns. So the question is: What is in there to hide? What is the big deal? What is he afraid of us seeing in those tax returns? Today, it came out in the news that the financial disclosure statement shows a payment to Michael Cohen, his attorney, that he said he never made. We have got to get to the bottom of these numbers, to the bottom of this Russian interference. Mr. Mueller and the FBI need to conclude their investigation without any interference, without any obstruction. For all of us as Americans, this applies to the very core of what a democracy is, and that is free, fair, and unimpeded elections. So there are three key questions that we keep asking. We ask our friends on the Republican side, particularly Speaker RYAN and Senate Majority Leader MCCONNELL : Let’s move forward with investigations here in this Congress. Why not? Let’s find out what is really going on. Let’s protect this investigation so that threats by the White House to fire Mr. Mueller, to fire Rod Rosenstein from the Department of Justice—they did fire individuals out of the FBI— let’s let these detectives and these law enforcement officials finish their job. But the questions are: What are they hiding? What are they afraid that people will see? And why not let the detectives and the law enforcement officers finish their job? Let’s play this out and see exactly what the facts are so we all know what happened and how we can stop it from happening again to make sure we have free and fair elections. I have been able to ask these questions and participate in these Special Order hours with several of my friends. One of those who has taken a keen interest in protecting this investigation and making sure that the facts do come to light has been my friend, JARED HUFFMAN from northern California. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ), for some of his thoughts as to where we are, because we have had many, many changes in terms of the lawyers who were representing either the White House or the President personally. They are gone. We have got new lawyers. Former District Attorney and Mayor Giuliani is now involved. Other people. The President’s personal lawyer, Mr. COHEN , is now out and under investigation himself. There seems to be something happening pretty much every day. I would like to get my friend’s thoughts about it. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Colorado is right that the pace of revelations and controversies surrounding this Trump White House and their personal financial and political involvement with Russia, their attempts to interfere with and obstruct justice relating to Mr. Mueller’s investigation, the pace of all that is just dizzy. So, here we are, 1 year into the work of Special Counsel Mueller. I am glad that Congressman PERLMUTTER began his remarks by reminding us of the context of this issue; the fact that what happened in the 2016 Presidential election was a big deal. It was unprecedented. A foreign adversary maliciously interfered in our election with a specific intent to help one candidate and to hurt another. They placed a bet on Donald Trump. They put their thumb on the scale in every way they could to help Donald Trump. Maybe that is why all along he has been reluctant to acknowledge what obviously happened. He doesn’t want to talk about it. He wants to write it all off as a witch hunt and a conspiracy theory. He probably feels a little defensive about that cloud of legitimacy involving Russian interference. Based on what we know so far, there may be an even more sinister explanation for some of his behavior. It may be that he—or, at least a lot of people very close to him—were actively working with the Russians as part of this. That is what the Mueller investigation is looking into and that is what the American people have to find out. We have to know the full extent of exactly what happened, no matter where those facts may lead. The truth is, at this 1year mark in this historic investigation, this historic scandal, there is plenty of reason to worry about what President Trump might do by way of trying to block and stop and interfere with this investigation. It is not just us saying it. You can look at his own word. He has said at various times in recent months: ‘‘At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved.’’ That is obviously a threat, whether that is using his pardon power or beginning to fire people in the Department of Justice, the FBI, or even the Special Counsel himself. He has threatened to reveal conflicts of interest of the Special Counsel. Obviously, this is a favorite tactic of President Trump, trying to intimidate, trying to posture with folks who he perceives as adversaries. He said on another occasion: ‘‘Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy.’’ These are the ravings of someone who is acting very defensively. And I would say as a former attorney—Congressman PERLMUTTER is a former attorney himself—it really speaks to a consciousness of guilt. We would argue that if we were in a court of law and we had evidence of statements such as this repeatedly calling this investigation a witch hunt. On another occasion, he says: ‘‘As I have been saying all along, it is all a big hoax by Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch hunt.’’ On another occasion he said: Why don’t I just fire Mueller? Well, we’ll see what happens. 
Taken together, all of his various statements should be very troubling to anyone who cares about the independence of our law enforcement agencies and about the integrity of this critically important investigation. I am glad to stand with the gentleman tonight and every night that we have had these Special Order hours to continue to make sure that our colleagues here in the House know that we are going to defend this investigation, that we are going to do everything we can to make sure that our law enforcement professionals and Special Counsel Mueller have the chance to fully find the evidence, wherever it may lead, to get the truth out to the American people. We deserve nothing less. I am glad to see our colleague, JOE COURTNEY from Connecticut, joining the conversation. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from northern California, and his points are really well taken. This investigation, rather than just sort of pushing some paper around, we have had other special counsel appointed from time to time and just in this—some of them take years. Whether it was the Contra affair, Watergate, or whatever, it takes years and years. Here, really in 1 year, we have had 13 Russian either agencies or corporations and individuals indicted. We have had at least six or seven Americans indicted in this whole process. Recently, I think within the last few days, or maybe it was even today, Paul Manafort, chairman of the Trump campaign, objected to the indictment that he found himself under. He went to court and said that Mueller had exceeded his authority by bringing the indictment. The judge said: No, that indictment stands. There has been a lot of smoke. We know that there is some fire creating that smoke. We have got to find that. We have got to find precisely what happened. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ), who has joined us and has got some thoughts about this that he will share. Mr. COURTNEY. First of all, I want to thank Congressman PERLMUTTER  and Congressman HUFFMAN who have been, again, diligent in terms of coming to the floor on a regular basis to push back against what is clearly a pretty coordinated, concerted effort to discredit the Mueller investigation. It is really pretty disturbing on many levels, fundamentally because it is an attack on institutions within our country which we all took an oath to uphold and defend. 
The rule of law is, frankly, one of the fundamental pillars of this country in terms of being a free society. When you have folks who, again, are holding public office going beyond just disagreements of opinion regarding actions that all of us as public officials have to be held accountable for, but really to attack the institutions themselves, which is clearly the drumbeat of criticism of the Mueller investigation and where it is headed, is something that really we need to speak out and push back against. Again, the 1year anniversary is, I think, a very important moment to step back and reflect in terms of where this investigation started and where it is today. Again, if you go back a year ago and look at the reaction that greeted this appointment from, again, Republican leaders, Newt Gingrich, Robert Mueller is a superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity. Speaker PAUL RYAN: ‘‘My priority has been to ensure thorough . . . investigations are allowed to follow the facts wherever they may lead. . . . The addition of Robert Mueller as special counsel is consistent with this goal, and I welcome his role at the Department of Justice.’’ b1945 Senator CORYGARDNER : 
I commend the Department of Justice for bringing an independent voice to help clarify this situation. 
The list goes on and on. And again, why not? I mean, Robert Mueller is somebody who has a record of service to this country going back to when he was a marine in Vietnam. He led a rifle platoon, was wounded, received a Purple Heart as well as the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry and two Navy Commendation medals for his military service. He went on, obviously, to become a distinguished legal practitioner. He was appointed by President Bush to be the head of the FBI and did such a great job that, after his 10year term, the U.S. Senate extended his term 2 years by a vote of 100–0. So when you are talking about somebody who has really earned a reputation for being, really, a pretty conservative prosecutor, both in terms of his time as a U.S. attorney and also in terms of his term as head of the FBI, we are dealing with someone who is beyond reproach, frankly. And as was pointed out by Mr. PERLMUTTER , the decision came down at the Washington, D.C., district court by Federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson in a 37page opinion which, again, pushed back very powerfully about the notion that somehow he has strayed from his mission that the Department of Justice gave him. Again, her decision, just in case after case, points out that the indictment of Manafort fell perfectly within the charge that he was given by Assistant U.S. Attorney Rosenstein, which, again, is to investigate other issues that ‘‘may arise from the investigation.’’ Again, in the case of Manafort, we are talking about somebody who was squarely within the intelligence community’s conclusion that the election was basically under attack from Russians. Manafort’s connections to Ukrainian interests, which clearly were sort of on the Russian side of Ukrainian politics, is just an obvious place for the special counsel to pursue. Again, as you point out, the number of indictments, the number of convictions, clearly show that this is not a fishing expedition, it is not a witch hunt. It is a serious prosecution whose everystepoftheway actions have been ratified by the courts and also ratified by the appointing authority, Mr. Rosenstein. It is time for all elected officials to step back and let this process proceed. Again, the forensics on this in terms of just the endorsements to Mr. Mueller’s credibility and experience and knowledge in this area scream out for all of us to respect the rule of law and let this investigation proceed. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding this event on the 1year milestone of the Mueller investigation. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Connecticut has reminded me of something. And I think something that has really infuriated me is the President’s attacks on the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, our chief and top law enforcement agency in this country. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But are they doing their job to the best of their ability to protect Americans, to protect America? Absolutely. And for the President to sort of just continue to chip away and to excoriate the FBI because it is undertaking an investigation that may implicate him in breaking laws of the United States of America, I think, is something that we haven’t seen. This investigation needs to continue to do its work, to talk to witnesses, to determine what has occurred here. The Senate Judiciary today, or within the last day or two, released thousands of pages of testimony and information. One of the places that it talked about was what happened at a meeting—I think it was at the Trump Tower—in June of 2016, so 5 months, 6 months before the election, between a Russian attorney. I think another Russian was there; Paul Manafort, the chairman of the campaign; Jared Kushner, soninlaw of the President; and Donald Trump, Jr., his son. There is a lot of concern about what actually occurred in that particular meeting. There is a lot of material here that is very, very troubling. I know my friend from California has thought about this. He has thoughts about Mr. Giuliani saying that Donald Trump may take the Fifth Amendment, which I think came out of nowhere. But why would he want to take the Fifth Amendment? Again, the question is: What is he hiding? What is he afraid of? Let’s just let law enforcement complete its work. Mr. Speaker, I yield back to the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of thoughts. First of all, that infamous Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016 just stinks to high heaven; the gentleman is absolutely right. Anyone who looks objectively at what we know about that meeting, anyone who is not hosting a show on FOX News, at least, would feel that there is a big, big problem here and we have got to ask some hard questions. Of course, Donald Trump, Jr., initially outright lied about it, said it was about adoption. And then we saw the full text of the email exchange, making it very clear that this was the front end part of a quid pro quo between the Trump operation and the Russians, that this was the offer of assistance, of dirt, of a bombshell on the Clinton campaign. And of course that was greeted with enthusiasm by Trump, Jr., who hastily arranged the meeting, brought in the top brass, said he was very excited about it if it is what he thought it was. And then, when it proved not to reveal that bombshell, he immediately expressed how disappointed he was, and some phone calls ensued. One of those phone calls was from a restricted number, and he claims he didn’t remember exactly who that call was. Well, turns out his dad, our President now, has a restricted number. And that is a knowable fact. If our colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee were serious about this investigation, they would find out who that phone call was to because it is one of the dots that could need to be connected around this very controversial Trump Tower meeting. But they are not interested at all. They didn’t ask those questions. They didn’t even require Trump, Jr., to answer the questions, and they have rushed to shut down their investigation. So that brings me to the other point. We have all talked about the threats to the Mueller investigation from President Trump himself, but there is another threat from within these walls, from our colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee, who have taken this sacred trust of oversight that we have as Members of Congress and, unfortunately, compromised it to the level that they seem to simply be fronting for the President instead of doing a genuine investigation. Unlike their colleagues in the Senate who at least acknowledge the obvious, that Russia was trying to help President Trump in its interference, their report doesn’t even say that. And then they include a gratuitous statement that they find no evidence of collusion, despite everything we have been talking about, everything that is already in 
the public record. We have got a real problem within these walls that also threatens the investigation. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talked about quid pro quo, and the thing that I am worried about, I serve on the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee of the Committee on Financial Services, where we deal a lot with sanctions: sanctions against North Korea, sanctions against Iran, sanctions against China, sanctions against Russia. With Russia having gone into Ukraine, Russia having gone into Crimea, and then Russia having interfered with our elections, a lot of sanctions are out there, but this administration seems to be using kid gloves in applying them. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Yes, I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has just hit on the ‘‘quo.’’ We talked about the ‘‘quid’’: the solicitations from Russia. Through Papadopoulos, even earlier, in April, the spring of 2016, those solicitations were welcomed and embraced by the highest levels of the Trump campaign, possibly even Mr. Trump himself. We need to nail down that phone call and a few other details. But now we are talking about the ‘‘quo’’ part: what would Russia get in return? And we know from undisputed evidence that Mike Flynn was working on sanctions relief even before they took office, during the transition, violating, apparently, the Logan Act as he was doing it. We know that this President and others in his administration have bent over backwards to try to cut Russia breaks on these sanctions. So, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is exactly right to focus on that obvious piece, the ‘‘quo’’ part of this seeming quid pro quo. That is another reason why we have to let this investigation run its course: so that we can find out exactly what happened here. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I know my friend from Connecticut has some other thoughts, so I yield to him. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, real briefly, again, as I mentioned earlier and the two gentlemen have alluded to, we are talking about an effort to discredit the Mueller investigation that I think, really, as all Americans, we really should be concerned about the questions about whether or not our court system is truly fair, whether or not the FBI, the leading law enforcement agency of this country, is corrupt, which is, again, some of the language that has been sort of tossed around by the President’s defenders. The harm that does in terms of really basic institutions in this country is something that I just think you can’t treat as normal political discourse. We are talking about real longlasting harm to the country. Right now there are FBI counterterrorism agents who are hard at work, literally, as we are standing here on this floor, keeping this country safe. They are involved in investigations of mass shootings. You see the FBI jackets when these events happen, and they were in Connecticut when Sandy Hook took place. I would just say, from a personal standpoint, my parents both served in the FBI. My dad was a Gman back in the day, and my mother actually was a clerical worker there. That is how they met, actually. So I guess you could say I was born under the watchful eye of the FBI. But the fact of the matter is that he was somebody who was very proud of his service. Again, it was during World War II. His job was actually tracking fifth columnists in the U.S. who were looking to cause sabotage to critical facilities in the country. Again, there are always, in every organization, instances where there are bad apples. But the fact of the matter is, as an institution, in terms of law enforcement, these agents are out there every single day protecting this country; and to attack not just an individual decision but an institution is, again, the real sort of level that we are watching happen here with the pushback on the Mueller investigation, and it is just totally unacceptable. As I said, on the 1year anniversary, it has proved its credibility, the Mueller team, in terms of concrete, real results. And the courts and, as I said, the Department of Justice have repeatedly reconfirmed and reaffirmed the rationale for the creation of the Mueller investigation and the fact that it is operating totally within the mission and charge that was given. So I think it is important for all of us to continue to raise our voices and defend the rule of law and institutions that are out there to protect our Constitution and our democracy. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, we will wrap up this portion of our Special Orders because I know we have another subject that Ms. PINGREE and Mr. B LUMENAUER and Mr. T ONKO would like to address. Mr. Speaker, the seriousness of this subject can’t be overstated: the impact on elections; the trust in our system of elections; the trust in our law enforcement; the trust in our courts; the trust, which is attacked by this President and too many others, of our institutions of the press, whether it is The Washington Post or The New York Times or somebody investigating. And it goes to trust of this Nation and what we have formed. And when you have got outside influences like Russia sticking their nose in our business and trying to put their thumb on the scale as to who should run this Nation, I can’t think of a higher crime. b2000 And we know the National Security Advisor for Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, indicted; Rick Gates, campaign advisor for the Trump campaign; George Papadopoulos, foreign affairs advisor for Trump campaign; Richard Pinedo; Alexander van der Zwaan—all indicted, sentenced, or at least pled guilty. Indicted still: the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; 13 Russian nationals; and 3 Russian entities. This investigation needs to get to the bottom of all of this. We have got to try to figure out: Is there anything being hidden? Is there anything that we, as Americans, should know about this interference that we don’t know today? And our law enforcement officers, from Robert Mueller to the FBI to the cop on the beat, need to be allowed to finish this investigation. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from California and my friend from Connecticut. I yield to my friend from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ) because she seems to be ready to go here. I don’t know about her two colleagues, the one from New York and the one from Oregon, because they seem to be kind of getting ready but not nearly as ready as my friend, Congresswoman PINGREE . Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Maine. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. PERLMUTTER for yielding, and I thank him for, really, the eloquent conversation he has been having for the last half an hour about the extreme importance of the investigation that is going on and recognizing the fact that this is the 1year anniversary, and obviously, we still have a long ways to go. This is a very critical issue, and we need to continue to support Robert Mueller and the work that he is doing, and I am very grateful for all that is going on. May 17 is not only the first anniversary of that investigation, but it is also the day we started the debate on the farm bill. And for those of you who have been following this, you will see that this week there are going to be amendments and general debate around this particular bill. I have also been joined by a couple of my colleagues from SEEC, the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, because we want to talk specifically tonight about how this farm bill harms the environment and conservation. You are going to hear all kinds of things about the farm bill. Some of the most egregious challenges are within the nutrition title, which takes up about 80 percent of the resources of the farm bill. But it is very important to talk about the role of the environment in this bill. A lot of people don’t think about the farm bill as an environmental bill, but actually, farmland accounts for over 40 percent of our Nation’s land, and what happens to farms and working forests has a huge impact on water quality, on wildlife, on environmental health, and the farm bill contains many provisions, some of which people don’t often know that much about, that are important to conservation programs for farmers. Farmers understand why it is important to care for the land that takes 
care of them. They know that conservation practices ensure that the resource remains sustainable while helping them to save money, preparing for environmental issues like drought and extreme weather. Conservation practices that sequester carbon in the soil, put more organic matter in the soil, have a huge impact on our ability to sequester carbon, which we all know is very important to issues around climate change. I just want to go over a few of the highlights, or you could say the low lights, of this bill when it comes to environmental practices, and then I am happy to share with several others who would like to talk about some of the programs, and we will have a little dialogue about it. One of the things that happens is it eliminates the Conservation Stewardship Program. These are financial incentives for farmers to implement longterm conservation practices that benefit wildlife and natural resources, which also help their bottom line. Elimination of this program is about $1 billion cut for conservation. Also, within the program, they are folding in the Conservation Stewardship Program into another program called EQIP, and these two programs will be worked together. And while maybe that sounds like it is streamlining in Maine, we are worried that they will have far less in resources overall. In Maine, programs have been particularly important to helping what has been a growth in small farms in our State and more resources to our farmers. People have built hoop houses, which extend our season and allow you to grow more in the early season and into the late season, helped with wells, composting facilities, a variety of other things. Now we are going to combine those programs, have less in resources, and farmers will just be fighting for far less dollars. The bill also eliminates a lot of mandatory funding. And one program I wanted to mention was the REAP program, Renewable Energy for America Program. I think many of us really care about renewable resources and allowing our farms and rural businesses to have more energy efficiency, use alternative energy improvements. This helps to reduce their environmental impact, and, again, their costs. It is very difficult to make a good living on a farm, and that has to be factored in as well. In Maine, the REAP program has helped install solar power, helped maple syrup producers reduce energy costs, generated energy from biomass, built more efficient processing systems, built an anaerobic digester, and so much more. So this is also a very critical program that is now going to be changed in the way it is funded, and that means we can’t count on it going into the future. There are a lot of policy riders—and I am hoping my colleagues will talk about a few more of them—that will hurt farmers and the health of rural communities in many ways, and these have no place in the farm bill. One of them that I have heard a lot about from my constituents—and there is a lot of talk about—is the King amendment—the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING)—that would preempt local and State laws, which would preempt many of those laws that impact pesticides and animal welfare. Now, Maine, where we are a very outspoken State, we believe in agriculture, and we care deeply about the environment. We already have 30 communities that have local pesticide laws restricting pesticides. That would be eliminated under this because they would be preempted. We have other laws about crate sizes, breeding crate sizes, puppy mills; any of those kinds of things that regulate animal practices, States would no longer be allowed to do. This is not a good States’ rights issue. It is bad for the issues that we care about, and we should not allow this amendment to pass. There are also a variety of issues that would impact the Endangered Species Act. Now, we are lucky in Maine. Since 1978, when the impacts of DDT had reduced the number of bald eagles to about 20 nesting pairs, once that was eliminated and there was no more DDT, fast forward to today, in the last count, we have 500plus bald eagles in our State. Almost everywhere in our State you can see a bald eagle out there fishing, doing its work. Well, the language in this bill would say that when reviewing pesticides and herbicides, there would no longer be any requirement for the EPA to consult expert wildlife agencies to identify and minimize impact to endangered species. Many of us are deeply worried about the effect on pollinators like bees and butterflies, which are critically important to agriculture. We can’t exist without pollinators, and this is a terrible time to put them in further danger. I will just mention one more and then yield to a couple of my colleagues who are ready to speak. One provision in the farm bill would undermine the National Environmental Policy Act, that is, NEPA. Again, those are critically important reviews that go on in anything that we do. To weaken that would harm our communities, our environment, and our public health. So I have done a little bit of a broad overview, and I could talk about things that frustrate me in this farm bill all night long, but I want to yield to one of my great colleagues from the State of Oregon, someone who represents the other Portland, as we say. I have the first Portland. Mr. Speaker, more importantly, I yield back to my friend from Colorado. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Maine. The farm bill—and agriculture and the environment—is always something she cares a lot about, whether it is conversations about milk or eggs or local control, which is really sort of at the heart of her concern about this bill, that, you know, Maine, and its local governments and the State as a whole, cares about its environment and it cares about its agriculture. And she, as a Representative, makes that clear to the rest of us how important it is to her State. So I thank the gentlewoman from Maine, and I now yield to my friend from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy in allowing us to join in this conversation, and I strongly identify with what the Representative from the other Portland just said. In fact, North Haven, I am reflecting right now that, in 3 short months, during the summer recess, I plan on sitting on a deck looking out at North Haven and enjoying looking for those eagles that have been rescued and are very much in evidence in her beautiful part of the country. She is not just an advocate for the environment and for agriculture; she is a practitioner. And I have had an opportunity to tour her magnificent farm in North Haven that is really a model of sustainability, showing really what valueadded agriculture is, reclaiming the history of that island in terms of the bounty of the land. But that doesn’t happen by accident. It takes commitment and followthrough and, step by step, trying to harness the forces of sound agricultural policies, good environmental stewardship to be able to add value while it protects the environment. So I am looking forward to seeing her handiwork again this summer, and I deeply appreciate her leadership tonight in terms of the environment, what she cares about in terms of nutrition, celebrity chefs. There are a whole range of things, and it underscores why we are here talking about the farm bill. It is the most important legislation that most Americans pay no attention to. It is the most important piece of legislation that, sadly, few in the House of Representatives really drill down and look at what is in it. It will be the most important health bill that this Congress will pass or consider for the remainder of this session. We still subsidize a diet that makes Americans sick, paying too much to the wrong people to grow the wrong food in the wrong places, and it is the most important environmental bill, bar none. If you care about emissions of greenhouse gasses, the agriculture sector plays a role—9 percent, it is claimed statistically. But if you factor in all of the inputs in terms of pesticides and transportation, refrigeration, you will find that it is far greater than that, and these are elements that are within our control. The gentlewoman referenced the conservation programs. It is interesting to me, in reading the guidance that the 
administration has put out about the farm bill and what they tout, they want to promote independence. They don’t want to support dependency. They want to have higher performance standards for projects that they are involved with, yet the farm bill that is being considered now by the Republicans undercuts performance standards. When we eliminate, as the gentlewoman said, the Conservation Reserve Program, only one out of four conservation grants is currently funded. There is not enough money, and they are going to reduce it $1 billion more while eliminating the Conservation Stewardship Program. It is also stunning when there is an opportunity to provide performance standards for conservation. I have offered an amendment before the Rules Committee that would apply conservation standards, that you get conservation funding if you produce results. But that is not the way it works now. The EQIP program, which hands out grants to help farmers improve the environment, you look at the practices that are authorized under this bill, that are funded under this bill, there are six or eight of them that actually hurt the environment. They are not required to enhance their environment. We pay for things like fencing and hog lagoons for big operations that ought to be able to pay their own way, and they take that money that would be available to other farmers and ranchers to be able to fund programs that would actually enhance the environment. I deeply appreciate the gentlewoman’s leadership, and I appreciate what my friend from Colorado has offered up. We have other colleagues here who have some things to say. I will hang tight for a moment in case we run out of speakers, but I want to cheer folks on because it is time that we put the spotlight on this egregious bill, the King amendment, the lack of accountability, and wasteful spending. b2015 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon for those comments, who, as always, is very knowledgeable and passionate about the things that really matter to most Americans, and I thank him for being such an advocate for the environment, always, every day. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), my friend. I know Mr. POLIS has some things he would like to add to this conversation. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the senior gentleman from Colorado for the time. Mr. Speaker, I want to discuss a couple of the terrible conservation and environmental bills that affect the district I represent, our State, and our country. As the gentleman from Oregon mentioned, the elimination of the Conservation Stewardship Program, a program that has been successful to help preserve over 70 million acres, is, frankly, inexcusable. The Conservation Stewardship Program supports farmers, ranchers, and owners of forests who want to pursue highlevel conservation stewardship activities. It is important to protect our watershed that our towns and communities rely on, to keep our air clean, to sequester carbon, to maintain diverse habitats for wildlife, and, yes, to keep our farms productive and sustainable in the long term. Working lands conservation programs are so popular that the Natural Resources Conservation Service wound up having to have a waiting list. It had to turn away almost threequarters of the qualified applicants. Under the proposal today it would have to turn away 100 percent of applicants. Now, they claim that they are consolidating some programs into the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, but, frankly, those programs are very different. Whereas, the Conservation Stewardship Program helps farmers and ranchers implement advanced conservation and stewardship systems to help preserve and protect the resources on their lands. EQIP is more of an introduction or onramp to working lands conservation. It is on a onetime basis to help a specific conservation practice. It is not a program that designed, nor does it provide, assistance for longterm sustainability. That is why the Conservation Stewardship Program is so important for our forest health. Switching gears to our national forests, it seems that some Members of this body are still seeking to erode protections for our national forests. One example in this bill, the Tongass National Forest, in Alaska, which is one of the crown jewels of our National Forest System, faces a huge threat with two amendments. One of those amendments in the bill, which was already ruled in order last night without any debate, would exempt all of the Federal forests in Alaska—more Federal forests than any State in the country—to one of the most important conservation safeguards: the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule. The second amendment would overturn the Tongass forest plan, which protects roadless areas and other ecologically important lands from unsustainable logging, and charts a transition away from taxpayer subsidized, industrial scale, oldgrowth logging, to better and new forms of sustainable economic development. Our country’s oldgrowth forests are, frankly, a National treasure. Clearcutting ancient forests not only compromises our public lands; but it devastates and fragments habitat for wildlife, it introduces invasive species that compete with native species; and, yes, it pollutes the drinking water supplies for as many as 60 million people. The Roadless Rule is very important because it provides a balanced protection between our oldgrowth forests and public roads, and hydropower projects. Its application in Alaska has a very positive impact on community access and economic development, and we need to maintain the rule. As representatives and stewards of our forests, under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it is absolutely critical to protect our public lands. From the Clean Water Act to NEPA, which this bill would devastate for projects that are 6,000 acres or less, to the Endangered Species Act, which has had so many great successes, we need to protect the tools we have to secure a safe environment and a diverse habitat for our wildlife. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Colorado, and others, for speaking out on the important environmental provisions in this bill. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for bringing up these important points, and I wish him well as he goes on about a campaign for Governor in the State of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ), my friend, again, a tireless advocate for the environment. Obviously, New York produces, especially in his part of the State, a lot of farms and a lot of agriculture. This is a subject that he knows well. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER ) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I speak, this evening, joining with some members of SEEK. You heard earlier from the gentlewoman from Maine, who spoke of the SNAP cuts, the nutrition cuts. Congresswoman PINGREE is absolutely right: It is a big portion of the farm bill. But, beyond that, I am horrified with this current farm bill that proposes many harmful provisions that would completely disregard some very bedrock environmental laws. As one of the cochairs of SEEK, which aims for sustainable outcomes for energy and environment policy, you must speak to this bill, because it is so dreadful as it relates to our environmental and energy policy. This bill weakens environmental and public health protections against pesticides, many of which were established to protect the health of our children. Those protections that would be destroyed by this farm bill include allowing companies to spray pesticides into our waterways without even obtaining a Clean Water Act permit, endangering sources of drinking water and places where we swim and where we fish; preempts local governments from taking steps to protect their communities from pesticides; and weakens protections for endangered species by eliminating the requirement to consult with Federal wildlife experts. These pesticides can elevate the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. 
Removal of Clean Water Act protections, and the preemption of local efforts to protect communities, puts our public health at great risk. The International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015 classified the pesticide glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. The United States Geological Survey routinely finds glyphosate in our United States waterways. EPA’s scientific review found that the pesticide chlorpyrifos in water and on food is unsafe for children and increases the risk of learning disabilities. Prenatal exposures to this chemical are associated with reduced IQ and delayed motor development. Whenever chlorpyrifos is sprayed, it can cause immediate and longterm health harms to kids, to farmers, to farmworkers, and others who are exposed. These provisions also put our wildlife at risk. Decades ago, bald eagles and peregrine falcons were brought to the brink of extinction by the pesticide DDT. To address such issues, the EPA is required, under the Endangered Species Act, to consult with the expert Federal wildlife agencies when approving chemicals that can harm endangered species. This bill eliminates that requirement, threatening endangered wildlife and hindering recovery of imperiled species. Our farm bill is about supporting farmers, strengthening communities, and providing food for America. Rolling back public health and wildlife protections has no place in this bill. The cuts of $23plus billion in SNAP benefits, kicking an estimated 1 million households off of the program and affects 265,000 children out of free school meals is torturous in its own right. Someone, today, earlier said: When I was a kid, my money for food programs, for lunch programs was taken by the school. Now Congress is taking the money for school lunch programs away from the kids. Cuts of $800 million in conservation funding are devastating to our environment, and the cutting of vital funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency in our rural communities, which will eliminate the Rural Energy for America Program, is going to be a great consequence of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I was compelled to come to the floor and join with my colleagues as a member of SEEK that is looking for sustainable energy and environment outcomes to speak against this bill, which is going to hurt the progress over the last decades that speaks to agriculture in America, farming in America, and the quality of life for children and families across this great land. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York for those comments. I can say, to those who are listening, that Mr. TONKO  serves on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee and speaks up about the environment and about concerns about chemicals, the effects on public health, the effects on the environment, and I thank him for his advocacy. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND), my friend, for his thoughts on this particular subject, a gentleman who is an outdoorsman, and talks about the farms and the cheeses of Wisconsin. He is here as a real advocate for his State. I am sorry that he has had the Green Bay Packers and they have fallen on hard times. Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, even with that introduction, I thank my very good friend and colleague from Colorado for holding this Special Order. I am honored actually to be on the House floor with so many of my esteemed colleagues, who have taken a back seat to no one when it comes to standing up for our natural resources: for the conservation title, specifically, of this farm bill. And I am looking at the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ) and the work that she has done on agriculture policy throughout the years, and her service to her district: the introduction of the local Farms Act that she has worked on in a bipartisan fashion. My friend from Oregon, who is one of the foremost thinkers and leaders when it comes to environmental policy, but the impact on our family farms throughout our country. This is an important moment, because this is one of the more important bills that we have to consider in this session of Congress: the renewal of the farm bill. We have a chance every five or six years to take a look at the program to see what is working, what isn’t, and fix what isn’t working to make sure that we are empowering our farmers with the tools and resources that they need to be successful. I come from one of the largest agriculture producing districts in the Nation, in rural western and northcentral Wisconsin. It has been tough in farm country in the last few years, given where commodity prices have been, and, yes, where milk prices have been falling for the last 3 years. It is very difficult for these individual entities and family farms to succeed with this very tough market that they are facing right now. That is why taking our time to get this farm bill done right is the appropriate thing to do. But, unfortunately, the farm bill in its current form misses the mark in so many areas. There has been a lot of discussion about what is happening under the conservation title, the elimination of the Conservation Stewardship Program, which has worked incredibly well, and has been very successful for my family farmers in Wisconsin. I come from a very hilly area with bluffs and coulees: a lot of highly sensitive and erodible land and a lot of water source. Being able to use a Conservation Stewardship Program that is built in for the flexibility for what my farmers need, and the technical assistance that they need, to put good conservation plans in practice is very important. As the previous speaker highlighted, too, the demand is overwhelming. Three out of every four farmers nationwide applying for conservation funding assistance are currently turned away because of the inadequacy of resources. By eliminating the Conservation Stewardship Program and rolling it into the EQIP program eliminates $800 million worth of base funding. This comes on the heels of the previous farm bill, where there were $8 billion worth of cuts under the conservation title. We are not stepping up to address the need that exists in farm country; instead, we are rolling it back even further. But the problems with this farm bill don’t just end under the conservation title. Under title I commodity programs, they are lifting the payment limitation caps that had been in existence for some time. Now, passthrough entities will be able to qualify for these subsidy payments. I think the average viewer, and average taxpayer, would be shocked to see the mailing addresses for these commodity subsidy programs going to New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, ending up on the doorsteps of multimillionaires and billionaires, who are receiving government subsidies under the commodity program. That is wrong. These people won’t even set foot on a family farm. Rolling back any protections that exist under the multiple entity rule, which means that husbands, wives, daughters, sisters, sons, aunts, and uncles can qualify for the same payments, is also wrong. Finally, there is an opportunity to tighten the crop insurance program. Right now, it is prohibited from even tracking these crop insurance premium subsidies. You can’t even track it to the individual. If there is one thing that this farm bill should demand is complete transparency. The American taxpayer deserves to know where their tax dollars are going, but they can’t now under the crop insurance program. That is something else that I am trying to fix with an amendment. We are going to find out later today what amendments are made in order to try to improve this bill. It may be beyond salvage at this point coming out of the House, but we still have time later this year to do the right thing to make sure that this farm bill speaks to the needs of our family farmers back home and not to the powerful special interests here in Washington. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague again for yielding me this time. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin for those comments. He makes so many good points, and he does it in a way that really is understandable by all of us. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ), my friend, if he wishes, to close. 
b2030 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate that. It has been fun working with Congresswoman PINGREE , with my friend RONKIND, looking at these programs over the years. There is a great essay written by Marion Nestle, an author, a professor of nutrition at NYU, and the title of the essay is ‘‘The Farm Bill Drove Me Insane.’’ As she tried to actually teach a class about the farm bill to graduate students, she dove into it and found that it was just hopelessly complex. What I appreciate about working with the gentlewoman from Maine and the gentleman from Wisconsin is it doesn’t have to be that complex. We ought to be able to strip this away, have a full and honest debate, and get to the basics that make the most difference for the American public. Hopefully this thing will collapse, and we will have some time this year to work on it and make it better. Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
