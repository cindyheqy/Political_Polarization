Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Andrea Van de Kamp, of Pasadena, California, upon receiving the prestigious Rose Award from the Los Angeles Parks Founda-tion. Born in Michigan, Andrea attended Michigan State University and received her Master’s De-gree from the Teacher’s College of Columbia University. Andrea has an impressive and var-ied career in business, fundraising and the arts. These include serving as Associate Di-rector of Admissions for Dartmouth College, Director of Public Affairs for Carter Hawley Hale Stores, Executive Director of the South-ern California Coro Foundation, Director of Development at the Museum of Contemporary Art, and President and CEO of the Inde-pendent Colleges of Southern California where she administered annual funding campaigns for 15 colleges. In addition, she was Managing Director of Sotheby’s West Coast Operations and Vice President of Sotheby’s North Amer-ica. Andrea is well known for her energy, good sense of humor, and exceptional people skills, and those traits have been invaluable to the many arts organizations she has been in-volved with. A volunteer for the Music Center: Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles for many years, she chaired the center’s Board of Governors, chaired the Operating Company, was a member of The Blue Ribbon—the cen-ter’s women’s support group, and chaired the foundation giving fund. One of her greatest achievements was in 1995 when Andrea took up the challenge and embarked on a vigorous funding campaign and raised the remaining $264 million needed to build the Walt Disney Concert Hall. In addition to the Music Center, where she is Chair Emeritus, she served on the Walt Dis-ney Company Board of Directors, the UCLA Hammer Museum Board of Directors, Vice Chaired the California Council of the Human-ities, was Co-Chair of the Los Angeles Arts Task Force, as well as serving on various fi-nancial and business organizations. In addition to the Los Angeles Parks Foundation Rose Award, Ms. Van de Kamp was honored with the 2003 Junior League of Los Angeles’ Life-time Community Achievement Award. Andrea and her late husband, former Cali-fornia Attorney General John Van de Kamp, have one daughter, Diana. I ask all Members to join me in thanking An-drea Van de Kamp of Pasadena, California for her extensive and outstanding contributions to the arts in the greater Los Angeles commu-nity. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MISS-ING CHILDREN’S ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT ACT HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 14, 2017 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Missing Children’s Assistance Amendment Act of 2017, along with Congres-sional Black Caucus Chair C
EDRIC RICHMOND  (D–LA), House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member J
OHN CONYERS (D–MI), Congres-sional Caucus on Black Women and Girls Co- Chair B

OHN LEWIS (D–GA), R OBERT BRADY (D–PA), F
REDERICA WILSON (D–FL), and P RAMILA  J
AYAPAL (D–WA). The bill would require the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to collect and publish broad demographic characteristics, including race, gender, eth-nicity, sexual orientation and gender identity, of missing children. Congress has long recognized that missing children are a national problem. In 2013, Con-gress required OJJDP to conduct national inci-dence studies of missing children every three years instead of periodically. Such a study is now underway. However, my bill would require OJJDP to collect, break down, and publish de-mographic characteristics, including sub-groups, of these missing children. It is critical that the public know if there is a dispropor-tionate number of missing children of color, particularly missing girls of color, which may be an underreported national problem. Experts need to first measure the incidences, and then study whether children have been trafficked, abducted, are running away, or are missing for other reasons, and make recommendations. The last national comprehensive study of missing children by OJJDP was based on a survey conducted in 1999, known as the Na-tional Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children (NISMART–2). Currently, OJJDP is conducting a new study, known as NISMART–3. How-ever, there is no statutory requirement that the triennial study collect or publish demographic characteristics of missing children. For in-stance, while NISMART–2 published race and gender data, it did not publish any subgroups, such as the number of girls of color missing. It is more important than ever to have reli-able statistics on missing children. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. A TRIBUTE TO HOLLY HAMPTON— 28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 14, 2017 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women’s History Month. Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation’s women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my congressional district. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Holly Hampton of Echo Park, a unique neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Holly Hampton has been a resident of Echo Park for many years, calling this historic neighborhood and community home since 1989. Ms. Hampton currently serves as Vice President of the Echo Park Historical Society’s Board of Directors, which preserves and pro-motes the neighborhood’s architectural and cultural heritage. Holly also serves as Chair of the Historic Echo Park Home Tours. Ms. Hampton, a professional graphic de-signer, has been recognized for her involve-ment in numerous community design projects. Most notably, she participated as a judge for the Echo Park Community Parade’s children’s art contest for the past six years, and has de-signed installations for the Echo Park Histor-ical Society. She received recognition from the City of Los Angeles at the Echo Park Farmers’ Market’s 10 year anniversary for her work with Katrina Alexy, an artist, on the creation of the market logo. In 2001, Ms. Hampton purchased a home in Echo Park, and became active in the develop-ment of her local neighborhood watch, which included neighbors on Grafton Street, Lemoyne Street, Effie Street, Lake Shore Ave-nue and Lobdell Place. She also began partnering with the Los Angeles City Council 13th District Office to organize staircase street clean-up events in an effort to help maintain the public staircase located on her street. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-gressional District, Holly Hampton.

A TRIBUTE TO BETTY PORTO— 28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 14, 2017 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women’s History Month. Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation’s women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my congressional district. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Betty Porto of La Can˜ada Flintridge, California. The success of the Porto family stems from humble beginnings in Manzanillo, Cuba. After Fidel Castro’s violent revolution erupted in Cuba in the 1950s, Raul, Sr. and his wife, Rosa requested permission to leave the coun-try. As they waited for approval, both Raul, Sr. and Rosa were dismissed from their jobs. To support their three children, Betty, Raul, Jr., and Margarita, Rosa, a talented baker, refined her recipes and started selling her cakes to neighbors and friends. The Porto family’s re-quest to leave the country was eventually ap-proved, and they entered the United States in the early 1970s. In the United States, they opened a bakery in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles that quickly flourished, and Betty Porto, in addition to her siblings, was there to lend a helping hand. Betty Porto attended John Marshall High School in Los Angeles, and simultaneously worked at the family’s bakery, Porto’s Bakery & Cafe´, taking care of the front of the house since she loved interacting with people and enjoyed customer service. Her mother, who valued the importance of receiving a higher education and credits a large part of her suc-cess to having a bachelor’s degree, influenced Betty’s love of learning. Upon graduating from high school, Betty received a bachelor’s de-gree and a master’s degree in political science from California State University, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Los Angeles, respectively. Her goal was to attend law school, but she quickly changed her mind as spending time with her family at the bakery had awakened her passion for the family busi-ness, and she wanted to support her parents, keeping in mind all the sacrifices they had made to give her a better life. Over the years, Ms. Porto and her siblings became increasingly involved in the commu-nity by supporting many worthwhile organiza-tions, including Glendale Healthy Kids, Amer-ican Red Cross, Glendale police and fire de-partments, and the Alex Theatre to name a few. For the past seven years, Betty has been a staunch supporter of Union Rescue Mission, donating the remaining food from Porto’s Bak-ery & Cafe´at the end of each day. She also gives tours of Porto’s Bakery & Cafe ´to cul- inary students, to show them firsthand, out of the classroom setting, how to run a bakery, and has even hired some of these students to work at Porto’s Bakery & Cafe´. Betty and Rick, her husband of twenty-five years, have two daughters. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-gressional District, Betty Porto. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 14, 2017 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women’s History Month. Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation’s women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recog-nize a remarkable woman, Lena Kortoshian of La Crescenta, California. Ms. Kortoshian attended California State University, Northridge, where she received a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics, and a Master’s Degree in Leadership and Policy Studies. For many years, Ms. Kortoshian has been a pillar of education and an avid supporter of our youth. Lena’s career in education began in 1986, when she was working as an instruc-tional assistant at an elementary and a middle school in the Glendale Unified School District. Since then, she has served in many capac-ities, including as a mathematics teacher at Glendale High School and Clark Magnet High School, Assistant Principal of Herbert Hoover High School, and a Mathematics Administrator at the Los Angeles County Office of Edu-cation. Lena has also served as Assistant Principal and Associate Principal of Clark Magnet High School, and is currently Principal of the school. Lena has always dedicated her time and ef-forts to ensure the success of her students. She served as a volunteer math tutor with the Committee for Armenian Students in Public Schools, a non-profit organization that ad-dresses both the educational and social needs of immigrant children in public schools, and continues to tutor students after school, giving special attention to each student she helps. Lena is also a Member of the Board of Re-gents of Prelacy Armenian Schools—a board which is appointed by the Prelate and Execu-tive Council of the Western Prelacy of the Ar-menian Apostolic Church of America. Over the years, Lena has received recogni-tion for her contributions to the community, such as the Armenian American Chamber of Commerce’s ‘‘Friend of the Armenian Commu-nity’’ award. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-gressional District, Lena Kortoshian. REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF ROBERT A.D. SCHWARTZ HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 14, 2017 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay final tribute to Robert A.D. Schwartz. Mr. Schwartz died on February 18, 2017 in his Oakland, California home, at the age of 92. He was a businessman, philanthropist, patron of the arts, and jazz musician. Mr. Schwartz was born in 1925 in Chicago, and received his B.S. in June 1944 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Upon graduation, he joined the Navy and was sent to the Pacific. Bob moved to Oakland in 1951, where he founded Schwartz & Lindheim and later Keysource International, which develops and manufactures specialized keyboards for indus-try. He later earned a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from Golden Gate University Law School, becoming a member of the California State Bar in 1974. In 1979, Mr. Schwartz founded the Robert A.D. Schwartz Foundation. The foundation’s mission is to develop vocational, musical and citizenship educational programs. His philan-thropic work also led him to serve as chairman of Urban Strategies Council, a non-profit orga-nization, which works to eliminate persistent poverty in the Bay Area. He also founded Peer Tutoring Resources Center, which works to support the develop-ment of caring and collaborative citizens by enhancing the use, expansion and sustain-ability of peer tutoring—a model engaging stu-dents as instructors and leaders in classrooms and across schools. In recognition of his contributions to the Oakland community, Bob was named Oakland Citizen of the Year in 1996, and December 14 2016 was proclaimed ‘‘Robert Schwartz Day’’ in Oakland. An avid musician, Mr. Schwartz was instru-mental in reviving the Oakland Symphony, and started his own jazz band which played for seniors at local retirement homes. As chairman of the Northern California Democratic Party, Bob worked tirelessly on many campaigns, including my own cam-paigns for Congress. On a personal note, Bob was a trusted con-fidant, a brilliant strategist, and most impor-tant, a loyal friend who I loved very much. I invite my colleagues to join me as I offer condolences to his loving family, and his lov-ing wife Debbra Wood Schwartz. Robert A.D. Schwartz will be greatly missed but his legacy as a creative spirit and a trail-blazer community activist will live on as a source of inspiration for generations to come.

I would like to recog-nize a remarkable woman, Anne-Marie John-son of Silver Lake, a unique neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Born in Los Angeles, Anne-Marie Johnson has been a lifelong Silver Lake resident, and graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles. Since 2011, she has served as an At-Large Representative on the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council. In this capacity, she has co-chaired town hall meetings and has served as co-chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Ms. Johnson is a familiar face in motion pic-tures and television. She has starred in nu-merous television series such as Melrose Place, In Living Color, In the Heat of the Night, and for a few seasons, she appeared on JAG, portraying Congresswoman ‘‘Bobbi Latham.’’ In addition, Anne-Marie has ap-peared on Days of Our Lives, Chasing Life, Hunter, The X-Files and CSI: Crime Scene In-vestigation, and most recently in Pretty Little Liars, Castle, Grey’s Anatomy, Major Crimes, and NCIS: Los Angeles.

In 2016, she re-ceived the Screen Actors Guild Ralph Morgan Award, and was the first African American to receive this award since the inception of the honor in 1981. In 2017, Anne-Marie received the Rosa Parks Legacy Award from the South-ern Christian Leadership Conference, in rec-ognition of her tireless efforts in the commu-nity. In addition, Ms. Johnson has volunteered with the Los Angeles Police Department, where she co-created, co-produced and co-di-rected a series of public service announce-ments called ‘‘Obey The Rules Of The Road’’ to bring attention to traffic safety. Anne-Marie has been married to Martin Grey since 1996. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-gressional District, Anne-Marie Johnson.

STRENGTHENING AND CLARIFYING THE 25TH AMENDMENT ACT OF 2017 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 14, 2017 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, like many people, I have noticed a renewed interest in the 25th Amendment as we have seen erratic behavior out of the White House. As I exam-ined the Amendment, it became clear that in the case of mental or emotional incapacity, there is a glaring flaw. In the absence of Con-gressional action, the constitutional language depends on actions by the Cabinet. Because the Cabinet can be fired by the President, there is a natural bias that would make them reluctant to acknowledge the President’s in-ability to serve. It’s time to revisit and strength-en the Amendment and make sure there is a reliable mechanism in place if the President becomes unable to discharge the powers and duties of office. The 25th Amendment was adopted 50 years ago in the wake of President Kennedy’s as-sassination. It provides a mechanism for the succession of the President for his or her re-placement in the event he or she proves unfit to serve. Under the Amendment, the Vice President and a majority of either the Cabinet or some ‘‘other body’’ designated by Con-gress, may remove the President from office. While the language is straightforward, it raises a host of questions. This ‘‘other body,’’ rather than the principal officers of the execu-tive branch, is undefined and there is no guid-ance for how it should operate. This legislation determines the body would consist of the Vice President, advised by a majority of the living former Presidents and Vice-Presidents. These people have been President, or in the line of succession and understand the pressures of the office and the responsibilities the Presi-dency entails. They are of both parties, experi-enced, and well regarded by the American public. It is hard to imagine a better group to work with the Vice President to examine whether the President is able to discharge the duties of the office. When there are questions about the President’s ability to fulfill his or her constitutional responsibilities, it is in the coun-try’s best interest to have a mechanism in place that works effectively. f 
A TRIBUTE TO PHYLLIS KIM—28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 14, 2017 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women’s History Month. Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation’s women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recog-nize a remarkable woman, Phyllis Kim of Glendale, California. Phyllis Kim received her Bachelor of Arts Degree and an Interpretation & Translation Certificate from the University of California, Los Angeles. Currently, she is a court inter-preter in the Korean language in Los Angeles. For years, Ms. Kim has been very active with the Korean American Forum of California, which is dedicated to bringing public attention and recognition to the ‘‘comfort women’’ of World War II. From 1932 until the end of World War II, over 200,000 women and girls throughout Asia, many of them kidnapped, threatened, or lured from their homes under false pretenses, were forced into sexual slav-ery by the Imperial Armed Forces of Japan. Ms. Kim continues to raise awareness about these women, known as ‘‘comfort women,’’ and also works toward receiving a formal rec-ognition and an apology from Japan for its past war crimes of sexual slavery by its mili-tary, and to prevent wartime crimes against women as well as children. Through the dedicated efforts of Ms. Kim and the Korean American Forum of California, the Comfort Women statue was built in Glen-dale, California. Phyllis makes every effort to visit the statue as often as she can to honor the Halmoni. Phyllis lives in Glendale with her husband of nine years, Roy Hong. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-gressional District, Phyllis Kim. f

She has given of herself with joy, humility, and grace and, along the way, has changed so many lives for the better in Burbank. Her kind and relaxed demeanor is not only evident in her treasured relationships with her husband Barry, her family and friends, but also in her charitable work in the community. Ms. Volpei-Gussow has brought her incred-ible talent, insight, time, and energy to numer-ous boards and special committees over the years. She currently sits on the Boards of the Burbank Chamber of Commerce, City of Bur-bank Heritage Commission, Burbank Arts for All, Burbank on Parade, Burbank Business Partners, and Keller Williams Agent Leader-ship Council. She serves on committees for the Providence Saint Joseph Foundation Emergency Service Campaign, Boys and Girls Club of Burbank and Greater East Valley, Bur-bank Temporary Aid Center, and Family Serv-ice Agency of Burbank. Her past community involvement includes Ambassador Chair of the Burbank Chamber of Commerce, Docent at the Burbank Historical Society’s Gordon R. Howard Museum, and Board Member of both the Kids Community Dental Clinic and The Burbank Association of REALTORS, Community Service Foundation. Ms. Volpei-Gussow’s charitable and profes-sional work has not gone unnoticed as she was awarded 2012 Realtor of the Year by the Burbank Association of REALTORS and named Community Leader of the Year at the Boys and Girls Club of Burbank and Greater East Valley 2013 Gala Dinner. Ms. Volpei-Gussow rarely says no when asked to give a helping hand, and once given, her level of leadership, support, and gen-erosity never waivers. She is a community leader who is unafraid of challenging the ways things were done in the past as she looks to-wards the future with a bold new plan to make the organizations she is involved with and the City of Burbank grow and thrive.

HONORING PHILIP KALAYIL 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 14, 2017 Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the life of Philip Kalayil who passed away on March 13 this year of natural causes. It seems like everybody who’s anybody in the city of Chicago has a story about Philip Kalayil. Philip came to Chicago from India in the mid-1950s and became an early leader and organizer of the Indian-American community in the Chicago area. Before his untimely death, Philip had been recognized by the Association for Asian Amer-ican Studies, which honored him with its Heart of Asian American Community Award. Philip’s legacy of leadership and bridge- building between all racial and ethnic groups are needed now more than ever. While Philip left this world far too early, we should all take comfort in knowing that his memory and self-less service have left a mark on Chicago and our nation. The civic contributions and dedication to the Indian-American community by Philip Kalayil have helped Indian Americans in the Chicago area such as myself to pursue professional achievements to further the development of our community. On behalf of all of Philip’s countless friends and associates, I just want to say thank you for all that you did for the people of Illinois. You’re leaving some big shoes to fill in the city of Chicago. Mr. Speaker, I hope we might all keep in our thoughts and prayers the Kalayil family as they mourn their loss. In that spirit, I celebrate Philip’s life and think about what an impact that life made on so many people.

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FAIR PAY ACT OF 2017 APRIL 4, 2017 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 14, 2017 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today is Equal Pay Day, which marks the number of addi-tional days a woman must work to earn what a man earned by the end of last year. The 1963 Equal Pay Act (EPA), the first of the great civil rights statutes of the 1960s, has grown creaky with age and needs updating to reflect the new workforce, in which women work almost as much as men. The best case for a stronger and updated EPA occurred here in the Congress in 2003, when female custodians in the House and Senate won an EPA case after showing that female workers were paid a dollar less per hour for doing the same or similar work as men. Had these women not been represented by their union, they would have had an almost impossible task in using the rules for bringing and sustaining an EPA class action suit. Based on my own experience as the first woman to chair the Equal Employment Oppor-tunity Commission, I again introduce the Fair Pay Act (FPA) on behalf of the average fe-male worker, who is often first steered to, and then locked into, jobs with wages that are deeply influenced by the gender of women who have traditionally held such jobs. Much of the wage inequality women experience today is because of employer-steering and deeply rooted wage stereotypes, which result in wages being paid according to gender and not according to the skill necessary to do the job. I introduce the FPA because pay disparity most women face today stems mainly from the segregation of women and men in different jobs and paying women in female-dominated jobs systematically less. Two-thirds of white women and three quarters of African-American women work in just three areas: sales/clerical, service and factories. We need more aggres-sive strategies to break through the societal barriers present throughout history the world over, as well as employer-steering based on gender, which is as old as paid employment itself. The FPA requires that if men and women are doing comparable work, they are to be paid comparable wages. If a woman, for ex-ample, is an emergency services operator, a female-dominated profession, she should not be paid less than a fire dispatcher, a male- dominated profession, simply because each of these jobs has been dominated by one sex. If a woman is a social worker, a traditionally fe-male occupation, she should not earn less than a probation officer, a traditionally male job, simply because of the gender associated with each of these jobs. The FPA, like the EPA, will not tamper with the legal burden. Under the FPA, as under the EPA, the burden will be on the plaintiff to prove discrimination. The plaintiff must show that the reason for the disparate treatment is gender discrimination, not legitimate market factors. Remedies to achieve comparable pay for men and women are not radical or unprece-dented. State governments, in red and blue states alike, have shown that it is possible to eliminate the part of the pay gap that is due to discrimination. Twenty states have adjusted wages for female-dominated professions, rais-ing pay for teachers, nurses, clerical workers, librarians, and other female-dominated jobs that paid less than comparable male-domi-nated jobs. Minnesota, for example, imple-mented a pay equity plan when it found that traditionally female jobs paid 20 percent less than comparable traditionally male jobs. There may well be some portion of a gender wage gap that is traceable to market factors, but 20 states have shown that you can tackle the gender discrimination-based wage gap without interfering in the market system. States gen-erally have closed the wage gap over a period of four to five years at a one-time cost of no more than three to four percent of payroll. In addition, many female workers routinely achieve pay equity through collective bar-gaining, and countless employers provide it on their own as they see women shifting out of vital female-dominated occupations as a result of the shortage of skilled workers, as well as because of the unfairness to women. Unequal pay has been built into the way women have been treated since Adam and Eve. To dis-lodge such deep-seated and pervasive treat-ment, we must go to the source, the tradition-ally female occupations, where pay is linked with gender and always has been.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE509 April 14, 2017 
we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation’s women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recog-nize a remarkable woman, Amy Yanow of the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Amy Yanow has always had a passion for community. After a career in real estate devel-opment, she obtained a Master of Business Administration from the Anderson School of Management at UCLA and combined her love of community with her love for small busi-nesses. As co-owner of two of the most nota-ble craft beer destinations in Southern Cali-fornia, Mohawk Bend in Echo Park and Tony’s Darts Away in Burbank, Ms. Yanow has found innovative ways to incorporate her desire to support community and her passion for locally sourced products and services. Ms. Yanow formalized sourcing guidelines which focus on procuring products that celebrate Los Angeles and California local farming. Charitable giving is built into every level of Ms. Yanow’s restaurant strategy from menu offerings to marketing efforts. She believes in personal outreach to build lasting and mean-ingful relationships with her community. On behalf of Mohawk Bend, Ms. Yanow has partnered with thirty local non-profits to achieve fundraising and awareness of commu-nity-based initiatives in her backyard. Machine Project, 826LA, Echo Park Recreational Cen-ter, Echo Park Parenting and Education, San-dra Cisneros Academy, Fire Station 20 Echo Park, Echo Park Community Parade, Edendale Branch Library, and Food Forward are a few of the beneficiaries of her gen-erosity. Under her guidance, Tony’s Darts Away has supported community-based initia-tives in the City of Burbank by providing funds to the Family Service Agency of Burbank, the Beagle Freedom Foundation, and Keep-A- Breast Foundation to name a few. Ms. Yanow and her husband, Tony Yanow, have shown great dedication to the non-profit organization River LA and its mission to unlock the potential and beauty of the Los An-geles River’s fifty-one miles. From late 2015 until February 2016, the Yanows led a public matching grant campaign to raise funds and awareness for the creation of the community- oriented recreation areas and green spaces along the river. Ms. Yanow was deeply in-volved in the fundraising drive by creating a public awareness campaign through personal outreach and building a comprehensive social media strategy that ultimately accomplished the fundraising goal of $500,000. Ms. Yanow is a treasure to her community and an inspira-tion to all who know her. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-gressional District, Amy Yanow.
