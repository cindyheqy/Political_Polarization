Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I want to thank my colleagues, Rep. LOISFRANKEL , Rep. B RENDA LAWRENCE , Rep. BARBARA LEE, Rep. A NNKUSTER , Rep. N ORMA  TORRES , Rep. S HEILA JACKSON LEE, Rep. D ON BACON , and Rep. M ARTHA MCSALLY, who spoke out during the May 2nd Special Order Hour on nonconsensual pornography in the military. It is critical that we continue to raise awareness about this topic and I am grateful to see Members from both parties coming together to fight this predatory and humiliating practice taking place in our military. I would also like to specifically thank Reps. FRANKEL  and LAWRENCE for hosting the Special Order Hour on behalf of the Democratic Women’s Working Group. I am deeply passionate about stopping nonconsensual pornography in the armed services, and was disappointed to miss the Special Order Hour. I had an unavoidable conflict, since at the same time I was serving as the Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee Military Personnel Hearing on the Annual Report on Sexual Harassment and Violence at the Military Service Academies. During the hearing, I listened to brave testimony from military survivors of sexual assault and harassment who also suffered retaliation after they came forward. All members of the military deserve protection from sexual violence on the internet, in the academies, and every place else. Marines United, and other incidents of nonconsensual pornography in the military, are examples of degrading behaviors that destroy careers and lives. When these horrific incidents occur, it is not about sex or social media policy; it is evidence of a culture of rot that is allowed to spread by military leadership. I am concerned that NCIS and military leadership is not taking this seriously—my staff found scores of nonconsensual pornography images on Tumblr in under 5 minutes with the search term ‘‘Tumblr Army naked.’’ These attacks go well beyond just the posting of the pictures. They are widespread and involve every branch of the military and all levels of command, as shown by the charge against Master Sgt. Theophilus Thomas. Why is it that other crimes are punished with a zero tolerance policy and the individual is removed from service, while stalking, harassment, and the destruction of your colleague’s career fails to warrant the same punishment from the military? These crimes pose a serious threat to troop readiness and morale and must be treated as such. I am proud to be a colead with Congresswoman MCSALLY on the PRIVATE Act, which would make posting consensually taken, but nonconsensually distributed intimate photos illegal under the UCMJ. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join together and support the PRIVATE Act and the brave men and women who put their lives on the line in service to our country. f 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the American Health Care Act. My colleagues across the aisle tried and failed once before to consider this bill, but they pulled it from the House floor because they didn’t have the votes. Today, they seek to pass this. amended bill, but it’s just as flawed as the first. The changes will hurt seniors, veterans, the sick, and middle and lowincome individuals. Essential health benefits guaranteed in the Affordable Care Act can now be waived, comprising quality health care for those with pre existing conditions, expectant mothers, and individuals seeking mental health and substance abuse treatment. Ultimately, millions of Americans will be harmed by this bill. This second attempt to rush a vote on our nation’s health care, without a revised Congressional Budget Office score, was quickly and carelessly crafted to meet arbitrary, deadlines and illconceived campaign promises. Protecting the central coast of California’s health care, particularly for the most vulnerable among us, is one of my top priorities. I urge my colleagues in the Majority party to focus not on partisan interests but serve the people. I will be voting no on this bill. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to do the same. 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my alma mater, St. RoseMcCarthy Catholic School on its 100th anniversary. In 1911, the school’s founder, Father Philip Scher, became pastor of St. Brigid Church, with hopes of eventually expanding to build a hospital and a Catholic parochial school near the church. The hospital was established two years later in 1913 and was staffed by Dominican Sisters of Kenosha. Four years later, on August 31, 1917, St. Rose Catholic School, named after St. Rose of Lima, the first American Dominican saint, was established and was staffed by three teaching sisters. The first location of the school was in a Holy Names Society hall behind the church. The school consisted of three classrooms, separated by folding partitions where seventyfive eager students came to learn. By 1919, the teaching staff increased to five sisters and a porch was enclosed to create more classrooms and a garage was used as a kindergarten. In 1921, Father Peter H. McNellis improved the school aesthetically, added two more class rooms, and added a kitchen. Enrollment then doubled and in the following years more improvements were made to the school. In 1941, Thomas McCarthy, a parishioner, donated a generous gift to the parish in his will with the purpose of constructing a new parochial school. The new school was constructed and renamed Thomas McCarthy School in his honor. Enrollment continued to increase to 450 students, leaving the teaching sisters with their hands full. In 1997 the school was renamed from Thomas McCarthy School to a combination of its former name and its current name to create St. RoseMcCarthy Catholic School. Currently, there are 135 students in grades preschool through 8th grade. The school remains an excellent educational institution in the Central Valley; it was built by, and continues to be successful due to, faithful volunteers, generous donors, and the Dominican Sisters of Kenosha. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in congratulating St. RoseMcCarthy Catholic School on their 100th anniversary, and wish them continued success for many years to come. f 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major Efrain Reyna Jr. of the United States Army for his extraordinary dedication to duty and service to the Nation. After four years of faithful service in the nation’s capital, Major Reyna will transition from his present assignment as a Budget Liaison at Department of the Army Headquarters to civilian life back in the Great State of Texas. Major Reyna has demonstrated the invaluable service that Army Congressional Liaisons provide Congress. He enabled countless Members and staff in developing a better understanding of Army policies, operations, and requirements. His firsthand knowledge of military needs, culture, and tradition were of tremendous benefit to Congressional offices. Prior to service as a Liaison, Major Reyna was assigned to my office as a Military Fellow 
where he quickly became an indispensable asset to my team. His performance was superb and he earned my utmost respect. His ability to build relationships and create opportunities aided me greatly in securing legislative language in support of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting victims, an effort that had been a priority of mine for 5 years. A native Texan from the Rio Grande Valley, Major Reyna is a distinguished military graduate from Saint Mary’s University where he earned a commission in the Army Aviation branch. He served with the 101st Airborne Division as a Chinook helicopter pilot and platoon leader. From here, he deployed on his first combat tour to Afghanistan as a flight platoon leader in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Efrain also served with the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, ‘‘the Great Place.’’ While there, he served in various leadership positions to include Chinook company commander and support battalion operations officer. Efrain conducted his second combat deployed to Afghanistan with the 1st Air Cavalry Brigade as a company commander. His dedication to excellence has not gone unnoticed. Major Reyna’s awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and numerous others. He has earned the Senior Aviator Badge, Ranger Tab, Airborne Wings, and Air Assault Wings. Efrain is a graduate of the Marine Expeditionary Warfare School. He also completed a Master’s Degree from George Washington University during his time here, demonstrating his commitment as a Warrior and a Scholar. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize the selfless service of Major Efrain Reyna and the support and dedication of his wife Kelly Ann and their two sons, Isaac Lee Reyna and Zachary Miers. I wish them the very best as they complete over twelve years of honorable service to our great nation and proceed to the next chapter in their lives. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jessica Nalepa, an outstanding member of my staff who is transitioning out of my office after seven years to share her talents with the administration. A Virginia native, Jessi interned in my office while she was in school at George Mason University where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Government & International Politics and Communications, graduating cum Laude. Despite her East Coast upbringing, Jessi soon became an honorary Texan through and through. Her outstanding work as an intern swiftly led her to become a permanent part of my team as the Director of Scheduling. Continuing to demonstrate her talents and work ethic, she moved through the ranks of my office fast: first from Scheduler to Deputy Chief of Staff and then ending her service to me as my Chief of Staff Jessi has been an integral part of my team and has served dutifully as a public servant to Texas–10 and the entire state. She also played an instrumental role in my personal growth here in Congress when she helped me in my campaign to become Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee during the 113th Congress. Possibly the toughest part of Jessi’s job was balancing my duties to serve Texans through my personal office and simultaneously ensure the safety of all Americans through my work on the committee. Despite the challenges this posed on a daily basis, Jessi always went above and beyond. She managed these dynamics with professionalism, integrity, and a high degree of respect for the people who we serve. And, I’ll add she accomplished all of this while earning a Master’s Degree in Public Policy Analysis from George Mason University. Jessi’s dedication to Texas’ 10th Congressional District and the U.S. House of Representatives is an extraordinary example of her strong commitment to her country and fellow citizens. Even though she is departing my office, Jessi will always be part of Team McCaul and I will be forever grateful for her work. Jessi is possibly the hardest worker I have had the honor to know, and she will be sorely missed by all. Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in thanking Jessi for her service to the great state of Texas and our nation, and wish her the very best of luck as she sets forth on the next chapter of her life. f 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Ted Hall, who is being honored as the 2017 Napa Valley Grower of the Year at the Napa Valley Grapegrowers’ 42nd annual dinner. Mr. Hall has a long and successful history of management and leadership within the wine industry in California and throughout the nation. A native of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, Mr. Hall received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University and went on to earn his MBA from Stanford University. Before coming to Napa Valley, Mr. Hall developed his true love of the land while living on his family’s farm in the township of Potter, Pennsylvania. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps and is an active jazz trombonist and piano player. Mr. Hall exemplifies the values of the Napa Valley Grapegrowers. He is dedicated, shows good judgement, and pays attention to the details that matter. He has served as President & CEO of Long Meadow Ranch since 1989. Additionally, Mr. Hall serves on the board of directors for numerous educational, charitable, and arts organizations. Drawing on his knowledge and success in the vineyard industry, Mr. Hall represents and advocates on behalf of growers as Chairman of the Napa Valley Grapegrowers and as a member of the Industry Issues Committee. As someone who shares his great community pride for Napa Valley, Mr. Hall looks to the region’s future by sharing his expertise with the next generation of growers and farmers. He is the current Chairman of the St. Helena High School Agriculture Education Committee and the Napa County Agriculture Protection Advisory Committee (APAC). Mr. Hall supports multiple conservation easements in Napa County and is a member of a variety of public and private organizations involved in food and agriculture. Mr. Speaker, Ted Hall has had a remarkable career as a business leader in our Napa Valley community. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor him here today. f 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I promised the people of the ThirtySixth District of Texas that I would repeal Obamacare and replace it with conservative solutions. President Donald J. Trump was elected on this same platform. Last week we came together to fulfill that promise. After years of speeches, debates, elections and ‘‘show votes’’ that we knew would be vetoed or go nowhere in the Senate, last week’s vote was the real deal. This was perhaps the most important and consequential domestic policy legislation any of us will ever see. To begin with, it serves as the largest entitlement reform of the Medicaid program in the program’s history and eliminates the individual and employer mandate penalties. It also stops mandatory spending on large abortion businesses, such as Planned Parenthood, for one year. It isn’t the exact bill I would have written, but I am proud to say that I voted YES on the AHCA. While Republicans alone provided the votes to pass this bill, it was still the product of finding common ground to provide the American people with relief from Obamacare. Members of our conference from every ideological stripe and every type of district came together to improve the bill and to secure its passage. While we could certainly write a better one that allows for insurance sales across state lines, gives consumers better choices about the plans and benefits they want, and tears down the antitrust exemption for insurers— the absurd tightrope we must walk to comply with the Senate’s reconciliation rules has forced us to write this bill with one hand tied behind our back. Like their colleagues here, Senate Democrats have made clear that preserving the failed experiment of Obamacare matters more than anything else, and that they would launch a fake, phony Filibuster if anything came to the Senate that did not comply with the Senate procedure known as the ‘‘Byrd Rule.’’ I was extremely pleased to be part of House passage of AHCA last week and now look to the Senate to move the road blocks that continue to threaten our conservative agenda. 
Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Patrick Leonard of Dubuque, Iowa for his year of service as President of the Iowa Funeral Directors Association. A fellow graduate of my own alma mater, Loras College, Mr. Leonard has successfully owned and operated his funeral home in Dubuque since 1990. His year as President of the Association has been marked by faithful leadership of the IFDA Board of Governors as they pursued IFDA’s mission of promoting and supporting funeral service excellence. Since coming to Congress in 2014, I have seen firsthand the dedication, enthusiasm, and passion that Mr. Leonard brings to his profession every day. Last summer, we were honored to have Mr. Leonard represent the IFDA at my congressional office’s Dubuque Senior Wellness Fair. He understands that leadership is about stepping up and getting involved personally in service of the mission. Mr. Leonard also finds time to give back to his community. Just last year, after months of preparation and coordination with the U.S. Navy, Mr. Leonard oversaw the return of a WWII veteran’s remains back to Iowa. Mr. Leonard expressed to me how much of an honor this was for him, and how this project signified the importance of funeral services to those who pass, and their loved ones. On behalf of the nearly 700 licensed funeral directors in Iowa, I want to again thank and recognize Mr. Leonard for his exemplary service as President of the IFDA. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Trefethen family, John, Janet, Lorenzo, Hailey and, posthumously, Eugene and Catherine, for their hard work, dogged perseverance and community involvement. The Trefethen family first restored their historic McIntyre Winery, which is on the National Register for Historic Places, in 1973. In August of 2014 the largest earthquake in the Bay Area since 1989 caused significant damage to the winery. Rather than scrapping their winemaking operations and moving elsewhere, they stayed and rebuilt the winery and will hold a celebratory reopening this week. Led largely by Hailey, the McIntyre building has been resurrected and now includes a new base that is earthquake resistant. The McIntyre building today contains 85 percent of the original building material and will use the same 19th century pipes to distill the famous Trefthen family wine. When Gene moved to the Napa Valley 50 years ago, the Trefethen family began a long tradition of community involvement. The family donates wine to many community events annually to be auctioned for charitable causes including children at risk and the environment, two of the family’s passions. The Wine Community is integral to our way of life in my district. The Trefethen family has done more than their part to support our community. John was the founding President of the Napa Valley Grapegrowers and has served multiple terms on the Napa Valley Vinters Board. Janet served on the Board of Directors for the Queen of the Valley Foundation and founded the Oak Knoll District of Napa Valley, where she lead the effort to have it recognized as an American Viticulture Area in 2004. Hailey recently finished serving terms on the Board of California Institute and the Napa Valley Vintners. Mr. Speaker, on May 7, the Trefethen’s will host their winery’s grand reopening. True to their love of community, it will feature local high school choirs, vocalists and a barbershop quartet. They have worked hard to preserve their winery. It is fitting and proper that we honor them here today. f
