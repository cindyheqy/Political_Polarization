Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my sincerest birthday wishes to Coach Herman ‘‘Big Man’’ Pittman, who will be celebrating his 90th on Sunday, November 19, 2017. As a young man, Herman was a gifted athlete. He displayed great ability to play the game of basketball, and throughout his high school career at Tampa Middleton High School, he played as the team’s point guard. Because of his success, he would go on to earn an athletic scholarship to attend Florida Agriculture & Mechanical University (FAMU), where he lettered on the football team, as well as played starting guard on the FAMU Rattler Basketball Team. During his time at FAMU, Herman led his team to two Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) Championships. He would go on to make First Team AllSIAC Conference and AllSIAC Tournament Team for two years. After graduating from FAMU with his Bachelor of Science in Physical Education, Herman joined the U.S. Army, where he was cocaptain of the Fort Meade Generals in Maryland. Herman would go on to earn a Master’s of Science in Health and Physical Education from Indiana University. Herman began his career as a teacher and coach for the Dillard High School Panthers in 1955. He taught physical education and driver’s education, and also coached basketball, football, and track during his tenure of 37 years. He also coached at Deerfield Beach High School, making a total of 18 years of coaching. His career as a basketball coach, record of conference participation shows seven Conference Championships, as well as being voted Outstanding Coach of the Conference five times. His teams won six District Championships and were runnersup two times. His teams also qualified for the state tournament seven times, having won four state titles, they qualified for participation in the National High School Tournament held at Tennessee State University in 1959, 1963, 1965, and 1967. His coaching records and contributions earned him the title of ‘‘One of the Winningest and Most Outstanding Coaches in the Nation.’’ For Herman’s outstanding contributions and commitment to youth and other service involvements in Broward County, he has been awarded numerous honors. The Community and School Board have likewise renamed the Dillard High School Gymnasium as the ‘‘Herman Pittman Gymnasium.’’ As an educator, Herman once stated, ‘‘I feel I’m out here trying to educate a child for life. I try to teach them to be able to make adjustments in a changing society. I do the same thing in the classroom that I do on the basketball court—you have to teach young people how to live.’’ This is something that Herman has been committed to his entire life. Outside of teaching and coaching, Herman has continued to dedicate his time to serving in a wide array of organizations that include: Kappa Alpha Psi, Inc. Fraternity, First Baptist Piney Grove Church, ‘‘Meals on Wheels,’’ The Kiwanis Club of Central Broward, FAMU Alumni Association, F Club, and the Dillard Task Force. On Friday, November 3rd, Herman was honored at the 23rd Annual Mount Olive Development Corporation (MODCO) Community Service Awards Gala, entitled ‘‘A Celebration of Savvy Senior Citizens & Committed Military Servants.’’ Among the things that he said was ‘‘the world is always evolving,’’ in his 90 years he has evolved with the world. And, he has stood the test of time. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to wish a very happy 90th birthday to my very good friend, Coach Herman ‘‘Big Man’’ Pittman, whose service and dedication to the State of Florida and our nation is truly admirable. Herman will celebrate his birthday with his lovely wife Nielza, their three daughters Linda, Lisa, and Lavette, and their four grandchildren Chelsey, Colin, Mika, and Cody, as well as so many in our community, who love and respect all that he has contributed. I wish him many more years of happiness and success. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Wayne Farms, a poultry company based in my home of Hall County. While attending this year’s National Safety Conference for the Poultry Industry, Wayne Farms received 10 distinct awards for success in employee safety. More than a year ago, Wayne Farms began carrying out an initiative called ‘‘Zero Accident Culture’’ to further prioritize the safety of its 10,000 employees. Through organized efforts, the company was able to set and meet goals that paved the way for an even more secure atmosphere for its team members. Since its inception, the Zero Accident Culture initiative has brought down the number of injuries within the company, leaving employees with a safer environment to work in each day. Wayne Farms’ leadership in workplace safety signifies the commitment that poultry producers have made not only to improving the quality of their food, but also to improving the work environment that they welcome their teams into each day. I congratulate Wayne Farms on the strides they’ve made in workplace safety. I wish them the best as they continue to contribute to our community in northeast Georgia. 
TO COMMEMORATE THE HONORABLE ANNA G. ESHOO FOR 25 YEARS OF SERVICE IN THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues today to commemorate the Honorable ANNA G. E SHOO for 25 years of incredible service in the United States House of Representatives. She has represented constituents in San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties in California since she was first elected to Congress in 1992. Representative ESHOO has authored and championed significant legislation on healthcare, technology, intelligence and the environment to improve the lives of her constituents and the American people. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama together signed 39 of her bills into law. She recognizes the goodness of the American people, the tremendous value of diversity that immigrants bring into our country and the power of technology to transform and improve our communities. She has a remarkable legacy in her healthcare legislative history. Her work enables states to provide care to women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer. Her reforms made the Food and Drug Administration more effective and responsive. She introduced legislation to eliminate lifetime caps on health insurance 14 years before it was included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Many of Representative ESHOO ’s accomplishments in Congress involve modernizing technology to solve problems. Firstnet, a nationwide public safety network of next generation 911 services, connected public service agencies across the nation, shortening emergency response times and making everyone safer. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative ESHOO played a key role following the September 11th Terrorist Attacks. She chaired the Subcommittee on Intelligence Community Management, where she focused on policy and management challenges affecting all 16 agencies that comprise the U.S. Intelligence Community. She worked to ensure that U.S. intelligence efforts were consistent with our nation’s values, which are embodied in our Constitution. She also worked to modernize our intelligence gathering capabilities and to improve Congress’ ability to construct meaningful oversight of these programs. Because of legislation introduced by Representative ESHOO , thousands of acres of California’s public lands are protected, including preservation of Sand Hill Bluff and significant areas of the California Coastal National Monument, the expansion of the Moffett Field Bay Trail, renovation of the Pigeon Point Lighthouse and the purchase of Bair Island to include in the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. These priceless lands are protected for future generations because of her leadership. Representative ESHOO has received many welldeserved commendations, including the Dean’s Medal Award from the Stanford School of Medicine and the President’s Medal from Menlo College. She received the Angel Award from the Child Abuse Council of Santa Clara County and the Thomas Jefferson International Religious Freedom Champion Award for her work to protect religious minorities in the Middle East. She received the Statesmanship Award from the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress for her work to empower tomorrow’s technology leaders. Mr. Speaker, the Honorable ANNAG. E SHOO  is an important and valued Member of this body. She serves her constituents with great integrity, strength and compassion. It is therefore fitting and proper that we commemorate her for 25 years of service and send her our best wishes as she celebrates this impressive milestone.
