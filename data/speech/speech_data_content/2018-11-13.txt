Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fulbright Program, enacted in 1946 and sponsored by then Senator J. William Fulbright, who represented my home State of Arkansas. This exceptionally American contribution to the world has educated over 360,000 students from 165 countries, including 52 Nobel laureates and 31 heads of state. Every year, Fulbright scholarships are given to more than 2,500 Americans, from all backgrounds and in all stages of life, the chance to spend time abroad and gain a global perspective on today’s most important issues. Two years ago, I had the opportunity to plant a tree on the Capitol Grounds in honor of the 70th anniversary of the Fulbright Program and its Arkansas roots. This program has funded the academic pursuits of countless American and international scholars while building economic prosperity and promoting America’s respect for freedom, the rule of law, and our democratic values. The Fulbright Program has my support, and all of our citizens should encourage this uniquely American mission of friendship. 
SUPPORTING NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of National Adoption Day this coming Saturday. National Adoption Day began in 2000 when seven cities opened courtrooms on the Saturday before Thanksgiving to alleviate the backlog of pending adoptions. Since then, more than 65,000 children have had their adoption finalized during a National Adoption Day celebration. The number of North Carolina children in foster care has been increasing, with last year totaling nearly 11,000. There are more than 425,000 children in foster care nationwide, with over 110,000 awaiting adoption by permanent families. National Adoption Day aims to raise awareness of these children and educate the estimated 47 million Americans who have considered adopting a child in foster care. May this year’s effort be another success by connecting children awaiting adoption with parents who can provide the love and stable environment they need to realize their potential. 
RECOGNIZING KEVIN MOONEY (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of Kevin Mooney to the communities of Scottsbluff, Gering, and western Nebraska. This week, after 34 years as a trusted journalist in Nebraska’s panhandle, Kevin will retire from his position as news director at KNEB radio. Throughout his career, Kevin has received six Mark Twain Awards from the Nebraska Associated Press and the Trailblazer Award from the Scottsbluff/ Gering United Chamber of Commerce. Kevin names the local sugar factory explosion in 1996 as the largest story he reported. He stayed on the air all night providing updates to our community. Kevin is most thankful for his wife, Tracy. He says she has supported him a great deal throughout their 35 years of marriage, given he is on call 24 hours every day. Even with his busy schedule, Kevin has dedicated himself to community and charity events such as the Thanksgiving in the Valley event. It is a collaboration of KNEB radio and local nonprofits ScottsbluffGering Soup Kitchen and Scottsbluff Kiwanis Club. They serve around 400 meals every year on Thanksgiving Day. Please join me in honoring and thanking Kevin Mooney for his service to Nebraska journalism. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 3:45 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 9 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1546 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. TIPTON ) at 3 o’clock and 46 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2740) to posthumously award a Congressional Gold Medal to Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl in recognition of his acts of valor during World War II. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2740 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2017’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl was born in Hungary on October 25, 1903, later moving to Slovakia to study under Rabbi Shumel Dvoid Ungar in Nitra. (2) During his time in Nitra, he quickly became a senior figure within the local Jewish community and Yeshiva. (3) Weissmandl was responsible for some of the daring efforts to save the Jewish people of Slovakia from the Holocaust, which include the establishment of a ‘‘Working Group’’, an underground organization that raised funds to negotiate ransom with German and Slovakian officials in order to delay mass deportations. (4) During the Nazi regime, Weissmandl used his contacts from England to obtain visas, becoming one of the first to actively protect people of Jewish ancestry in Europe. (5) Weissmandl also wrote telegrams to generate awareness of the Jewish people’s plight and encouraged other strategic approaches to stop the Holocaust, including the bombing of railroad tunnels to prevent the transportation of persons to concentration camps. (6) Weissmandl established a Working Group—a wide variety of people from different political and ideological spectrums— whose common goal was to save people from the ‘‘Final Solution’’. (7) The Working Group was one of the first to document in writing the accounts of Auschwitz Escapees in a document widely referred to as the ‘‘Auschwitz Protocols’’. (8) Weissmandl himself later translated the initial documentation from German to Hebrew and included a widely known addendum that pleaded for action. (9) Weissmandl wrote the first known appeal for the use of Allied air resources to disrupt the Holocaust. (10) In 1942 when Slovakia started deportation for ‘‘resettlement’’, Rabbi Weissmandl was the first to inform the Working Group that people were being murdered and not sent to work as originally claimed. (11) Rabbi Weissmandl also played an instrumental role in Solomon Schoenfeld Kindertransport rescue, helping save hundreds of lives. (12) Rabbi Weissmandl came to America and in 1945 immediately got to work to establish a home and Yeshiva for Holocaust survivors. The Yeshiva of Nitra he established in Mount Kisco, New York, was the first Yeshiva campus in America and became and example that other institutions followed. (13) Rabbi Weissmandl has significantly influenced the flourishing communities of Talmudic scholars in Brooklyn, New York, and generally across the United States.

WELCOMING THE HONORABLE JOSEPH D. MORELLE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, as codean of the New York delegation, along with my colleague Congresswoman LOWEY , the New York delegation is pleased to welcome our newest colleague, Joe Morelle, representing New York’s 25th District in upstate New York. Joe has been elected to the seat of our beloved and departed colleague Louise Slaughter. Joe hails from Irondequoit and, like myself, served in the New York State Assembly. He was elected to that body in 1990 and became majority leader in 2013. He graduated from SUNY Geneseo with a bachelor’s degree in political science and began his political career at age 28 as a Monroe County legislator. Congressman Morelle and his wife, Mary Beth, are well known and well loved, and we are so happy to have Joe Morelle as one of our colleagues. Congratulations, Joe. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Morelle). Mr. MORELLE. I thank the Speaker and his staff for the courtesies they have extended to me. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, first of all, my wife, Mary Beth; my entire family; and many dear friends who have traveled to be with us today and those at home watching for their unwavering love and support. I would also like to thank my longtime friend, Congressman ELIOT ENGEL , for that 
kind introduction and the warm welcome all my colleagues in the New York delegation have extended to me. I am humbled to take the oath of office. It is truly the honor of a lifetime to serve New York’s 25th District as a Member of the House of Representatives. Indeed, I have very big shoes to fill. Congresswoman Slaughter was truly a remarkable individual who shattered ceilings and blazed trails. More than that, she was a dear friend to me for over 30 years, and I will be forever grateful for her guidance, devotion, and friendship. It is a special privilege to be able to carry on her vital and important work. I look forward to the days ahead and our work together to support our neighbors in need, to advance society for future generations, and to build a stronger, more vibrant America. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
WELCOMING THE HONORABLE KEVIN HERN TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, it is a tremendous pleasure today to introduce our newest colleague from Tulsa, Oklahoma, the great First District of Oklahoma. Having been a special election baby myself a long time ago, the pressure, the significance of our colleagues when they stand before you in the unique way that they are sworn in is tremendous. So the advice that I have given Congressman HERNI will try and practice myself: brevity. Born on an Air Force base, worked all of his life, earned a degree in engineering and an MBA degree. The thing I love the most, perhaps, is a hog farmer at one point in his career and a very successful restaurateur. KEVIN is an individual who is a reflection of the great First District of Tulsa. He is a reflection, I think, of what we need and want in a Member of this United States House of Representatives. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to our newest colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. HERN). Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, Members of this esteemed body, it is my honor to represent the citizens of Oklahoma’s First Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank my wife, Tammy, of 25 years. I would not be here today without her. My oldest son, Kelby, is here with his wife, Dana; and my youngest son, Kaden, is here. I also want to thank my colleagues from Oklahoma who have gone above and beyond in welcoming me to this body: Congressman LUCAS , Congressman COLE, Congressman R USSELL , and Congressman MULLIN . I cannot thank them enough. The most recent advice they gave me was to keep this very brief, so brief I will be. I have lived the American Dream, growing up without running water to now serving my great country and fellow Oklahomans in Congress. Now, we as a body need to work together to make sure that that dream can be achieved by so many generations to come. Let’s get to work. f 
WELCOMING THE HONORABLE MARY GAY SCANLON TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would invite all of my Pennsylvania colleagues to come up and join me if you would like. Mr. Speaker, as the dean of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation, it is my great pleasure to welcome our newest colleague. For the last 35 years, MARY GAY SCANLON has been a public interest lawyer, working for voting rights, equitable education funding, immigration, and criminal justice reform. She is an advocate for lowincome families, children, women, veterans, and seniors. She and I worked together on securing asylum in this country for the internationally recognized Sudanese human rights activist Hawa Saleh, who was imprisoned and tortured by the Sudanese Government for speaking out against it. And I am pleased to note that Hawa is here in the House gallery today. MARY GAY’s career reflects her deep commitment to aiding and giving back to her community. She has worked tirelessly to help those in need in Pennsylvania, and she now plans to continue that work at the national level here in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to welcome such a dedicated individual to this body. I know we all look forward to working with her and our colleagues in the Pennsylvania delegation to serve the Commonwealth and this great Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ), the senior Republican member of the delegation, for some remarks also. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, obviously, on behalf of our entire delegation, Republicans and Democrats both, we welcome our new colleague to this Chamber and look forward to serving with her. We are pleased to have her here. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON ). Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, Members of the 115th Congress, I am honored to have this opportunity to serve our country. Mr. Speaker, I chose tonight to be sworn in on our Constitution, a document that begins with our uniquely American creed, ‘‘We the people,’’ a charge and a challenge to faithfully represent the people of my district and the entire country, a charge I promise to honor every day with all of my might. I am particularly honored to serve as the advance guard not just for Madeleine Dean, Chrissy Houlahan, and Susan Wild, who will soon join me and our brethren in the Pennsylvania delegation, but also as an advance guard for the army of new Members who will join us for the 116th Congress, a Congress that may look substantially different than the one we see today. I am eager to continue doing the work that we, the people, entrust to the equal branches of this government: To ensure that fairness, civility, and opportunity are available to all and to right the wrongs that hold far too many back; To make sure that the people get a fair shake, whether in their jobs, in our classrooms, in the courts, or in the voting booth; To treat others with civility, particularly here in our Nation’s capital, as we work in service to the people of this great country; To ensure opportunity and safeguard the world we pass on to the next generation. I promise to continue fighting for the underserved, for children and families, for seniors and veterans—to bend the arc of justice for those in need; for students like those on my mock trial team from Constitution High School in Philadelphia, who are the next generation of civic leaders; for veterans like Bob in Media or Pixie in Philadelphia, who want assurance that their benefits will not be treated as simply a line item in our budgets; for families like Malcolm’s in Chester, whose lives have been forever changed by gun violence; and for my friend Hawa Salah, a human rights activist from Darfur who was forced to flee her homeland after her advocacy for oppressed people led to her kidnapping and torture by her own government. I am eager to continue this work right here with all of you. Finally, I am grateful to the voters, to my friends and family, and particularly my husband, Mark, for believing in me, and I hope that I make him proud. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform be discharged from further consideration of the resolution (H. Res. 1138) condemning the antiSemitic attack on the building housing three congregations, Tree of Life, Dor Hadash, and New Light, honoring the memory of the victims of the attack, and offering condolences to and expressing support for their families, friends, and community, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Carolina? Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, although I don’t object, I rise today with a heavy heart. A few short weeks after a gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue building in Pittsburgh, my hometown, and took the lives of 11 innocent people and injured 6 others, I ask the House to pause now to remember those who were taken from us: Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Malinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil and David Rosenthal, Bernice Simon, Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax, and Irving Younger. If we could pause for a moment of silence for these people. b1930 I would also like to honor the law enforcement officers, the first responders, and the medical professionals who heroically responded to the attack. And I continue to wish a full and speedy recovery for those who are wounded. The attack happened because one man had a dark hatred in his heart for the Jewish people. But the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and the city as a whole have proven to be stronger than hate. I want to thank the Bipartisan Taskforce to Combat AntiSemitism for their support and all of the American people who have reached out with their comforting words and support. We all must do more to combat this hate in our neighborhoods and stop these tragedies from happening. This resolution is just a step in the healing process for our city and our country. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Carolina? There was no objection. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 1138 Whereas, on October 27, 2018, an antiSemitic attack took place at the Tree of Life synagogue building in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where members of the Tree of Life, Dor Hadash, and New Light Jewish congregations were engaged in morning Shabbat services, killing 11 and wounding six innocent people; Whereas the people of the United States mourn the lives of Joyce Feinberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Mallinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil Rosenthal, David Rosenthal, Bernice Simon, Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax, and Irving Younger; Whereas the people of the United States hope for the speedy recovery of those who were injured; Whereas the people of the United States are grateful for the swift action of law enforcement, emergency response teams, and medical professionals who responded to the attack; Whereas the attack is believed to the be deadliest assault on Jewish people in American history; Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation finds the majority of religious hate crimes are motivated by antiJewish bias; and Whereas antiSemitism has been increasing for years, including a reported 57 percent rise in antiSemitic incidents from 2016 to 2017, the largest singleyear increase in anti Jewish hate since such data was collected: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives— (1) condemns the horrific, antiSemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue building in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 27, 2018, in which 11 innocent people were killed and six were injured; (2) condemns rising antiSemitism in the United States and around the world; (3) honors the memory of Joyce Feinberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Mallinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil Rosenthal, David Rosenthal, Bernice Simon, Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax, and Irving Younger, who were killed in the attack; (4) expresses hope for a full and speedy recovery by and pledges continued support for those injured in the attack; (5) offers heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the Tree of Life, Dor Hadash, and New Light Jewish congregations, as well 
as the families, friends, loved ones, and communities affected by the tragedy; (6) applauds the dedication and bravery of law enforcement for their efforts to respond to the attack, as well as the service of first responders and medical professionals throughout the Pittsburgh community; (7) stands with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh, the United States, and across the world; (8) reaffirms the commitment of the United States and its allies to defeat anti Semitism in all its forms throughout the world; and (9) supports the right of Americans to freely exercise their religious beliefs and rejects all forms of terror and hate. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment to the text at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Page 3, line 1, strike ‘‘Feinberg’’ and insert ‘‘Fienberg’’. 
The amendment was agreed to. The resolution, as amended, was agreed to. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment to the preamble at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
In the second whereas clause, strike ‘‘Feinberg’’ and insert ‘‘Fienberg’’. In the last whereas clause, insert ‘‘according to the AntiDefamation League’’ after ‘‘2017’’. 
The amendment to the preamble was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DISPENSING WITH MORNINGHOUR DEBATE ON TOMORROW Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the order of the House of January 8, 2018, regarding morninghour debate not apply tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Carolina? There was no objection. 
PERMISSION TO POSTPONE FURTHER PROCEEDINGS ON H.R. 5787, STRENGTHENING COASTAL COMMUNITIES ACT OF 2018 Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5787) to amend the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to give effect to more accurate maps of units of the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System that were produced by digital mapping of such units, and for other purposes, may be postponed through the legislative day of November 16, 2018, as though under clause 8 of rule XX. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Carolina? There was no objection. f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF DAMON NELSON (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, Damon Nelson, the staff director of our House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, passed away a few days ago, and this has left us shocked and saddened. It was my honor to have been selected by the Speaker to serve on this coveted committee, and we all came to know Damon as a kind and gracious gentleman. Always armed with a smile, Damon was there to lend a hand to staffers and Members alike. A veteran of the Persian Gulf war, Damon took pride in his military service, which also afforded him the opportunity to meet his lovely wife, Dana. My heart goes out to you, Dana; to Damon’s family; to our congressional colleague DEVIN; and to all the wonderful folks who had the privilege of calling Damon a friend. Although Damon will no longer walk these hallowed halls, his spirit will forever be forged in the mission of this institution: To serve our citizens with honor and distinction. I was privileged to know such a patriot and fine individual who embodied the characteristics of a public servant. Thank you, Damon, for all you did, and rest easy, my friend. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP WEEK (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, as co chair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, I rise to recognize National Apprenticeship Week. In recent years, we have heard too often about the tremendous skills gap that we have in our country, where too many jobs at companies in our districts go unfilled because workers don’t have the skills to do those jobs that are available. Well, apprenticeships provide valuable onthejob training for students of all ages. By combining practical and theoretical instruction, they allow students to earn while they learn, preparing them for highskilled, highpaying jobs. I have seen the promise of these programs back home. In Rhode Island, Electric Boat has partnered with the Community College of Rhode Island to offer an apprenticeship program at Quonset Point in maritime pipe and structural trades. Apprentices will finish the program with a certificate and an associate’s degree, ready for rewarding careers in highdemand industries. Apprenticeships offer affordable education for students, powerful productivity enhancements for businesses, and big economic returns for our communities. As the number of skilled job openings continues to grow and the workforce continues to age, apprenticeship programs will become even more critical. f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF DR. RICHARD GOTTFRIED (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Dr. Richard Gottfried, whose life was tragically taken, along with 10 other congregants, during the attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on October 27. Raised in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Rich concluded his studies at the University of Pittsburgh Dental School. There, he met Peg Durachko, with whom he enjoyed a beautiful 38year marriage. Rich and Peg ran a local dental practice. They also joyfully gave back to their community, providing dental care to the needy, including immigrants and refugees, at the Catholic Charities Dental Clinic and at the Squirrel Hill Medical Center. Their boundless love was reflected in their full respect of and engagement in each other’s Jewish and Catholic faiths. When not serving as synagogue president or providing dental care, Rich and Peg relished evenings at home on their deck with wine and cigars. What took Rich from us was an act of pure evil, hatred, and antiSemitism. Love must overcome hate, and the love displayed by Rich and Peg, and now continued by her, can lead us all from grieving to healing. May Rich’s memory be a blessing to Peg and his whole community. 
THE APPOINTMENT OF MATTHEW WHITAKER AS ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General of the United States. Mr. Whitaker has repeatedly dismissed the value and seriousness of the Mueller investigation while advising the President on strategies to sabotage it, including through advocating for investigations the DOJ’s own professional staff had already determined were unnecessary. Mr. Whitaker’s broader record on issues of justice is just as disturbing, as the AntiDefamation League found his opposition to the appointment of nonChristian Federal judges to be ‘‘deeply troubling.’’ 
Lastly, Mr. Whitaker’s service as Acting Attorney General has been widely recognized by legal experts from across the political spectrum as unconstitutional because of the clear requirement that principal officers, such as the DOJ’s Secretary, demand Senate confirmation. The United States needs an Attorney General worthy of the office and committed to protecting the efforts of Special Counsel Mueller. But so long as Mr. Whitaker remains in office, he should follow ethical guidelines and recuse himself from the Mueller investigation. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF COLONEL VIC STRAUB (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Veterans Day, I had the privilege of being in St. Marys, Pennsylvania. The American Legion recognized Colonel Vic Straub for his service, and I was honored to be there. As part of the celebration, I presented Colonel Straub with a flag that had been flown over our United States Capitol. Colonel Straub’s personal qualities share a lot in common with the colors of our Stars and Stripes. The red symbolizes his courage, dating back to sitting in the cockpit of a range of experimental planes as an airman. The white symbolizes his purity of purpose and being selfless in all his work. The blue symbolizes his loyalty to his family, his community, and to his country. And the stars, well, what more can I say? Colonel Straub is a talented and proud Air Force guy. Mr. Speaker, one of the privileges of this job as a U.S. Representative is that we are able to meet, help, and thank many people throughout the congressional district. As we honored our veterans throughout the Nation this weekend, let us all remember that freedom is not free. And for that, we can thank a veteran. 
HONORING SERGEANT VINCENT PANTOZZI (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Vincent Pantozzi of Jersey City, New Jersey, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, which was Sunday. Just 2 months after the United States entered World War I, and only 5 years after Mr. Pantozzi immigrated to the United States, he enlisted in the Army. Sergeant Pantozzi served in many pivotal battles in France. He was shot in the knee on June 15, 1918, and then gassed 8 days later. Sergeant Pantozzi spent 3 weeks in a field hospital, recovered, and returned to his post. He was awarded the Purple Heart and many other commendations for his service. In 1919, Sergeant Pantozzi was honorably discharged from the United States Army. The next day, he became a U.S. citizen. Mr. Pantozzi passed away on October 7, 1976, at the age of 82. I ask my colleagues to join me in honor of Sergeant Vincent Pantozzi of Jersey City, New Jersey, an exceptionally dedicated man whose service to our country deserves this recognition. f 
PRAYERS AND SUPPORT FOR THE RESIDENTS OF PARADISE, CALIFORNIA (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart. In my district, just a few days ago broke out a tremendously devastating wildfire. It affected the town of Paradise, California, and has completely destroyed the town and displaced at least 27,000 people, with many missing, their whereabouts unknown. Mr. Speaker, we ask for the prayers of the people of this country for this still unfolding situation. The fires aren’t even all the way out yet. They haven’t investigated everything yet. And they still have many, many missing people there. So what we really need is a little more time to put the fires out, so that we can have reentry and find those who are missing. For those who want to support and help in this country, Mr. Speaker, monetary donations at this time for the Paradise, California, fire, known as the Camp fire, would be the most helpful thing that people can do at this time, to give the most assets and resources, the most helpful for those who are providing and helping with the shelters for so many people who have been displaced. I thank the American people for their prayers and support for our Paradise citizens. 
OPEN ENROLLMENT ENDS DECEMBER 15, 2018 (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to encourage every citizen to sign up for health insurance coverage during open enrollment, which ends on December 15. You still have several weeks. For details about available plans, please visit healthcare.gov or call 1– 800–318–2596. Health insurance is a vital protection that ensures Americans won’t be forced to put off a checkup or worry about going broke if they or a family member gets sick. As many in Ohio know, the average cost for 3 days in the hospital is $30,000. The majority of personal bankruptcies in our country result from healthcare expenditures. There are many affordable health plans on the exchange. In many cases, financial help is even available. In fact, 8 in 10 people qualify for financial help, with most getting a plan for $75 a month or less. Health insurance can provide you and your family with health security and peace of mind, and health insurance pays medical costs when you or a loved one really needs medical care. The marketplace provides access to quality and affordable health coverage. In order to get in touch with someone local to learn more, go to localhelp.healthcare.gov, or call 1–800– 318–2596. Find out how much you can save while signing up for good health insurance. You have until December 15. f
