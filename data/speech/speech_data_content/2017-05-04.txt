Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Small Business Week. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. This week is dedicated to celebrating and recognizing them and their contributions to our Nation. Because of this, I wanted to take a moment to recognize a few stellar small businesses in north central Florida. Archer Automotive and Tire, founded in 2004, came about after a fleet mechanic of over 20 years decided he wanted to open his own shop. Thirteen years later, they have expanded into a stateoftheart facility employing over eight families, allowing them to serve even more of their community. Eat the 80, winner of the Gainesville Chamber of Commerce’s 2016 Leading Women’s Enterprise Award, is a meal delivery service specializing in health food that doesn’t lack flavor or quality. They believe that everyone should have access to a healthy diet, and they built a business that could provide meals for working families. Finally, I would like to recognize Endoscopy Replacement Parts, an aftermarket manufacturer established in 1997. Their 18 years of manufacturing experience, great customer service, and giving back to the community has led them to be recognized as the 2015 Manufacturers Association of Florida’s Manufacturer of the Year, and the 2015 Small Business Administration’s Small Business Exporter of the Year. Mr. Speaker, it is businesses like that that keep our communities vital and growing. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2192, PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT AMENDMENT, AND PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1628, AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 308 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 308 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2192) to amend the Public Health Service Act to eliminate the non application of certain State waiver provisions to Members of Congress and congressional staff. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. P OE of Texas). The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on House Resolution 308, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to bring forward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. Over the past few weeks, the Rules Committee has had the opportunity to hear from numerous stakeholders, from the chairs and ranking members of committees of jurisdiction to the Members who have offered amendments. Most recently, last night we heard testimony from Mr. MACARTHUR and Mr. UPTON to explain their amendments and address any questions from the committee members, and from Ms. MCSALLY to explain her legislation. b0915 This rule provides for further consideration of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act, and incorporates three amendments—the Palmer Schweikert amendment, the MacArthur amendment, and the Upton amendment—that strengthen the underlying bill. It also provides for consideration of H.R. 2192, legislation authored by Representative MCSALLY , with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. Speaker, all across our country, the Affordable Care Act continues to strip hardworking Americans and families of access to affordable, quality medical care and offer them skyrocketing premiums and anemic provider networks in return. Democrats smuggled ObamaCare through with little regard for the procedure, left lofty and empty promises that benefit simply a bureaucratic machine. Seven years later, we have seen these promises evaporate as ObamaCare patients lose access to their doctors and lose the very insurance plans they were promised would remain intact. Our friends across the aisle claim that coverage has been expanded and individuals who never had quality health care before now have access. Mr. Speaker, I wish that were true, but it is not. I wish my colleagues and I didn’t hear from neighbor after neighbor who can’t find a doctor to accept ACA insurance or who avoids medical care altogether because their deductibles reach higher than the clouds. But we do hear from them because Americans are suffering as insurance providers flee from the notsofree market. You see, coverage doesn’t mean access to care. Unfortunately, we have heard all too often that individuals may have health coverage, but they can’t use it because their premiums and deductibles are too high for them to actually afford the care. What good does the coverage do a woman who earns $22,000 a year and has a $5,000 deductible? What good does it do a young family to have insurance that no provider in their community accepts? What good does it do to say we want to grow the economy and create jobs when American businesses are struggling to keep their doors open due to the ObamaCare mandate? We have witnessed insurers dropping out of the exchanges and seen premiums climbing while consumers are left with less and less choice. Five States have one option and no choice for health insurance, and nothing guarantees that their residents will keep that much. ObamaCare has hijacked the free market, and it has taken some Americans’ liberties with it. We must remember that exchanging freedom, choice, selfdetermination for securities at the hands of Big Brother too often leaves us with neither liberty nor security. We know that ObamaCare was designed to make a singlepayer system inevitable. And to the extent that a singlepayer system means a zero choice system, the prophecy has already come true. Families can no longer choose to save for retirement or pay their mortgages because premiums suck up all the oxygen in their budget. Individuals who want to purchase a PPO cannot because their county only offers HMO plans. Disabled Americans who depend on Medicare find that ObamaCare has given more Federal funding to able bodied Americans than our more vulnerable neighbors. In my district, a young mother who wants to take her young son to the family doctor postObamaCare can’t because she can’t find a physician who accepts her new insurance. Brittany Ivey and her husband have struggled under the consequences of the Affordable Care Act. Mrs. Ivey was working parttime at a small business that provided her family with health insurance until the effects of ObamaCare on the insurance market raised her premiums sharply. This drove the Ivey family into the individual market, where a midlevel plan took 65 percent of her monthly gross income, even after a small Federal subsidy. Unable to afford insurance through her employer, Mrs. Ivey turned to the Federal exchange, where she obtained a plan that neither she nor her children’s doctor would accept. The Affordable Care Act robbed Americans of the ability to choose health care that worked for them, and the Affordable Care Act destroyed the insurance market along with the benefits that competition and innovation offer all of us. The American people deserve better. ObamaCare replaced our doctors with bureaucrats because that is what socialized medicine does. The American Health Care Act is our last chance to get off the Federal ferris wheel before we are locked into a healthcare system that takes us nowhere and offers neighbors nothing but heartburn. The American Health Care Act guts the most egregious provisions of ObamaCare, rolls back the law’s taxes, restores flexibility to the States, and helps to make quality care more accessible and affordable. Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons I came to Congress is to repeal and replace ObamaCare and rein in our Nation’s bloated, ballooning entitlement system. The American Health Care Act does that by, for the first time, making major reforms to an entitlement program—Medicaid. It rolls back the Medicaid expansion under ObamaCare, one of the fundamental pillars, and it makes structural changes to the program to ensure it only goes to the individuals it was intended to help. The American Health Care Act allows States to establish work requirements for ablebodied adult Medicaid enrollees. It lets States choose between the per capita cap and a flexible Medicare block grant, and it increases the growth rate to cover disabled and elderly Medicaid populations. The bill enacts patientcentered reforms, increases access to healthcare savings accounts, and creates a Patient and State Stability Fund to help stabilize insurance markets that have contracted during ObamaCare. Over the course of the last several weeks, we have worked in this House to strengthen the bill. We have listened to feedback from constituents, neighbors, stakeholders, and each other. Importantly, coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions is maintained as a baseline within the bill. An 
amendment from Mr. M ACARTHUR further protects individuals’ preexisting conditions from being denied coverage. While the amendment provides States with additional flexibility by allowing them to seek a waiver, individuals with preexisting conditions will not be left out to dry. In fact, there are conditions attached to the waiver that ensure States use funds provided by the bill, should they receive a waiver, to set up highrisk pools for those very individuals. With the addition of the Upton amendment, the bill provides $108 billion to help States fund programs such as highrisk pools. Mr. Speaker, my home State of Georgia has very different needs than California. That is why I think it makes sense to give States more say in what works for their populations. Our plan does this, but it does so in a way that ensures protections exist for vulnerable populations like the elderly, disabled, and children. The rule also provides for Representative MCSALLY ’s legislation to ensure that Members of Congress are treated the same as all Americans. I fully support this bill and firmly believe elected officials should be required to live under the same laws as those they were elected to represent. President Trump has made his support of the American Health Care Act and its strengthening amendments clear, and I stand with him in supporting this legislation to gut ObamaCare and rescue the American people. Mr. Speaker, average premiums rose by 40 percent or more in 11 States just this year. The statistics and the stories speak for themselves. We must act to dismantle ObamaCare, and the Affordable Care Act does that. I support the rule before us today to provide for further improvements to the bill and look forward to supporting both the rule and the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) for the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, pathetic, that is the word to describe this process and this bill. If the American people could sue Congress for malpractice, my Republican friends would be in deep trouble. How could you do this? How could you do this to the American people? How can you do this to the people you represent? You are taking away essential healthcare protections. You are allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. You are supporting a bill that will throw 24 million people off of their health care and cut Medicaid by $880 billion to give a $1 trillion tax break to the wealthiest people in this country. What is wrong with you guys? Today’s rule selfexecutes three of the newest Republican amendments to the Republican health plan. This means, without any sort of debate or discussion whatsoever, the Palmer, MacArthur, and Upton amendments will magically pass the House. What I find so hard to believe about this latest backroom deal is that they actually make this bill worse. I didn’t think that was possible, Mr. Speaker. To shore up support amongst this Chamber’s most conservative faction, Representative MACARTHUR and others made a deal with President Trump to gut protections for individuals with preexisting conditions and to eliminate essential health benefits like maternity care, mental health treatment, and prescription drug coverage, just to name a few. These are among the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The American people were justifiably outraged, and they showed up by the thousands to townhalls to express their anger. And there were some on the Republican side who actually got it. They listened to their constituents and they had the courage to stand up and say no. But when Republican leaders came up short in their whip count, Representative UPTON ran to the White House and concocted a deal with President Trump to try to win back votes. His amendment adds a measly $8 billion spread out over 5 years in a futile attempt to soften the devastating effect that this bill will have on millions and millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. Now, $8 billion over 5 years sounds like a lot, but when we are talking about an entire country, it really isn’t. Don’t take it from me. Robert Graboyes from the conservative Mercatus Center said: ‘‘The $8 billion amount is a pittance. Spread over 5 years, it’s a fifth of a pittance.’’ This is not a leftwing organization. This is an organization funded by Koch Industries, the Koch brothers. My friends love the Koch brothers. What’s more, some analysts have already estimated that an additional $200 billion will be needed over a decade to adequately fund highrisk pools. So this amendment is billions upon billions upon billions of dollars short. And as the Center for American Progress points out, the Upton amendment ‘‘will have almost no effect.’’ Now, my colleagues who have been won over by this should be ashamed of themselves. We are supposed to fix problems and help people, not merely settle for political cover that can be used in a press release. $8 billion to cover a $200 billion shortfall? Back where I come from, we call that being a cheap date. I guarantee you, your constituents are going to figure this out, and they will not be happy. So to socalled moderate Republicans who have contorted themselves this week to try to find a fix to the damage being done to the people with preexisting conditions, I have breaking news: I have a magic bullet fix if Republicans really want to protect people with preexisting conditions. Are you ready? Brace yourselves. Don’t change the law. Everyone is already protected by the Affordable Care Act, including people with preexisting conditions and those who struggle to find affordable care. Let me say to my colleagues that to claim or imply that this Republican plan covers preexisting conditions is a lie, plain and simple. Now, let me say a few words about the process that has been used to bring this bill to the floor. It has been a disaster from start to finish, with secret negotiations, backroom deals, and bribes to buy off factions within the Republican Conference. There have been no hearings on this bill whatsoever. And the Republican leadership couldn’t even slow down long enough to receive a score from the CBO. I have one simple question: What is the rush? Wait a week and get a CBO score. Why is that such a radical idea? Mr. Speaker, are Republican leaders jamming this bill through to appease Donald Trump? Are they concerned that a new CBO score will confirm what we already know is true, that this bill will be devastating to the people of this country, force even more people to lose their health care, especially to older, sick, and lowincome Americans. Or maybe, Mr. Speaker, Republican leaders are worried that their colleagues will go home over this weeklong break and actually hear from their constituents who overwhelmingly oppose this effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Honestly, I don’t know how my Republicans friends can defend this terrible, closed, authoritarian process. It is an absolute disgrace. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, or, better yet, I urge my Republicans colleagues to do what they did a couple of weeks ago and pull this disastrous bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH ), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on the Budget. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, the question every Member of Congress should be asking themselves today is: Who in the world is better off because of today’s bill? It is not the 24 million people the CBO says will lose their health coverage if this bill becomes law. It is not the seniors who will be priced out of the market by an age tax or the millions of families who will see their health care gutted by the more than $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid. It is not the 881,000 nonelderly adults in Kentucky with preexisting conditions who would, once again, face 
staggering health costs with reduced care. So who is better off? Well, certainly corporations and millionaires who will see nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts from this bill. And at least, in their minds, a few Republican Members are so desperate for some type of political victory they are willing to risk the health and well being of their constituents to ram through a bill without hearings, analysis, or, most alarmingly, any sense of morality. That is the cruel tradeoff my Republican colleagues have decided to make. Our families deserve far better. I urge my colleagues to exercise better judgment and vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b0930 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if my colleagues are aware of this since we are moving so quickly here, but I want to flag for everyone an important oped in The Hill by the executive director of the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center. She points out that in the latest version of this legislation, rape can once again be categorized as a preexisting condition as it often was before the Affordable Care Act. I include her column, entitled ‘‘Health ‘reform’ will make sexual assault survivors sick,’’ in the RECORD . 
HEALTH ‘REFORM ’ WILLMAKESEXUAL  ASSAULT SURVIVORS SICK (By Gina Scaramella) So far, we know that about 24 million Americans stand to lose their health insurance coverage if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is replaced with the American Health Care Act (AHCA). We know that most of those 24 million people will be lowincome. We also know that groups of people who experience significant health care disparities, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and Black and Latino people, will be among those who risk losing the most if the ACA is repealed. To that list, we must add survivors of sexual violence. Before passage of the ACA in 2010, sexual assault survivors who had sought medical care for their injuries could be denied health insurance coverage at a later date. The reason? Health insurers often categorized rape as a preexisting health condition. In one widely reported case, a 45yearold woman met two men at a bar in Florida who bought her a drink. Hours later, she found herself lying by the side of the road with injuries indicating that she had been raped and that the men had spiked her drink. Her doctor prescribed a treatment of antiviral, postHIV exposure drugs to protect against HIV transmission. When the woman lost her health insurance several months after the attack, she was unable to obtain new insurance due to the health care treatment she had received for the assault. She went without health insurance for three years. Stories like these prompted the National Women’s Law Center to launch a campaign called ‘‘Being a Woman Is Not a PreExisting Condition.’’ It was so popular that then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi adopted the phrase in her prohealth reform talking points with media, and the New York Times ran an explainer on the ways in which health insurers treated women as if they were just one giant preexisting condition. The AHCA initially retained the ACA’s ban on discrimination against people with pre existing conditions. But an amendment to the AHCA bill offered last week by New Jersey Congressman Tom MacArthur and North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows would make it easier for health insurers to deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions. By letting states waive the ACA prohibition on charging people with preexisting health conditions higher premiums, protections for those who’ve previously been medically treated for sexual assault would be gutted. Perhaps more alarming, though, is the MacArthurMeadows amendment’s provision allowing states to also seek waivers from the ACA’s requirement that essential health benefits be covered by health insurance plans. Essential health benefits include preventive health care services that most of us take for granted. These include tests for blood pressure and cholesterol, mammograms, and vaccinations. Essential health benefits also include coverage for mental health care and substance abuse treatment. Sexual violence survivors face acute treatment needs in the aftermath of an assault such as care for gynecological injuries, other physical trauma, sexuallytransmitted diseases, and pregnancy. But sexual violence takes many forms: incest: ongoing sexual abuse outside of the family, sexual assault, sexual harassment or exploitation, and rape. Each of these types of assault puts the survivor at risk for various potential negative physical health and mental health outcomes. For example, an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse is at a higher risk for psychiatric disorders. Women and men who have survived rape as adults are at higher risk of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse—any of which can significantly interfere with daily living. No one can deny that there is a direct line between having survived sexual violence, and an increased risk of physical and mental health problems. The mental health impacts of sexual violence are deep and often longstanding. Survivors need longterm access to nonjudgmental health and mental health services to reduce their suffering and mitigate as much as possible the stress that recovery from sexual violence puts on intimate family relationships, and obligations related to school and work. It is hard to see any good coming from this latest attempt to repeal the ACA and all of the care it has brought to survivors of sexual violence. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DELBENE). Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, this destructive legislation hurts middle class families and threatens massive disruption to our healthcare system. And it has only gone from bad to worse. Stripping protections from 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions isn’t just wrong, it is inhumane. Nobody in this country should go bankrupt trying to afford the medical care they need to stay alive. This isn’t about politics; it is about human decency and who we are as Americans. It is about people like Jackie, a cancer survivor from Snohomish who says the Affordable Care Act saved her life. She wrote to me saying: ‘‘My cancer recurred, but I was covered. I was able to complete my treatments without having to worry about how to put food on the table. Or being left to die. Because of the ACA, I survived.’’ We all have stories like this in our districts, but some of my colleagues aren’t listening. I hope they find the courage and the wisdom to vote ‘‘no’’ on this dangerous legislation. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO ). Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Republicans, over the last few months, have said that they would fundamentally change health care in the United States, and it is clear today that they have. They have made it much worse. I want to highlight one provision that allows for States to permit insurers to get rid of essential healthcare benefits and charge people more who have preexisting conditions. Think about that for a second. In my home State of Texas, the Governor and other State leaders have already turned their back on so many people, allowing foster care children to sleep in State offices, allowing sex trafficking and human trafficking victims to go to jail because there is nowhere else to put them. You should ask yourselves: What will your leaders do? Will they allow insurers to charge you more for preexisting conditions like diabetes and hypertension and cancer and asthma? Do you think, and do you trust, that they are going to do the right thing by you? Because today, this plan allows them to abandon you. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. At this time, I think one of the interesting things is, as discussed, the criticism of this. I think it was just a reminder, Mr. Speaker, of what happened 7 years ago when our healthcare market, which could have been helped by many good ideas, was decided to be taken on a very unhealthy bent. We are now paying the price for that. We are going to continue to see that unless we change it. We are changing that for the better. One of the strongest voices that we have had in this body is someone who has actually taken it as his living to take care of people. Dr. BURGESS not only came to this Congress with a strong voice of not only what doctors and the medical profession have, but I think it gives us an insight into what patients need as well. He has been a clarion voice through this whole process, before ObamaCare, during the disaster of ObamaCare, and now as we look to fix the problems that have existed. I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ). Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, how did we get to this point? 
The Affordable Care Act is simply not working for the American people. It is limiting choices. It is raising costs. It is leaving millions without access to care. And unfortunately, these are not just talking points but very real issues affecting very real Americans. The Affordable Care Act has left the individual market in shambles and has driven insurers away from offering coverage. Now, we are seeing onethird of all counties in the United States of America with only a single insurer. And among the plans that have chosen to remain in these markets, there have been widespread, doubledigit premium increases. In Texas, premiums have jumped 29 percent a year, on average, from 2014 to 2017. The markets are in difficulty. They are failing to live up to the promise made 7 years ago, that Americans would be able to receive ‘‘affordable care.’’ As we knew then, and we still know now, this was an empty promise and has priced over 19 million Americans out of the market. What is worse, these individuals are forced to pay the individual mandate penalty or seek a hardship exemption because of the cost to purchase and use their health insurance. Mr. Speaker, 11 months ago, Speaker RYAN released the Better Way plan to save the Nation’s healthcare system and to bring relief to the American people. This plan, which served as the blueprint for the American Health Care Act, laid out policies to stabilize the markets damaged by the Affordable Care Act, repeal the burdensome Affordable Care Act taxes and mandates that have hindered innovation and limited access to care. So let’s take a look at what the American Health Care Act does. First and foremost, the American Health Care Act provides immediate relief to the State insurance markets. As Republicans, we know that onesize fitsall works for no one, and certainly did not work for the individual markets. The States should have the flexibility to support their insurance markets and ensure that plans can continue to provide options for coverage. To do this, we relax two of the more egregious market regulations that were imposed under the Affordable Care Act: the mandate that premiums cannot vary for younger and older Americans by more than a 3to1 ratio and the mandate creating fixed actuarial values for plans. The mandate limiting a plan’s ability to set premiums by age has driven up the cost of coverage for younger and healthier Americans and, subsequently, pushed them away from seeking coverage by the millions. Of the over 19 million Americans who have sidestepped the individual market, it is estimated that as many as 45 percent of these individuals are under the age of 35. Without these younger Americans seeking coverage, the markets have plunged, as insurers have hiked up premiums year after year to compensate for unhealthy risk pools. To change this, there is relaxation of the 5to1 ratio. It will lower premium costs and provide necessary opportunities to stabilize markets. We also give States the option, the choice to go higher or go lower, which honors the spirit of federalism. Additionally, we are repealing the actuarial values mandate to provide insurers with additional flexibility to offer more coverage options. The requirement for insurers to offer specified Bronze, Silver, and Gold level tiers has limited consumer choice, driving even more individuals away from seeking coverage and further contributing to the collapse of the healthcare markets. To further supplement these efforts, we are establishing the Patient and State Stability Fund. This fund provides States access to a total of over $140 billion over 10 years to promote innovative solutions to lower costs and increase access to health care for their unique patient populations. Mr. Speaker, the goal is simple, to provide States with maximum flexibility in how they address the cost of care for their citizens. The American Health Care Act provides States with options for how to use funds, including providing financial assistance for high cost individuals, incentivizing insurer participation in those markets, reducing the cost of insurance, promoting access to preventive services, and reducing outofpocket costs for patients. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a combination of the Stability Fund and other proconsumer changes would reduce premiums by 10 percent below current projections of 2026. We want patients to have access to highquality, affordably priced health coverage. The Patient and State Stability Fund can help States lower costs and can increase access to high quality health care for their citizens. In addition to supporting the insurance markets, the American Health Care Act creates needed reforms to the Medicaid program itself. Without any changes, the current Medicaid expansion is expected to cost $1 trillion in 10 years’ time—$1 trillion a year in 10 years’ time. Medicaid needs reform so that States can continue to provide coverage to children, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups, the very populations that this safety net program was created to serve. To address these concerns, the American Health Care Act first phases out the Medicaid expansion, not traditional Medicaid but Medicaid expansion. The expansion has hurt State budgets and limited States’ abilities to ensure that resources will continue to be available for the vulnerable populations for which Medicaid was designed. By phasing out expansion, we are providing States with greater budget autonomy. Additionally, our bill helps further bend the Medicaid cost curve by shifting the program toward a per beneficiary allotment. Per beneficiary allotments set limits on the annual growth for per capita expenditures for which the States will receive matching funds from the Federal Government. Per beneficiary allotments create greater fiscal accountability and ensure that the program can continue to exist for years to come. This is not a new idea. This was an idea put forward by President Bill Clinton and, at one time, supported by every Democratic Member of the Senate in 1995. Second, the American Health Care Act increases the amount of flexibility that States have in managing their Medicaid program. The bill scales back the Affordable Care Act mandates that have limited a State’s ability to tailor plans toward the needs of beneficiaries. States can and States should be trusted to effectively manage the needs of their Medicaid beneficiaries. The American Health Care Act will allow them to do so. Additionally, the American Health Care Act furthers the goal of providing the States with greater flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs by providing States with the option to implement two additional opportunities: work requirements and block grants for Medicaid. When the Affordable Care Act was being debated, some of the most consistent complaints that we heard throughout the discussion came from Governors and State representatives expressing concerns about the negative consequences that they saw on the horizon. This time around, we chose to engage our State counterparts in the discussion and listen to their input as we designed the bill; and at the top of their list was a desire to see the work requirements built into the Medicaid and the expansion populations, and the opportunity to work with Medicaid as a block grant. Republicans trust that States know what works for their respective populations, and we are not going to stand in the way of States seeking to design Medicaid programs that work for them. Finally, the American Health Care Act provides additional resources to bolster State safety net providers. The bill provides increases to the Community Health Center Fund, offers enhanced funding to support the safety net providers in States that did not expand Medicaid, and ends the cuts to Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, cuts that are going to occur under current law on October 1 of this year. We are committed to ensuring that our local providers can continue to deliver lifesaving care and that the American Health Care Act turns this commitment into action. For the millions of Americans in rural and medically underserved areas, these actions 
will provide needed relief that was undercut by the Affordable Care Act and will allow these Americans to continue to have access to care. Moving forward, together, these efforts will provide meaningful reform and relief for the States and for the individuals seeking health care. We are stabilizing the markets, reforming Medicaid in the most substantive and consequential way in its 52year history, and ensuring that all Americans can maintain access to care through local safety net providers. We do recognize there is still more work to be done in health care, and that is why we only consider the American Health Care Act to be the beginning. It is the key that gets us through the door into additional health reform. From here, we will work with Secretary Price at the Department of Health and Human Services to further deregulate the marketplace and increase consumer choice in the healthcare markets, and we will enhance the American Health Care Act with additional legislative efforts to further the goal of lowering healthcare costs. Mr. Speaker, this should be a very exciting time in health care. With all of the knowledge that has been gained over the years in the practice of medicine, I am humbled to be here today speaking in support of this legislation. It will begin the muchawaited process of unwinding the Affordable Care Act and will finally return patients to the center of health care. b0945 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, wow. I yield myself such time as I may consume, and to rebut the gentleman from Texas, let me include in the RECORD a letter from the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, and the National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease. 
LEADING PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS REMAIN  OPPOSED TO THE AMERICAN HEALTH CAREACT 
CRITICIZING UPTON AGREEMENT  WASHINGTON , May 3, 2017.—Earlier today, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (ROR) issued a press release stating that an amendment proposed by Representative Fred Upton (RMI) to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) provides ‘‘protection and certainty for patients with preexisting conditions.’’ Eight leading patient groups, listed below, issued the following statement in response: Despite the Upton amendment, we remain strongly opposed to the American Health Care Act and urge Congress to consider the people at the heart of this decision. The various patchwork solutions offered by lawmakers would still leave the millions of patients we represent, who have serious and chronic health conditions, at risk of not being able to access lifesaving treatments and care. There is no substitute for fundamental, unequivocal protections for people with preexisting conditions. The AHCA, including the potential amendment, would undermine vital safeguards against being charged more for insurance based on health status. Increasing funding for risk sharing programs and consumer financial assistance does not address the legitimate challenges built into these proposals. The other equally important problems with the AHCA remain, including: Allowing states to waive the guarantee of essential health benefits, which would: Segment the market into plans for sick people and plans for healthy people, driving up the cost of plans for people with serious health care needs Undermine the protection against annual and lifetime coverage caps, a critical safeguard for patients Eliminating Medicaid expansion coverage for millions of Americans and altering the program’s financing structure in a way that jeopardizes coverage of new and innovative treatments Increasing outofpocket costs for many Americans, including some of the sickest and elderly among us Given the numerous shortcomings of the American Health Care Act in serving the patients we represent, our organizations have no choice but to oppose this legislation and urge all Representatives to vote against it, with or without the Upton and MacArthur amendments.

[From the American Medical Association, May 3, 2017] AMA WARNS THAT PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE  AMERICAN HEALTH CAREACTDONOTREMEDYBILL’SSHORTCOMINGS  
AMERICANS WOULD STILL LOSE HEALTH IN SURANCE COVERAGE  CHICAGO .—American Medical Association (AMA) President Andrew W. Gurman, M.D., issued the following statement today about proposed changes to the American Health Care Act (AHCA): ‘‘None of the legislative tweaks under consideration changes the serious harm to patients and the health care delivery system if AHCA passes. Proposed changes to the bill tinker at the edges without remedying the fundamental failing of the bill—that millions of Americans will lose their health insurance as a direct result of this proposal. ‘‘Highrisk pools are not a new idea. Prior to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 35 states operated highrisk pools, and they were not a panacea for Americans with pre existing medical conditions. The history of highrisk pools demonstrates that Americans with preexisting conditions will be stuck in secondclass health care coverage—if they are able to obtain coverage at all. ‘‘Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance coverage for millions of Americans, the legislation would, in many cases, eliminate the ban against charging those with underlying medical conditions vastly more for their coverage.’’ ‘‘America should not go backward to the time when our fellow citizens with preexisting health conditions faced high costs for limited coverage, if they were able to obtain coverage at all. The AMA urges congressional leaders and the Administration to pursue a bipartisan dialogue on alternative policies that provide patients with access and coverage to high quality care and preserve the safety net for vulnerable populations.’’ BACKGROUND ON HIGH RISK POOLS  A January report from the American Academy of Actuaries notes that ‘‘enrollment has generally been low, coverage has been limited and expensive, they require external funding, and they have typically operated at a loss . . . Removing highrisk individuals from the insured risk pools reduces costs in the private market only temporarily. Over time, even lowercost individuals in the individual market can incur high health care costs, which would put upward pressure on premiums.’’ According to the Kaiser Family Foundation: State highrisk pools featured premiums above standard nongroup market rates— with most states capping them at 150%–200% of standard rates. Many also featured high deductibles, some $5,000 or more. Despite the fact that many individuals were forced into highrisk pools because of a preexisting condition, nearly all states excluded coverage for these conditions for 6–12 months. Almost all highrisk pools imposed lifetime limits on covered services, and some imposed annual limits. Some states capped or closed enrollment. Combined net losses for the state highrisk pools totaled more than $1.2 billion for 2011, or $5,510 per enrollee, on average. Furthermore, a 2010 paper by James Capretta and Tom Miller that appeared in National Affairs estimated that the cost of adequately funded high risk pools would be $15 billion to $20 billion per year. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the RECORD a letter from the American Academy of Family Physicians in opposition to this bill. 
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF  FAMILY PHYSICIANS , May 3, 2017. JIMMCGOVERN , Representative, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREP. JIMMCGOVERN : Despite recent activities and amendments, the American Health Care Act (H.R. 1628) remains a highly flawed proposal that will destabilize our health care system, cause significant loss of coverage, and allow for the discrimination against patients based on their gender, age, and health status. For these reasons, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) continues to oppose the AHCA and 
encourages the House of Representatives to reject this failed policy. The fact remains that the AHCA will: Cause more than 24 million people to lose their health care coverage, including more than 7 million with employersponsored coverage. Destabilize the individual health insurance market. Create a race to the bottom by eliminating any standards with respect to minimum insurance benefits. Enact draconian cuts in the Medicaid program that will have an immediate negative impact on lowincome individuals, children, and millions of senior citizens who rely on the program. Eliminate community rating and return to medical underwriting, thus allowing insurers to discriminate against individuals based on their gender, age, and health status. Deny individuals protection against annual and lifetime spending caps, thus threatening the financial stability of millions of individuals and families in the future. Over the past few days there has been an effort to advance policies that seek to protect individuals with preexisting conditions from facing discrimination in insurance underwriting as a result of their health status. Despite a willingness to spend more money on these proposals, the current efforts on preexisting conditions fail to accomplish their goal. Highrisk pools are inherently flawed and expensive. The proposals under consideration provide inadequate funding for an inadequate period of time, thus creating an underfunded and temporary solution for the millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. We find it regrettable that Congress would seek to relegate individuals with high health care needs to a program that has a questionable history and would face uncertain financial stability in the future. By removing critical consumer protections that collectively ensure that the millions of individuals with preexisting conditions can continue to purchase affordable health care coverage, the AHCA would result in higher premiums and higher deductibles for millions. Additionally, the negative impact of the AHCA is not limited to the individual insurance market. These policies also may impact the more than 130 million people with employersponsored insurance. Thank you. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the RECORD a statement from the AARP in strong opposition to this bill. 
AARP, May 3, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : Older Americans care deeply about access to and affordability of health care. With the addition of the Upton Amendment, as reported, we once again write to share our opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and urge you to vote NO. Changes under consideration that would allow states to waive important consumer protections—allowing insurance companies to once again charge Americans with preexisting conditions more because they’ve had cancer, diabetes or heart disease—would make a bad bill even worse. This would be devastating for the 25 million Americans 50–64 who have a deniable preexisting condition. The Upton amendment would do little to reduce the massive premium increases for those with preexisting conditions. Throughout consideration of the AHCA, we have been expressing serious concerns about the impact that this legislation will have on older Americans. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)’s last estimate further demonstrates the harmful impact of this bill on older Americans and some of our most vulnerable. Specifically, the American Health Care Act will weaken the fiscal sustainability of Medicare; dramatically increase premium and outofpocket costs for 50–64 year olds purchasing coverage on the individual insurance market; allow insurance companies to once again discriminate against those with preexisting conditions; substantially increase the number of Americans without insurance; and put at risk millions of children and adults with disabilities and poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program to access longterm services and supports and other benefits. Our members and others 50 years of age and older care deeply about health care and want to know where their elected leaders stand. Recognizing the importance of the upcoming vote on the American Health Care Act, AARP intends to inform our members, and others over age 50, how their elected officials voted. We’ll communicate the results of the vote in our widelycirculated publications, in email alerts, in our online channels, and through the media. Again, we urge all Representatives to vote NO on the American Health Care Act in its current form. MEDICARE  The American Health Care Act repeals provisions in current law that have strengthened Medicare’s fiscal outlook, specifically, the repeal of the additional 0.9 percent payroll tax on higherincome workers. Repealing this provision would remove billions from the Hospital Insurance trust fund, hasten the insolvency of Medicare, and diminish Medicare’s ability to pay for services in the future. 
INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE INSURANCE MARKET  Currently, about 25 million Americans age 50–64 have a preexisting condition, about 6.1 million purchase insurance in the nongroup market, and nearly 3.2 million are currently eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance coverage through either the federal health benefits exchange or a statebased exchange (exchange). Since passage of the ACA, the number of 50–64 year old Americans who are uninsured has dropped by half. We are deeply concerned that the AHCA would be a significant step backwards and result in millions of older Americans who cannot afford their health care, including many simply losing their health care. Based on CBO estimates, approximately 14 million Americans will lose coverage next year, while a total of 24 million Americans would lose coverage over the next 10 years. Affordability of both premiums and cost sharing is critical to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access health care. A typical 50–64 year old seeking coverage through an exchange has a median annual income of under $25,000 and already pays significant outofpocket costs for health care. We have serious concerns—reinforced by the CBO estimate—that the bill under consideration will dramatically increase health care costs for 50–64 year olds who purchase health care through an exchange due both to the changes in age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that requires uninsured older Americans to pay three times more than younger individuals) to 5:1 (or more) and reductions in current tax credits for older Americans. CBO concluded that the bill will substantially raise premiums for older people and force many into lower quality plans. Age rating plus reduced tax credits equal an unaffordable age tax. Our previous estimates on the agerating change showed that premiums for current coverage could increase by up to $3,200 for a 64 year old. In addition, the bill reduced the tax credits available for older Americans to help purchase insurance. We estimate that the bill’s changes to current law’s tax credits alone could increase premium costs by more than $5,800 for a 64year old earning $15,000. Overall, both the bill’s tax credit changes and 5:1 age rating would result in skyrocketing cost increases for older Americans. In their analysis, CBO found that a 64 year old earning $26,500 a year would see their premiums increase by $12,900—758 percent—from $1,700 to $14,600 a year. Current law prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against individuals due to a preexisting condition. The bill would repeal preexisting condition protections and would once again allow insurance companies to charge Americans more—we estimate up to $25,000 more—due to a preexisting condition. As a result, the 40 percent of 50 to 64 yearolds (about 25 million people) who have a deniable preexisting condition risk losing access to affordable coverage. The Upton Amendment, which would add funds to address the impact of premium increases for those with preexisting conditions, would do little to mitigate the massive premium increase for some of the most vulnerable Americans. AARP strongly opposes any weakening of the law’s preexisting condition protections which benefit millions of Americans. MEDICAID AND LONG TERM SERVICES AND  
SUPPORTS  AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act that create a per capita cap financing structure in the Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of individuals who depend on the essential services provided through Medicaid. CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid funding by $880 billion over 2017– 2026, about 25 percent less than what it projects under current law. Medicaid is a vital safety net and intergenerational lifeline for millions of individuals, including over 17.4 million lowincome seniors and children and adults with disabilities who rely on the program for critical health care and longterm services and supports (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, managing medications, and transportation). Older adults and people with disabilities now account for over sixty percent of Medicaid spending, and cuts of this magnitude will result in loss of benefits and services for this vulnerable population. Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65 and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost 33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid spending. Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and communitybased services (HCBS) for assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as hearing aids and eyeglasses. In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person, this approach to financing would likely result in overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and families unable to shoulder the costs of care without sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to program eligibility, services, or both—ultimately harming some of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens. 
The bill also repeals the six percent enhanced federal Medicaid match for states that take up the Community First Choice (CFC) Option. CFC provides states with a financial incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and people with disabilities live in their homes and communities where they want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in Medicaid, the cost of HCBS per person is onethird the cost of institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could disrupt services for older adults and people with disabilities in the states that are already providing services under CFC and would result in a loss of about $12 billion for HCBS over ten years. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS  The AHCA would repeal the fee on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is projected to add $24.8 billion to the Medicare Part B trust fund between 2017 and 2026. Rather than repeal this fee for Medicare, AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce the burden of high prescription drug costs on consumers and taxpayers, and we urge action on bipartisan solutions. AARP remains willing to work with you to ensure that we maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust insurance market protections, controls costs, improves quality, and provides affordable coverage to all Americans. However, the AHCA does not accomplish these goals, and we continue to urge you to vote NO. Sincerely, NANCY A. L EAMOND, Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, if this bill were so great, these organizations would be supporting the Republican bill, not opposing it; and they are strongly opposing it. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the harsh indifference of these Republicans to the wellbeing of so many Americans is startling. Trump may temporarily bury the lies central to this plan with a tweet storm—with fake news. But these Republicans who follow him will not be able to find an excuse as one family after another suffers. Today’s surprise attack on American health care has been widely condemned by healthcare professionals across the country and those who represent the disabled and sick, like the American Cancer Society and the March of Dimes. Jimmy Kimmel, know that your baby was fortunate, but others born with a disability will face the barrier of preexisting conditions. They didn’t listen to the AARP, which knows that those Americans too young for Medicare by a few years will get socked with unaffordable premiums. They don’t know what this monstrosity of a bill costs to the taxpayer. They don’t know how many families will lose coverage or how many jobs will be lost. They don’t really know what is in this bill. They know only that the Pied Piper of Trump Tower is playing a tune today and they must dance. There is much talk about highrisk pools. The real highrisk pool is the one that everyone who votes for this outrageous proposal is about to plunge into. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGH TER), the ranking member of the Rules Committee. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank my colleague for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I was fortunate enough to bring the ACA to the floor after years of working on it and experts writing it. It had such incredible things in it. I think it would behoove us this morning to talk about what every one of us who has health insurance is going to lose because the benefits of the ACA accrued to all of us. Now, you need to know first that we are going to lose the fact that 85 cents of every premium dollar will go for health care. It will go back to insurance profits. We are also going to lose the fact that families could no longer go bankrupt because of health care. The largest cause of bankruptcy are families with medical bills, and the ACA took care of that. Nobody ever talks about that much, but if a single person spent $4,500 a year on health care, a family $12,500, the insurance companies picked up the rest of it. How about that? That is a pretty good loss that we are going to face. So why in the world are we rushing into this thing? Well, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, verified as recently as last Saturday evening in Pennsylvania that we have to do this first because $800 billion has to come out of health care so that they could do the tax bill with great corporate tax relief for the 1 percent. So as you lose your health care, your ability to go to the doctor, and your preexisting conditions because risk pools don’t work, be comforted by the fact that we are in the hands of people who put the needs of corporations and wealthy people ahead of the citizens of the United States. Just in case you think people aren’t paying any attention, for the first time in my life, my office has 185 applications for six seats as interns in the summertime. It is unheard of. Calls in my office have gone from about 10 a day to 80, all of them talking about this. I have never seen political suicide in my life like I am seeing today. I think our leader put it so succinctly: you are tattooing that on your foreheads. Now, those people out there who have really gotten sort of used to this, all we have heard all the way through is that this is going to fall apart. The problems going on with the ACA right now are that the insurance companies have uncertainty because of what has been going on here. I need to bring up one of the greatest hoaxes in America in any institution that passes laws. For over 60 times, you brought to the floor of this House and we debated bills to do away with the health care. ‘‘Repeal and replace,’’ you shouted. Millions and millions of dollars’ worth of time on this floor were spent on what was absolutely a hoax because you had no repealandreplace plan. It was simply all talk, and now you have got to rush through this so you can do your big tax bill. I am sorry to see this happen. It is a sad day for the United States. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I feel bad for the gentleman because it appears as if he only has one speaker supporting this rule and the bill, and nearly our entire caucus wants to speak on this against the Republican healthcare repeal bill. So I was wondering whether the gentleman might consider sharing some time with us? Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. As a wonderful manager of time, he will be able to parse the time as best he may see fit. I have other speakers who probably will be coming by, so I will just encourage the manager to manage his time well. Mr. MCGOVERN. It looks kind of lonely over there. It speaks volumes about how much support there is for this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, now I have to say to my friends on the other side: You sold out cheap—as we say in New Jersey—all to give a tax cut to insurance companies and the most well off. The Upton amendment is, of course, an admission. After 7 years, you came up with this? You have got to be kidding me. This is worse than a Fellini movie. At least he didn’t take 7 years to distinguish between fantasy and reality. For a New Jerseyan with asthma, this will mean a $4,340 premium surcharge; for autism, $5,510. The list goes on and on—60, $70,000 if you have cancer. But less discussed is their attempt to rid the essential health benefits which removes yet another ACA protection for everyone. So now the Republicans have hit for the cycle. You hit for the cycle. You jeopardized the health care of nearly every single American—those on Medicare, those on Medicaid, those in the ACA exchanges, and now 150 million people with employer coverage. You sold out. It is a shame. I like most of you, but you are on the wrong path. It took you 7 years for this? I will never yield. I will never yield. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair, not to each other. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the 
American College of Physicians in opposition to the bill. 
AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS , April 24, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Majority Leader, Washington, DC. Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER , Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN, M INORITY LEADER  PELOSI , MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL , AND MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER : On behalf of the American College of Physicians (ACP), I am writing to urge Congress to move away from the harmful changes to patient care that would occur if the American Health Care Act (AHCA) were to become law, and to instead work for bipartisan solutions to improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rather than repealing and replacing it. We believe that the AHCA, which would repeal and replace the most important coverage and consumer protections created by the ACA, is so fundamentally flawed that it cannot be made acceptable. We understand that the leadership in the House of Representatives continues to explore ways to bring a modified version of the AHCA to a vote, based on a draft amendment reportedly being developed by Representatives MacArthur and Meadows, a summary of which was made available to the public through news organizations. This amendment would make the harmful AHCA even worse by creating new coverage barriers for patients with preexisting conditions and weakening requirements that insurers cover essential benefits. The American College of Physicians is the largest medical specialty organization and the secondlargest physician group in the United States. ACP members include 148,000 internal medicine physicians (internists), related subspecialists, and medical students. Internal medicine physicians are specialists who apply scientific knowledge and clinical expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and compassionate care of adults across the spectrum from health to complex illness. The draft MacArthurMeadows amendment would create what is known as the ‘‘Limited Waiver Option’’ that would allow states to eliminate or severely weaken vital ACA Title I consumer protections—specifically, community rating and essential health benefits (EHBs)—returning the country to the preACA days when persons with preexisting ‘‘declinable’’ medical conditions in most states were priced out of the market and the insurance products available in the individual market did not cover medically necessary services. Specifically: The MacArthurMeadows amendment would create an option for states to obtain Limited Waivers from certain federal standards that would gut existing law consumer protections. Based on a summary of the draft amendment, states could seek Limited Waivers for: Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) Communityrating rules, except for the following categories, which are not waivable: Gender or Age (except for reductions of the 5:1 age ratio previously established) or Health Status (unless the state has established a highrisk pool or is participating in a federal highrisk pool) To obtain the waiver, states would only need to ‘‘attest that the purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce premium costs, increase the number of persons with healthcare coverage, or advance another benefit to the public interest in the state, including the guarantee of coverage for persons with preexisting medical conditions. The Secretary shall approve applications within 90 days of determining that an application is complete.’’ [Emphasis added in italics]. In other words, as long as a state attested that there was a ‘‘benefit to the public,’’ insurers would be once again allowed to charge more to people with preexisting conditions, or decline to cover needed benefits like physician and hospital visits, maternity care and contraception, mental health and substance use disorder treatments, preventive services, and prescription drugs. This would take us back to the days when people had to fill out intrusive insurance company applications to document their previous health history, even before being advised what the premium would be based on their individual health risk. Unlike community rating, which bases premiums based on the expected costs associated with all persons in the insurance pool (adjusted only by age, tobacco use, and family size), the Limited Waiver would again allow insurers in states that obtain a waiver to again charge people exorbitant and unaffordable premiums for their preexisting conditions. Before the ACA, insurance plans sold in the individual insurance market in all but five states typically maintained lists of so called ‘‘declinable’’ medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, arthritis, obesity, stroke, or pregnancy, or having been diagnosed with cancer in the past 10 years. Even if a revised bill would not explicitly repeal the current law’s guaranteedissue requirement which requires insurers to offer coverage to persons with preexisting conditions like these guaranteed issue without community rating allows insurers to charge as much as they believe a patient’s treatment will cost. The result would be that many patients with preexisting conditions would be offered coverage that costs them thousands of dollars more for the care that they need, and in the case of patients with expensive conditions like cancer, even hundreds of thousands more. An amendment to the AHCA reported out of the Rules Committee on April 6th to establish a ‘‘Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program,’’ which would create a fund that states could use to reimburse insurers for some of the costs associated with insuring sicker patients, would not offset the harm done to patients with preexisting conditions by allowing the Limited Waiver of community rating and essential benefit protections. The preACA experience with highrisk pools was that many had long waiting lists, and offered inadequate coverage with high deductibles and insufficient benefits. Unless a national highrisk pool is supported with a massive infusion of funding it will not be sufficient to cover the millions of people with preexisting conditions that would be denied or charged more for coverage under the AHCA. One paper estimates that a national highrisk pool would cost $178.1 billion a year, roughly $176.4 billion more than the annual funding provided to the Invisible Risk Sharing Program. Also, shifting people out of the existing health insurance marketplace to a highrisk pool would undermine the assurance that enrollees could keep their existing coverage. The Limited Waiver Option will also allow states to seek waivers from the essential health benefits required of all plans sold in the individual insurance market, with the result that millions of patients will be at risk of losing coverage for essential services like maternity care, cancer screening tests and treatments, prescription drugs, preventive services, mental health and substance use disorder treatments, and even physician visits, prescription drugs and hospitalizations. Prior to passage of the ACA, 62% of individual market enrollees did not have coverage of maternity services, 34 did not have substanceuse disorderservices, 18% did not have mentalhealth services and 9% did not have coverage for prescription drugs. A recent independent analysis found that the AHCA’s repeal of current law required benefits would result in patients on average paying $1,952 more for cancer drugs; $1,807 for drugs for heart disease; $1,127 for drugs to treat lung diseases; $1,607 for drugs to treat mental illnesses; $4,940 for inpatient admission for mental health; $4,555 for inpatient admission for substance use treatment; and $8,501 for maternity care. Such increased costs would make it practically impossible for many patients to avail themselves of the care they need. The result will be delays in getting treatment until their illnesses present at a more advanced, less treatable, and more expensive stage, or not keeping up with lifesaving medications prescribed by their physicians. Allowing states to eliminate the EHB will threaten our nation’s fight against the opioid epidemic. A study concluded that with repeal of the ACA, ‘‘approximately 1,253,000 people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage.’’ Finally, allowing states to drop important benefits like maternity, substance use disorder treatment, and preventive services will do little to reduce premiums. A report by Milliman found that the main drivers of premium costs were ambulatory patient services, hospitalization, and prescription drugs. These are crucial services that form the core of any health insurance plan. To be clear: while some younger and healthier persons might be offered lower premiums in states that obtained a ‘‘Limited Waiver’’ of communityrating and essential health benefits, it would be at the expense of making coverage unaffordable for those who need it most, older and sicker persons, and result in skimpy ‘‘barebones’’ insurance for many others that does not cover the medical care they would need if and when they get sick. Finally, even without the Limited Waiver Amendment, ACP continues to believe that the AHCA has numerous other provisions and policies that that will do great harm to patients including: The phaseout of the higher federal match in states that have opted to expand Medicaid and the ban on nonexpansion states being able to access the higher federal contribution if they choose to expand Medicaid; Converting the shared federalstate financing structure for Medicaid to one that would cap the federal contribution per enrollee; Providing states with a Medicaid block grant financing option; Eliminating EHBs for Medicaid expansion enrollees; Imposing work or job search requirements on certain Medicaid enrollees; Regressive agebased tax credits, combined with changes that will allow insurers to charge older people much higher premiums than allowed under current law; Continuous coverage requirements for patients with preexisting conditions; Legislative or regulatory restrictions that would deny or result in discrimination in the awarding of federal grant funds and/or Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program funding to women’s health clinics that are qualified under existing federal law for 
the provision of evidencebased services including, but not limited to, provision of contraception, preventive health screenings, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, vaccines, counseling, rehabilitation, and referrals, and; Elimination of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provides billions in dollars to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases. The College strongly believes in the first, do no harm principle. Therefore, we continue to urge that Congress move away from the fundamentally flawed and harmful policies that would result from the American Health Care Act and from the changes under consideration—including the proposed ‘‘Limited Waiver’’ amendment—that would make the bill even worse for patients. We urge Congress to instead start over and seek agreement on bipartisan ways to improve and build on the ACA. The College welcomes the opportunity to share our ideas for bipartisan solutions that would help make health care better, more accessible, and more affordable for patients rather than imposing great harm on them as the AHCA would do. Sincerely, JACKENDE, MD, MACP, President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Cancer Action Network against this bill. 
CANCER ACTION NETWORK , AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY , May 3, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) is deeply concerned about the reports of additional amendments to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), including one that would allegedly add $8 billion in new spending for state highrisk pools. This amendment is particularly egregious because it would further incent states to apply for waivers from currentlaw market rules that protect patients with preexisting conditions. Historically, state highrisk pools have fallen short of providing coverage of prevention, treatment and followup care for cancer patients and survivors. Segmenting people with cancer and other serious illnesses away from the private marketplace and into high risk pools absent an adequate and permanent source of public funding has never been an adequate solution. Between 1976 and 2010, 35 states created highrisk pools to cover individuals who could not otherwise purchase insurance in the private market, usually because of a pre existing condition. Every one of those risk pools experienced net operating losses year after year. Furthermore, highrisk pools did not result in lower premiums. All of them set premiums above the nongroup market average or standard rate in the state, usually by 150–200 percent. Only a few states provided additional premium assistance for low income individuals, leaving many who could not afford premiums priced out of the program. Most states also imposed waiting periods before covering preexisting conditions. An individual with a prior cancer diagnosis often had to wait 6–12 months before the highrisk pool would cover the costs associated with cancer treatment or followup survivorship care. Most states imposed limitations on coverage with either lifetime or annual limits. And most plans offered deductibles of $1,000 or higher. Neither AHCA, nor the new amendment would fully protect patients from any of those conditions. Cancer patients and survivors need insurance coverage that is affordable, readily accessible, and protects them from preexisting condition exclusions, annual and lifetime caps on coverage and extraordinary outof pocket costs. Past experience has shown that highrisk pools failed to meet these basic needs, yet still were a drain on state budgets. As we have indicated in our earlier letters, there are reasonable fixes that could be made to the current law. We stand ready to work with you to develop policies that improve the law and encourage a robust health insurance market that provides affordable and comprehensive coverage options. Sincerely, CHRISTOPHER W. H ANSEN , President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the American Society of Clinical Oncology against this bill. 
AMERICAN SOCIETY OF  CLINICAL ONCOLOGY , April 27, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN, On behalf of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), I write to express our strong opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), as currently amended. As the leading professional society representing more than 42,000 physicians worldwide who care for people with cancer, ASCO has a unique perspective on the law’s potential impact on cancer patients. Our core mission is to ensure every patient with cancer has meaningful access to high quality care. We believe Congress shares this goal and our comments today are in the spirit of advancing that common purpose. In January 2017, as Congress embarked upon the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, ASCO shared a set of guiding principles that support improvements to the current health care system. We also put forth specific areas where people with cancer need protections. Our principles rest on the belief that any health system reform must ensure all people affected by cancer receive highquality care. ASCO’s first principle states, ‘‘all Americans should have access to affordable and sufficient healthcare coverage regardless of their income or health status. To ensure protected access, the current ban on preexisting condition limitations, elimination of annual and lifetime coverage caps, and maintenance of guaranteed renewability should be preserved.’’ We take the position that ‘‘any efforts to reform the healthcare system at the national, state, or local levels should ensure that individuals with healthcare insurance can continue to access affordable insurance without interruption.’’ The amended AHCA violates these principles. Studies show that when cancer patients do not have adequate insurance they receive less care, receive it later, and have worse outcomes than those with better insurance coverage. Uninsured and underinsured families facing a cancer diagnosis experience significant stress. They often are unable to meet outofpocket expenses and even forgo cancer care in order to pay for necessities of daily living. The AHCA as currently constructed will create or worsen these barriers to care. It will add costs to the system, decrease access to appropriate treatment and increase existing disparities in care. We are especially concerned with provisions allowing state waivers that could erode important protections for patients with cancer, including preexisting condition safeguards, coverage of essential services, and access to affordable health insurance. Removing these protections from current federal law allows for a weakening of these critical provisions in some states and establishes a system of inequitable protections across state lines for cancer patients. We urge policymakers to ensure that robust requirements are in place to ensure that all insurance products cover the full scope of services and therapies that cancer patients require. ASCO strongly opposes passage of the AHCA in its current form. We welcome the opportunity to address these issues—and to work toward a better proposal—with you and your staff. Sincerely, DANIEL F. H AYES , MD, FASCO, FACP, President, American Society of Clinical Oncology. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine against this bill. 
AMERICAN CONGRESS OF  REHABILITATION MEDICINE , May 2, 2017. Re Deep Concerns with the American Health Care Act and Related Amendments. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) writes in reference to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), H.R. 1628, and the MacArthur Amendment to the bill. ACRM is an organization of rehabilitation professionals dedicated to serving people with disabling conditions by supporting research and services that promote health, independence, productivity, and quality of life; and meet the needs of rehabilitation clinicians and individuals with disabilities. ACRM is seriously concerned that current House proposals will undercut the federal coverage standard for rehabilitation and habilitation services and devices established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Access to rehabilitation enables individuals experiencing injuries, illnesses, and disabilities to maximize their quality of life by enhancing their health, function, and independence. We believe that any ACA repeal and replace bill that advances in the House and Senate must maintain access to rehabilitation and habilitation services and devices. In particular, the AHCA (H.R. 1628, as amended) includes a provision that would allow states to apply for waivers exempting them from compliance with important patient protections that are required by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including premium rating ratios based on age, protections for consumers disallowing medical status underwriting (i.e., community rating), and requirements for insurers to cover a defined package of essential health benefits (EHBs), which include rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices. We are deeply concerned these EHB changes will curtail access for both children and adults in Medicaid expansion states, as well as private ACA health plans. ACRM believes that these provisions will significantly undermine the health insurance coverage that patients need. ACRM urges Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to improve access to affordable, comprehensive care for all Americans, 
including those with disabilities and chronic conditions needing rehabilitation and habilitation services and devices. DOUGLAS KATZ, MD, FACRM, FAAN, ACRM President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities in strong opposition to this bill. 
CONSORTIUM FOR CITIZENS  WITHDISABILITIES , April 28, 2017. DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS : The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is strongly opposed to the amended American Health Care Act. The amended American Health Care Act retains the original bill’s proposals to dramatically cut Medicaid services that are vital to people with disabilities and seniors through per capita caps, which CCD has opposed. The new amendments—including permitting states to seek waivers from the protections for people with preexisting conditions and from the requirement to provide essential health benefits—makes the amended AHCA even more harmful to people with disabilities. We urge you to oppose this legislation. Medicaid provides services and supports that maintain the health, function, independence, and wellbeing of 10 million enrollees living with disabilities. For many people with disabilities, being able to access timely needed care is a life or death matter. The American Health Care Act changes the way that the Federal Government funds Medicaid—rather than paying states based on the actual costs of healthcare for people in Medicaid, it sets a cap on the amount of federal support, a cap that is totally unrelated to the actual costs of needed care for enrollees. This cap is designed to cut Medicaid, and the bill uses those cuts to pay for unrelated tax cuts. Slashing federal support for Medicaid, which is already a lean program, will force states to cut services and eligibility that put the health and wellbeing of people with disabilities at significant risk. The newest amendments to the American Health Care Act make the bill even more harmful to people with disabilities. The new amendments would allow states to easily obtain waivers that would allow them to charge higher premiums to people with pre existing conditions, including people with disabilities. They also would allow states to seek waivers from the Affordable Care Act’s requirement to provide essential health benefits, including crucial services for people with disabilities such as mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness services and chronic disease management, and pediatric services. These waivers jeopardize the Affordable Care Act’s protections for people with preexisting conditions, including people with disabilities, and CCD opposes any rollback of those protections. The ACA helped millions of people with disabilities and others to gain access to affordable and comprehensive health insurance. The amended American Health Care Act is insufficient to help people with disabilities meet their healthcare needs, and we urge you to oppose the bill should it come to a vote. Sincerely, Health Task Force Cochairs: Bethany Lilly, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law; Dave Machledt, National Health Law Program; Peter Thomas, Brain Injury Association of America; and Julie Ward, The Arc of the United States. Long Term Services and Supports Co chairs: Alison Barkoff, Center for Public Representation; Nicole Jorwic, The Arc of the United States; Sarah Meek, Lutheran Services in America Disability Network; and Laura Weidner, National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON .) Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, there is only one reason this bill is on the floor today: the President cares more about cutting a deal than keeping his promises. He promised we would lower costs. That turned out to be a lie. He promised we would expand coverage. That turned out to be a lie. He promised we would protect millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. That, too, was a lie. Back in Massachusetts at the Agawam Diner, I met a veteran named Clif, who told me when I was on my way to Washington for the first time to go to Washington as an American—not as a Democrat or a Republican, but as an American. To my Republican colleagues, heed Clif’s advice today. Don’t vote as a Republican. Vote as an American. Don’t throw away your credibility to give a legislative victory to a President who will never stick his neck out for anyone other than himself. For what? To betray the people who trusted them? I urge my Republican colleagues to put country before party. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this ridiculous bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I think it is interesting today since we would not be here today if there was not the problems that you, Mr. Speaker, and I have seen. Onethird of this country has one insurer, premiums with doubledigit increases, people who can afford—maybe even with subsidies the amount of their plan can’t afford the deductibles and copays. They go to doctors who won’t take their insurance. We are not here by mistake, Mr. Speaker. We are here because ObamaCare is an abject failure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from Children’s Leadership Council opposed to this bill. 
CHILDREN ’SLEADERSHIP COUNCIL , May 1, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : The Children’s Leadership Council opposes the American Health Care Act (AHCA) because it would jeopardize health care for millions of babies, children, youth and families. We urge you to vote NO on this legislation. The Children’s Leadership Council (CLC) is a coalition of organizations dedicated to improving the lives and opportunities of America’s children. Nationwide, CLC members work to advance the health, education and wellbeing of babies, children and youth in order to prepare them for school, work, and life. The CLC is the only national children’s coalition solely dedicated to supporting investments in our nation’s children and youth; and collectively, CLC’s members have affiliates, partners, and members in every state in the nation. The Affordable Care Act and Medicaid play a crucial role in the lives of children, including those facing the greatest challenges such as children in poverty; children suffering abuse and neglect; children in foster care, and children with disabilities. Medicaid, for example, provides coverage for approximately 37 million children, including children with disabilities, children in foster care and children from lowincome families. Children are the largest group of Medicaid recipients, and nearly 40 percent of all the nation’s children rely on Medicaid and CHIP for their healthcare. Medicaid provides health care treatment and preventive services, mental health care, case management and transportation services to and from medical appointments for children who are lowincome or disabled. The AHCA’s changes to Medicaid would radically restructure a program that has worked for more than 50 years to support children’s health. The Medicaid cap would shift $839 billion to stages, forcing them to cut eligibility, benefits, or provider rates that could have disastrous health consequences. There is no question that the massive cuts to Medicaid, increased premiums likely for millions of families, and eliminating the Essential Health Benefits requirements under current law will seriously harm children and families. Maternity benefits would be among the many medical services no longer guaranteed if this bill were to become law. The massive Medicaid reductions in substance abuse treatment will add to the increases nationwide in the need for child welfare services because of the surge in opioid addiction. Families caring for children with disabilities will find supports for care at home jeopardized. With a record 95% of children with health coverage in our country, the AHCA would turn back the clock on progress for children. And recent proposed changes to the bill would further undermine consumer protections that make health care out of reach for lowincome children and their families—thus making the already harmful bill worse for children. Polling conducted by the Children’s Leadership Council found 71 percent of parents, including 67 percent of Independent parents (of children under the age of 18), want increased investments in programs that help children in the areas of education, health and nutrition, not less as proposed by the AHCA. Congress has a strong history of working on a bipartisan, bicameral basis on issues, policies and programs important to children. It is our hope and expectation that members of Congress continue this history, as Congress works on improving our nation’s healthcare system. This legislation would be a dangerous step backward. We strongly urge you to vote NO. Sincerely, RANDI SCHMIDT , Executive Director, Children’s Leadership Council. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Paralyzed Veterans of America against this bill. 
PARALYZED VETERANS OF AMERICA , Washington, DC, May 3, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) urges 
rejection of the latest version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA). PVA is the nation’s only Congressionallychartered veterans’ service organization solely dedicated to representing veterans with spinal cord injury and/or disease. Consequently, we are very concerned about the conflicting information circulating about this legislation and the adverse impact it could have on our members and millions of other people with disabilities. As we understand it, the AHCA cuts $880 billion out of the Medicaid program in order to finance tax cuts that will explode the deficit and largely assist upper income individuals, corporations, and providers. The Medicaid changes are particularly devastating to people with disabilities. Under the cap and cut proposal, the federal government would no longer share in the costs of providing health care services and community services beyond the capped amount. This would eliminate the enhanced federal match for the Community First Choice Option under Medicaid that provides attendant care services in the community. Thanks to this program, many poor veterans with serious nonserviceconnected disabilities have been able to move from nursing homes into their communities. The AHCA also weakens Medicaid by ending the Medicaid expansion earlier and offering Medicaid block grants to states. Data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation shows expansion has helped thousands of veterans and their caregivers. For veterans and PVA members in particular, the AHCA continues several problematic policies of the ACA as well as troubling new provisions that could affect the ability of many veterans and their family members to afford health insurance in the private market. The underlying AHCA bill: Continues to exclude CHAMPVA beneficiaries—dependents of the most catastrophically disabled veterans—from the dependents’ coverage policy up to age 26. Fails to remove the prohibition on enrollment into the VA health care system for Priority Group 8 veterans, thus denying these veterans access to the principal health care system for veterans. Denies access to tax credits making health insurance affordable to anyone eligible for a host of other federal health programs, including those ‘‘eligible’’ for coverage under Title 38 health care programs. This would prevent many veterans who may be ‘‘eligible for’’ but not enrolled in the VA health care system from accessing these tax credits intended to help people buy insurance. Not only do the changes made to the original version of the AHCA continue its failure to protect veterans and people with disabilities, they make these circumstances worse. The latest changes would allow states to seek waivers that would allow insurers to charge higher premiums to people with pre existing conditions, including people with disabilities. The new amendments also would allow states to seek waivers from the ACA’s requirement that certain essential health benefits must be provided, including crucial services for people with disabilities such as prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness services and chronic disease management. The combination of these changes would make it nearly impossible for people with preexisting conditions to find affordable plans that cover basic health care services. Throughout these past few months, the American people have been calling for a bipartisan effort to improve the nation’s health care system. Congress should heed these voices, stop its pursuit of the flawed American Health Care Act and work together through regular order to strengthen all Americans’ access to affordable, high quality health care. Sincerely, CARLBLAKE , Associate Executive Director. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the March of Dimes opposed to this bill. 
[From the march of dimes] UNDER AHCA, O VER 6 M ILLION WOMEN OF  CHILDBEARING AGEWILLLOSEHEALTH COVERAGE  DEARREPRESENTATIVE : Prior to 2010, low income adult women could generally only obtain Medicaid coverage after they were pregnant. By the time they enrolled in this coverage, many of the best opportunities for guaranteeing a healthy pregnancy and healthy baby had already been missed. Today, states that have expanded Medicaid can extend Medicaid coverage to lowincome women of childbearing age, giving them the chance to get healthy before they get pregnant. The March of Dimes estimates that approximately 6.5 million low income women of childbearing age are currently covered under Medicaid expansion, giving them access to treatment for tobacco use, obesity, substance abuse, and other conditions that can have a major impact on future pregnancies. Between 2012 and 2015, the rate of uninsurance among women of childbearing age dropped by 40%, with much of that decline attributable to Medicaid expansion. The American Health Care Act (AHCA) would do away with these advances by rolling back Medicaid expansion. Its fundamental restructuring of the traditional Medicaid program would also likely lead to significant coverage losses or restriction of services to beneficiaries, including pregnant women. These changes do a serious disservice to lowincome women and families by denying them access to the care they need to lead healthy lives and, ultimately, have healthy pregnancies and give birth to healthy infants. The MacArthur amendment and other proposed changes to the AHCA do not address these issues. Women, infants, families, and communities will bear the longterm cost if health care for women of childbearing age and pregnant women is shortchanged and more babies are born sick as a result. The March of Dimes urges all Representatives to oppose the American Health Care Act. Sincerely, STACEY D. S TEWART , President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from AFSCME in strong opposition to this bill. 
AFSCME, May 3, 2017. U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 1.6 million working and retiree members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to express our continuing opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), notwithstanding the addition of the Upton amendment. The harm that AHCA will impose on ordinary Americans is breathtaking in scope. As the Congressional Budget Office has detailed, 24 million will lose their health care coverage. The Medicaid program will be cut by $839 billion and restructured, ending the guarantee that the federal government will fund a specified share of state Medicaid costs. The bill makes coverage more expensive, especially for lowerincome families and older workers and it undermines the financial strength of Medicare. And the MacArthur amendment makes a very bad bill worse by allowing states to opt out of Affordable Care Act protections that ensure that people with preexisting conditions will be able to obtain comprehensive, affordable health care. Moreover, the MacArthur amendment would allow insurance companies to reimpose caps on annual and lifetime limits, even in employersponsored coverage, putting the health care of those with catastrophic illnesses or injuries at risk. Under the Upton amendment, grants to states that could be used for highrisk pools will be increased by 6% or $8 billion over five years. This is a paltry increase. Even the conservative Mercatus Center described the increase as a ‘‘pittance.’’ Highrisk pools would still be grossly underfunded, even if states put all of the $138 billion in grant funding into them. We urge the Congress not to ignore the previous experience with state highrisk pools. By segregating those with preexisting conditions into separate coverage we know they will face higher premiums, benefit exclusions, annual and lifetime limits on coverage and waiting lists. It is unacceptable that this bill eliminates $500 billion in taxes on the wealthiest 2%, health insurers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device makers, while taking health care away from millions. Moreover, the bill retains the 40% tax on high cost health plans, which will undermine employersponsored insurance for working families by hollowing out coverage and increasing outofpocket expenses, although it delays the implementation for six years. The bottom line is that this bill would cause millions to lose their health coverage. Most of those with preexisting conditions would return to the days when even inadequate coverage was unaffordable. The bill would drive up costs for those who are older and lowerincome, shift costs to states, fail to protect employersponsored coverage, weaken public health and undermine the solvency of the Medicare trust fund—all the while providing tax cuts for the wealthy and wellconnected. The priorities demonstrated by this bill are upside down. We urge you to oppose this bill. Sincerely, SCOTT FREY, Director of Federal Government Affairs. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the National Farmers Union in strong opposition to this bill. 
NATIONAL FARMERS UNION, May 3, 2017. DEARMEMBER OF CONGRESS : I write on behalf of nearly 200,000 members of the National Farmers Union (NFU) who are engaged in all forms of farming and ranching. NFU has already spoken in opposition of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) because of the estimated 24 million Americans who would lose coverage as a result. The most recent amendment to the AHCA only moves further away from NFU’s memberdriven policy of affirming ‘‘the right of all Americans to have access to affordable, quality health care.’’ Farming is a dangerous occupation, ranking 6th in occupational fatality rates. The injury rate for agricultural workers is also 40% higher than the rate of all workers. Finally, the average age of farmers in the United States is over 58 years. U.S. health care policy must take into account the unique needs of the men and women who provide food and fiber for our country and much of the world. Our current health care system is not without its problems, but progress has been 
made since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The current structure of tax credits and premium subsidies help farmers maintain consistent coverage, especially during downturns in the farm economy. The expansion of Medicaid has proven beneficial to rural communities, where the rate of enrollment is higher than in urban America. The Health Insurance Marketplace, while certainly in need of stabilizing measures, makes coverage more accessible for many farm families. The correlation between a strong Medicaid program and the success of rural hospitals has become evident during the influx of rural hospital closures over the last six years. Seventyeight rural hospitals have closed since 2010 with over 80% of those located in states that opted out of the Medicaid expansion. With another 673 hospitals at risk of closure, the AHCA’s proposed Medicaid cap could have devastating consequences for rural communities. In 2012, 75 percent of farms sold less than $50,000 in agricultural products and 57% had sales less than $10,000. Young farm families that don’t receive additional income or health benefits from offfarm jobs would find it extremely difficult to purchase health insurance. The proposed legislation would also hurt older farmers. Easing restrictions on what insurance companies can charge older customers will leave older farmers facing increased premiums of thousands of dollars, despite the larger subsidies some would receive. The modified AHCA bill also has a significant negative impact on those with preexisting conditions. It’s estimated that 40 percent of 50 to 64yearolds would be denied coverage in the individual market without the Affordable Care Act’s protections for those with preexisting conditions. The waiver option would mean that a large number of farmers in many states would be forced into highrisk pools. This legislation is woefully short in funding for those highrisk pools, leaving individuals with preexisting conditions to contend with increased premiums, higher deductibles and longer waiting periods for coverage. Affordable access to quality health coverage is a high priority for all Americans. As you consider how to best improve our health care system, we ask that you give serious consideration to the needs of farmers and ranchers. While there is certainly room for improvement in current policy, the American Health Care Act will only hurt family farmers and rural communities across the country. NFU requests that you oppose the proposed legislation. We appreciate your efforts to provide all Americans with highquality comprehensive health insurance. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, ROGER JOHNSON , President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, this procedure that we are witnessing here this morning, based on what happened at the White House for the last 48 hours, has all the charm of a ransom note. The idea that this is put in front of us so that they can provide a tax cut at the expense of middle class Americans is really what we are voting on today. So that child who is born with diabetes across America can no longer be guaranteed health insurance if we turn this option over to the States. Anybody who comes from local or State government knows this: that money will be used to balance the budgets in economic downturns at the expense of those who need it for health care. Another essential point here as I think we go forward, the other side—by the way, there are only two on the other side. What is amazing about this is—when you consider that argument that they had with us yesterday about national defense, understand this: real national defense also includes providing health care for members of the American family. That is a very important consideration. They are about to subtract from guaranteed benefits to the American family for the purpose of offering a tax cut to people at the very top, again, at the expense of middle class Americans. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, here we go again. The majority thinks they have finally found the right combination of political giveaways to pass their bill, a bill that we have to remember still kicks 24 million Americans off their healthcare coverage. It still charges seniors more. It still takes away some of the most basic protections of your health plan that it should cover. Despite what you hear, this latest BandAid amendment is not going to change any of that. That is just what we know so far. Since this bill was built by backroom deals and haphazard guesses, we don’t even know how much this bill will cost America—not just dollars added to the deficit, but the human cost of how much more damaging this bill will be. It is the height of irresponsible governing, not just rushing something through without full and fair consideration. Frankly, we are getting used to that on our side of the aisle. But to force through a bill that you know is going to hurt 24 million Americans is more than irresponsible; it is just plain wrong. b1000 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the National Education Association in strong opposition to this bill. 
MAY3, 2017. Hon. JAMES P. M CGOVERN , House of Representatives, House Office Building, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN MCGOVERN : On behalf of our three million members and the 50 million students they serve, we strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act as amended. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that by 2026, the original bill would provide $883 billion in tax cuts while taking health coverage away from 24 million people, including some of the most vulnerable among us—the poor, the sick, the elderly, and the children who constitute more than half the current Medicaid enrollment. Votes on this issue may be included in NEA’s Report Card for the 15th Congress. The April 25 amendment made the original bill even worse. It allows states to jettison existing essential health benefit requirements, thereby permitting health plans covering millions of people once again to exclude coverage for maternity and newborn care, pediatric dental and vision services, mental health and substance use services, and other crucial benefits. The May 3 amendment is the equivalent of a tiny bandage on a gaping wound. The cost of setting up separate pools or premium assistance programs for people with preexisting conditions far exceeds the $8 billion spread over five years the amendment provides—nationwide, at least $25 billion per year would be required, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Both the original and amended American Health Care Act threaten to return this country to the days when annual and lifetime dollarbased limits on the use of essential health benefits shifted tremendous financial and health risks to working families. Insurance companies could charge people with preexisting conditions many times more than they charge healthy people—just as they did before the Affordable Care Act. Millions of Americans with preexisting conditions would be at risk of losing health coverage or face premiums so high only the very wealthy could afford them—the same people who benefit from the massive tax cuts in the original bill. Specifically, we are concerned that this legislation will: Lead to drastic cuts in Medicaid benefits and eligible beneficiaries. The American Health Care Act radically restructures how Medicaid is funded. Instead of the federal government paying a percentage of actual Medicaid spending, each state will get a set amount. States will choose between a block grant, a lump sum payment, and a ‘‘per capita cap,’’ a flat amount for certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Either way, state budgets will take a big hit: the share of revenue spent on Medicaid will rise from 24.5 percent in 2017 to 28 percent by 2025, according to Moody’s Investors Service. To compensate for the loss of federal support, states are likely to divert money from education to health care as well as limit the number of Medicaid beneficiaries, the scope of Medicaid benefits, or both. Hit the students most in need the hardest. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Medicaid reimburses schools for mental health care, vision and hearing screenings, diabetes and asthma management, wheelchairs and hearing aids, and more. Federal support is substantial—for example, in 2015 California schools received about $90 million from Medicaid, Florida schools about $63 million, New York schools about $137 million, Pennsylvania schools about $131 million, and Texas schools about $250 million (Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, compilation of 2017 data). Capping federal support for Medicaid will shift costs to the states, jeopardizing services essential for students to learn and thrive, especially those with disabilities. Increase the cost of health care for those least able to afford it. The American Health Care Act provides largely agebased tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year—far less than today’s subsidies. For example, according to Kaiser Family Foundation calculations, a 60yearold earning $20,000 a year in Lincoln, Nebraska, now gets $18,470 to help buy insurance and additional subsidies to help with deductibles and copayments. Under the American Health Care Act, she would get a $4,000 tax credit for the premium and nothing for other outofpocket health 
care costs. By 2026, the average subsidy under the American Health Care Act would be half the average subsidy under the Affordable Care Act, according to CBO. Tax ‘‘high cost’’ employersponsored health coverage. We recognize that the American Health Care Act postpones the effective date of the 40 percent excise tax on such plans until 2026. But this tax—a back door pay cut for millions of working families—needs to be fully repealed. Enhance tax breaks for the rich. The American Health Care Act nearly doubles the amount of money that can be socked away in taxfree health savings accounts—at least $6,550 for individuals and at least $13,100 for families in 2018. It also repeals a 3.8 percent investment tax and 0.9 percent surcharge on wages above $250,000—a savings of about $195,000 per year for the top 0.1 percent of earners, according to the independent Tax Policy Center. Weaken the individual insurance market and employmentbased coverage. The American Health Care Act eliminates penalties for individuals not buying—and large employers not providing—health coverage. But premiums go up 30 percent if coverage lapses for more than 63 days—for example, when someone loses her job and cannot afford to buy health insurance until she gets another one. Overall, CBO predicts substantial increases in outofpocket costs for low and moderateincome people due to the decline in subsidies and increase in deductibles and other costsharing. Some employers may gut their health plans or stop offering coverage altogether, since they will no longer be penalized for doing so. The American Health Care Act plays Robin Hood in reverse. It reneges on the promise to deliver better, cheaper health coverage for all Americans, giving the richest among us massive tax cuts while causing the number of people without insurance to rise from 28 million today to an estimated 52 million in 2026, according to CBO. We strongly urge you to oppose the amended American Health Care Act—deeply flawed legislation that is even worse than the original bill. Sincerely, MARCEGAN, Director of Government Relations, National Education Association. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of NurseMidwives, American College of Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women’s Health, National Partnership for Women & Families, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. 
MAY1, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : On behalf of physicians, certified nursemidwives/certified midwives, and nurse practitioners who provide care for the women of America, along with our patient partners, we stand together for women and families and against House passage of the MacArthur (R NJ) Amendment to the American Health Care Act (AHCA, H.R. 1628). Rather than support recent gains in women’s access to healthcare and coverage, the MacArthur Amendment and AHCA turn back the clock and reverse hardwon progress. We stand ready to continue work with Congress to advance legislation that promotes women’s health, healthcare and coverage. In our letter of March 22, 2017, we expressed opposition to the AHCA because it threatened women’s access to care protected by Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) requirements, eliminated the Medicaid expansion, cut qualified providers at Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program, and made severe reductions to Medicaid and other programs critical to women and newborns. We said that important health initiatives for women and newborns should be built upon and improved—not rolled back. However, the MacArthur Amendment to AHCA places women’s health and coverage at even greater risk. The MacArthur Amendment would enable states to waive EHBs including those for maternity and newborn care, preventive services, and services for mental health and substance use disorders; to waive community rating rules; and to shunt patients with costly healthcare conditions or illnesses into unproven government high risk pools. Supporters of the bill claim this bill maintains protections for those with preexisting conditions, but allowing states to waive coverage of EHB and charge people more based on their health status renders the promise of coverage for preexisting conditions to be meaningless. If all that the Secretary may require of a state waiver application is an unvalidated attestation that the purpose of their requested waiver is to reduce premium costs, increase the number of persons with healthcare coverage, or advance another benefit to the public interest in the state, including the guarantee of coverage for persons with preexisting medical conditions, it is meaningless in protecting health, quality healthcare and coverage. Women and families must not be made to suffer, lose access to care and coverage, and pay higher healthcare costs. EHB is a critical protection that ensures women have guaranteed access to a robust set of health care services. Making certain categories of coverage optional—such as maternity care—would not substantially lower the premiums that people pay for health coverage. For example, the requirement for maternity care as an EHB is not a source of health cost growth. Rather, by sharing risk across a broad population of beneficiaries it provides vital protection for women and families from the risk of tens of thousands of dollars of outofpocket costs associated with normal physiologic labor and delivery, cesarean section, and birth complications. In exchange for monthly premium costs of just $8–14 according to one recent analysis, the maternity care EHB provides significant security for people wishing to grow their families in the U.S. Furthermore, since everyone is at some point a newborn, childbirth affects all of us. Enabling exclusion of maternity care from health coverage denies people access to the care that everyone deserves for the best start in life. Congress should move to protect and advance health, quality care and coverage, particularly for women and newborns, and not to endanger them as the AHCA and the MacArthur Amendment would do. Americans of both parties agree. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found ‘‘relatively few Americans want to see the president and Congress decrease funding for a variety of different health priorities—including spending for reproductive health services for lowerincome women (21 percent).’’ When women have access to quality, evidencebased, affordable care throughout their lives, they enrich our workforce, achieve higher levels of education, reach their goals, and actively contribute to the success of their families and their communities. We urge the U.S. House in the strongest possible terms to get it right, not fast. The AHCA and the MacArthur Amendment turn the clock back on women’s health and should not move forward. We stand ready to continue assisting Congress in advancing health policy that supports women’s access to high quality healthcare and coverage, and is effective at controlling and reducing the costs that people pay for their healthcare. Sincerely, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of NurseMidwives, American College of Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women’s Health, National Partnership for Women & Families, Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want you to look and keep your eyes on who will feel the TrumpCare’s mother of all bombs of health care dropped on the American people. God have mercy on your soul. I am a person living with a preexisting disease. I am a breast cancer survivor. This heartless and callous bill, with 24 millionplus people being thrown off of health care and the reverse Robin Hood of stealing from the poor and the seniors laying in their beds, and you are doing an age tax that is five times more than any other young person has to pay, is disgraceful, as well as the pittance that you have given for preexisting conditions, which is $8 billion. They say you need $25 billion. Then you are telling the States to get a waiver. They are going to celebrate. And then you are saying to Trump, the king, that we have the votes to drop that mother of all bombs of health care. Let me just simply say: I want to stand with the people. I want her to live in dignity and to be able to get well. I want to make sure that Medicaid is provided for working families. I don’t want the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, to steal bread from the market because they can’t get any health insurance. God have mercy on your soul. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee and the representative of a congressional district that has benefitted enormously from the Affordable Care Act, I rise in strong and unyielding opposition to H.R. 1628, the socalled ‘‘American Health Care Act,’’ which more accurately should be called ‘‘Trumpcare, the Pay More for Less Act.’’ I oppose this third and latest reincarnation of Trumpcare for several compelling reasons: 1. Trumpcare forces families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, increasing outof pocket costs. 2. Trumpcare will take away health care from 24 million hardworking Americans. 3. Trumpcare would gut Essential Health Benefits and protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. 4. Trumpcare forces Americans aged 50–64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are. 
5. Trumpcare shortens the life of the Medicare Trust Fund and ransacks funds that seniors depend on to get the longterm care they need. Mr. Speaker, 85 months ago, on March 23, 2010, redeemed a promise that had been unfulfilled for nearly a 100 years, when he signed into law the landmark Affordable Care Act passed by the Democratic controlled 111th Congress. Seven years later, the verdict is in on the Affordable Care Act: the American people have judged it a success. As reflected in the most recent public opinion polls, 61% of Americans approve of ObamaCare and oppose efforts to repeal it, the highest approval rates on record to date and continuing an inexorable upward trend over the past several years. Mr. Speaker, the reason Americans are adamantly opposed to Republican repeal efforts, including the third iteration of Trumpcare now before us is that Obamacare is no longer a bogey cooked up in Republican talking points but a lifesaving and life affirming measure that they experienced in their own lives. Americans think it is beyond crazy to repeal a law that has brought to more than 20 million Americans the peace of mind and security that comes with knowing they have access to affordable, high quality health care. Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 17.1% of Americans lacked health insurance; today nearly nine of ten (89.1%) are insured, which is the highest rate since Gallup began tracking insurance coverage in 2008. Because of the Affordable Healthcare Act: 1. insurance companies are banned from discriminating against anyone, including 17 million children, with a preexisting condition, or charging higher rates based on gender or health status; 2. 6.6 million youngadults up to age 26 can stay on their parents’ health insurance plans; 3. 100 million Americans no longer have annual or lifetime limits on healthcare coverage; 4. 6.3 million seniors in the ‘‘donut hole’’ have saved $6.1 billion on their prescription drugs; 5. 3.2 million seniors now get free annual wellness visits under Medicare, and 6. 360,000 Small Businesses are using the Health Care Tax Credit to help them provide health insurance to their workers; 7. Pregnancy is no longer a preexisting condition and women can no longer be charged a higher rate just because they are women. We are becoming a nation of equals when it comes to access to affordable healthcare insurance. With all of this progress, and the prospect for more through further refinements, who in their right mind would want to go back to how it used to be? The answer seems to be only the President and House Republicans who call the Affordable Care Act and its enviable record of success a ‘‘disaster.’’ Americans know a disaster when they see one and they see one in the making: it is called ‘‘Trumpcare,’’ masquerading as the ‘‘American Health Care Act,’’ which will force Americans to pay more, get less, decimate the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and give a massive tax cut for top 1 percent. Americans are right to be alarmed and angered by what the Trump Republicans are trying to do by rushing to vote on a Trumpcare bill before it can be scored by highly respected and nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. What we do know for sure is that this Trumpcare bill is a massive $900 billion tax cut for the wealthy, paid for on the backs of America’s seniors, the vulnerable, the poor, and working class households. Trump gave the game away on March 20, 2017 in one of his trademark pep rallies: ‘‘We want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.’’ This ‘‘Robin Hood in reverse’’ bill is unprecedented and breathtaking in its audacity—no bill ever tried to give so much to the rich while taking so much from the poor and working class. When they were forced to pull Trumpcare 1.0 from the floor because they lacked the votes to pass, House Republican leaders responded by adding an amendment (Trumpcare 2.0) that made the original bill even worse. Trumpcare 2.0 would allow states to jettison existing essential health benefit requirements, thereby permitting health plans covering millions of people once again to exclude coverage for maternity and newborn care, pediatric dental and vision services, mental health and substance use services, and other crucial benefits. All this accomplished was a hemorrhaging of support from the moderate wing of the Republican Conference who feared the repercussions of leaving millions of Americans with preexisting conditions without health insurance so the Trump Republicans invented Trumpcare 3.0 to provide $8 billion over five years to offset the cost of setting up separate pools or premium assistance programs for people with preexisting conditions. This pittance is not designed or intended to help real people with preexisting conditions, but to provide cover for House Republicans to walk the plank. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, at least $25 billion per year would be required, not $8 billion spread out over five years as provided for in Trumpcare 3.0. Trumpcare represents the largest transfer of wealth from the bottom 99% to the top 1% in American history. This callous Republican scheme gives gigantic tax cuts to the rich, and pays for it by taking insurance away from 24 million people, leaving 52 million uninsured, and raising costs for the poor and middle class. In addition, Republicans are giving the pharmaceutical industry a big tax repeal, worth nearly $25 billion over a decade without demanding in return any reduction in the cost of prescription and brandname drugs. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, of this bill, it can truly be said that ‘‘never has so much been taken from so many to benefit so few.’’ The PayMoreForLess plan destroys the Medicaid program under the cover of repealing the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion. CBO estimates 14 million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage by 2026 under the Republican plan. In addition to terminating the ACA Medicaid expansion, the bill converts Medicaid to a per capita cap that is not guaranteed to keep pace with health costs starting in 2020. The combined effect of these policies is to slash $880 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next decade. The cuts get deeper with each passing year, reaching 25% of Medicaid spending in 2026. These steep cuts will force states to drop people from Medicaid entirely or ration care for those who most need access to comprehensive coverage. The PayMoreForLess plan undermines the health care safety net for vulnerable populations. Currently, Medicaid provides coverage to more than 70 million Americans, including children, pregnant women, seniors in Medicare, people who are too disabled to work, and parents struggling to get by on povertylevel wages. In addition to doctor and hospital visits, Medicaid covers longterm services like nursing homes and home and communitybased services that allow people with chronic health conditions and disabilities to live independently. To date, 31 states and D.C. have expanded Medicaid eligibility to lowincome adults, which, when combined with the ACA’s other coverage provisions, has helped to reduce the nation’s uninsured rate to the lowest in history. Trumpcare throws 24 million Americans off their health insurance by 2026 according to the Congressional Budget Office. Lowincome people will be hit especially hard because 14 million people will lose access to Medicaid by 2026 according to CBO. Trumpcare massively shifts who gets insured in the nongroup market. According to CBO, ‘‘fewer lowerincome people would obtain coverage through the nongroup market under the legislation than current law,’’ and, ‘‘a larger share of enrollees in the nongroup market would be younger people and a smaller share would be older people.’’ The projected 10% reduction in premiums is not the result of better care or efficiency—it is in large part the result of highercost and older people being pushed out of a market that is also selling plans that provide less financial protection. People with low incomes suffer the greatest losses in coverage. CBO projects the uninsured rate for people in their 30s and 40s with incomes below 200% 
of poverty will reach 38% in 2026 under this bill, nearly twice the rate projected under current law. Among people aged 50–64, CBO projects 30% of those with incomes below 200% of poverty will be uninsured in 2026. Under current law, CBO projects the uninsured rate would only be 12 percent. Being uninsured is not about ‘‘freedom.’’ Speaker RYAN has argued that people will happily forgo insurance coverage because this bill gives them that ‘‘freedom.’’ The argument makes as much sense as the foolish claim that slaves came to America as ‘‘immigrants’’ seeking a better life. The freedom to be uninsured is no freedom at all to people in their 50s and 60s with modest incomes who simply cannot afford to pay thousands of dollars toward premiums. They do not really have a choice. The claim of our Republican friends that Trumpcare provides more freedom to all Americans calls to mind the words of Anatole France: ‘‘The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread from the market.’’ 
Trumpcare raises costs for Americans nearing retirement, essentially imposing an ‘‘Age Tax.’’ The bill allows insurance companies to charge older enrollees higher premiums than allowed under current law, while reducing the size of premium tax credits provided. Again, these changes hit lowincome older persons the hardest. A 64yearold with an income of $26,500 buying coverage in the individual market will pay $12,900 more toward their premiums in 2026, on average. Trumpcare raises costs for individuals and families with modest incomes, particularly older Americans. A recent analysis found that in 2020, individuals with incomes of about $31,000 would pay on average $4,000 more out of pocket for health care—which is like getting a 13% pay cut. And the older you are, the worse it gets. An analysis by the Urban Institute estimates that for Americans in their 50s and 60s, the tax credits alone would only be sufficient to buy plans with major holes in them, such as $30,000 deductible for family coverage and no coverage at all of brandname drugs or many therapy services. Another reason I oppose the Trumpcare bill before us is because its draconian cuts in Medicaid funding and phaseout of Medicaid expansion put community health centers at risk. Community health centers are consumer driven and patientcentered organizations that serve as a comprehensive and cost effective primary health care option for America’s most underserved communities. Community health centers serve as the health care home for more than 25 million patients in nearly 10,000 communities across the country. Across the country, 550 new clinics have opened to receive 5 million new patients since 2009. Community health centers serve everyone regardless of ability to pay or insurance status: 1. 71% of health center patients have incomes at or below 100% of poverty and 92% have incomes less than 200% of poverty; 2. 49% of health center patients are on Medicaid; and 3. 24% are uninsured; 4. Community health centers annually serve on average 1.2 million homeless patients and more than 300,000 veterans. Community health centers reduce health care costs and produce savings—on average, health centers save 24% per Medicaid patient when compared to other providers. Community health centers integrate critical medical and social services such as oral health, mental health, substance abuse, case management, and translation, under one roof. Community health centers employ nearly 100,000, people and generate over $45 billion in total economic activity in some of the nation’s most distressed communities. Mr. Speaker, community health centers are on the front lines of every major health crisis our country faces; from providing access to care (and employment) to veterans to addressing the opioid epidemic to responding to public health threats like the Zika virus. We should be providing more support and funding to community health centers; not making it more difficult for them to serve the communities that desperately need them by slashing Medicaid funding. Trumpcare Republican plan leaves rural Americans worse off. Mr. Speaker, health insurance has historically been more expensive in rural areas because services cost more and it is hard to have a stable individual market with a small population. Under the Affordable Care Act, premium subsidies are tied to local costs, which helps keeps premium costs down. But they are not under the Republican plan. So, under the Republican plan residents in rural areas, who tend to be older and poorer, will pay much more and get much less health insurance. What the Affordable Care Act, and its repeal means in the lives of real people: At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, the powerful and compelling reasons to reject Trumpcare lie in the real world experiences of the American people. Let me briefly share with you the positive, life affirming difference made by the Affordable Care Act in the lives of just three of the millions of Americans it has helped. Joan Fanwick: ‘‘If Obamacare is repealed, I don’t know if I’ll live to see the next President’’ ‘‘After nearly a decade of mysterious health scares, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder called Sjogren’s syndrome last year, when I was a junior at Temple University. ‘‘It’s a chronic illness with no known cause or cure, and without close medical surveillance and care, it can lead to lifethreatening complications (like the blood infection I frequently experience). ‘‘For me, having this disorder means waking up every morning and taking 10 different medications. ‘‘It also means a nurse visiting my apartment every Saturday to insert a needle into the port in my chest, so I can give myself IV fluids throughout the week. ‘‘Without insurance, my medical expenses would cost me about $1,000 per week—more than $50,000 per year. And that doesn’t even include hospitalizations. ‘‘My medical bills aren’t cheap under Obamacare, but I can afford them. ‘‘Under Obamacare, insurance companies aren’t allowed to cut you off when your costs climb so right now, the most I personally have to pay out of pocket is $1,000 per year.’’ Brain Norgaard: ‘‘I am a small business owner and leadership trainer who Obamacare has helped tremendously.’’ Brian Norgaard, a Dallas, Texas resident called my office to express his opposition to Trumpcare and to offer share how the Affordable Care Act has helped small business owners like himself: ‘‘I am a small business owner and leadership trainer who Obamacare has helped tremendously. ‘‘My wife and I both own small businesses in the Dallas, Texas area and as a result of the huge savings we received after paying lower [healthcare] premiums under Obamacare, we were able to reinvest those saving into both of our businesses and the community. ‘‘And the healthcare we received was quality, at that.’’ Ashley Walton: ‘‘For cancer survivors, we literally live and die by insurance’’ Ashley Walton was 25 when a mole on her back turned out to be melanoma. She had it removed, but three years later she discovered a lump in her abdomen. She was then unemployed and uninsured, and so she put off going to a doctor. She tried to buy health insurance. Every company rejected her. Ashley eventually became eligible for California’s Medicaid program, which had been expanded under the Affordable Care Act. The 32yearold Oakland resident credits her survival to the ACA. Without it, ‘‘I would likely be dead, and my family would likely be bankrupt from trying to save me.’’ Before any of our Republican colleagues supporting this bill cast their vote, I urge them to reflect on the testimony of Joan, Brian, and Ashley, and on this question posed by a constituent to Sen. COTTON of Arkansas at a recent town hall: ‘‘I’ve got a husband dying and we can’t afford—let me tell you something. ‘‘If you can get us better coverage than this [Obamacare], go for it. ‘‘Let me tell you what we have, plus a lot of benefits that we need. ‘‘We have $29 per month for my husband. Can you beat that? Can you? With all the congestive heart failures, and open heart surgeries, we’re trying. $29 per month. And he’s a hard worker. $39 for me.’’ Like a horror film of yore with monsters and vampires, both the original Trumpcare and its sequels threaten to return this country to the days when annual and lifetime dollarbased limits on the use of essential health benefits shifted tremendous financial and health risks to working families. Insurance companies could charge people with preexisting conditions many times more than they charge healthy people—just as they did before the Affordable Care Act. Millions of Americans with preexisting conditions would be at risk of losing health coverage or face premiums so high only the very wealthy could afford them—the same people who benefit from the massive tax cuts in the original bill. I urge all Members to reject Trumpcare, one of the most monstrously cruel and morally bankrupt legislative proposals ever to be considered in this chamber. To paraphrase a famous former reality television personality, ‘‘believe me, Trumpcare is a disaster.’’ We should reject it and keep instead ‘‘something terrific’’: and that is the Affordable Care Act, regarded lovingly by millions of Americans as ‘‘Obamacare.’’ Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, if I had to defend ObamaCare, I would go into hysterics, too. 
Since ObamaCare went into effect, the insurance choices and coverage have gotten lower and the costs have gotten higher. Virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance so I’m left to change doctors who I’ve seen for over 30 years and switch to ‘‘new’’ doctors who I don’t trust, and who cannot provide the same healthcare benefits I’ve received in the past. I have a brain tumor that I have monitored by a very skilled neurooncologist. Not anymore. The three choices I was given via healthcare.gov aren’t even honored forms of insurance for this doctor. 
Yes, it left them out again. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ). Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, despite the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle, today is an exciting day for those of us who have been working and fighting to end ObamaCare’s reign over this country. It is race month in Indiana, and I want to remind my colleagues that, as exciting as today is, today’s vote is a green flag, not a checkered flag. It is the beginning of the race, not the end. Today, the House will vote to move legislation forward that will repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something far better. The bill will surely undergo more changes as we continue this process in the Senate, but it is on its way to the finish line. There are some really strong policies in this bill. It cut taxes by a trillion dollars on the American people, and government spending by hundreds of billions, too. Despite the rhetoric, it keeps preexisting condition prohibitions. No one with a preexisting condition will be denied coverage because of the policies in this bill. Insurance companies cannot raise premiums on individuals with preexisting conditions as long as they maintain coverage. The bill will also make sure 26year olds continue to stay on their parents’ healthcare plans as they enter the workforce. Most importantly, though, the bill unshackles American families from the mandates, taxes, and penalties that are costing these families thousands of dollars each year. Though ObamaCare helped some, we have to remember that ObamaCare made things worse for millions of America, and that is where the national anger has come from. I have heard from countless Hoosiers who tell me the stories of their premiums going from $500 a month to $1,500 a month, with deductibles that are through the roof, at $10,000plus a month. They have to spend $30,000 out of pocket before they even get to their insurance. For a middle class family, that means they have no meaningful insurance at all. We can do better, and we will. That starts today. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the National Rural Health Association opposed to this bill. 
[From the National Rural Health Association] VOTENO TO THE AMERICAN HEALTH CAREACT The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural America. The AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure crisis. Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill improve the base bill, NRHA is concerned that the bill still falls woefully short in making health care affordable and accessible to rural Americans. For example, the modified bill contains a decrease in the Medical Expense Deduction threshold from 10% to 5.8% in an attempt to assist Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 who would see their premiums skyrocket under the current plan. However, this deduction is not a credit and therefore would be of little use to low income seniors that are in very low tax brackets or do not pay income tax at all. Additionally, the new amendments to freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of Jan. 1, 2018, and reduce the Medicaid percapita growth rate will disproportionately harm rural Americans. The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved populations in our nation without coverage, and further escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to the Wall Street Journal, the ‘‘GOP health plan would hit rural areas hard . . . Poor, older Americans would see the largest increase in insurancecoverage costs.’’ The LA Times reports ‘‘Americans who swept President Trump to victory— lowerincome, older voters in conservative, rural parts of the country—stand to lose the most in federal healthcare aid under a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.’’ Let’s be clear—many provisions in the ACA failed rural America. The lack of plan competition in rural markets, exorbitant premiums, deductibles and copays, the coop collapses, lack of Medicaid expansion, and devastating Medicare cuts to rural providers—all collided to create a health care crisis in rural America. However, it’s beyond frustrating that an opportunity to fix these problems is squandered, and instead, a greater health care crisis will be created in rural America. Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to protect rural patients’ access to care. Three improvements are critical for rural patients and providers: 1. Medicaid—Though most rural residents are in nonexpansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%). Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is different and thus requires different programs to succeed. Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not ‘bonus’ payments, but rather alternative, costeffective and targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for millions of rural patients and financial stability for thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal health care reform must protect a state’s ability to protect its rural safety net providers. The federal government must not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to care. Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to create stability among rural providers to maintain access to care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers, a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health. Service providers, and individual rural providers. 2. Market Reform—Fortyone percent of rural marketplace enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing 70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums. Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34 for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan). Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes, cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance. Rural communities have fewer health care providers for insurers to contract with to provide an adequate network to serve the community. Any federal health care reform proposal must address the fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for participation and are currently not obliged to provide service to markets with less advantageous risk pools. Demographic realities of the rural population make the market less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the same way that financial service institutions are required to provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable insurance companies should be required to provide services in underserved communities. 3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals— Rural hospitals serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban), thus acrosstheboard Medicare cuts do not have across the board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad debt decrease significantly. However, because of unaffordable health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has actually increased 50% since the ACA was passed. According to MedPAC ‘‘Average Medicare margins are negative, and under current law they are expected to decline in 2016’’ has led to 7% gains in median profit margins for urban providers while rural providers have experienced a median loss of 6%. If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to protect rural patients’ access to care, could rapidly be undone. The National Rural Health Association implores Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the nation. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the American Thoracic Society opposed to this bill. 
AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY , April 27, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 16,000 members of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), I want to voice my grave concerns with the latest legislative proposal developed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While CBO estimates are not yet available for the most recent legislation proposal being considered in the House, we remain concerned that the bill, if enacted, will result in a loss of health insurance for millions of Americans. Should the proposal come up for a vote in the near future, we urge you to vote ‘‘NO’’ on the American Health Care Act. The ATS opposes any legislation that does not ensure affordable health insurance coverage for Americans currently insured under 
the ACA. We are concerned that allowing states to waive important insurance reforms in the Affordable Care Act will lead to reduced coverage for many Americans and significant price increases for patients with pre existing conditions. Further, we are concerned that reliance on ‘‘high risk pools’’ will not adequately meet the health insurance needs of many Americans with preexisting conditions. We note that previous attempts at implementing statebased high risk pools have been largely unsuccessful. Members of the ATS serve a large and diverse patient population, including patients with respiratory diseases, critical illnesses and sleep disorders such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, sepsis and obstructive sleep apnea. Our patients cannot afford to lose affordable health insurance coverage for any period of time. The ATS looks forward to working with Congress to improve our health care system and ensure health insurance coverage for all Americans. If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Nuala S. Moore, Associate Director of Government Relations. Sincerely, DAVID GOZAL , MD, MBA, President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics opposed to this bill. 
ANDDIETETICS , Washington, DC, May 2, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : Nutrition services save money, improve chronic disease outcomes and save lives. For this reason, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the nation’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals, remains opposed to H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA) as amended by the MacArthur amendment. The Academy and our 75,000plus members believe that all Americans should have both coverage and access to highquality health care. The Academy urges Congress to support measures that include nutrition services and prevention that reduces the cost of health care and improve patients’ lives. The new proposal set forth in the AHCA not only fails to improve the health of all Americans, but it will worsen patient care and public health by removing vital resources that are currently effective in improving health across the country. This legislation continues to eliminate investments in prevention and public health, reverse advancements made in disease prevention and chronic care management, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, would result in the loss of health care coverage for at least 24 million Americans Allowing states to waive preexisting conditions and essential health benefits will lead to decreased coverage and utilization of vital nutrition services. Individuals with chronic disease such as diabetes and hypertension benefit from medical nutrition therapy and nutrition services to lower their blood sugar and blood pressure, while reducing reliance on expensive medications. The cost of these services is inexpensive and replaces more costly interventions that are necessary as chronic disease progresses with many complications. The Academy holds five key tenets for analyzing any legislation to reform health care: 1. The health of all Americans should improve as a result of our health policy choices. Sufficient resources must be made available to ensure optimal health. 2. Access to quality health care is a right that must be extended to all Americans. 3. Nutrition services, from preconception through end of life, are an essential component of comprehensive health care. 4. Stable, sufficient and reliable funding is necessary for our health care system to provide everyone access to a core package of benefits. 5. Health care must be patientcentered. Affordable access to care is an ongoing challenge that any reform legislation should address. Although this legislation purports to provide access, it fails to make coverage more affordable; unaffordable access to coverage is really not coverage at all. The proposal fails to maintain a core package of benefits that improve the health of Americans, by removing a basic floor of services that should be provided without costsharing to the Medicaid population. Additionally, the new proposal would allow states to opt out of requiring that health plans cover the Essential Health Benefits which help reduce longer term health care costs, allow insurers to charge people higher premiums based on preexisting conditions like nutrition related diseases like diabetes and heart disease and increase outofpocket costs for vulnerable older adults. By repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the proposal eliminates the sole federal investment in prevention, which will harm our state and local communities that depend on these effective publicprivate partnerships to improve the health of their communities. The AHCA as currently drafted fails to meet the Academy’s five tenets, and therefore we cannot support the passage of these proposals. The Academy urges Congress to not hold future votes without an evaluation of the proposed amendments from the Congressional Budget Office estimating the budgetary impact of the amended legislation and the anticipated effect on coverage for Americans. We look forward to continued collaboration to improve the health and nutrition for all Americans. Sincerely, LUCILLE BESELER , President. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from The Jewish Federations of North America opposed to this bill. 
OFNORTH AMERICA , Washington, DC, May 2, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) remains staunchly opposed to the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), even with the recently released amendment proposed by Representative Tom MacArthur (R–NJ). We are disappointed that AHCA retains the devastating cuts to Medicaid included in the earlier version of the legislation, cuts which are the result of the legislation’s proposal to dramatically restructure Medicaid’s federal financing structure and roll back coverage for 14 million people covered by the state Medicaid expansions. The amendment does nothing to alleviate these concerns. JFNA represents 148 Jewish federations and 300 network communities that together support 15 leading academic medical centers/ health systems, 100 Jewish nursing homes, and 125 Jewish family & children’s agencies, providing health care for more than one million clients, Jewish and nonJewish alike. Medicaid is a lifeline for more than 80 million people, including lowincome children, older adults, and people with disabilities nationwide. Medicaid is a vital program for Jewish federations throughout the country and particularly for our communal health and longterm care partners that care for the most vulnerable in our communities. JFNA is deeply troubled by the findings of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that AHCA will cause $839 billion in reductions— about 25 percent—to federal Medicaid funding and a loss in coverage for more than 14 million Medicaid beneficiaries. We believe that converting Medicaid to a block grant or per capita cap will cause irreparable harm not only to the millions who depend on the program, but also to our large network of providers who care for them. AHCA would convert the longstanding and fundamental federalstate partnership of the Medicaid program to a block grant or per capita cap system. Under either approach, states would receive a limited amount of federal money for their Medicaid programs. As CBO found, even under a per capita cap system, the federal share is lower than the average annual increase in Medicaid spending and will not be sufficiently flexible to address a variety of key factors affecting Medicaid spending, including major disasters, economic downturns, unexpected health care cost increases, and demographic changes, such as the rapidly aging baby boomer generation. CBO projected that AHCA’s $839 billion cut in federal Medicaid funding will shift substantial costs to state and local governments, our providers, and our patients, thus exacerbating the existing strain on the program. We agree with CBO’s conclusion that, due to these reductions in funding, states will be left with no choice but to reduce Medicaid enrollment, eligibility for Medicaid benefits, and payment rates. Many people who now qualify for Medicaid could end up uninsured or losing access to critical health and longterm care services. JFNA is concerned by many of the unintended consequences of this legislation, such as: People who desperately need Medicaid and who are currently eligible will become uninsured; States will be forced to cut back on crucial Medicaid services, such as home and communitybased services, effectively forcing people who are capable of living in the community with proper home and communitybased services into nursing homes; States will be forced to reduce already low provider payment rates, thus further decreasing the pool of providers serving Medicaid beneficiaries and increasing waiting times for services; and, Health care providers and entities that care for these vulnerable populations will suffer additional financial strain. As a result, these agencies will be forced to lay off staff or close their doors altogether, resulting in significant job losses and further hurting state economies. For these reasons, we must oppose the legislation as currently written and urge the House of Representatives to reconsider moving forward with it. We stand ready to work with you, in tandem with our Jewish communal health and longterm care providers, to promote more targeted ways to reduce Medicaid spending and develop a new framework of policies to improve Medicaid quality, efficiency, and sustainability. Sincerely, WILLIAM C. D AROFF , 
Senior Vice President for Public Policy & Director of the Washington Office. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD an article in The Wall Street Journal today stating: ‘‘. . . employers looking to lower their costs could impose lifetime limits and eliminate the outofpocket cost cap from their plans under the GOP legislation.’’ 
[From the Wall Street Journal] LITTLE NOTED PROVISION OF GOP H EALTH  BILLCOULD ALTER EMPLOYER PLANS  
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REQUIREMENTS  (By Stephanie Armour and Michelle Hackman) Many people who obtain health insurance through their employers—about half of the country—could be at risk of losing protections that limit outofpocket costs for catastrophic illnesses, due to a littlenoticed provision of the House Republican healthcare bill to be considered Thursday, healthpolicy experts say. The provision, part of a lastminute amendment, lets states obtain waivers from certain Affordable Care Act insurance regulations. Insurers in states that obtain the waivers could be freed from a regulation mandating that they cover 10 particular types of health services, among them maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health treatment and hospitalization. That could also affect plans offered by large employers, health analysts said. The ACA prevents employer plans from putting annual limits on the amount of care they will cover, and it bars lifetime limits on the 10 essential benefits. But in 2011, the Obama administration issued guidance stating that employers aren’t bound by the benefits mandated by their state and can pick from another state’s list of required benefits. That guidance was mostly meaningless because the ACA established a national set of essential benefits. Under the House bill, large employers could choose the benefit requirements from any state—including those that are allowed to lower their benchmarks under a waiver, health analysts said. By choosing a waiver state, employers looking to lower their costs could impose lifetime limits and eliminate the outofpocket cost cap from their plans under the GOP legislation. The measure would give employers added flexibility to take steps that could lower costs by limiting moreexpensive coverage areas. And it would lessen the federal regulation of insurers, a goal of GOP lawmakers who believe the ACA is an example of government overreach. The impact on employer plans expands the scope of the health bill to affect, potentially, everyone not insured by Medicare or small business plans, since the bill also includes cuts to Medicaid and changes to the individual market. Employer health plans are the single largest source of health insurance in the country, with about 159 million Americans receiving coverage through their jobs. ‘‘It’s huge,’’ said Andy Slavitt, former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama. ‘‘They’re creating a backdoor way to gut employer plans, too.’’ But some experts say the impact could be less. ‘‘The real question is, would employers do this? Many wouldn’t,’’ said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ‘‘Many employers offer quality benefits to attract employees. But employers are always looking for ways to lower costs.’’ Fiftynine percent of employers had a lifetime limit on how much their insurance plans would cover before the ACA, Mr. Levitt said. The potential impact on largeemployer plans was picked up on by health analysts including Matthew Fiedler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. It is possible the Trump administration could minimize the impact by barring employers from picking plans across state lines, he said, but there is no sign that that would occur. ‘‘The core goal of insurance is to ensure that people are protected if the worst happens, and these protections are crucial to achieving that goal,’’ Mr. Fiedler said. Potentially, the new provision could play out this way: If a state did away with a requirement to provide mental health and substance abuse services, employer plans using that benchmark could impose lifetime caps on the amount of mental health coverage they are willing to pay for. One trade group representing employers said the amendment’s effects on people with employersponsored health coverage would be minimal. Most large employers didn’t impose annual or lifetime limits before the ACA was implemented, according to James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at the Erisa Industry Committee. ‘‘Even if selfinsured health plans are no longer banned from imposing annual or lifetime limits, they’re unlikely to attempt to squeeze the toothpaste back into the tube,’’ he said. ‘‘The benefits of reimposing limits are questionable.’’ 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it has just been said that no one with a preexisting condition will be denied treatment. That is a cruel falsehood. Roughly 129 million Americans today have a preexisting condition. Here is what the AMA says to refute what was just said: ‘‘The history of highrisk pools demonstrates that Americans with preexisting conditions will be stuck in second class health coverage, if they are able to obtain coverage at all.’’ Now we have a proposal for $8 billion. That is a deceitful fraud. I intend going back home to travel the State of Michigan and elsewhere and tell the American people that although those who have said that are simply not being truthful, they essentially are turning their backs on 129 million Americans. We Democrats will never turn our back on the people of the United States of America. When it comes to health care, it is a vital need. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, even with, again, the muddled hysterics, there is nothing in this bill, even if you have preexisting coverage now, there is nothing that says you lose it. Let’s at least get the facts straight. Also, let’s talk about families and why we are here. Despite Obama’s promises, my plan was canceled at an affordable $450 a month when ObamaCare was implemented. My new plan has gone up every year and for 2017 will be over $1,300 a month. My husband and I cannot keep up with these increases. Soon it will be a choice between food and housing or health care. 
Virginia from Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL). Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, my question today is: How long will the opposition try to hold on to the failing Affordable Care Act? How long will they desperately try to hold on with their fingernails, screaming and thrashing at something that is failing so miserably? Just this week, it was announced that 94 of 99 counties of Iowa will not have a carrier at all. In Michigan this year, individual policy premiums went up 20 percent, never mind deductibles and copays. While currently 26 million Americans do not have coverage, 19.2 million either claim a waiver or pay a penalty that last year was $3 billion. Yet somehow the other side claims the Affordable Care Act is some form of nirvana. The American Health Care Act guarantees issuance of coverage and targets assistance to those who have health challenges, in contrast to the Affordable Care Act that just thinks we should throw money at it. What amazes me, in my first few months here in Congress, if there is a problem, we will just throw money. The opposition wants a blank check, which will not work in this country. It is going to kill this country. Let me suggest to my colleague from Michigan, my neighbor, that if he wants to schedule to go around the State and talk about the benefits of this program, the Affordable Care Act, I will go with him. We will go anywhere he would like to go. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a statement from the Children’s Hospital Association in opposition to this bill. 
[From Children’s Hospital Association, Apr. 27, 2017] CHILDREN ’SHOSPITALS URGEHOUSE TO VOTE AGAINST AMENDED AHCA 
KIDS WASHINGTON , DC.—On behalf of our nation’s children’s hospitals and the patients and families they serve, Children’s Hospital Association (CHA) continues to oppose the newly modified American Health Care Act (AHCA) and strongly urges the House of Representatives to reject the bill. Recently adopted changes only worsen the AHCA by putting children with preexisting conditions at increased risk of losing health care coverage and failing to correct the Medicaid cuts that would impact over 30 million kids. The legislation the House might consider for a vote as early as the weekend would impose over $800 billion in cuts on states by fundamentally changing Medicaid—a program over 40 percent of the children across the country depend on for their health care coverage and access to medical care. Under 
the bill, Medicaid would no longer be able to flex with the needs of enrollees, instead becoming a severely restricted system of per capita caps or block grants. The block grant option in particular would be devastating to children as it eliminates Medicaid’s EPSDT (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment) benefit which ensures children receive immunizations, mental health assessments and vision, eye and hearing exams as well as other medical services they might need. A block grant would also remove costsharing protections for children, essentially creating new barriers to care for lowincome, working families. CHA urgently asks members of Congress to vote against the AHCA. Medicaid must be maintained to ensure children receive the coverage and medical care that return lifelong benefits into adulthood. Investing in children’s health advances a better future for our nation. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include a statement from Families USA in opposition to this bill. 
[From FAMILIESUSA] LATEST HOUSE GOP P ROPOSAL —‘‘U PTON  AMENDMENT ’’—S TILL LEAVES PEOPLE WITH  PREEXISTING CONDITIONS OUT IN THE COLD WASHINGTON , DC.—Republicans in the House today are discussing a socalled compromise that ostensibly adds $8 billion to their Affordable Care Act (ACA) repeal bill in an attempt to appease members worried that the bill strips coverage guarantees for people with preexisting conditions. Below is a statement from Families USA Executive Director Frederick Isasi. ‘‘Despite today’s wheeling and dealing, the GOP repeal bill still drops the coverage guarantee for people with preexisting conditions, strips coverage from millions, and drives up costs for millions more. A measly $8 billion handout isn’t going to change that. The bill also decimates Medicaid—more than $800 billion in cuts. That hurts seniors, people with disabilities, and children like Jimmy Kimmel’s son who he so eloquently spoke of Monday night. Remember, half of the births in America are reimbursed through Medicaid. ‘‘The Upton $8 billion is a nonsolution— money thrown at ‘highrisk pools’ that experts on both sides of the aisle have warned lead to higher costs, fewer benefits, and waiting lists rationing care for those with preexisting conditions. ‘‘Republicans in the House can do all the backroom votetrading they want; their bill will still harm millions and millions of people in America and breaks President Trump’s promise to cover everybody and protect people with preexisting conditions. This isn’t what people in America want. It is time for the GOP to drop this deeply flawed legislation and move on to efforts that will help, and not hurt, America’s families.’’ 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include a statement from the Association of American Medical Colleges in opposition to this bill. 
[From AAMC, May 2, 2017] AAMC STATEMENT ON THE MACARTHUR  AMENDMENT TO THE AMERICAN HEALTH  CAREACT AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges) President and CEO Darrell G. Kirch, MD, issued the following statement regarding the amendment to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) introduced by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R–N.J.): ‘‘This week, the House could vote on a new version of the American Health Care Act that includes the MacArthur amendment. Unfortunately, the amendment does not address the limitations in the original measure, such as making highquality, affordable health insurance available to all, and maintaining programs to support the health care safety net—at least at current levels—until other comparable coverage expansions are available. The amendment’s treatment of essential health benefits and health status underwriting dilutes protections for many Americans and would leave individuals with preexisting conditions facing higher premiums and reduced access to vital care. The shortcomings in the underlying bill remain the same. The original analysis from the Congressional Budget Office indicated that 14 million Americans would lose their health insurance coverage as early as next year, and as many as 24 million by 2024. Nothing in the bill has changed that alters the fact that this legislation would lead to fewer Americans with quality insurance, less affordable coverage for those who have it, and the destabilization of the current Medicaid program. We continue to urge members of Congress to engage with the nation’s medical schools and teaching hospitals and other stakeholders to find ways to achieve high quality health care for all Americans.’’ Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SA´NCHEZ ), the vice chair of the Democratic Caucus. Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I can’t believe we are here again to vote, or not, on the Republicans socalled healthcare bill. Let me remind my colleagues that we are finally here only after Republicans failed to even hold a vote on March 24, and then offered extreme, multiple amendments to appease the furthest right of their party. But I have to give it to them: it takes real cojones to stand here and vote on a bill that they know provides nearly zero healthcare benefits for the American people. It takes real fortitude and conviction to stand up for a bill that cuts coverage for 24 million Americans, guts Medicaid, reduces the solvency of Medicare, and segregates the sickest. The truth is, Republicans lack the bravery to call this bill what it really is: a massive tax cut for the rich on the backs of working moms and dads and the sick. They lack the integrity to do the hard work that it takes to craft an actual healthcare bill that would build upon current law and improve the health of Americans. I implore my colleagues to come to their senses, vote against this terrible bill, and work with us to continue to improve health care in this country for all Americans. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I have been waiting also for my friends across the aisle to stand up and say that ObamaCare is a failure. I guess they can’t. For the last 7 years, the voters have. Small business owners and American entrepreneurs: 
As an entrepreneur with two special needs children, the ACA is an expensive nightmare. Both my husband and I are smallbusiness owners and must pay for individual insurance. We are on the highest deductible plan offered to us, a monthly premium over $1,000, and outstanding medical bills that we are struggling to pay off. We have seen our premium go up at least 14 percent and the expenses of care, lab, et cetera. With all exceptions, to the President, he is offering to his corporate friends. We are the ones who get ignored. That is the true face of ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ). (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, mandates seldom work. Markets do work. My friends on the Democratic side of the aisle haven’t pointed out that 19 million Americans have chosen to pay the tax penalty to the IRS, rather than be forced into one of these ObamaCare plans. They talk about all the people who have gotten coverage. Most of them got coverage when the bill that is now called ObamaCare expanded Medicaid to healthy adults and paid 100 percent of the cost to cover those individuals at a cost right now of about $70 billion a year. Mandates don’t work; markets do. I choose less government mandate, more personal freedom. Vote for the rule; vote for the bill. Let’s restore markets and freedom to health care in America. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHUof California.) Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Kate called my office, worried for her son who is 1year old and was born with muscular dystrophy. He will need care for the rest of his life. Without the ban on preexisting conditions, the cost of insurance for her son will be astronomical. She is paralyzed with fear about how she is going to be able to care for him for the rest of his life. Under TrumpCare, the healthcare bill written for Donald Trump and not the American people, insurance companies will be able to charge Kate’s son more because he has a preexisting condition. Imagine that. Her son’s health care will be out of reach, his precious life endangered. That is unimaginably cruel, especially when we have a system in place right now that gets Kate’s son the treatment he deserves. That is why I am opposing this bill today. I cannot support a measure that we know will cost sick people more money, will force families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, will force 24 million people off their insurance, and guts essential health benefits. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this horrific bill today. b1015 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I believe probably the reason they won’t vote for it is they don’t understand it, because preexisting conditions 
are covered. If you have coverage now, nothing in our bill, no matter what would come from the State or anyone else, would lose the preexisting conditions. I guess it is just easier to talk your talking points and have your poster and go from there. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I, too, am a person with preexisting conditions, and I believe it is not just something that I should do; it is a responsibility for me to be the staunchest advocate for people out there who have preexisting conditions. That is why I am such an ardent supporter of this bill. I think every American and every person out there with preexisting conditions should be asking themselves: How is it that they have coverage if every single insurance provider has pulled out of the market? If there is no entity to go to out there and provide insurance, how is it that preexisting conditions could possibly be covered? I have had the question constantly: How is it so difficult for Republicans to get this bill passed, to get this through the floor? The answer is this, and this is again the question that every American should be asking themselves: Who is going out there and saying that preexisting conditions won’t be covered? It is the exact same group of people that went out there and lied to the face of every single American, telling them that if they liked their plan, they would keep their plan; if they liked their doctor, they would keep their doctor; that the average American family was going to save $2,500 or more on health insurance. That was a boldfaced lie. It was orchestrated by architects who specifically went out with the intention to prey on the American people. That is who is going out there selling these lies against my party. I resent that completely because we have come up with a plan, with a strategy to go out there and save health care for the American people, and I couldn’t be more proud of that. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, maybe the gentleman hasn’t been listening to all the organizations and healthcare advocates who have come out strongly opposed to the Republican bill, that I have read into the RECORD , who know a lot more about health care than anybody in this House, who spend their lives protecting people and protecting people’s healthcare rights. They are all in strong opposition to the Republican bill because you take away the protections for preexisting conditions, plain and simple. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we began this debate listening to my friend from Texas talk about how he was humbled to be here today supporting the Republican bill. Well, frankly, I think he should be embarrassed, embarrassed that my Republican colleagues are afraid to have a full, open, lengthy debate about these impacts. We are taking a consequential piece of legislation, and Republicans are jamming it through without a CBO score so they don’t know the impacts, and we don’t have the confidence. We do know, however, my friend from Massachusetts has read into the RECORD item after item, the medical association, disease advocacy groups, the American Association of Retired People, it is an honor roll of people who know about health care, who fought to preserve and protect and enhance, and the Republicans have no answer to refute this litany of experts who are independent, who are professional, who care. Who are opposed. That is something that I think Republicans should be ashamed of. They have had 7 years chipping away at the Affordable Care Act to try to make it worse, yet it still is supported by people who know. The Republican approach should be rejected. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the American Public Health Association in strong opposition to the Republican bill. 
AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH  ASSOCIATION , May 4, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the American Public Health Association, a diverse community of public health professionals who champion the health of all people and communities, I write to express our continued strong opposition to H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The amended bill would be even worse for the nation’s health than the original proposal and does nothing to improve the health of the American public. Additionally, the bill would have the greatest negative impact on the health of the most vulnerable Americans. According to the March Congressional Budget Office analysis, the legislation would result in 14 million Americans losing health insurance coverage in 2018. By 2026, CBO estimates 24 million individuals would lose coverage, taking the uninsured rate up to a staggering 52 million, nearly double the number of Americans who would lack insurance under existing law. The bill would cut critical premium subsidies for low and middleincome families and phase out the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Under the proposal, many, especially lowincome and older Americans, would pay higher premiums, receive lower subsidies and be subject to higher out of pocket costs, including higher deductibles and copays for plans that provide less coverage. Health insurance coverage is critical to preventing disease, ensuring health and wellbeing and driving down the use of costlier providers of care. Unfortunately, this proposal will result in a greater number of people losing coverage than the number of people who have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act, putting many at risk of premature death due to the lack of access to critical health services. The amended bill would be even worse for public health than the original bill that was pulled from the House floor in late March. The amended bill would allow states to opt out of requiring health plans to cover the 10 essential health benefits such as maternity care, mental health and substance abuse disorder services and prescription drug coverage. It would also allow insurers to charge significantly higher premiums for people with preexisting conditions and possibly allow insurers to charge older adults even higher premiums. The inclusion of a mere $8 billion over five years will do little to help people with preexisting conditions who could see drastically higher premiums leaving millions in the individual and small group market with no protections from insurer discrimination. The bill would also eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the first and only mandatory funding stream specifically dedicated to public health and prevention activities. The fund has already provided more than $6 billion to support a variety of public health activities in every state including tracking and preventing infectious diseases like the Ebola and Zika viruses, community and clinical prevention programs, preventing childhood lead poisoning and expanding access to childhood immunizations. Eliminating the fund would devastate the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The fund currently makes up 12 percent of CDC’s budget and eliminating this funding stream would force Congress to replace the funding through the regular appropriations process where resources for nondefense discretionary programs are already too low. Not only would the bill phase out the Medicaid expansion under the ACA, it would also make other troubling changes to the Medicaid program, converting it to a per capita program. The most recent CBO analysis estimated the bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by $839 billion over the next decade, drastically cutting resources to states, many of which are already struggling with tight budgets. The bill would also block Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood for one year—which CBO estimates will lead to less access to care, more unintended births and more costs for the Medicaid program. While the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, the law has made progress in addressing the biggest challenges facing our health system including the rising costs associated with our health care system, uneven quality of care, deaths due to medical errors, discriminatory practices by health insurance providers and the shrinking ranks of the nation’s primary care providers. The ACA has made progress in shifting our health system from one that focuses on treating the sick to one that focuses on keeping people healthy. We ask you to oppose this and future efforts to repeal or weaken the ACA. Instead, we urge you to work on a bipartisan basis to improve and build upon the successes of the ACA and to work to provide health insurance coverage to the more than 28 million who still lack coverage. We look forward to working with you to create the healthiest nation in one generation. Sincerely, GEORGES C. B ENJAMIN , MD, Executive Director. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ). Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, the Republican healthcare bill is reckless and heartless: It increases the cost of premiums and deductibles; It imposes an age tax on older Americans; It unravels protections for patients with preexisting conditions; 
It eliminates maternity care, substance abuse treatment, and prescription drug coverage; It does away with lifetime limits and annual caps. President Trump’s claim that people with preexisting conditions will be covered is false, and it is a betrayal. It will have threatening consequences for millions of Americans. It will cost lives. If this passes today, the American people should be in the street to call out the immorality of this legislation. They should decry this offense against humanity and this offense against the American people. I call on the American people: Do not let them get away with it. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ). Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the Republicans’ latest plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. After Republicans failed to earn the votes to pass their American Health Care Act in March, I thought that we could finally move forward to find bipartisan solutions to improving health care in America. Instead, Republicans have revived their partisan goal of ACA repeal by adding provisions that have made a bad bill even worse. Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it; the bill before us today will make Americans’ health care worse in this country: This legislation will cause 24 million people to lose coverage, while drastically increasing healthcare costs on everyday families; It eliminates Federal safeguards that prevent insurers from charging older Americans higher premiums; It guts essential health benefits, like maternity care and prescription drugs; Further, it removes crucial patient protections that prevent discrimination against people with preexisting conditions, leaving our most vulnerable populations with a false promise of sufficient coverage through these failed highrisk pools. Mr. Speaker, I am saddened that so many Republicans appear willing to place hollow partisan victories above the health of their constituents. I oppose the Republican AHCA in the strongest possible terms and urge all of my colleagues to put the health of Americans first. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, our friends across the aisle put partisan interests above the health of the American people, and we are seeing the results of that today. In fact, a smallbusiness owner from Missouri says: 
I recall the days before the ACA when we would receive a 2inch notebook that contained multiple quotes from different health insurance companies. Now our options are listed on a single legalsized sheet of paper. We only received three quotes for 2017, and just two of them were adequate for our region. In 2013, our insurance cost $180,000 for 92 lives with a $2,000 deductible. In 2016, we paid $252,000 for just 61 lives who face a $5,000 deductible. Our options are dwindling, our costs are skyrocketing, and our employees are ultimately suffering because of the ACA. Again, a defense of the defenseless or a positive solution for America; that is what we are offering. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ). Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, analysis of health insurance coverage for the past 30 years, analysis of data from the New England Journal of Medicine shows that, for every 455 people who are insured, one life will be saved. With the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, it is estimated that 43,956 people a year will die. Long live the Republican Party. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, President Trump was elected by rural America. This bill betrays rural America three ways: Health care, 24 millionplus are going to lose their health care, many of them in rural America; Second, it takes healthcare dollars and it turns them into a $7 million tax cut for the wealthiest 400 families in this country; Third, the tenet of rural America is: we are in it together. That means if you are born with a preexisting condition, you have a preexisting condition, we are going to be there for you. This bill turns its back on rural America, the people who stand up for one another and believe we are in it together, you are not on your own. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate it, but it is amazing the concern for rural health care now under ObamaCare when much of rural America has been down to one provider. That is not a choice. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I am listening to this debate and I am hearing a lot of demagoguery and no solutions, no solutions for people who have seen skyrocketing premiums, no solutions for people who have lost their healthcare plans, no solutions for people who have lost their doctors, no solutions for people with preexisting conditions who are subject to the same skyrocketing premiums as everybody else, no solutions for people with preexisting conditions who don’t even have an insurer in their exchanges. I, too, have a preexisting condition. I am a cancer survivor. I am in the individual market. I am seeing the same skyrocketing premiums as everybody else. We are moving legislation today that will not only protect those with preexisting conditions, but will work to bring down premiums. Importantly, those defending the Affordable Care Act had a goal: single payer, socialized medicine, and this legislation will stop it. Vote for this legislation, save our healthcare system, and have a much better result for the American people. Mr. MCGOVERN. May I inquire of the gentleman how many more speakers he has? Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am still waiting on a couple more speakers, but I am ready to close whenever the gentleman is. Mr. MCGOVERN. Well, I am not really prepared to close because my side has a ton more to say, but I am out of time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I will tell Mr. MCGOVERN , it is his time to manage. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and given the fact there were no hearings or anything else, it would have been nice to have a little bit more time. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would change the rules of the House to prevent this bill or any other healthcarerelated legislation from being considered if it does not have a CBO cost estimate or if it would deny health coverage or require higher premiums due to preexisting conditions; impose lifetime limits on health coverage; prevent individuals under age 26 from being covered under their parents’ plan; reduce the number of people receiving health care under the Affordable Care Act; increase costs to seniors by reopening the doughnut hole and raising prescription drug costs; require people to pay for preventive services, including cancer screenings; reduce Medicare solvency or change the Medicare guarantee; or reduce Federal taxes on the 1 percent of the population with the highest incomes or increase taxes on the 80 percent of hardworking Americans earning moderate to low incomes. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous materials, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, none of us on this side are claiming that the Affordable Care Act is perfect. In fact, for 7 years, we have been prepared to work with our Republican colleagues in a bipartisan way to make it even better, to cover more people, to find ways to lower costs; but for 7 years, my Republican colleagues had no interest in doing that. All they wanted to do was repeal the bill, repeal the bill, repeal the bill and offer no alternative. Now we see their alternative, and it is an awful alternative. It is a disaster. It is an alternative that came not out 
of a deliberative process, but out of some back room somewhere. People haven’t even read this bill. They don’t even know what it does because we are not even waiting for a CBO score. This is a pathetic process that everybody should be ashamed of. Let me just say, to claim or to imply that the Republican plan covers people with preexisting conditions, it is a lie. It is a lie. Let’s be honest about it. This does not cover people with preexisting conditions. To come on the floor and say it does, to try to fool people, well, you may get away with it in the short term, you may get a headline, but I will tell you, people will figure out soon enough when they are denied healthcare coverage, when they see their costs rise and rise and rise. To have a healthcare bill that throws 24 million Americans off of health insurance, you should be ashamed. To have a healthcare bill that cuts Medicaid by $880 billion to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country, you should be ashamed. I spent a good deal of my time reading letters from organizations like the National Farmers Union, the AARP, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Paralyzed Veterans of America, March of Dimes, the American Medical Association, on and on and on, organizations that have dedicated their lives to helping people in this country that know something about this subject. b1030 And when it comes down to who do I trust, them or you, on whether or not your bill covers people with preexisting conditions, there is no contest. I trust them. They see what you are trying to do. They understand that this bill is a fraud. It is unconscionable to not only me and to people on our side, but to people who are watching this debate—Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike—that we would be spending time debating a healthcare bill that will make life worse for people in this country. Any kind of healthcare bill that came to this floor ought to be about expanding coverage and lowering cost. We want to work with you on that. Instead, you come to a bill that is going to rip health care away from tens of millions of people. How can you do this? How can you do this to the American people? How can you do this to your constituents? This is a terrible bill. You should vote ‘‘no’’ on it or, better yet, pull it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. What we have seen for the last few minutes, I would probably get up and cheer, too. Because now you look at it this way. What they want to claim as a disaster or recognize as a disaster, they didn’t recognize 7 years ago. They chose to cram it down America’s throat, and for 7 years the American people have said: No. Stop it. We don’t want a healthcare system from government that takes freedom away from us and that removes it from us. We have been presented with a list of letters from folks who are against this bill. Well, it is just a quick reminder to those, Mr. Speaker, who may be wanting to remember. Some of these same folks were the same folks who said ObamaCare was great, and who gave letters of support. I guess they are trying to cover up for 7 years of their first mistake. When we understand this—let’s go to some experts. I will just clarify them as experts, Mr. Speaker. President Bill Clinton calling ObamaCare, last year, the craziest thing in the world. He summed it up pretty well. Because what summed up here is they forgot the American people. Republicans have decided that we are going to put the American people back in control. We are not going to continue to hear from Pam in Nebraska, who is selfemployed and lost her insurance four times under ObamaCare and twice because of the Nebraska failed startup. If we are going to talk about misleading the American people, it started 7 years ago, and it ends today. It ends today. The American people deserve better. They have been thrown under the bus for 7 years. They deserve an insurance market that is open, that is accessible, and that does cover preexisting conditions. If you want the deception, follow the other side. If you want the truth, follow this side. Mr. Speaker, if I had to defend the last 7 years and offer nothing into the faces of these, yeah, I would have been hysterical on the floor this morning, too. And that is exactly what we have seen. So for those who may be, it is time to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule, ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and start giving back to America the liberty and freedom for a healthcare system that is the best in the world and has been attacked for 7 years. Again, that ends today. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R.Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has agreed to without amendment a joint resolution of the House of the following title: 
H.J. Res. 66. Joint resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to savings arrangements established by States for nongovernmental employees. f 
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT AMENDMENT Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 308, I call up the bill (H.R. 2192) to amend the Public Health Service Act to eliminate the nonapplication of certain State waiver provisions to Members of Congress and congressional staff, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. (Mr. SIMPSON ). Pursuant to House Resolution 308, the bill is considered read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2192 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF NONAPPLICATION OF CERTAIN STATE WAIVER PROVISIONS TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFF. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 308, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2192. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, after 7 years, we have heard the stories from our constituents, from our patients, from our friends, from our families who have suffered under the Affordable Care Act. Today, we will have a chance to vote on a plan that will rescue and revitalize the market and lower costs and increase flexibility for patients to choose and keep a health insurance plan that works for them and their family. However, before we can do that, we have to pass a bill that will ensure that Members of Congress and their staffs are treated the same way as the rest of America. So let’s be clear. We firmly believe that Members of Congress should live by the same rules as everyone else, period. The bill we are considering now will make a simple technical correction to ensure that the American Health Care Act and its amendments apply equally to everyone when signed into law. Over the last several months, we have worked thoughtfully and thoroughly with our colleagues in the Senate to achieve our shared goal of repealing and replacing ObamaCare. Throughout these discussions, we have come to better appreciate and better understand the other Chamber’s reconciliation limitations. As a result, we have drafted the American Health Care Act with constant awareness of what the slightest misstep may mean for the legislation’s privileged status or that 51vote threshold in the other body. Some might say it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than to draft House policy to Senate procedure, but we are confident that we have achieved that challenging feat. One of the limitations we have come to respect is that no committee other than the Senate Committee on Finance or the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions can receive a jurisdictional referral. For example, if we were to crossreference multiState plans established by the Affordable Care Act, we would get a referral to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee because those plans are under the Office of Personnel Management. b1115 So let’s be clear, congressional healthcare operates as a small group plan within the District of Columbia’s SHOP Exchange. This was a decision that was made by the Obama administration. So for waivers impacting the essential health benefits of age rating, which impacts both the individual and small group markets, Members of Congress and our staffs would be treated the same. As far as community rating, this impacts only the individual market, so no group plans, including Members of Congress or our staffs, would be impacted. Even so, in an attempt to be crystal clear, today we are passing a bill, out of fairness and transparency, to ensure that Congress operates under the same laws as private citizens, a principle that both Republicans and Democrats should support. My thanks to Representative MCSALLY for her leadership on this issue. Her bill helps deliver us a step closer to fulfilling our promise. Today we will fulfill our promise to provide relief from the higher costs and the dwindling choices for patients under the Affordable Care Act. Today we will repeal and replace ObamaCare with a better solution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. I remind my colleague from Texas that his vote for the healthcare bill will take away protections for 4,536,000 people with preexisting conditions in Texas. Mr. Speaker, I heard my colleague from Texas talk about repeal and replace. This is the myth, the hoax, that the Republicans and the President are trying to play on the American people. I assure you this is repeal. There is no replacement. The people are going to lose their insurance. They are going to pay more. They are going to have lousy insurance because they are not going to have any kind of protections. We passed the Affordable Care Act because the States were not doing the right thing. People couldn’t afford insurance. They couldn’t pay for a premium. They were too high. So what did we do? We expanded Medicaid, and we provided generous subsidies for those people who needed it. We also knew, under the old system where the States were in charge, that people got lousy insurance if they 
could even find it. Sometimes they didn’t have hospitalization, so we insisted there had to be a package that included preexisting conditions. We also said that, you know, if you were paying a lot for your copays or your deductibles, we are going to put limits on those things as well. And we put limits also on how much you can charge, what we call ‘‘community rating.’’ Now, what are the Republicans doing here today? They are getting rid of all that. They want to go back to the old days. And when they tell you that somehow they are going to be able to do this, the reason they can’t do anything is because they repeal most of the payfors that pay for the subsidies that pay for the Affordable Care Act. So when they tell you: Oh, we are going to give extra money for this, for highrisk pools or to help the States if they decide to have waivers, the bottom line is there is no money left here. There is no money to pay for those subsidies; there is no money to pay for Medicaid expansion; there is not enough money to pay for highrisk pools because they have repealed the underlying payfors that we use to pay for the Affordable Care Act. What they are doing now is going back to the old system, the Wild West of the States. They are allowing States to waiver the essential benefits package. They are saying to States that they can charge whatever they want for the insurance because they got rid of community ratings. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself another 15 seconds to say this: Do not buy into this hoax. There is no money left. They want to go back to the old system, and the old system stunk. What we did was correct the problems of the old system. So don’t believe this cruel hoax. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ), the author of the bill. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2192, a measure that eliminates double standards by preventing Members of Congress from being exempt from the State waiver provisions of the American Health Care Act, as amended. Due to very arcane Senate procedural rules within the budget reconciliation process, the MacArthur amendment to the American Health Care Act does not and cannot apply to Members of Congress. To address this, I have introduced this simple, standalone, two page bill that would appeal the exemption for Members of Congress should the American Health Care Act become law. In the military, the same code of conduct and standards apply to the entire chain of command. Now, in my role as a lawmaker, I believe that any law we pass that applies to our constituents must also apply equally to Members of Congress. Individuals who are stewards of the public trust must abide by the rules that they make. My bill, H.R. 2192, will ensure that Congress abides by the laws they pass and is treated no differently than other hardworking Americans. Regardless of your vote on the AHCA, this is a bill that each and every single Member of Congress should support. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Arizona that her vote for this bill could increase premiums for people with breast cancer in Arizona by $42,250. I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ). Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I think that today is yet another sad day here in the House of Representatives for the people of our country, because what is being brought forward is the same bill that we debated and that went down because of the weight of the problems and the cruelty of that bill. It is the same thing with a few more poison pills in it. People are going to have to pay higher premiums and deductibles, and it is going to increase what comes out of their pocket; there is going to be less coverage; 24 million people will lose their coverage—that remains in this bill—and key protections are gutted, American people: emergency rooms, maternity care, opioid, mental health care, a string of things that you want in your insurance coverage, a crushing age tax for seniors. Now, there is a real hypocrisy here. Every single Member of Congress has been enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. I want to know which one of you dropped out of it. It was good enough for you—one person, great. Two people, big deal. It was good enough for you, but it is not good enough for your constituents. And you know what? Who is standing with you? Not the doctors in our country, not the AARP to seniors, not nurses, not the cancer association, not anyone. This bill violates the American people. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ), the vice chairman of the Health Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the American Health Care Act. A constituent of mine from Kentucky personally reached out to share her story. Under ObamaCare, the cost of her family’s monthly premium rose to over $1,000 with a deductible of over $12,000, in total, almost half her income. When she fell and broke three ribs, she couldn’t afford to go to the emergency room because of the astronomical deductible. She suffered for weeks until as she could afford care; and as she said in her own words: ‘‘I paid 50 percent of my income for something I am forced to buy and cannot use.’’ In Kentucky, there are many counties with just one health insurer on the exchange. That is not right. Affordable health care means having real access to health care when you need it. ObamaCare reduces access. It is not there, when they need it, for many Americans. I urge my colleagues to support the American Health Care Act. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Kentucky that his vote for the healthcare bill will take away protections for 881,000 people with preexisting conditions in Kentucky. I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENE GREEN ), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is appalling what is happening today on the House floor. It appears to be: let’s just pass a bill, no matter what it does or who gets hurt with it. TrumpCare is nothing more than broken promises and meanspirited policy. It would mean higher healthcare costs for more than 24 million hardworking Americans losing their health coverage, key protections are gutted, older Americans are hung out to dry, the end of Medicaid as we know it, and cuts in Medicare. If TrumpCare passes, Americans with preexisting conditions could be pushed off their insurance and sent in the highrisk pools that are not affordable. Highrisk insurance pools do not work when everyone in the pool is a high risk. I was a State legislator when we did that. You have to have highrisk pools that share the wealth, so to speak. People will be left with soaring costs, worse coverage, and rationed care. It is a frightening future where millions of Americans who need affordable, dependable health care are left out in the cold. There is an obvious, irresponsible reason why this vote is being rammed through without even a Congressional Budget Office estimate or an opportunity for Members to even know what is in it. They don’t want people figuring out the realworld consequences and the devastation it means to our American families. History will not be kind to the people who support this awful bill. I urge my colleagues to do what is right and vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ). Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, the Senate never quits. When ObamaCare was passed in 2010, the Senate Democrats refused to use ObamaCare for their personal insurance. Most Americans know that what is good for the goose is good for the gander. My staff, my family, 
and I have been on ObamaCare since day one. Incredibly, the Senate is at it again. They don’t want the American Health Care Act to apply to them because it is not right. They are special, and so they put a clause to exempt Congress from the American Health Care Act so they could filibuster the healthcare bill. That dog didn’t hunt in 2010; it ain’t hunting in 2017. If it is good for the American people, our bosses, it is good for their servants, Congress, us. I urge my colleagues to be true public servants. Vote for H.R. 2192. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Texas that his vote for this bill could increase premiums for people with diabetes in Texas by $5,100. I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ). Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, the American Health Care Act was pulled from the House floor in March because the American people realized it was a deeply flawed bill. That bill would have ripped healthcare coverage away from 24 million of our constituents. For those lucky enough to maintain coverage, the bill would have massively raised premiums, deductibles, and outofpocket costs. The crushing age tax in this bill would force older adults to pay astronomically high premiums. So what did the majority do in the last 6 weeks? They made the bill worse. The MacArthur amendment lets States opt out of the essential benefits of the ACA. Not only would this jeopardize insurance availability for the onethird of Americans who have preexisting conditions, it would let insurance companies deny coverage altogether for maternity, for emergency room, for mental health, and for other essential benefits. And because the MacArthur amendment eliminates community ratings, everybody’s insurance costs would skyrocket. I am going to tell you something. My Republican colleagues are going to be really, really sorry that they rushed this bill to the floor before they got an amended CBO score. The reason is, when we do get this—and make no mistake, we will get this—they are going to find out that many more millions of people besides the 24 million people, originally, who are going to lose their insurance are going to be shocked to wake up to find out, if this TrumpCare bill passes, many millions more will lose their coverage. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this poorly conceived legislation. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ), a valuable member of the Health Subcommittee on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2192 to ensure Members of Congress and staff are not exempt from the American Health Care Act. Making good on our word, this legislation will be passed alongside the American Health Care Act and fixes a technical error made to comply with the Senate rules. In our country, lawmakers are not above the law. Elected officials and the people we represent should have the same health care, period. As an original cosponsor of H.R. 2192, I believe this is common sense. It is straightforward legislation, and it is necessary as a companion bill to the American Health Care Act. b1130 It is really quite simple: Congress should live by the same laws it creates. When the American Health Care Act becomes law, Members of Congress and staff will have the same health care as the American people. I urge passage of H.R. 2192, in conjunction with the American Health Care Act. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Florida that his vote for the healthcare bill will take away protections for 3,116,000 people with preexisting conditions in Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ). Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for the past 7 years we have had 62 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but Republicans have never once put a plan on the floor for the American people. Well, today, we all get a chance to go on record of where we stand on this bill, this shameful, cruel bill. Here are the facts: 24 million Americans are going to lose their insurance if this bill becomes law. Over $839 billion gets cut out of the Medicaid program. The essential benefit package in States, wiped out. In my State, it is taking care of people with mental illness and opioid addiction; gone. This takes $117 billion out of the Medicare trust fund. This is a healthcare bill—this is really a tax bill masquerading as a healthcare bill. The plan here is to take this money out of the healthcare system and use it for tax cuts. That is what this bill is going to do. This creates a survivalofthefittest health care for America. If you are young, if you are healthy, if you are wealthy, this bill is for you; you are going to do okay. But if you are old, if you are sick, if you are poor, there is no coverage in this bill for you. If you have a young child with cancer, guess what, those benefits aren’t going to be paid. You are going to run out of benefits. These highrisk pools are a sham. They are not adequately funded. This bill must be defeated. The American people will remember who votes for this bill today. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I wish to now speak to the underlying MacArthur amendment that the McSally bill is here to modify. The MacArthur amendment specifically would allow States to waive three of ObamaCare’s costliest mandates. Let me stress that again. It would allow States—not require States; it would allow States to waive three of ObamaCare’s costliest mandates, essential health benefits, age ratings, and community rating. In waiving these Federal mandates, health insurers would not be allowed to discriminate by gender or preexisting condition, and no one would be denied coverage, period. Here is how it works: a State may apply to waive essential health benefits or to increase the age rating ratio from the bill’s underlying 5to1 ratio. They may also change the way individuals who have not maintained continuous coverage are charged for their healthcare plan, but only if the State has a risksharing program in place, like the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program established by the Palmer Schweikert amendment. In order to receive a waiver, a State must explain to the Secretary of Health and Human Services how the program will reduce average premiums for patients, increase enrollment for residents, stabilize the State’s health insurance market, stabilize premiums for individuals living with preexisting conditions, or increase the patient’s healthcare options. It is important to note that in providing assistance to reduce premiums or other outofpocket costs, for individuals who may be subject to an increase in their monthly premiums because they reside in a State with an approved waiver, have a preexisting condition, are uninsured because they have not maintained continuous coverage and they purchase health insurance on the individual market, there will be $138 billion to assist with premium assistance. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, understand this: the Republicans planned to exempt Members of Congress from the provisions of TrumpCare until they got caught. So here are five numbers that show just how deadly and dangerous the Republican bill is: Twentyfour million is the number of children, adults, and veterans whose health insurance will be ripped away. $880 billion is the size of the cut to Medicaid, threatening health care and longterm care for 74 million people: children, pregnant women, the elderly, and the disabled. $600 billion is the tax cut that goes to millionaires and billionaires and corporations. 758 percent is the premium increase a 64yearold making $26,000 a year will pay because of the Republican age tax. Seventeen percent is the percent of Americans who supported TrumpCare before they made it worse. 
The Republicans’ attempt to improve TrumpCare is like trying to douse a dumpster fire with gasoline. This bill is a disaster, and anyone who votes for it does so at their extreme peril. The American people are watching, and they will not forget. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would point out that within the State of Illinois, there were eight plans in 2015. There are five plans in 2017 with a 57 percent increase in premiums. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON ), a valuable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for giving me time to speak up. I, too, agree that Members of Congress should be subject to the same rules and laws that the American people are. So I support my colleague, Ms. MCSALLY , in this legislation. But, you know, I want to speak to the bigger, broader issue here. My colleague from Pennsylvania said: What about that family with that kid that has cancer? Where was my colleague and the friends on the other side of the aisle when ObamaCare resulted in millions of policy cancellations and millions of Americans losing their coverage because of the broken promises? Where was my colleague and the Democrats when millions of Americans were forced out of work because of the jobkilling policies of ObamaCare? Let me tell you something. The American people remembered that, and that is what happened in 2010. We didn’t hide in a back room to get what we are doing today done. We have been working on it for 6 years, and we are going to get it done today. We are going to meet the promises that we made to the American people, and starting today, ObamaCare is on its way out the door. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Ohio that his vote for this bill will take away protections for 1,919,000 people in Ohio with preexisting conditions. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD ). Mr. BUTTERFIELD. So you have been working on it for 6 years. My information is that you posted this bill at 8 last night. The Congressional Budget Office has not given it a score. They have not told the American people how much it is going to cost or how many people it is going to affect. You have skyrocketed premiums for hardworking Americans who have preexisting conditions, and that is what my colleagues need to understand. If you are an average 40yearold adult with a preexisting condition and have diabetes, it is estimated your premiums will rise $400 a month. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, $800 a month. And heaven forbid if you have some preexisting condition involving cancer; the numbers just go off of the chart. You know and I know this bill will not see the light of day in the Senate. This is a political stunt to save face with your rightwing base. You know it and we know it. If this wasn’t so serious, affecting the economy and the affordability of insurance, I would say just go on and do it, because you will lose your opportunity to serve in this House and you will ultimately lose the majority. Don’t do it. Forget about politics. Think about the 24 million Americans who will not be able to afford health insurance coverage. That is why the American Medical Association, AARP, American Nurses Association, and all of the other stakeholder groups have pleaded with you. They have called your office. They have written you letters. They have written us letters. Don’t do it. I ask you to vote ‘‘no’’ on this illconceived legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman and all Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, directed to the Chair, I would just make note of the fact in North Carolina, there were three plans offered in 2015, down to two plans in 2017, premium increase of 82 percent. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ), another member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, regardless of the myths being spun by the other side of the aisle that refused to read 129 pages of a bill, the Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable. My constituents have been asking for relief from this collapsing law for years. They can no longer afford to pay more for less; and refusing to act is not an option. Under ObamaCare, outofpocket expenses have skyrocketed not just for people on exchanges, but for all patients. Premium increases are nearly four times larger than previously projected. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, seem content with the current flawed system which puts the government in charge of people’s health and promises coverage that is going away. Let’s vote to increase choice, lower costs, enhance protections, truly cover preexisting conditions, and get Washington out of the way so that patients and their doctors are once again at the center of healthcare decisions. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Michigan that his vote for this bill could increase premiums for those who are pregnant in Michigan by $13,790 per year. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MATSUI ). Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, Republicans are turning their backs on the American people today. There are no guarantees with this bill. This bill will raise costs for families, penalize people nearing retirement with an age tax, and rip coverage away from millions of Americans. And if that wasn’t bad enough, this revised TrumpCare bill guts protections for people with preexisting conditions; people like Cameron, who was diagnosed with cancer at 24 years old. Because of the Affordable Care Act, he was able to access coverage and attend graduate school. Now, of course, he has a preexisting condition. This is personal for Cameron and millions more in this country, and they are not going to be silent as Republicans rush this legislation through. Mr. Speaker, lives are on the line. I urge my Republican colleagues to have the courage to vote ‘‘no’’ on this legislation. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), another valuable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a member of the Health Subcommittee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the American Health Care Act. For the last 7 years, I have watched ObamaCare crush the healthcare system that I worked in for more than 30 years. Thanks to ObamaCare, we have an insurance exchange that has withered to where a third of the counties in our country have only one insurer. At home in Georgia, 96 counties have only one choice on the exchange. That is not a choice. ObamaCare has failed, and the American Health Care Act is critical to resuscitate our healthcare system and move it in a direction where patients, families, and doctors are making decisions, not the Federal Government and bureaucrats sitting behind a desk in Washington. The American people need and deserve better, and that is why we must pass the American Health Care Act. This legislation guts ObamaCare and rebuilds a system that would deliver the choice and control that patients need and deserve all while ensuring that health insurers will not be allowed to discriminate by gender or preexisting conditions, and no one will be denied coverage, period. b1145 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Georgia that his vote for the healthcare bill will take away protections for 1,791,000 people with preexisting conditions in Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ), who is the vice ranking member our committee. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this bill will be devastating to families all across America. The Republican bill rips coverage away from millions of Americans. The last projection was 24 million. They didn’t wait for the new 
projection, which is going to be much higher. The Republican bill hurts Medicare, and it shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund just when we have more baby boomers retiring and calling on Medicare. It imposes a huge age tax because it makes affordable insurance much less affordable if you are about age 50 or older. A dirty little secret here that most people have not discussed is the harm it does to the Medicaid guarantee. For over 50 years in America, we have said that if you are disabled, if you have a family member with Alzheimer’s, or if you have a child with a complex medical condition, you are not going to be destitute because your health care is so expensive. That is one of the fundamental guarantees of Medicaid for 50 years. They take that away and go to the heart of the medical care that is provided under Medicaid as well. It is shameful. But it got worse. As we approach this day, they didn’t have the votes, so they made it worse by going to the heart of the Affordable Care Act which ended discrimination against our neighbors with a preexisting condition. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. They also said essential health benefits are not going to matter. What good is an insurance policy if you buy it and you can’t go to the emergency room? We have got to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. We have got to fight back against this crass power play that transfers all the wealth in this country. Vote ‘‘no.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is no longer under recognition. The Chair would ask Members to respect the gavel and the time yielded. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would point out that, in the State of Florida, there were 10 insurance plans available in the individual market in 2015, down to 5 plans in 2017, with a 24 percent premium increase. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. COLLINS), who is a very valuable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, for the past 7 years, the American people have pleaded with their Representatives in Washington to repeal ObamaCare. Today, every Member of this body has the opportunity to do just that. We have the chance to eliminate excruciating mandates and taxes that are suffocating our economy and marketplaces. Under ObamaCare, premiums have increased by over 37 percent since 2014, onethird of counties in this country have only one insurance provider, and 4.7 million Americans were kicked off the insurance coverage they wanted to maintain despite President Obama’s promise that, if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it. But today we have the chance to lower premiums, increase competition among insurance providers, and improve access to health insurance for all Americans. We finally have the chance to formally reject an unprecedented government overreach into health care and take the first step towards giving patients control over their own health. In western New York, this bill will have even more profound benefits. The amendment that I authored with Representative JOHN FASO will relieve county governments in New York of a $2.3 billion unfunded mandate forced onto county taxpayers by the Governor of New York and will substantially reduce the tax burdens of property owners across New York State. This one provision of the American Health Care Act will save taxpayers in the eight counties that I represent over $470 million a year. This is a gamechanger for local New York governments and restores a fundamental tenet of representative democracies that the level of government that makes the decision about spending should be responsible for raising those funds. I am proud to stand up for western New Yorkers whose voices have been silenced for too long, and I am proud to vote for the freedom, fiscal responsibility, and local decisionmaking this bill guarantees. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to do the same. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from New York that his vote for this bill will take away protections for 3,031,000 people in New York with preexisting conditions. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. CLARKE ). Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the American Health Care Act. This dangerous and destructive bill leaves 24 million Americans without coverage. It will cause the uninsured rate for my district in Brooklyn, New York, to skyrocket to over 12 percent and leaves over 400,000 Brooklynites in my district without coverage. Because of the severe cuts to Medicaid, this bill will also put people in the terrible position of having to choose between being able to eat, being able to obtain lifesustaining medication, or visiting their doctor. Which one do you, Mr. Speaker, suggest they choose? For most Americans, Medicaid benefits are not the end goal but, rather, provide temporary support. For seniors, Medicaid can mean the difference between nursing home care and dying alone. I urge my colleagues to consider the harmful and deadly reallife impact of this legislation, and I vehemently oppose it. I ask that we resist this cynical reverse Robin Hood sham that takes from the poor and gives to the rich. As President Lincoln said: ‘‘You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.’’ This is a sham, and we need to vote it down. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN), who is a very valuable Member of Congress and a fellow physician. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, once again, in support of the American Health Care Act. I do this as a doctor for the good of my patients. We are here today to repeal ObamaCare, to take healthcare decisions away from Washington bureaucrats and give them back to the people. The American Health Care Act will create a patientcentered system that will lower the cost of health care and serve patients. This act eliminates ObamaCare’s taxes, subsidies, and mandates. It defunds Planned Parenthood. It puts Medicaid on a budget, and it is the largest entitlement reform in a generation. Without Washington mandates driving up costs and limiting access to care, Americans will have the freedom to obtain quality healthcare plans that fit their needs at a cost they can afford. All this talk about preexisting conditions, this bill provides guaranteed issuance. Let’s not break our promise on repealing ObamaCare. Let’s be true to our word. We owe it to the people who sent us here. I support the American Health Care Act, Mr. Speaker, and I urge all Members to do the same. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Florida that his vote for this bill could increase premiums for people with asthma in Florida by $4,090 per year. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ). Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, what this legislation does on the surface is very clear: it makes health care more expensive. The more you need it—the sicker or older or poorer you are—the further out of reach it will be. That is why doctors, hospitals, nurses, the mental health community, and patients have spoken out, and spoken out against this bill. But this bill doesn’t just cut coverage and hike premiums all for a tax cut for the wealthy. It codifies a worldview by this administration that is dead set on dividing America along the lines of the god of your prayers, whom you love, where you come from, and your fate and fortune. We see it in their tax plan, in their budget cuts, in immigration policy, and now in health care, a worldview that scapegoats the struggling and the suffering, that sees fault in illness, and that rejects the most basic universal truth of the human existence, which is that every single one of us one day will be brought to our knees by a diagnosis we didn’t expect, a phone call we can’t imagine, and a loss we cannot endure. 
So we take care of each other because, but for the grace of God, there go I one day, and we hope we will be shown that mercy, too. It is the ultimate test of the character of this country confronting our Chamber today: not the power we give the strong, but the strength with which we embrace the weak. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 13
3⁄4minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 11
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH ), who is a valuable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, this bill guarantees access for all. And when I say ‘‘access,’’ let me be clear: it is access for all. When you have insurance companies that are pulling out—today we learned Aetna is pulling out of Virginia—and when you have counties across these United States that no longer have anyone who is willing to provide the ObamaCare insurance, that is not access; When you have a situation where somebody comes up to you at the local county fair and says, ‘‘You have got to get me out of ObamaCare. It is killing me. It is killing our family’s finances because we have such a high deductible, because we have such a high copay, and my husband is very sick,’’ he may have a piece of paper, Mr. Speaker, he may have a piece of paper, but it is not really health insurance when you can’t really use it without having to sell off what little assets you may have or worry about whether or not you can afford to have a roof over your head any longer. This is not working. ObamaCare is not working. This bill will bring some sanity back to the system. It will take us a couple of years, but the rates of insurance will, in fact, come down. This business that we keep hearing that all these people are going to be without availability of insurance, it is just fake news. It is not true. This bill does everything that people want it to do, but it gives them choices—not mandates from the Federal Government, but choices—about their health care. I have been interested to hear some people saying that you all are just ramming this through because the bill wasn’t posted until last night. What wasn’t posted until last night was the LongUpton amendment, or the Upton Long amendment. It is two pages. I invite my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to read it. The McSally bill is a page and a quarter. The MacArthur amendment, which has been out for over a week, is about 8 pages. They could have read it while we have been standing here debating this bill. But they don’t choose to read the bill, they don’t choose to learn the facts, and they don’t choose to tell the American people the truth. They want to scare the American people to make them believe that this is a bad bill. This is a good bill, and I urge everyone to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Virginia that his vote for the healthcare bill will take away protections for 1,344,000 people with preexisting conditions in Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. PETERS ). Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I have seen this bill every step of the way over the short month we have considered it. I was there for the 26hour meeting we had at the Energy and Commerce Committee. We didn’t have an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office then either. If you want to accuse us of not wanting to know the facts, that is something that is very basic to know. We would like to have that here. Here we are again on the floor without that analysis. Through all of that time, the sad thing is that we have not heard one real argument for how this bill would make health care more affordable and accessible for families in my district in San Diego or anywhere in the country. Now, the healthcare system isn’t perfect. There are problems with some insurance markets because they are not providing the choice they should. So let’s fix them. But that is not what we are doing. What we are doing is we are on the cusp of passing a bill that is opposed by doctors, nurses, hospitals, patients, seniors, and just about everybody because it would make the problems in our healthcare system worse, not better. This is a bill that, if it were to become law, would rip health insurance coverage away from at least 24 million Americans. That is the Congressional Budget Office. That is not fake news. That is the truth. The bill would leave many Americans with preexisting conditions with premiums they can’t afford or without any coverage at all. Today’s votes take us one step closer to a system where families go bankrupt over an unexpected illness and our emergency rooms are filled with mothers once again seeking basic care for their children. I refuse to accept that is the best we can do for the American people, and I am voting ‘‘no.’’ Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), who is a fellow physician and the chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, the American Health Care Act in no way changes the existing regulations that allow a veteran who is eligible but not enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs’ healthcare system from using a tax credit to purchase health insurance. Language that would have codified that legislation into law was removed from an earlier version of the bill to comply with Senate rules. b1200 Removing language in no way changes that existing regulation or a veteran’s eligibility to receive a tax credit. By the way, that is the exact same language that was in the ACA. I repeat that: the American Health Care Act in no way affects a veteran’s ability to access tax credits. I am disturbed that our colleagues in the minority, Mr. Speaker, would assert that it does, in an effort to score political points against this legislation. Fearmongering has no place in this debate or where America’s veterans are concerned. As chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, as a medical doctor, and as a veteran myself, ensuring that veterans’ health care is protected is my highest priority in this Congress, and I would not stand for language in this bill or any other bill that would compromise a veteran’s ability to access care. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my opposition to this morally bankrupt bill, and I include in the RECORD a letter of opposition from the National Rural Health Association. 
[From the National Rural Health Association] VOTENO TO THE AMERICAN HEALTH CAREACT The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural America. The AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure crisis. Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill improve the base bill, NRHA is concerned that the bill still falls woefully short in making health care affordable and accessible to rural Americans. For example, the modified bill contains a decrease in the Medical Expense Deduction threshold from 10% to 5.8% in an attempt to assist Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 who would see their premiums skyrocket under the current plan. However, this deduction is not a credit and therefore would be of little use to low income seniors that are in very low tax brackets or do not pay income tax at all. Additionally, the new amendments to freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of Jan. 1, 2018, and reduce the Medicaid percapita growth rate will disproportionately harm rural Americans. The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved populations in our nation without coverage, and further escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to the Wall Street Journal, the ‘‘GOP health plan would hit rural areas hard. 
. . . Poor, older Americans would see the largest increase in insurancecoverage costs.’’ The LA Times reports ‘‘Americans who swept President Trump to victory— lowerincome, older voters in conservative, rural parts of the country—stand to lose the most in federal healthcare aid under a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.’’ Let’s be clear—many provisions in the ACA failed rural America. The lack of plan competition in rural markets, exorbitant premiums, deductibles and copays, the coop collapses, lack of Medicaid expansion, and devastating Medicare cuts to rural providers—all collided to create a health care crisis in rural America. However, it’s beyond frustrating that an opportunity to fix these problems is squandered, and instead, a greater health care crisis will be created in rural America. Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to protect rural patients’ access to care. Three improvements are critical for rural patients and providers: 1. Medicaid—Though most rural residents are in nonexpansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%). Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is different and thus requires different programs to succeed. Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not ‘bonus’ payments, but rather alternative, costeffective and targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for millions of rural patients and financial stability for thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal health care reform must protect a state’s ability to protect its rural safety net providers. The federal government must not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to care. Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to create stability among rural providers to maintain access to care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers, a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health Service providers, and individual rural providers. 2. Market Reform—Fortyone percent of rural marketplace enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing 70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums. Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34 for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan). Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes, cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance. Rural communities have fewer health care providers for insurers to contract, with to provide an adequate network to serve the community. Any federal health care reform proposal must address the fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for participation and are currently not obliged to provide service to markets with less advantageous risk pools. Demographic realities of the rural population make the market less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the same way that financial service institutions are required to provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable insurance companies should be required to provide services in underserved communities. 3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals— Rural hospitals serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban), thus acrosstheboard Medicare cuts do not have across the board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad debt decrease significantly. However, because of unaffordable health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has actually increased 50% since the ACA was passed. According to MedPAC ‘‘Average Medicare margins are negative, and under current law they are expected to decline in 2016’’ has led to 7% gains in median profit margins for urban providers while rural providers have experienced a median loss of 6%. If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to protect rural patients’ access to care, could rapidly be undone. The National Rural Health Association implores Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the nation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my colleague from Tennessee that his vote could increase premiums with breast cancer in Tennessee by $38,550 per year. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ). Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this misguided legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This vote might be the single most important issue our Congress deals with. It literally means life or death for too many people in our country. What we vote on today is ultimately a reflection of our values as a nation. I believe that we have a moral responsibility to take care of the most vulnerable among us. The nuns taught me that. The Bible teaches us that. They are the sick, the poor, the elderly. This dangerous bill does nothing to protect them. In fact, it will do more harm to our most vulnerable. There are 129 million Americans who suffer from a preexisting condition. They are our neighbors, our friends, and, for some, our family. They are the people attending their townhall meetings. For me, I am a caregiver. I spend more time at the hospital and with the doctors than I want to. Person after person comes up to me and tells me their story and begs me not to lose their insurance. Healthy Michigan let them go to the doctor for the first time. The Affordable Care Act made a guarantee that someone with a preexisting condition could not be charged more than healthy people and that coverage would be available to all. Please vote against this shameful bill. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACK ), the chairman of the Budget Committee. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I am always amazed when I start hearing conversations about the Affordable Care Act and how it is working so well today. I want to talk about two situations in my home State of Tennessee. When the Affordable Care Act went into place in the State of Tennessee, we had a risk pool. The risk pool covered about 28,000 people. They were happy with their care, they were happy with their providers, and they were happy with the cost. It was patient centered. They determined what best fit their needs. These were people with preexisting conditions, happy with where they were. In 1 day, because the Federal Government said, You don’t meet this and you don’t meet that and you don’t meet this, they lost their insurance. They were in the marketplace. I want to tell you about two situations that are very close to me, but they only represent a number of the many calls that I get in my office. One is a good friend of mine who has lupus. She went on the marketplace. For the first year, she did pretty good. Her premiums were pretty low; her deductible was reasonable. But here is what she found: she couldn’t keep her doctor. Can you imagine someone who has had lupus for a number of years, it is being controlled, and now she is told she cannot keep her doctor? She had to find other doctors. She was not happy with that because she had a relationship. They didn’t use the same treatment and care that she had received before. So she has not felt very healthy. In the meantime, every year that it is renewed, she calls me to say: My premiums have gone up, my deductibles have gone up, and now it is more than what I was paying before when I liked what I had and I couldn’t keep it, opposite of what the President told everyone: If you like what you have, you can keep it. The second one is someone who has myasthenia gravis. Again, on that same risk pool. She lost her opportunity to get the medication that she was receiving, an IV medication. She has myasthenia gravis. She was very controlled, able to work, living a healthy lifestyle. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Mrs. BLACK. She lost her opportunity to have that medication because that medication was $400 a month, now 
it is $3,400 month, and no longer can she get her medication. When the other side talks about how wonderful this system is, I implore them to come to our State and talk to the people in our State. I am a registered nurse. I know what it is like to take care of people who have healthcare conditions who need to be in a risk pool. But let’s do it the right way. Let’s give it to our States. Let’s allow this now to be used in a way that is patientcentered, the way it was working in my home State of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I am looking forward to the vote later on this afternoon. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Tennessee that her vote will take away protections for 1.265 million in her State with preexisting conditions. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ). Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, President Trump and the Republicans are looking for a win. They want to put points on the scoreboard. But why would you want to win by taking healthcare coverage away from 24 million Americans? Why would you consider it a victory to raise premiums and copayments and deductibles on millions of Americans, including millions of older Americans? Why would you view it as a success to eliminate protections for preexisting conditions? If I could vote against this bill 100 times, I would do it. If I could vote against it 1,000 times for the thousands of my constituents that will be hurt by this bill, I would. It is wrong, it is immoral, and it is inhumane. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ), the vice chairman of the Health Subcommittee on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, what I want to talk about is what is underlying in this bill in the traditional reform in Medicaid. Medicaid currently costs State and Federal Governments $600 billion. It is estimated in 10 years—a decade—to cost a trillion dollars. It is a system that is set up to implode on itself. So we want to fix the problem before we get to the critical point where it is going to implode. Let’s fix it now, and let’s make it right. What we do is allow States to have the same money they had in 2016—the exact same money—with growth. The growth would be the CPI, medical, and, in some categories, plus one. They also have growth in demographics. We have some people who retire to other States. They have a concern. What if I am from a State where somebody lives in an area and then they move to my State when they are older and typically cost more in the Medicaid system? We adjust for that. It is in the per capita allotment. As they move, they would transfer. It is not a traditional block grant, unless the State chooses to do so. We are here reforming an entitlement program for the first time since the 1990s. It is a very sound, solid way, and a way that preserves and protects the program and prevents the program from imploding on itself within a decade. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Kentucky that his vote for the healthcare bill will take away protections for 881,000 people with preexisting conditions in Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, this bill is worse than a sham. This bill is worse than a sugar pill. This bill is downright ugly. It is poison. As an emergency medicine doctor, I urge you to do no harm. I urge everybody to do no harm. Let’s be clear: a vote for this bill is a vote for 24 million people to lose their insurance. A vote for this bill is to add an age tax to those 55 years old and older. A vote for this bill is raise out ofpocket costs for everyone, with less coverage. A vote for this bill is to take away guarantees for emergency care, medicine, mental health, and maternity care. A vote for this bill is to allow private health insurance companies to drop patients who have a preexisting illness. How, you may ask? Let’s say I see a patient with diabetes who doesn’t have health insurance. A private health insurance company can say: No, we are not going to cover you. Why don’t you go to the highrisk, highcost State insurance pool that is way too expensive, with no guarantees that they will cover what they need. Therefore, they won’t be able to afford it. They won’t have coverage. They are going to go into financial ruin. All of this is in order to give $6 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest. I urge everybody to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleagues who have worked so hard on this legislation to try and rescue these failing insurance markets. We learned yesterday, I think most of Iowa now will not have a single insurer left on the exchanges. If you are one of the people out there in the one outofthree counties where people only have one option for insurance, what we are trying to do here is fix this market so you actually have insurance to cover you. We believe that in going forward with this piece of legislation not only do we give more flexibility to States to innovate, they care about the people in their States. I know my home State of Oregon does. Yet they are facing a shortfall right now that this legislation would provide over $320 million to help fill. One of their proposals is to kick 350,000 people off of Medicaid. This would help fill the gap: $320 million in the next 2 years to fill an $882 million shortfall they have. But this is a problem across the country. What we are trying to do here is reform ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, in a way that will work going into the future. Otherwise, people are going to be left with not only enormous rate increases in the premiums, but also you have seen an explosion in the cost of what they have to pay out of pocket. I have had people in my district say: Look, I am outside of that area where I get a subsidy, and I am paying full price. Our premiums have gone up 50 percent in the last 2 years. My options have gone down from four or five to maybe one or two, maybe three, and it is getting worse. They are threatening to pull out. My outofpocket costs are now so high, I am paying for something I can’t even afford to use. We are trying to fix and rescue this market and bring people in. You hear all these numbers State by State. I am not buying into that at all. They don’t understand what our bill does. We are giving States authority, we are giving protections for people, and we are going to get this straightened out once and for all so that we have an insurance market that works, but, more importantly, that we have a healthcare system that people can afford and that we can get quality health care when they see a doctor, between them and their doctor, without a bureaucrat in between. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to this horrible bill, and I include in the RECORD a letter in opposition from the Children’s Hospital Association. 
CHILDREN ’SHOSPITAL ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, March 15, 2017. Hon. ORRIN HATCH , Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. RONWYDEN , Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMEN HATCH AND WALDEN : On be half of our nation’s children’s hospitals and the patients and families they serve, we believe the American Health Care Act (AHCA) in its current form is a setback to child health on a national level. Over 30 million children receive their health care coverage through Medicaid. The legislation as written 
cuts the budget, coverage, and benefits for the care for children, many of whom have significant health care needs, including children with disabilities. Children’s hospitals have identified several provisions in the AHCA that create serious concerns about the bill as passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Foremost among these concerns is that the bill would cut the health care budget for children by converting the Medicaid program to a percapita cap system beginning in 2020. This limits future funding for the states and risks significant reductions in the Medicaid budgets providing care for over 30 million children. The current Medicaid entitlement financing structure allows for greater certainty for children in the Medicaid program and shifting to a capped environment risks undermining the current health care available to children. We are alarmed children’s health care financing is not considered and protected in the AHCA, and that children are exposed to equal funding risk in the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that AHCA will reduce overall Medicaid funding by $880 billion or 25%. Medicaid is the largest payer for children’s health care in the nation and cuts of this magnitude will have a severe negative impact on children’s health care. There are also discrete program changes envisioned in the AHCA posing detrimental effects to children’s access to health care. Eligibility policy changes in the bill risk reducing or delaying access to Medicaid coverage. We are concerned by CBO’s projections that Medicaid enrollment will substantially decrease under the AHCA and the absence of information on the impact on children specifically suggests that additional examination of these issues is needed. We support maintaining Medicaid as an entitlement for children as well as retaining essential elements of the program. Every child in America should have access to high quality health care and Medicaid is critical to this aim. Research shows providing Medicaid coverage for children is a smart investment for the nation, resulting in better health outcomes for children into their adult lives and bringing longterm returns for the country. Children’s hospitals cannot support any bill that does not safeguard funding, coverage and benefits for children. With respect to the AHCA, we call on lawmakers to protect kids and recommend, at a minimum, the following: We must not cut funding for children’s care under a per capita cap. Children are already funded at the lowest per beneficiary levels, and ensuring sufficient funding for children’s health care into the future is absolutely essential. Accomplishing this under the current proposal requires clear identification of spending for all children, including those eligible based on disability, and exempting funds spent on children from a ‘‘claw back’’ on any spending that exceeds per capita cap target expenditures. We believe spending on all children should be protected from recoupment in the following year. This is critical to ensuring states do not have incentives to restrict children’s access to medically necessary care. Ensure all funding for children, including blind and disabled children, is clearly identified. Accurate information on Medicaid spending is vital to evaluating the program’s effectiveness for children and holding states accountable for the delivery of services. We believe all children, including blind and disabled children, should be included in a single children’s 1903A enrollee category and the per capita cap for children should be adjusted accordingly to reflect the higher expenses of children with disabilities. Children are a separate and distinct population from adults. Funding dedicated to children must be identifiable, allowing for an accurate picture of the federal and state investment in kids. This is an important part of ensuring accountability and the availability of sufficient resources to address children’s health care needs. We believe it is important to consider protections preventing diversion of resources specifically intended for children. As we work with state governments to innovate and improve care delivery, the nation’s pediatric providers are in a better position to help states achieve their goals if all kids are in a common eligibility category. Continue requirements that all children receive pediatricspecific benefits providing medically necessary care determined by their physicians. The current Medicaid structure includes important protections for all children and ensures they have access to medicallynecessary care. It is essential that Congress includes language guaranteeing continued access to pediatricspecific services provided under the Early and Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit. Maintain Medicaid coverage levels for children and protect them from potential loss of coverage or delays in eligibility. Changes to eligibility, such as ending hospitals’ ability to make presumptive eligibility determinations, limiting retroactive coverage, or reducing children’s Medicaid mandatory eligibility levels, directly risk children’s coverage and should not be included. Remove the provision in the bill eliminating hospital presumptive eligibility authority. Hospital presumptive eligibility authority allows hospitals to temporarily enroll children, pregnant women, and other individuals in Medicaid until their full enrollment determination can be made. This means earlier access to needed care for Medicaid eligible children. Remove the provision in the bill repealing the ability of states to provide retroactive eligibility up to three months prior to the month of application, as allowed under current law. Ensuring retroactive coverage of benefits under Medicaid is very important for children, especially children with complex medical conditions. Without this provision, it will be challenging for families who incur high levels of expense prior to their Medicaideligible child being enrolled in the program. Remove the provision in the bill reducing mandatory eligibility levels for children age 6–18 from 133 percent of federal poverty level (FPL) to 100 percent of FPL. All other children are required to be covered by Medicaid up to 133 percent of the FPL. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment on this legislation. We look forward to working with you in this Congress to at least maintain the benefits children have today, and to hopefully strengthen health care for children into the future. Very best regards, MARKWIETECHA , President and CEO, Children’s Hospital Association. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind the chairman that his vote for the healthcare bill will take away protections for 654,000 people with preexisting conditions in Oregon. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ). Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for leading and for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, let’s be very clear about where we are with TrumpCare 2.0. This bill still strips 24 million Americans of health care, cuts $880 billion from Medicaid, and increases premiums for the majority of Americans. It still has an age tax if you are 50 to 64 years old, and cuts maternity care and coverage for substance abuse disorders. It still gives $1 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest millionaires, billionaires, and corporations on the backs of working people who will pay more and get less. TrumpCare 2.0 adds insult to injury because my Republican colleagues would like you to believe that they are going to cover preexisting conditions. That is just not true. American people, be clear: this will not cover preexisting conditions, and 133 million Americans with those preexisting conditions will suffer. There are kids like James Kish, an 8yearold in my district who has a brain tumor and literally stands to die if this bill passes. Mr. Speaker, hundreds across this country are calling our offices and weeping. We should all weep that this bill is coming to the floor. We should vote ‘‘no.’’ b1215 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 20 seconds to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I have to say that the information that we are being told, even The New York Times has characterized some of it as being misleading, and it is. When you say Oregonians are going to suddenly be thrown out, that is not true on preexisting conditions because there is no waiver request. You are just making that stuff up. I dispute it. It is misleading. It is wrong. It is fear mongering, and I am sorry it is happening on this floor. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind my chairman that he represents more people on Medicaid expansion than any Republican in the country, and this bill ends Medicaid expansion. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ). Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, TrumpCare is another false promise. Actually, it is musical chairs. Millions of Americans will be left out and priced out, especially the sick, the old, the pregnant, and the mentally ill. Health insurance means life or death. In this concoction, who is eligible? How much will it cost? Who will be left out? There is no budget score from the Congressional Budget Office. Republicans aren’t guaranteeing affordable coverage. Everybody knows even a one word change in your insurance policy can make a gigantic difference in your coverage. Why not give Americans a chance to calculate the bill’s true cost and how it will impact them? As a result of the Affordable Care Act, 1 million Ohioans now have health 
insurance who didn’t have it before. Here we are at the end of our long voting week with a major proposal that will rip away the health insurance benefits or make them unaffordable for millions of Americans. Musical chairs is not the way to run the people’s House nor the lifeanddeath affairs of a great nation. TrumpCare sets up a cruel game of musical chairs. Shame, shame, shame. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ), the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Health. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I am surprised that my friends on the other side are defending the ObamaCare age tax, which is a tax on young people. I am the right demographic for it. This is how it works: people from age 26 to 34 pay more so people from age 50 to 64 pay less. Think about this: I am 53. In 3 years, I will be 56, my daughter will be 26. What I am asking her to do and what we are asking her to do if we don’t repeal this is, as you are wanting to buy a house, get married—she got married—buy a house, start a family, get her family moving forward, we are going to say: But we want you to pay more for your health care so I can pay less. That is what they are doing. They are having parents have their children pay more so they can pay less. With all of us, I think we want our children, as they start their families, start their life, to have more breaks, not put another burden on them. I defend the fact that we are giving tax relief to young people, for people from age 26 to 34, who can least afford the premiums that we are putting on them. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time that remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 2
3⁄4minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this is the cruelest and most immoral thing I have seen the Republican Party do to the American people. Tens of thousands of Americans will die if this bill passes. That is a fact. Republicans have been deceiving the American people for the last 8 years. They don’t care about working people, and this bill proves it. They care about insurance companies and drug companies that fund their campaigns. They care about the millionaires and billionaires who get huge tax cuts in this bill. Don’t try to tell me that they care about factory and construction workers who will be hurt by this bill. Don’t try to tell me that they care about single moms who won’t be able to put food on the table after you pass this bill. Don’t try to tell me that they care about cancer survivors who are going to pay $140,000 more for health insurance. I don’t know how anyone can look their constituents in the eye if they vote for this bill. Shame on you if you do. If you vote for this bill, there will come a day when you will have to answer for your vote, when you will have to look a friend, a family member in the eye, someone who is sick or dying, and say: I did this to you. Don’t do it. Vote ‘‘no.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded once again to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. RICE). Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the American people today who are being dragged down by this failing disaster called ObamaCare. Since I first got to Congress, I have consistently heard from people across the Seventh District of South Carolina who have been negatively affected by ObamaCare. We were told: If you like your plan, you could keep it. We were told: Your premiums would go down by $2,500 per family. We were told it would provide more choice. But what we have seen is exactly the opposite. 232,000 South Carolinians’ plans were canceled, premiums have increased by double digits every year and are up by 28 percent this year. There is only one insurer left in South Carolina, and they are threatening to pull out. The law is failing miserably and getting worse. This bill repeals harmful ObamaCare taxes across the board that drove up healthcare costs and transitions health care to a more competitive, patient centered insurance market. There are still fixes that need to be made to further improve health care, but this is a dramatic move forward from where we are today and the first step in moving America’s health care from an unsustainable system to a sustainable one. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from South Carolina that his vote for the healthcare bill will take away protections for 822,000 people with preexisting conditions in South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn this abhorrent legislation that will rip away protections from millions of Americans. I am a breast cancer survivor. President Trump and our Republican colleagues promised Americans like me that we would not be discriminated against based on our preexisting conditions. I am not sure if any Republicans actually know what it is like to live every single day of your life waiting for the other shoe to drop, but with this bill, you yank that peace of mind that we have with the Affordable Care Act out from under us. This bill would allow States to segregate sick people into separate, inferior coverage and leave individuals exposed to catastrophic health costs, benefit exclusions, and waiting lists. High risk pools spin sick people into a death spiral. Premiums go ever higher and coverage is spotty. I can only hope that my colleagues come to their senses before inevitably handing so many Americans a death sentence. Make no mistake, people will die as a result of this bill. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 11⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 
3⁄4minute remaining. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. I do want to take a minute today to thank the superior team we have in the House Legislative Counsel. They have put in many man hours and woman hours to draft this bill that is being considered here in the House today. Specifically I want to thank Ed Grossman, Jessica Shapiro, Michelle Vanek, and Jesse Cross for their devotion to the people of the United States in helping us draft this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my remaining time to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ). Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, how tragic it is that before House Republicans skip town, they will steal from Medicare, pass an age tax on older Americans, say that children with autism are a preexisting condition, and tell folks: If you have diabetes, you are paying $5,600 more. This morning, I heard from many hospitals, doctors, and nurses across Illinois. They know what families need to be taken care of and to be healthy. They do not believe that stripping 24 million Americans of their health insurance is in the best interests of our national health. To my eight Illinois colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, if you vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, the eight of you own its aftermath in our State; you own the 47,000 jobs that you will kill; you own the health of the millionplus Illinoisans who will be stripped of their health insurance. Let’s kill this horrific bill and work together to make health insurance affordable and accessible for all. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair again reminds Members to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we are here today to correct a technical problem that exists with trying to draft to Senate rules with the House legislation. Recognizing the problem, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) has introduced a straightforward and practical bill to fix the problem. It is a simple 2 page bill that, when the American 
Health Care Act becomes law, Members of Congress and congressional staff will be treated the same way as every other citizen. That is only right, and it is only proper. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 308, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A further message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed with an amendment in which the concurrence of the House is requested, a bill of the House of the following title: 
H.R. 534. An act to require the Secretary of State to take such actions as may be necessary for the United States to rejoin the Bureau of International Expositions, and for other purposes. f 
3⁄4minutes of the debate remained on the bill. The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACK ) has 191⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) has 221⁄4minutes remaining. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the American Health Care Act, a bill that repeals the worst parts of ObamaCare and begins to repair the damage it has caused. This bill brings choice and competition back into the healthcare marketplace and puts healthcare decisions back into the hands of patients and doctors where it belongs. It has been a winding road to get to this point, but we are here today to fulfill the promise that we made to the American people. I will point out right now to those who say we should have just moved on from healthcare reform, American families and individuals are suffering from rising costs and barriers to getting the care that they need right now. Under ObamaCare, the situation is getting worse every day. In Iowa, just yesterday, one of the last remaining insurers announced that it will pull out of the ObamaCare exchanges, leaving nearly all of the State’s residents with no—and, yes, I will say again, nearly all of the residents with no available health insurance plan for the purchase under ObamaCare. b1230 And in a few of the Iowa counties which are the remaining insurers, even that company is saying it might stop offering plans, leaving the entire State without an insurance plan available under ObamaCare. That is happening this very week. We can’t wait a moment longer than necessary to provide relief for the American people by repealing and replacing ObamaCare. I applaud the Members of this body who stuck with us during this process and worked hard to make the bill better. I, myself, had concerns about the bill as it was introduced. I worked hard to make sure that the bill truly reflected my ideals and the views and desires of my constituents. And when the bill came before the Budget Committee, which I chair, I urged my members to stay in the fight and work to improve the bill rather than stop it in its tracks. And do you know what? Our members did just that, making some recommendations that were eventually included in the various amendments. That message was heard loud and clear by all of the members of our Conference who have worked tirelessly to finalize a bill that truly reflects our vision for healthcare reform. Throughout this process, our commitment to undoing the damage done by ObamaCare has remained steadfast. Day after day, my constituents call my office begging us to do something to save them from ObamaCare, and it is because ObamaCare is collapsing. In my State of Tennessee, families are suffering. Premiums have increased by 60 percent, while deductibles are so high that, even if someone has an insurance card, it doesn’t mean they have guaranteed care. There are parts of my State in Tennessee that don’t have a single insurance provider in the marketplace, and twothirds of the counties have only one provider. That is not competition. That is called a monopoly. While no legislation is perfect, this bill makes some important changes to help American families get quality, affordable health insurance: It zeros out the mandates, it repeals the taxes, and it repeals the subsidies; it allows people to choose health insurance plans to meet the unique needs of their families instead of purchasing a onesizefitsall plan mandated by a Washington bureaucrat; and it modernizes Medicaid, a onceinalifetime entitlement reform. Ending Medicaid’s openended funding structure will play an important role in addressing our future budget deficits and our growing national debt. This is a particularly proud moment for me. I was working as a nurse in Nashville in the 1990s when the Clinton administration pushed a singlepayer pilot program in Tennessee called TennCare. I saw firsthand the negative impact governmentrun health care has on patient care. I saw costs rise and the quality of care fall. It inspired me to get involved in public service. When in 2009 and 2010 I saw those same principles being debated and, eventually, implemented on the national level, I thought my experience in Tennessee could be valuable in the national debate; so, in 2011, I sponsored the first piece of legislation that repealed a part of ObamaCare. Today, we take the largest step yet in rescuing the American people from this damaging, governmentrun healthcare system. I, and many other Members of this body, have worked hard to make sure that this bill truly reflects our visions for healthcare reform. I, for one, cannot sit idly by and let this opportunity go to waste. Governing is hard, but our constituents did not elect us to do what is easy. They elected us to do what is right. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on the American Health Care Act to rescue the American people from ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I remind my colleague that her vote for this bill could increase premiums for people with breast cancer in Tennessee by over $38,000. Mr. Speaker, let’s begin with a few facts: Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, costs have gone up at the lowest rate in 50 years; Those with preexisting conditions get insurance at the standard rate; Instead of millions of people losing their insurance every year, 20 million more people have insurance; Personal bankruptcies are down 50 percent. 
Still, all we hear are complaints, press releases, and promises about something better. But CBO has debunked this proposal by pointing out that 24 million fewer people will have insurance, that costs will go up, and insurance will cover less. So, whatever you think about the Affordable Care Act, this bill makes things worse—except for millionaires, who get a tax cut. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), a physician and the chair of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, I stood right in this well to debate the ACA, which the premise was to increase access and decrease costs. We all agree with that. But that is not exactly what happened. In my district, in the State of Tennessee, over onethird of the counties have no place they can buy insurance; and multiple counties in my State, including the third largest, have no access. Premiums have soared over 60 percent. Eighteen of the 23 coops went bankrupt, including one in my State, which required people to search for other coverage. No matter what verbiage you hear, nothing in this bill changes how veterans are treated under the law—nothing. The criticisms are flatout wrong. I am a veteran, doctor, and chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and it ain’t gonna happen. In my State, and where I practiced medicine for over 30 years, listen to this: 60 to 70 percent of the uncollectible debt now are people with insurance. So why do I support this bill? One, it protects preexisting conditions; Two, it puts patients ahead of special interests and restores a physicianpatient relationship; Three, it reforms Medicaid so that firstclass people don’t get secondclass care; and Four, it repeals individual mandates so that 160,000 Tennesseans don’t get fined for a product they cannot afford. Mr. Speaker, this bill isn’t perfect, but it is a huge improvement over ObamaCare, and it is worthy of every Member’s support. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for this bill could take healthcare protections away from over a million people in Tennessee with preexisting conditions. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ), the vice ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, today the House is voting on a harmful bill that puts the most vulnerable members of our community at risk. We know that millions will lose coverage. And the Affordable Care Act protects people with preexisting conditions—this bill does not. Highrisk pools don’t work. My constituents are scared, and so are people across this country. Arden from Gearhart, Oregon, wrote to me, distraught, because she and her daughter, Selah, could lose coverage. Arden took the loving step of adopting a child with special needs, and now the support program they rely on is at risk of being terminated by this bill. This is a critical vote. I implore my colleagues to think about all of the people like Arden and Selah in their communities. Think about the millions across this country who risk losing coverage. I implore my colleagues to do no harm. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this harmful bill. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who has worked tirelessly on this bill. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ), my colleague, for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. I thank the chairman for yielding. I have heard from my Governor, State officials, and providers about the challenges on the ground in Florida and what they are facing. The demographic issues in Florida raise significant challenges for the State of Florida, and it is the Medicaid program. Particularly, the State Medicaid program and providers face challenges relating to the costs of caring for the most disadvantaged and the elderly in Florida’s nursing home program, as well as the rising costs associated with Florida’s aging population. As the process moves forward, Florida’s unique challenges must be recognized and accounted for as we reallocate dollars for this important safety net program. Mr. WALDEN. I thank the gentleman from Florida for not only raising this issue, but being a real partner in this legislation. I met with your Governor as well, who has been very helpful in the discussions. We believe that accounting for aging demographics of the Medicaid program and broader population is an important factor we must consider to ensure that any Medicaid reform is successfully implemented. I am committed to working with the gentleman from Florida, our colleagues in the Senate, and the Trump administration to ensure Florida’s unique challenges related to an aging Medicaid demographic are recognized and accounted for appropriately. Mr. Speaker, in the remaining part of my time, I would just like to thank my colleagues for their work on this measure. Making sure that people have access to affordable health care is essential. It is something I would say that we all care about. We all care about family members who have suffered from cancer or other debilitating diseases or afflictions. We are trying to find a place here that works for all Americans, where we have insurance markets that are actually available where you can get an insurance product that works for you that is affordable for you. We know that today, in America, the insurance market and the individual market—that is a very small segment, 7 percent of insurance in America; that is what we are talking about here today—that that market is collapsing before our eyes. In fact, in Iowa, I think they just announced 94 in 99 counties, people there won’t even have an insurance product they can try to purchase on the exchange. We have met with Governors and we have met with insurers. We have said: What do we need to do to intercede to get this market back to where it works? The proposals contained in our legislation are designed to do exactly that: to get back to where consumers have choices when they are required to buy insurance to take care of their families. Those choices need to be affordable. They are not now, today. In my own State of Oregon, premiums have gone up 50 percent in the last 2 years. Meanwhile, the number of options that you have to choose from has gone down—and continues to go down. Now, we haven’t gone as far as some States where you have either no option in most areas of the State or just one, but how far off is it when insurers are failing, people losing their opportunity to get affordable health insurance? We take care of the disabled. We take care of the elderly. In fact, we plusup to medical CPI plus 1 to make sure that we take care of the elderly and the disabled in our Medicaid program. By the way, that is probably more than most States are spending today. So we have thought this through carefully. We care about people and their medical condition and their families because we are all in this together as Americans. I think the bill we have before us today works. It works to take care of those most in need. It works to make sure that the people can get access to insurance. I will tell you what. It is a first step in a manystep process to also look at families who are dealing with opioid addition and what we can do there. There are efforts at NIH, which we just supported yesterday, to fund medical research so that we can get cures for those who have diseases and other afflictions. We are fully committed to improving health care not only for Americans, but around the globe, through innovation and scientific discovery. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for this healthcare bill will take away protections for over 600,000 people in Oregon with preexisting conditions. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ). 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, which states that this legislation will dramatically cut Medicaid services that are vital to people with disabilities and seniors. 
No limiting access to coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions. Nothing in this act shall be construed as permitting health insurance insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairwoman BLACK  for her leadership on this effort, as well as Chairman WALDEN of the Energy and Commerce Committee for incredible work. As chairman on behalf of the Ways and Means Committee who work alongside you, I am honored to speak in support of the American Health Care Act because it guarantees coverage for those with preexisting illnesses. It guarantees coverage for those with preexisting illnesses. In fact, this bill takes decisive action to repeal all of the bad parts, all of the damage done by ObamaCare, and begin a thoughtful stepbystep process to deliver a patientcentered healthcare system, not a Washingtoncentered healthcare system, to the American people. While ObamaCare has helped some, far more have been hurt by this law. And more ObamaCare failures are piling up every day. Just yesterday, Aetna announced it will exit Virginia’s individual health market next year. And it is not just the State’s ObamaCare exchanges they are leaving behind. Aetna will not offer any plans next year in the individual market in Virginia. The same thing is happening in Iowa. And my friends on the Democratic aisle have done nothing to stop this— 
nothing. But today, because of this bill, thousands of people will have hope for a new plan to provide the healthcare coverage they need. Millions of Americans throughout the country are facing just terrible options. People of Texas have been hit particularly hard. Between last year and this year, nine healthcare insurers have exited ObamaCare exchanges in the Lone Star State. No other State saw more insurers leave. For my family, the failures of this law have come to mean some incredibly tough choices. They have had to accept, under ObamaCare, you can’t access affordable coverage that is tailored to what they need. They have had to learn how to get by as their monthly health premiums just skyrocket each and every year—bigger than their mortgage payments. They have had to choose between paying out of pocket for the care they need or not getting care at all. Under ObamaCare, the ability to receive treatment from a doctor you know and who knows you has become a luxury that too many can’t afford. Today, with the American Health Care Act, the Republicans propose we have an opportunity to provide immediate relief from this failing law. More than that, we can provide Americans with real choices in health care, not the painful decision they are forced to live with under ObamaCare. Under the Ways and Means Committee area, this starts by repealing the law’s crushing taxes and mandates, and that is where Ways and Means takes action. Under ObamaCare, the individual and employer mandate penalties allow Washington to strongarm you, to strongarm Americans into ObamaCare plans you do not want and cannot afford. Not anymore. Under the Republican plan, we repeal the individual and employer mandate tax penalties so Americans have the freedom to make the healthcare choices that are right for them. Under ObamaCare, over $1 trillion of taxes were imposed on the American people. Under the Republican plan, those taxes are gone that burden American small businesses and families. Under our plan, we provide increased health savings accounts so Americans can save easier for the outofpocket costs that hit them under any health care; and then we create a personal individual tax credit so Americans can buy plans that are right for them, not what is right for government. Healthcare premiums, they can choose a plan that can go with them from job to job, State to State, home to start a business, or a family, and even into those preretirement years. Today is about taking on a collapsing ObamaCare and replacing for the American people health care that they want, that they can use, and that they can afford; driven not by what Washington wants, but driven by what American families need in their health care. Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of this bill. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for this bill could take away protections of over 4.5 million people with preexisting conditions in Texas who might have access to coverage, but if they have diabetes, their rates could go up $5,000. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ). Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. After his latest failed attempt to roll back the ACA, Speaker RYANdeclared to the American people ‘‘ObamaCare is the law of the land.’’ Less than 50 days later, PAUL RYAN shamefully is going against his word trying to ram TrumpCare down our throats. It is an embarrassment that we are wasting taxpayer dollars to again consider TrumpCare—or as I called it ‘‘Trump don’t care’’—a reckless plan that does nothing to make health care better. TrumpCare gives the rich and big corporations a $600 billion tax break. It forces families to pay higher premiums and deductions, placing health care out of their reach. TrumpCare forces seniors to pay higher costs and changes Medicare as we know it. It strips essential health benefits and protections for people with preexisting conditions. What a pitiful display of partisan politics. TrumpCare is so bad, Republicans have exempted themselves from it. They don’t want TrumpCare. The medical industry doesn’t want TrumpCare. Democrats don’t want TrumpCare. Why don’t House Republicans listen? The people don’t want it, and I won’t support it. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from Common Sense Kids Action that explains that: ‘‘This jeopardizes the health and wellbeing of America’s kids and will alarm any parent who understands the importance of health insurance for their children and family.’’ 
COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION , April 25, 2017. Re H.R. 1628—OPPOSE. Hon. DIANE BLACK , Chairwoman, House Budget Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE BLACK : On behalf of the millions of American kids and families who rely on comprehensive, dependable health insurance to stay healthy and to get medical treatment when they need it, we are writing to respectfully express our strong opposition to your bill, H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). We have added this bill to our Common Sense Legislative Ratings Tool as an ‘‘Against Kids’’ bill and will communicate our position to our parent and teacher members. Common Sense is the nation’s leading independent nonprofit organization dedicated to helping kids thrive in a rapidly changing world. We empower parents, teachers, and policymakers by providing unbiased information, trusted advice, and innovative tools to help them harness the power of media and technology as a positive force in all kids’ lives. The policy arm, Common Sense Kids Action, is building a movement of parents, teachers, business leaders, and others dedicated to making kids our nation’s top priority by supporting policies at the state and federal level that contribute to the building blocks of opportunity for kids. Access to affordable and quality medical care for kids is certainly one of those key building blocks. Thanks to current law, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 95% of young children in the U.S. today have health insurance. That’s a remarkable achievement. With health insurance, parents are more likely to seek medical care for themselves and for their children, helping to prevent illnesses from developing and shortening their duration when they occur. However, the AHCA will result in 24 million fewer Americans having coverage, including millions of children. This jeopardizes the health and wellbeing of America’s kids and will alarm any parent who understands the importance of health insurance for their children and family. The Affordable Care Act certainly needs to be fixed, but if Congress has the goal of making sure that all families and businesses have access to affordable and comprehensive health insurance, it could improve the law for everyone without forcing millions of kids and their parents to lose access to critical medical care. As Congress continues to grapple with this issue, health insurance programs, we think these facts about children’s health insurance from the Congressional Budget Office and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families are important to keep in mind: Ninetyfive percent of children age 0–5 are insured today. Fortyfive million of those children access health care through two programs: about 37 million through Medicaid (a federalstate program) and 8 million through CHIP, the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Children are the singlelargest group of persons covered under Medicaid. Under the Affordable Care Act, as you know, many states expanded Medicaid with help from the federal government, increasing coverage for kids and families, including coverage for mental health care. Changes being considered, including under the AHCA, would cut funding to Medicaid by as much as $880 billion over the next 10 years. The AHCA, when compared with current law, would result in 24 million fewer Americans with health insurance by the year 2026. Even with changes recently suggested to your bill, America’s kids will be best served by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid and CHIP, not by repealing the Affordable Care Act and block granting or establishing a per capita cap on Medicaid. We urge you to keep our children’s future foremost in your thinking, withdraw your bill, and work on a bipartisan basis to support measures that protect and strengthen children’s health care. Thank you for your consideration of our views and we would be happy to talk with you at any time about this and other issues that matter to America’s children and families. Sincerely, DANNY WEISS, Vice President, Federal Policy, Common Sense Media/Kids Action. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ). (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from SEIU, which states: 
This legislation will leave millions without health insurance, and decimate the Medicare program. SEIU, May 2, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 2 million members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), America’s largest healthcare union, I write to voice strong opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA). New provisions in the legislation manage to make a bad bill worse. Not only does the bill cause millions to lose insurance coverage, face higher costs, and end Medicaid as we know it, but now it also strips essential protections for those with preexisting conditions. The AHCA will leave millions of men, women, and children without access to high quality, affordable health care. The AHCA legislation unequivocally jeopardizes working families’ safety, health, and financial security. The AHCA will leave millions of Americans without health insurance and therefore without access to healthcare. The last available estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated about 14 million fewer people will have health insurance in 2018, and by 2026, 24 million fewer people will have coverage compared to the current baseline under the ACA. Unfortunately, we do not have more up to date information. Despite the importance that healthcare plays in the lives of working families, Congressional leaders have indicated that they intend to hold a vote on the legislation without knowing its impact. The AHCA also decimates the Medicaid program, rationing and endangering healthcare for children, seniors, people with disabilities, and their families as well as for those who have gained coverage as a result of the Medicaid expansion. According to CBO, the legislation will cut federal funding for Medicaid by $880 billion over ten years. Americans know that Medicaid is working and realize the key role that the program plays in helping families afford care—including nursing home care and home and communitybased services for elderly and disabled individuals. Nearly 1 in 5 Americans are covered under Medicaid and rely on it to get health services Under the AHCA, those Americans would lose access to vital care that may mean the difference between life and death. Additionally, the AHCA would cap the amount of money states receive in Medicaid funding from the federal government each year, regardless of the cost of providing healthcare to those who qualify. Medicaid is already a lean program especially when measured on a per capita basis, and cuts from capping federal funding will quickly force states to cut services, limit enrollment, and decrease payments to hospitals and other providers. Also, Medicaid is the largest payer for long term care in the country. The program pays for more than 60 percent of all nursing home residents and for more than 3.2 million Americans with home and communitybased care, which allows many older Americans and people with disabilities to remain in their homes rather than move to a more expensive institutional setting. States—which must balance budgets and already face fiscal pressures—will not be able to make up the lost federal dollars and will be forced to deny care. The inevitable result will be that the AHCA will make it much harder and more costly for older Americans, people with disabilities, and their families to get services they need. In addition, the legislation will effectively end the Medicaid expansion, which provides health coverage to millions of people earning low to moderate incomes. While the bill purports to allow states to maintain the expansion, states will only receive an enhanced match, or additional funding, for people who enroll before 2020 and maintain continuous coverage. It is widely understood that there is significant churn on and off the program in this coverage category, and thus over time the reimbursement rates for states will drop. The resulting large cost shift to states may lead them to eliminate coverage for this group altogether. In fact, seven states have triggers that would end the Medicaid expansion in their state if federal reimbursement decreases. Lastly, Medicaid provider rates are already extremely low in most states. Cuts to Medicaid, capped funding, and elimination of the Medicaid expansion would lead to further reductions in rates for providers, leading to job and other spending cuts in the health care industry that will have ripple effects on the broader economy. We have serious concerns that hospitals, especially those that serve communities that may not have access to many providers, could be forced to close or cut back services, further reducing access to care in underserved areas. Those who purchase coverage in the individual market do not fare much better under the proposed bill. The AHCA provides tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 to individuals to purchase private insurance—substantially lower than the ACA’s current levels for the majority of those who receive them. Unlike the ACA, it is unclear that people with access to employer insurance that is unaffordable or inadequate will be eligible for credits, which would mean that they will be left without access to coverage and care. The bill also creates an age tax on older Americans by letting insurance companies charge people over 60 as much as five times what they charge others for the same coverage. CBO found that under the initial bill introduced, premiums for those between age 50 and 65 would skyrocket. Moreover, it is unclear what coverage will be available on the individual market or if the current healthcare marketplaces will even still exist under this scheme. Between premiums and out of pocket costs like deductibles, especially for those most in need of care due to preexisting conditions, illness, or age, the result could be higher costs for less coverage. A bad bill has managed to have been made even worse by the ‘‘MacArthurMeadows Amendment.’’ The amendment guts essential protections for those with preexisting conditions. It would allow states to charge those with preexisting conditions higher premiums by allowing states to very easily waive community rating requirements, which currently prohibits this practice. Furthermore it would grant states, through a waiver that is approved by default, the ability to opt out of essential health benefit requirements, a core set of medical services, like hospitalizations, mental health, maternity care and prescription drug coverage, which all insurers are required to cover under the ACA. If states waive requirements, insurers could leave those who are sick or with preexisting conditions out to fend for themselves and face exorbitant costs to get lifesaving care they need. Experts agree that the funding included in the ‘‘Upton Long Amendment’’ is completely inadequate to protect those with preexisting conditions. The Administration and Congressional Leaders promised to the American people that those with preexisting conditions would remain protected—this bill even with added amendments defaults on that promise. Another failure of the AHCA is that it hurts women by freezing funding to providers like Planned Parenthood, risking the health and wellbeing of the 2.5 million people who rely on the organization for basic care. One in five women in the United States has visited Planned Parenthood clinics and for many lowincome women of color, including many of our members, Planned Parenthood is their essential health provider. For these individuals, healthcare is not an ideological struggle or about the politics of one policy versus another; it is a necessity that could mean the difference between sickness and health. The real winners of the AHCA appear to be special interests and the wealthy. The legislation repeals most if not all of the ACA tax provisions for special interests like the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, offsetting these costs with the massive cuts to Medicaid described above. The bill also maintains the socalled ‘‘Cadillac tax,’’ which places a tax on workers who have robust health coverage, merely delaying implementation to 2026. Implementation of the tax will punish people who have decent insurance, and will encourage employers to further shift health costs to workers. Furthermore, the incentives for health savings accounts, which encourage wealthier people to shelter pretax income, are of little use to working households earning lowto moderate incomes. The AHCA is not care, it is chaos. The legislation creates an environment of uncertainty and unaffordability for Americans and is a bad deal for working families. The bill radically restructures Medicaid as we know it and cuts funding for the program significantly, endangers women’s health, and further enriches corporations, special interests, and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working families’ access to healthcare and financial stability. The American people will hold you accountable for how you proceed in this moment. We therefore respectfully ask you vote no on the American Health Care Act and the proposed amendments to the legislation when it comes to a vote in the House of Representatives. We will add this vote to our legislative scorecard. If you need any additional information please contact Ilene Stein, Assistant Legislative Director. Sincerely, MARYKAYHENRY , International President. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the House majority has once again made clear that, under Republican rule, the system is rigged. The fix is in. The deck is stacked against hardworking Americans, and exhibit A is your reckless Republican healthcare plan. Under TrumpCare, 24 million Americans will lose access to health insurance. Under TrumpCare, a draconian age tax will be imposed on people between 50 and 64. Under TrumpCare, costs will go up, premiums will go up, copays will go up, deductibles will go up. Under TrumpCare, tens of millions of Americans who are living with preexisting conditions will be screwed. House Republicans are out to destroy the American healthcare system as we know it, but you will be held accountable for the cruel and unusual punishment that you have decided to inflict on the American people. Vote ‘‘no’’ against this draconian piece of legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to direct their remarks to this Chair. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD an article in Consumer Reports dated May 2, 2017, entitled: ‘‘How the Affordable Care Act Drove Down Personal Bankruptcy.’’ 
NUMBER OF FILINGS BY HALF  (By Allen St. John) As legislators and the executive branch renew their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act this week, they might want to keep in mind a littleknown financial consequence of the ACA: Since its adoption, far fewer Americans have taken the extreme step of filing for personal bankruptcy. Filings have dropped about 50 percent, from 1,536,799 in 2010 to 770,846 in 2016 (see chart, below). Those years also represent the time frame when the ACA took effect. Although courts never ask people to declare why they’re filing, many bankruptcy and legal experts agree that medical bills had been a leading cause of personal bankruptcy before public healthcare coverage expanded under the ACA. Unlike other causes of debt, medical bills are often unexpected, involuntary, and large. ‘‘If you’re uninsured or underinsured, you can run up a huge debt in a short period of time,’’ says Lois Lupica, a bankruptcy expert and Maine Law Foundation Professor of Law at the University of Maine School of Law. So did the rise of the ACA—which helped some 20 million more Americans get health insurance—cause the decline in bankruptcies? The many experts we interviewed also pointed to two other contributing factors: an improving economy and changes to bankruptcy laws in 2005 that made it more difficult and costly to file. However, they almost all agreed that expanded health coverage played a major role in the marked, recent decline. Some of the most important financial protections of the ACA apply to all consumers, whether they get their coverage through ACA exchanges or the private insurance marketplace. These provisions include mandated coverage for preexisting conditions and, on most covered benefits, an end to annual and lifetime coverage caps. Aspects of the law, including provisions for young people to be covered by a family policy until age 26, went into effect in 2010 and 2011, before the full rollout of the ACA in 2014. ‘‘It’s absolutely remarkable,’’ says Jim Molleur, a Mainebased bankruptcy attorney with 20 years of experience. ‘‘We’re not getting people with big medical bills, chronically sick people who would hit those lifetime caps or be denied because of preexisting conditions. They seemed to disappear almost overnight once ACA kicked in.’’ The first attempt to repeal and replace the ACA, in March, failed to gain enough Congressional support and never came to a vote. Then in April, details of a new replacement plan were released. Although President Donald Trump has said that this new version, like the first bill that was pulled from consideration, will cover preexisting conditions, the revised law gives states broad latitude to allow insurance companies to increase rates for consumers with an existing illness. 
A RARE AND COSTLY DIAGNOSIS  Since the start of the year, more than 2,000 consumers have answered an online questionnaire from Consumer Reports’ advocacy and mobilization team, sharing their experiences with the ACA. Katie Weber of Seattle was one of them. In 2011, she had just landed her first job out of college, as a teacher with AmeriCorps, she explains in a phone interview. That’s when the unusual numbness in her hand began, which she—and her doctor—at first mistook for a pinched nerve. Then came debilitating headaches and nausea and, ultimately, a diagnosis of medulloblastoma, a fastgrowing cancerous brain tumor. The treatment for her tumor was straightforward: surgery, radiation, then chemotherapy. Figuring out how to pay for it was much less clear. She worried that the insurance she had through AmeriCorps wouldn’t cover enough of her bills. ‘‘My dad said to me, ‘Your health is the most important thing. If you have to declare bankruptcy at age 23, it’s no big deal,’’’ Weber says. Because of the ACA, she says, it never came to that. After her year with AmeriCorps, the new healthcare law enabled her to get coverage under her parents’ insurance plan. The ACA provisions required that the family’s insurance company cover her even though she had already been diagnosed with cancer. That would not have been the case before the ACA, which mandates the coverage of preexisting conditions for all consumers. Later, when she aged out of her parents’ insurance, Weber was able to enroll in Apple Health, Washington state’s version of Medicaid, a program that was expanded once the ACA was passed. That coverage, she says, has been crucial to her financial and medical wellbeing, especially once the cancer returned last fall. Weber says she now spends more time discussing treatment options and less time worrying how she’ll pay for MRIs and drugs. These are covered in full under her Apple Health policy. ‘‘Cancer is really expensive,’’ she says. ‘‘My insurance saved my life.’’ NUMBERS PLUMMET  If you want further testimony about how much personal bankruptcies have dropped over the past decade, talk to Susan Grossberg, a Springfield, Mass., attorney. For more than 20 years she has helped consumers push the financial reset button when debt triggered by divorce, unemployment, or a costly illness or medical episode became too much to handle. ‘‘Medical debt can get really big really quickly,’’ Grossberg says. ‘‘When you’re in the emergency room they’re not checking your credit score while they’re caring for you.’’ With the advent of the ACA—and before that, expanded state healthcare in Massachusetts—she says fewer clients with large medical debts walked through her door. Grossberg adds that her bankruptcy business has slowed so much that she has been forced to take on other kinds of legal work— landlordtenant and housing discrimination cases—to cover her own bills. The American Bankruptcy Institute suggested that veteran Chicago bankruptcy attorney and trustee David Leibowitz could also help parse the reasons for the decadelong decline. First, he says, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 made it more difficult for consumers to file for bankruptcy. The law required credit counseling and income verification and forced many consumers to seek protection under Chapter 13, which restructures, but does not eliminate, most debt. The piles of paperwork also meant most filers needed a lawyer, which made bankruptcy more costly and therefore not an option for many poor consumers. Then there was the economy. After a slow and steady recovery following the housing crisis of 2008, Leibowitz explains that American consumers generally had fewer problems with their mortgages, better employment prospects, and greater access to credit, which made them less likely to file. The final factor, according to Leibowitz, has been the ACA, which afforded health coverage to many more consumers and expanded protections for all. Of course, not everyone sees such a direct connection between the decline in bankruptcies and the emergence of the ACA. Thomas P. Miller, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and coauthor of ‘‘Why ObamaCare is Wrong for America’’ (HarperCollins, 2011), cautioned against ‘‘reaching broad conclusions’’ because the subject is so complex. ‘‘Certainly there are fewer people declaring bankruptcy, and certainly fewer are declaring bankruptcy because of healthcare spending,’’ he says. But his earlier research suggested that some studies exaggerated the degree to which high healthcare bills cause bankruptcies. ‘‘They tended to reflect other problems with credit card balances well beyond healthcare,’’ he says. ‘‘It stems from multiple causes.’’ FIGURING OUT WHY  Over the past decade, determining the causeandeffect relationship between medical debt and bankruptcy has become a political football, particularly during the years the Obama administration was trying to pass the ACA through Congress. The truth is that it’s not that easy to determine how many bankruptcies are caused by medical debt. Examining the paperwork doesn’t always offer insight because debtors often juggle their indebtedness, for example, using a credit card to pay an outstanding medical bill while leaving other debts unpaid. But a 2014 study from Daniel Austin, a bankruptcy attorney and, at the time, a professor at the Northeastern University School of Law, offers some of the most indepth research to date. Austin and his team selected a nationwide group of 100 bankruptcy filers meant to represent a crosssection of the U.S. population, studied their paperwork, then followed up with a survey asking filers, basically, ‘‘Why?’’ His team’s research found that medical debt is the single largest factor in personal bankruptcy. First, Austin analyzed the paperwork of individual case files, which suggested that medical bills were a factor in 18 percent of filings. But when he directly asked the same filers, in a survey, the number was even higher, with 25 percent citing medical bills as a factor in their decision to file bankruptcy. In addition to the nationwide group, Austin isolated a group of 100 bankruptcy filers from Massachusetts. Why Massachusetts? Because its citizens, starting in 2006, had been covered by a comprehensive state healthcare program similar to the ACA known as Romneycare, after the state’s former governor, Mitt Romney. The differences between the two groups were striking. Even though the Massachusetts filers owed substantially more in unsecured debt (that is, debt not backed by a home, a car, or another asset) than their counterparts in other states, they reported less than half as much medical debt, which is also unsecured. ‘‘The average medical debt in Massachusetts in 2013 was relatively low at just $3,041 (6 percent of total unsecured debt) compared to $8,594 (20 percent of total unsecured debt) nationwide,’’ Austin writes in his 2014 study, 
portions of which were published in the Maine Law Review. ‘‘Only about 9 percent of Massachusetts debtors felt their bankruptcy filing was a result of medical bills,’’ Austin explains. ‘‘This compares to 25 percent for debtors from [other] jurisdictions.’’ Austin’s research found that comprehensive medical coverage in Massachusetts had all but eliminated medical bills as a cause for bankruptcy. ‘‘Not only in absolute numbers—they had much smaller medical debt—but psychologically, medical debt did not loom nearly as large for people in Massachusetts as it did for other people in other states.’’ And in 2010, four years after Romneycare began, the state had a bankruptcy rate that was about 30 percent lower than that of other states. 
IN SEARCH OF CERTAINTY , CONSISTENCY  At its most basic level, health insurance allows consumers to pay for the medical care they need. Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determines how well the system is working by surveying Americans and asking a simple but powerful question: Did you have problems paying medical bills in the last 12 months? The percentage of those reporting problems has dropped from 21.3 percent of households when they first asked the question in 2011 to 16.2 percent in 2016. That’s almost 13 million fewer Americans no longer facing collection notices from a doctor or hospital. ‘‘It’s been happening across the board, by race, by age, by insurance status, by gender,’’ says Robin Cohen, the study’s lead author. But insurance is also about peace of mind. And judging from the consumers who have shared their stories with Consumer Reports, that certainty is in short supply as the fate of the ACA is decided. People are wondering what comes next: Repeal? Replace? Improve? Retain and neglect? No one really knows the answer. Americans are concerned about how the future of healthcare will affect them and their families. In CR’s Consumer Voices survey in January 2017, 55 percent of consumers said they lacked confidence that they or their loved ones would be able to afford insurance to secure that care. Don Shope of Ocean View, Del., said the availability of ACA coverage gave him the confidence to leave a corporate job and start his own consulting business. But now, with the ACA’s future in limbo, he and his wife are watching the action in Washington and worrying that they might have to return to jobs with benefits. ‘‘I’m not a liberal or a conservative, a Democrat or a Republican,’’ Shope said in a phone interview. ‘‘Our biggest concern is that with repeal and replace we’re going to be left high and dry.’’ He also believes in expanded health coverage for all. ‘‘If any American is sick, we should be willing to take care of them,’’ Shope says. ‘‘It’s the right thing to do. Economics and profit shouldn’t be part of the healthcare equation.’’ 
HANGING ON EVERY DIP AND TURN  And then there’s Kristin Couch, who has channeled the uncertainty into her own brand of activism. ‘‘I was kind of anxious,’’ Couch says about the day in March when Congress was set to vote on a less robust bill that would replace the ACA. The 31yearold public relations executive, of Gainesville, Ga., has started to follow healthcare politics in the intense, almost obsessive way some people follow sports. The morning after Election Day, she called the offices of her local congressional representatives, urging them to preserve the protections the ACA offers. Couch began caring about healthcare as a high school senior when she was diagnosed with lupus and since then has become something of a reluctant expert on how to manage not only her treatment but also the insurance that pays for it. With friends and neighbors she talks about the law in simple but personal terms. ‘‘I tell people, ‘I have a preexisting condition, and this has helped me,’’’ she says of the ACA. Couch follows the healthcare debate in Washington so closely because she knows firsthand what happens when you don’t have adequate coverage. Couch remembers the time, before the ACA, when a new immunosuppressive drug that wasn’t covered by her policy became available. ‘‘It was expensive,’’ she explained in an interview, ‘‘but it worked, and I knew I needed it. Every month I’d just put it on a credit card. When your medication is thousands of dollars a month, that’s the start of being in debt.’’ She considered bankruptcy but ultimately worked her way out from under the pile of medical bills. As a result of the ACA, her coverage shifted again when her employer no longer offered a traditional plan and she had to switch to one with a high $3,000 deductible. Initially she was stunned by her outofpocket costs, but she quickly realized that her total costs would be capped once she’d met that threshold. ‘‘It seemed scary and it seemed different,’’ she explains. ‘‘But it actually saved me money.’’ And now, she says, ‘‘I don’t have to worry about how much a new drug costs.’’ So on the March day the House of Representatives was supposed to vote on repealing the ACA, she worried that the insurance she’d come to depend on was about to be yanked away. Only after emerging from a client meeting did she learn the vote had been canceled. ‘‘I started crying I was so happy,’’ Couch recalls. ‘‘It’s like a weight has lifted.’’ But Couch’s relief was shortlived. Now she’s back to paying close attention to the rhetoric and votecounting deals in Washington, awaiting another possible vote on the newly revised plan. ‘‘I’m still optimistic,’’ she said this week. ‘‘I think enough people will stand up and fight for the coverage.’’ Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ). Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, a month ago I was ready to speak right here on the floor when this bill was abruptly removed. Apparently, it wasn’t bad enough that day, it wasn’t harmful enough. But now it is back worse than ever. So bad, it might actually pass. I don’t have a lot of time to explain, but let me tell you two groups that are really going to say thank you: it is the billionaires and it is the undertakers. This bill will make health care more unaffordable and cause preventable deaths. Meanwhile, it gives $600 billion—excuse me—$800 billion to the wealthy, to the billionaires. TrumpCare brings us higher costs, less coverage, guts the benefits, has a crushing age tax, and steals from Medicare. In my district alone, 43,000 people will lose coverage. 9,000 of those are children. The elderly, Medicaid will be lost, close to 2,000. There is a reason they are trying to jam this down our throats. There is no CBO score because they don’t want to hear a score. Mr. Speaker, let me make it plain. Let’s put this bill in a coffin, not Americans. Let’s kill and bury this bill. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE ), our distinguished whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the Budget Committee for yielding. I was in strong support of this bill, Mr. Speaker, that finally provides relief to the American people across this country from the failures of ObamaCare. Just how bad is it failing? You don’t have to look any further than what happened in Iowa yesterday, where literally they are going to have in 94 out of 99 counties nobody to write insurance for people that are in the ObamaCare exchanges. So what do the people, Mr. Speaker, that are opposed to this bill say to those millions of people in Iowa who are about to have no place to go to get health care? What are the people that oppose this bill, Mr. Speaker, going to say to the millions of people with preexisting conditions across the country who are being faced with doubledigit increases in their health insurance every year and, oh, by the way, premiums and deductibles as high as over $10,000, which are creaming those folks that are struggling under the weight of this bill? So what we are replacing it with, Mr. Speaker, are reforms that actually lower premiums, that actually put patients back in charge of their healthcare decisions so that elitists up here in Washington won’t tell you what you have to buy. You actually get to make that choice yourself. b1300 You get to focus on plans that are good for your family at lower costs so that you can be in charge. And, by the way, reforming the Medicaid system, one of the most broken forms of health care so that States actually have the ability to innovate and help lowincome families. This bill is important, Mr. Speaker, to rescue the American people from a law that has failed dismally. Let’s end the skyrocketing premium increases. Let’s lower costs and put patients back in charge of their healthcare decisions. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for this bill can take away protections for over 800,000 people with preexisting conditions in Louisiana. For example, those with breast cancer could see their premiums go up by over $34,000. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER ). (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from AARP which makes clear 
health care will be sabotaged under this bill, and healthcare costs for older Americans will ‘‘dramatically increase.’’ 
[From the House Democratic Leader’s Press Office, May 3, 2017] AARP PRESS RELEASE : NEWCHANGES TO THE  AHCA MAKES A BADBILLWORSE ! DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : Older Americans care deeply about access to and affordability of health care. With the addition of the Upton Amendment, as reported, we once again write to share our opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and urge you to vote NO. Changes under consideration that would allow states to waive important consumer protections—allowing insurance companies to once again charge Americans with preexisting conditions more because they’ve had cancer, diabetes or heart disease—would make a bad bill even worse. This would be devastating for the 25 million Americans 50–64 who have a deniable preexisting condition. The Upton amendment would do little to reduce the massive premium increases for those with preexisting conditions. Throughout consideration of the AHCA, we have been expressing serious concerns about the impact that this legislation will have on older Americans. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)’s last estimate further demonstrates the harmful impact of this bill on older Americans and some of our most vulnerable. Specifically, the American Health Care Act will weaken the fiscal sustainability of Medicare; dramatically increase premium and outofpocket costs for 50–64 year olds purchasing coverage on the individual insurance market; allow insurance companies to once again discriminate against those with preexisting conditions; substantially increase the number of Americans without insurance; and put at risk millions of children and adults with disabilities and poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program to access longterm services and supports and other benefits. Our members and others 50 years of age and older care deeply about health care and want to know where their elected leaders stand. Recognizing the importance of the upcoming vote on the American Health Care Act, AARP intends to inform our members, and others over age 50, how their elected officials voted. We’ll communicate the results of the vote in our widelycirculated publications, in email alerts, in our online channels, and through the media. Again, we urge all Representatives to vote NO on the American Health Care Act in its current form. 
MEDICARE  The American Health Care Act repeals provisions in current law that have strengthened Medicare’s fiscal outlook, specifically, the repeal of the additional 0.9 percent payroll tax on higherincome workers. Repealing this provision would remove billions from the Hospital Insurance trust fund, hasten the insolvency of Medicare, and diminish Medicare’s ability to pay for services in the future. 
INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE INSURANCE MARKET  Currently, about 25 million Americans age 50–64 have a preexisting condition, about 6.1 million purchase insurance in the nongroup market, and nearly 3.2 million are currently eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance coverage through either the federal health benefits exchange or a statebased exchange (exchange). Since passage of the ACA, the number of 50–64 year old Americans who are uninsured has dropped by half. We are deeply concerned that the AHCA would be a significant step backwards and result in millions of older Americans who cannot afford their health care, including many simply losing their health care. Based on CBO estimates, approximately 14 million Americans will lose coverage next year, while a total of 24 million Americans would lose coverage over the next 10 years. Affordability of both premiums and cost sharing is critical to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access health care. A typical 50–64 year old seeking coverage through an exchange has a median annual income of under $25,000 and already pays significant outofpocket costs for health care. We have serious concerns—reinforced by the CBO estimate—that the bill under consideration will dramatically increase health care costs for 50–64 year olds who purchase health care through an exchange due both to the changes in age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that requires uninsured older Americans to pay three times more than younger individuals) to 5:1 (or more) and reductions in current tax credits for older Americans. CBO concluded that the bill will substantially raise premiums for older people and force many into lower quality plans. Age rating plus reduced tax credits equal an unaffordable age tax. Our previous estimates on the agerating change showed that premiums for current coverage could increase by up to $3,200 for a 64 year old. In addition, the bill reduced the tax credits available for older Americans to help purchase insurance. We estimate that the bill’s changes to current law’s tax credits alone could increase premium costs by more than $5,800 for a 64year old earning $15,000. Overall, both the bill’s tax credit changes and 5:1 age rating would result in skyrocketing cost increases for older Americans. In their analysis, CBO found that a 64 year old earning $26,500 a year would see their premiums increase by $12,900—758 percent—from $1,700 to $14,600 a year. Current law prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against individuals due to a preexisting condition. The bill would repeal preexisting condition protections and would once again allow insurance companies to charge Americans more—we estimate up to $25,000 more—due to a preexisting condition. As a result, the 4o percent of 50 to 64 yearolds (about 25 million people) who have a deniable preexisting condition risk losing access to affordable coverage. The Upton Amendment, which would add funds to address the impact of premium increases for those with preexisting conditions, would do little to mitigate the massive premium increase for some of the most vulnerable Americans. AARP strongly opposes any weakening of the law’s preexisting condition protections which benefit millions of Americans. MEDICAID AND LONG TERM SERVICES AND  
SUPPORTS  AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act that create a per capita cap financing structure in the Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of individuals who depend on the essential services provided through Medicaid. CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid funding by $880 billion over 2017– 2026, about 25 percent less than what it projects under current law. Medicaid is a vital safety net and intergenerational lifeline for millions of individuals, including over 17.4 million lowincome seniors and children and adults with disabilities who rely on the program for critical health care and longterm services and supports (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, managing medications, and transportation). Older adults and people with disabilities now account for over sixty percent of Medicaid spending, and cuts of this magnitude will result in loss of benefits and services for this vulnerable population. Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65 and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost 33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid spending. Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and communitybased services (HCBS) for assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as hearing aids and eyeglasses. In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person, this approach to financing would likely result in overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and families unable to shoulder the costs of care without sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to program eligibility, services, or both—ultimately harming some of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens. Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I know in these polarized times we often forget our actual connections to each other, but we are all connected. A sick, uninsured employee affects the bottom line of a small business. Uncompensated care in the emergency room, we all pay the bill. When a child from an uninsured family goes to school with an undiagnosed virus, not only does it impact his or her ability to learn, it impacts other kids and puts them at risk. We are all connected. As Martin Luther King so powerfully said: ‘‘We may have come over on different ships, but we are all in the same boat now.’’ Mr. Speaker, it is time we start rowing together. Unfortunately, this bill fails to recognize this. It still fails that we are connected, and, instead of bringing us together, this simply divides us by providing less coverage, imposing an age tax, forcing people to pay more, and stripping key protections. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1628. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ). (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. I include in the RECORD a letter from the American Medical Association that states: ‘‘Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance coverage for millions of Americans, the legislation would, in many cases, eliminate the ban against charging those with underlying medical conditions vastly more for their coverage.’’ 
[From the American Medical Association, May 3, 2017] AMA WARNS THAT PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE  AMERICAN HEALTH CAREACTDONOTREMEDYBILL’SSHORTCOMINGS  
AMERICANS WOULD STILL LOSE HEALTH IN SURANCE COVERAGE  CHICAGO —American Medical Association (AMA) President Andrew W. Gurman, M.D., issued the following statement today about proposed changes to the American Health Care Act (AHCA): ‘‘None of the legislative tweaks under consideration changes the serious harm to patients and the health care delivery system if AHCA passes. Proposed changes to the bill tinker at the edges without remedying the fundamental failing of the bill—that millions of Americans will lose their health insurance as a direct result of this proposal. ‘‘Highrisk pools are not a new idea. Prior to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 35 states operated highrisk pools, and they were not a panacea for Americans with pre existing medical conditions. The history of highrisk pools demonstrates that Americans with preexisting conditions will be stuck in secondclass health care coverage—if they are able to obtain coverage at all. ‘‘Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance coverage for millions of Americans, the legislation would, in many cases, eliminate the ban against charging those with underlying medical conditions vastly more for their coverage.’’ ‘‘America should not go backward to the time when our fellow citizens with preexisting health conditions faced high costs for limited coverage, if they were able to obtain coverage at all. The AMA urges congressional leaders and the Administration to pursue a bipartisan dialogue on alternative policies that provide patients with access and coverage to high quality care and preserve the safety net for vulnerable populations.’’ 
BACKGROUND ON HIGH RISK POOLS  A January report from the American Academy of Actuaries notes that ‘‘enrollment has generally been low, coverage has been limited and expensive, they require external funding, and they have typically operated at a loss . . . Removing highrisk individuals from the insured risk pools reduces costs in the private market only temporarily. Over time, even lowercost individuals in the individual market can incur high health care costs, which would put upward pressure on premiums.’’ According to the Kaiser Family Foundation: State highrisk pools featured premiums above standard nongroup market rates—with most states capping them at 150%–200% of standard rates. Many also featured high deductibles, some $5,000 or more. Despite the fact that many individuals were forced into highrisk pools because of a preexisting condition, nearly all states excluded coverage for these conditions for 6–12 months. Almost all highrisk pools imposed lifetime limits on covered services, and some imposed annual limits. Some states capped or closed enrollment. Combined net losses for the state highrisk pools totaled more than $1.2 billion for 2011, or $5,510 per enrollee, on average. Furthermore, a 2010 paper by James Capretta and Tom Miller that appeared in National Affairs estimated that the cost of adequately funded high risk pools would be $15 billion to $20 billion per year. 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, the country will not remember what we say here today, but it will never forget what we do today, especially if we make the wrong choice and adopt this bill. The 159 million Americans whose employersponsored health care could be cut would never forget. Neither would the 24 million Americans who would lose their coverage or the 52 million people with preexisting conditions who would struggle to find health insurance again. If this bill passes, Mr. Speaker, no cancer survivor denied coverage will forget, no survivor of sexual assault charged more for her ordeal will forget, and no parent struggling to afford emergency surgery for a newborn child could ever forget. They would not have that choice. But today, we have one. We can choose to vote no and prevent millions of Americans from losing their health care. We can choose the right path rooted in morality, decency, and reason. I implore you, vote ‘‘no.’’ Mrs. BLACK. I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ). (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from AFSCME which states this bill would cause millions to lose their health coverage and return to the days when even inadequate coverage was unaffordable. 
AFSCME, May 3, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 1.6 million working and retiree members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to express our continuing opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), notwithstanding the addition of the Upton amendment. The harm that AHCA will impose on ordinary Americans is breathtaking in scope. As the Congressional Budget Office has detailed, 24 million will lose their health care coverage. The Medicaid program will be cut by $839 billion and restructured, ending the guarantee that the federal government will fund a specified share of state Medicaid costs. The bill makes coverage more expensive, especially for lowerincome families and older workers and it undermines the financial strength of Medicare. And the MacArthur amendment makes a very bad bill worse by allowing states to opt out of Affordable Care Act protections that ensure that people with preexisting conditions will be able to obtain comprehensive, affordable health care. Moreover, the MacArthur amendment would allow insurance companies to reimpose caps on annual and lifetime limits, even in employersponsored coverage, putting the health care of those with catastrophic illnesses or injuries at risk. Under the Upton amendment, grants to states that could be used for highrisk pools will be increased by 6% or $8 billion over five years. This is a paltry increase. Even the conservative Mercatus Center described the increase as a ‘‘pittance.’’ Highrisk pools would still be grossly underfunded, even if states put all of the $138 billion in grant funding into them. We urge the Congress not to ignore the previous experience with state highrisk pools. By segregating those with preexisting conditions into separate coverage we know they will face higher premiums, benefit exclusions, annual and lifetime limits on coverage and waiting lists. It is unacceptable that this bill eliminates $500 billion in taxes on the wealthiest 2%, health insurers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device makers, while taking health care away from millions. Moreover, the bill retains the 40% tax on high cost health plans, which will undermine employersponsored insurance for working families by hollowing out coverage and increasing outofpocket expenses, although it delays the implementation for six years. The bottom line is that this bill would cause millions to lose their health coverage. Most of those with preexisting conditions would return to the days when even inadequate coverage was unaffordable. The bill would drive up costs for those who are older and lowerincome, shift costs to states, fail to protect employersponsored coverage, weaken public health and undermine the solvency of the Medicare trust fund all the while providing tax cuts for the wealthy and wellconnected. The priorities demonstrated by this bill are upside down. We urge you to oppose this bill. Sincerely, SCOTT FREY, Director of Federal Government Affairs. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this bill. We all should. Protecting ACA is the top issue for my constituents. Constituents like Leslie Gauthier who, without the protections of the ACA, would not have gotten the treatment for leukemia that she was diagnosed just at the age of 22. Leslie is now in remission thanks to ObamaCare. For Leslie, the ACA protections like essential health benefits were a matter of life and death. This Republican bill would destroy those patient protections. Under the ACA in my district: a 5 percent drop in uninsured rates; subsidies based on income and region and not on age; Medicaid Expansion covering of 156,000 people will be lost. The President promised not to cut Medicaid. This bill guts it by $880 billion. This bill is a gut punch to America. Pregnant women seeking health care, kicked to the curb. Patients with preexisting conditions, kicked to the curb. Senior citizens who will have to pay more for less, kicked to curb. Over 24 million people, including 6.5 million Latinos, kicked to the curb. Mr. Speaker, we demand Republicans stop kicking to the curb Americans. Stop this bill. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the Service Employees International Union’s letter voicing strong opposition to the deadly American Health Care Act for their 2 million Members. 
SEIU, May 2, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 2 million members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), America’s largest healthcare union, I write to voice strong opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA). New provisions in the legislation manage to make a bad bill worse. Not only does the bill cause millions to lose insurance coverage, face higher costs, and end Medicaid as we know it, but now it also strips essential protections for those with preexisting conditions. The AHCA will leave millions of men, women, and children without access to high quality, affordable health care. The AHCA legislation unequivocally jeopardizes working families’ safety, health, and financial security. The AHCA will leave millions of Americans without health insurance and therefore without access to healthcare. The last available estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated about 14 million fewer people will have health insurance in 2018, and by 2026, 24 million fewer people will have coverage compared to the current baseline under the ACA. Unfortunately, we do not have more up to date information. Despite the importance that healthcare plays in the lives of working families, Congressional leaders have indicated that they intend to hold a vote on the legislation without knowing its impact. The AHCA also decimates the Medicaid program, rationing and endangering healthcare for children, seniors, people with disabilities, and their families as well as for those who have gained coverage as a result of the Medicaid expansion. According to CBO, the legislation will cut federal funding for Medicaid by $880 billion over ten years. Americans know that Medicaid is working and realize the key role that the program plays in helping families afford care—including nursing home care and home and communitybased services for elderly and disabled individuals. Nearly 1 in 5 Americans are covered under Medicaid and rely on it to get health services. Under the AHCA, those Americans would lose access to vital care that may mean the difference between life and death. Additionally, the AHCA would cap the amount of money states receive in Medicaid funding from the federal government each year, regardless of the cost of providing healthcare to those who qualify. Medicaid is already a lean program especially when measured on a per capita basis, and cuts from capping federal funding will quickly force states to cut services, limit enrollment, and decrease payments to hospitals and other providers. Also, Medicaid is the largest payer for long term care in the country. The program pays for more than 60 percent of all nursing home residents and for more than 3.2 million Americans with home and communitybased care, which allows many older Americans and people with disabilities to remain in their homes rather than move to a more expensive institutional setting. States—which must balance budgets and already face fiscal pressures—will not be able to make up the lost federal dollars and will be forced to deny care. The inevitable result will be that the AHCA will make it much harder and more costly for older Americans, people with disabilities, and their families to get services they need. In addition, the legislation will effectively end the Medicaid expansion, which provides health coverage to millions of people earning low to moderate incomes. While the bill purports to allow states to maintain the expansion, states will only receive an enhanced match, or additional funding, for people who enroll before 2020 and maintain continuous coverage. It is widely understood that there is significant churn on and off the program in this coverage category, and thus over time the reimbursement rates for states will drop. The resulting large cost shift to states may lead them to eliminate coverage for this group altogether. In fact, seven states have triggers that would end the Medicaid expansion in their state if federal reimbursement decreases. Lastly, Medicaid provider rates are already extremely low in most states. Cuts to Medicaid, capped funding, and elimination of the Medicaid expansion would lead to further reductions in rates for providers, leading to job and other spending cuts in the health care industry that will have ripple effects on the broader economy. We have serious concerns that hospitals, especially those that serve communities that may not have access to many providers, could be forced to close or cut back services, further reducing access to care in underserved areas. Those who purchase coverage in the individual market do not fare much better under the proposed bill. The AHCA provides tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 to individuals to purchase private insurance—substantially lower than the ACA’s current levels for the majority of those who receive them. Unlike the ACA, it is unclear that people with access to employer insurance that is unaffordable or inadequate will be eligible for credits, which would mean that they will be left without access to coverage and care. The bill also creates an age tax on older Americans by letting insurance companies charge people over 60 as much as five times what they charge others for the same coverage. CBO found that under the initial bill introduced, premiums for those between age 50 and 65 would skyrocket. Moreover, it is unclear what coverage will be available on the individual market or if the current healthcare marketplaces will even still exist under this scheme. Between premiums and out of pocket costs like deductibles, especially for those most in need of care due to preexisting conditions, illness, or age, the result could be higher costs for less coverage. A bad bill has managed to have been made even worse by the ‘‘MacArthurMeadows Amendment.’’ The amendment guts essential protections for those with preexisting conditions. It would allow states to charge those with preexisting conditions higher premiums by allowing states to very easily waive community rating requirements, which currently prohibits this practice. Furthermore it would grant states, through a waiver that is approved by default, the ability to opt out of essential health benefit requirements, a core set of medical services, like hospitalizations, mental health, maternity care and prescription drug coverage, which all insurers are required to cover under the ACA. If states waive requirements, insurers could leave those who are sick or with preexisting conditions out to fend for themselves and face exorbitant costs to get lifesaving care they need. Experts agree that the funding included in the ‘‘Upton Long Amendment’’ is completely inadequate to protect those with preexisting conditions. The Administration and Congressional Leaders promised to the American people that those with preexisting conditions would remain protected—this bill even with added amendments defaults on that promise. Another failure of the AHCA is that it hurts women by freezing funding to providers like Planned Parenthood, risking the health and wellbeing of the 2.5 million people who rely on the organization for basic care. One in five women in the United States has visited Planned Parenthood clinics and for many lowincome women of color, including many of our members, Planned Parenthood is their essential health provider. For these individuals, healthcare is not an ideological struggle or about the politics of one policy versus another; it is a necessity that could mean the difference between sickness and health. The real winners of the AHCA appear to be special interests and the wealthy. The legislation repeals most if not all of the ACA tax provisions for special interests like the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, offsetting these costs with the massive cuts to Medicaid described above. The bill also maintains the socalled ‘‘Cadillac tax,’’ which places a tax on workers who have robust health coverage, merely delaying implementation to 2026. Implementation of the tax will punish people who have decent insurance, and will encourage employers to further shift health costs to workers. Furthermore, the incentives for health savings accounts, which encourage wealthier people to shelter pretax income, are of little use to working households earning lowto moderate incomes. The AHCA is not care, it is chaos. The legislation creates an environment of uncertainty and unaffordability for Americans and is a bad deal for working families. The bill radically restructures Medicaid as we know it and cuts funding for the program significantly, endangers women’s health, and further enriches corporations, special interests, and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working families’ access to healthcare and financial stability. The American people will hold you accountable for how you proceed in this moment. We therefore respectfully ask you vote no on the American Health Care Act and the proposed amendments to the legislation when it comes to a vote in the House of Representatives. We will add this vote to our legislative scorecard. If you need any additional information please contact Ilene Stein, Assistant Legislative Director. Sincerely, MARYKAYHENRY , International President. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ). (Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I will include in the RECORD a letter from the Association of American Medical Colleges which states: ‘‘Treatment of essential health benefits and health status underwriting dilutes protections for many Americans and would leave individuals with preexisting conditions facing higher premiums and reduce access to vital care.’’ Mr. Speaker, I rise to caution those Republicans who have allowed themselves to be persuaded by this President into supporting this terrible bill which would leave millions of Americans without health care and raise the cost of care for millions more. You are going to pay a terrible price for not protecting your constituents. TrumpCare will cause 24 million Americans to lose their health coverage and slash Medicaid by $880 billion; for older Americans, premiums, deductibles, and copayments will skyrocket. Those between the ages of 50 and 64 will be forced to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for the same coverage. 
This crushing age tax will fall on some of the most vulnerable members of our society, elderly people on fixed incomes who often have serious health issues. Meanwhile, hidden in this bill is an outrageous tax break for billionaires. TrumpCare gives $600 billion in tax cuts to large corporations and wealthy people, including $2.8 billion to the 400 richest families in America. The MacArthur amendment made this bill even worse by jettisoning protections for people with preexisting conditions. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ). Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I have been here for five decades, and I can’t recall a time when we have debated something so obviously harmful to seniors and working people in this country. This bill strips health care from 24 million people. It requires seniors to pay sometimes 100 percent or more of their income in premiums. This legislation drastically and dramatically cuts Medicaid, directly contradicting President Trump’s claim not to. In Michigan, half of all children rely on Medicaid. In my district alone, 56,000 people will lose coverage, including 16,000 children and 3,200 seniors. Let’s be clear. If we pass this bill, people will die. Health care is a right and not a privilege. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ), the highest ranking enlisted soldier ever elected to Congress. (Mr. WALZ asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Paralyzed Veterans of America urging rejection of the latest version of the American Health Care Act. 
PARALYZED VETERANS OF AMERICA , Washington, DC, May 3, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) urges rejection of the latest version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA). PVA is the nation’s only Congressionallychartered veterans’ service organization solely dedicated to representing veterans with spinal cord injury and/or disease. Consequently, we are very concerned about the conflicting information circulating about this legislation and the adverse impact it could have on our members and millions of other people with disabilities. As we understand it, the AHCA cuts $880 billion out of the Medicaid program in order to finance tax cuts that will explode the deficit and largely assist upper income individuals, corporations, and providers. The Medicaid changes are particularly devastating to people with disabilities. Under the cap and cut proposal, the federal government would no longer share in the costs of providing health care services and community services beyond the capped amount. This would eliminate the enhanced federal match for the Community First Choice Option under Medicaid that provides attendant care services in the community. Thanks to this program, many poor veterans with serious nonserviceconnected disabilities have been able to move from nursing homes into their communities. The AHCA also weakens Medicaid by ending the Medicaid expansion earlier and offering Medicaid block grants to states. Data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation shows expansion has helped thousands of veterans and their caregivers. For veterans and PVA members in particular, the AHCA continues several problematic policies of the ACA as well as troubling new provisions that could affect the ability of many veterans and their family members to afford health insurance in the private market. The underlying AHCA bill: Continues to exclude CHAMPVA beneficiaries—dependents of the most catastrophically disabled veterans—from the dependents’ coverage policy up to age 26. Fails to remove the prohibition on enrollment into the VA health care system for Priority Group 8 veterans, thus denying these veterans access to the principal health care system for veterans. Denies access to tax credits making health insurance affordable to anyone eligible for a host of other federal health programs, including those ‘‘eligible’’ for coverage under Title 38 health care programs. This would prevent many veterans who may be ‘‘eligible for’’ but not enrolled in the VA health care system from accessing these tax credits intended to help people buy insurance. Not only do the changes made to the original version of the AHCA continue its failure to protect veterans and people with disabilities, they make these circumstances worse. The latest changes would allow states to seek waivers that would allow insurers to charge higher premiums to people with pre existing conditions, including people with disabilities. The new amendments also would allow states to seek waivers from the ACA’s requirement that certain essential health benefits must be provided, including crucial services for people with disabilities such as prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness services and chronic disease management. The combination of these changes would make it nearly impossible for people with preexisting conditions to find affordable plans that cover basic health care services. Throughout these past few months, the American people have been calling for a bipartisan effort to improve the nation’s health care system. Congress should heed these voices, stop its pursuit of the flawed American Health Care Act and work together through regular order to strengthen all Americans’ access to affordable, high quality health care. Sincerely, CARLBLAKE , Associate Executive Director. 
Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, there are many reasons that people may come to the conclusion this is not the piece of legislation for them. I would argue most egregious amongst this is the manner in which it was done. There was clearly an error made on the 7 million veterans you heard about. I do not question a single Member’s commitment in here to caring for veterans. You did not do it on purpose. You did it because you had to, to meet the arcane rules of the Senate, so you stripped it out, and you will, by all intents and purposes, fix it in the Senate. For you, I would say good luck with that. But for the Members who are sitting here: Why would we not debate this? Why would we not fix it? Why would we not go through regular order so all of us would ensure there is not a loophole that would deny coverage to 7 million veterans. This is too important to rush. It is too important to make errors like this. It is darn sure too important to count on the Senate to fix it. And it was our responsibility. So here we sat with 30 seconds among 15 of us to make points that are important to the American public. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: reject this. Come back and do it right, and provide the health care our veterans deserve. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are again reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. HANABUSA ). (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from Save Medicaid in Schools, a coalition of dozens of organizations. This letter states that this bill jeopardizes health care for the Nation’s most vulnerable children: students with disabilities and students in poverty. 
MAY2, 2017. Re The American Health Care Act Vote Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER , Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL , SPEAKER RYAN, MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER , 
AND MINORITY LEADER PELOSI : The undersigned member organizations of the Save Medicaid in the Schools Coalition are concerned that the American Health Care Act (AHCA) jeopardizes healthcare for the nation’s most vulnerable children: students with disabilities and students in poverty. Specifically, the AHCA reneges on Medicaid’s 50+ year commitment to provide America’s children with access to vital healthcare services that ensure they have adequate educational opportunities and can contribute to society by imposing a percapita cap and shifting current and future costs to taxpayers in every state and Congressional district. While children currently comprise almost half of all Medicaid beneficiaries, less than one in five dollars is spent by Medicaid on children. Accordingly, a percapita cap, even one that is based on different groups of beneficiaries, will disproportionally harm children’s access to care, including services received at school. Considering these unintended consequences, we urge a ‘no’’ vote on The American Health Care Act (AHCA). 
Medicaid is a costeffective and efficient provider of essential health care services for children. Schoolbased Medicaid programs serve as a lifeline to children who can’t access critical health care and health services outside of their school. Under this bill, the bulk of the mandated costs of providing health care coverage would be shifted to the States even though health needs and costs of care for children will remain the same or increase. Most analyses of the AHCA project that the Medicaid funding shortfall in support of these mandated services will increase, placing states at greater risk year after year. The federal disinvestment in Medicaid imposed by the AHCA will force States and local communities to increase taxes and reduce or eliminate various programs and services, including other non Medicaid services. The unintended consequences of the AHCA will force states to cut eligibility, services, and benefits for children. The projected loss of $880 billion in federal Medicaid dollars will compel States to ration health care for children. Under the percapita caps included in the AHCA, health care will be rationed and schools will be forced to compete with other critical health care providers—hospitals, physicians, and clinics— that serve Medicaideligible children. Schoolbased health services are mandated on the States and those mandates do not cease simply because Medicaid funds are capped by the AHCA. As with many other unfunded mandates, capping Medicaid merely shifts the financial burden of providing services to the States. 
CRITICAL HEALTH CARE FOR STUDENTS  A school’s primary responsibility is to provide students with a highquality education. However, children cannot learn to their fullest potential with unmet health needs. As such, school district personnel regularly provide critical health services to ensure that all children are ready to learn and able to thrive alongside their peers. Schools deliver health services effectively and efficiently since school is where children spend most of their days. Increasing access to health care services through Medicaid improves health care and educational outcomes for students. Providing health and wellness services for students in poverty and services that benefit students with disabilities ultimately enables more children to become employable and attend highereducation. Since 1988, Medicaid has permitted payment to schools for certain medicallynecessary services provided to children under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) through an individualized education program (IEP) or individualized family service program (IFSP). Schools are thus eligible to be reimbursed for direct medical services to Medicaideligible students with an IEP or IFSP. In addition, districts can receive Medicaid reimbursements for providing Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment Benefits (EPSDT), which provide Medicaideligible children under age 21 with a broad array of diagnosis and treatment services. The goal of EPSDT is to assure that health problems are diagnosed and treated as early as possible before the problems become complex and treatment is more expensive. School districts use their Medicaid reimbursement funds in a variety of ways to help support the learning and development of the children they serve. In a 2017 survey of school districts, district officials reported that twothirds of Medicaid dollars are used to support the work of health professionals and other specialized instructional support personnel (e.g., speechlanguage pathologists, audiologists, occupational therapists, school psychologists, school social workers, and school nurses) who provide comprehensive health and mental health services to students. Districts also use these funds to expand the availability of a wide range of health and mental health services available to students in poverty, who are more likely to lack consistent access to healthcare professionals. Further, some districts depend on Medicaid reimbursements to purchase and update specialized equipment (e.g., walkers, wheelchairs, exercise equipment, special playground equipment, and equipment to assist with hearing and seeing) as well as assistive technology for students with disabilities to help them learn alongside their peers. School districts would stand to lose much of their funding for Medicaid under the AHCA. Schools currently receive roughly $4 billion in Medicaid reimbursements each year. Yet under this proposal, states would no longer have to consider schools as eligible Medicaid providers, which would mean that districts would have the same obligation to provide services for students with disabilities under IDEA, but no Medicaid dollars to provide medicallynecessary services. Schools would be unable to provide EPSDT to students, which would mean screenings and treatment that take place in school settings would have to be moved to physician offices or hospital emergency rooms, where some families may not visit regularly or where costs are much higher. In addition, basic health screenings for vision, hearing, and mental health problems for students would no longer be possible, making these problems more difficult to address and expensive to treat. Moving health screenings out of schools also reduces access to early identification and treatment, which also leads to more costly treatment down the road. Efforts by schools to enroll eligible students in Medicaid, as required, would also decline. 
FOR CHILDREN  Significant reductions to Medicaid spending could have devastating effects on our nation’s children, especially those with disabilities. Due to the underfunding of IDEA, districts rely on Medicaid reimbursements to ensure students with disabilities have access to the supports and services they need to access a Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) and Early Intervention services. Potential consequences of this critical loss of funds include: Fewer health services: Providing comprehensive physical and mental health services in schools improves accessibility for many children and youth, particularly in highneeds and hardtoserve areas, such as rural and urban communities. In a 2017 survey of school district leaders, half of them indicated they recently took steps to increase Medicaid enrollment in their districts. Reduced funding for Medicaid would result in decreased access to critical health care for many children. Cuts to general education: Cuts in Medicaid funding would require districts to divert funds from other educational programs to provide the services as mandated under IDEA. These funding reductions could result in an elimination of program cuts of equivalent cost in ‘‘nonmandated’’ areas of regular education. Higher taxes: Many districts rely on Medicaid reimbursements to cover personnel costs for their special education programs. A loss in Medicaid dollars could lead to deficits in districts that require increases in property taxes or new levies to cover the costs of the special education programs. Job loss: Districts use Medicaid reimbursement to support the salaries and benefits of the staff performing eligible services. Sixty eight percent of districts use Medicaid funding to pay for direct salaries for health professionals who provide services for students. Cuts to Medicaid funding would impact districts’ ability to maintain employment for school nurses, physical and occupational therapists, speechlanguage pathologists, school social workers, school psychologists, and many other critical school personnel who ensure students with disabilities and those with a variety of educational needs are able to learn. Fewer critical supplies: Districts use Medicaid reimbursement for critical supplies such as wheelchairs, therapeutic bicycles, hydraulic changing tables, walkers, weighted vests, lifts, and studentspecific items that are necessary for each child to access curriculum as closely as possible to their non disabled peers. Replacing this equipment would be difficult if not impossible without Medicaid reimbursements. Fewer mental health supports: Seven out of ten students receiving mental health services receive these services at school. Cuts to Medicaid would further marginalize these critical services and leave students without access to care. Noncompliance with IDEA: Given the failure to commit federal resources to fully fund IDEA, Medicaid reimbursements serve as a critical funding stream to help schools provide the specialized instructional supports that students with disabilities need to be educated alongside their peers. We urge you to carefully consider the important benefits that Medicaid provides to our nation’s most vulnerable children. Schools are often the hub of the community, and converting Medicaid’s financing structure to percapita caps threatens to significantly reduce access to comprehensive health and mental and behavioral health care for children with disabilities and those living in poverty. We look forward to working with you to avert the harmful and unnecessary impacts the AHCA would impose on Medicaid, which has proven to benefit children in a highly effective and costeffective manner. If you have questions about the letter or wish to meet to discuss this issue further, please do not hesitate to reach out to the coalition cochairs: John Hill, Sasha Pudelski and Kelly Vaillancourt Strobach.

Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the TrumpCare Act. I am fortunate to have been born and raised in Hawaii where we are taught to never forget our seniors, our kupuna. AARP, with a national membership of 38 million and over 150,000 in Hawaii, remains steadfastly opposed to TrumpCare. The amendment proposed today makes the bill worse. And for our kupuna in Hawaii and nationally, they will have no relief from the age tax. This chart shows how much more at age 64 a person will pay in premiums, almost $6,800 in Hawaii where we have one of the best health cares. A 55year old will see a premium increase of almost $3,600 a year. Why? What did the seniors do that TrumpCare wants to penalize them and pay such a premium when they are moving towards retirement? TrumpCare is out to get those 50 to 64 with this terrible age tax. Vote against H.R. 1628. These numbers will not be different in your districts. Mrs. BLACK. I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, could you advise us how much time is remaining on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 5
1⁄2minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from Tennessee has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS ). (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) b1315 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD letters from the United Steelworkers, the AFL–CIO, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in relation to this bill. UNITED STEELWORKERS , May 3, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the members of the United Steelworkers union (USW), I continue to urge you to oppose the American Health Care Act (AHCA), despite proposed amendments. This legislation will adversely affect every American’s health insurance benefits including workplace plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and the individual market. This harmful and partisan legislation will cause tens of millions to lose insurance coverage over the next decade. Deductibles and premiums are expected to rise. In short, rather than reducing costs of health care, this bill will simply shift costs to working Americans and their families while cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations. The MacArthur Amendment allows states to opt out of certain protections under the Affordable Care Act such as the requirements that insurers provide plans with a minimum package of services and don’t discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. The amendment also lets states allow insurance companies to charge older people up to five times what they charge younger people. This amendment will allow for an uneven patchwork of insurance coverage across the country and will make insurance cost prohibitive for many working and retired Americans. Although lawmakers are working to address the treatment of individuals with preexisting conditions, none of the proposals have adequately addressed the costs associated with removal of the Affordable Care Act’s protections for those individuals. Overall, the AHCA is a transfer of wealth from working Americans to the very wealthy and to corporations including the pharmaceutical industry, insurance companies, and medical device manufacturers. It removes taxes on the very wealthy and on corporations, giving the wealthiest 400 household an average tax cut of about $7 million each. Meanwhile, the bill retains the ‘‘Cadillac Tax’’ which puts the burden of the cost of this legislation squarely on the backs of middle class working families. Most of our members are covered under employernegotiated insurance plans. However, the AHCA removes the employermandate included in the Affordable Care Act. This dramatically changes the incentive and landscape for employersponsored insurance, which threatens the system that provides insurance for millions of hardworking Americans. CBO estimated that 7 million people will lost their workplace coverage as a result of this bill. The AHCA also undoes protections and assistance for older Americans and our members who are retirees with dramatically increased outofpocket costs to Americans who are older but not yet eligible for Medicare. For those who will or currently rely on Medicare this bill reduces the solvency of the program by three years by repealing taxes on the wealthy and on corporations. Additionally, this bill makes perilous cuts to Medicaid which provides health care to lowincome Americans who have been laid off, work at lowpaying jobs, are disabled, or are elderly. This will strain already limited state budgets, restrict the needy Americans who are eligible for assistance, and eliminate needed services. Our members who work in the health care industry may also be affected by job losses and strained budgets caused by the passage of this bill. Providers (our employers) may be subjected to lower reimbursement rates from state Medicaid programs as a result of the federal cuts. Also, the costs of uncompensated care will rise as millions of Americans lose health insurance but still need health care treatment for illnesses and injuries. Once again, hardworking middle class health care workers will have to bear the costs of this harmful legislation. The amendments to the bill do not change the fundamental flaws in the legislation enough to make it worthy of your support. Harmful tax cuts are retained, and the bill would not do anything to reduce costs or to prevent Americans from losing health insurance—in fact, this bill would make those problems worse. The American Health Care Act is a harmful piece of legislation that does not solve the problems in our current health insurance system. Despite amendments, the costs of this bill would still be borne by working families, making health care less affordable and less accessible. The United Steelworkers strongly opposes the AHCA and we urge you to vote against it. Sincerely, LEOW. G ERARD , International President.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 12.5 million working people represented by the AFL–CFO, I urge you to oppose the American Health Care Act (AHCA, H.R. 1628). In a stunning fashion, this bill takes health coverage away from about 24 million people while providing massive tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations. No one in good conscience can support this legislation. It is important to understand what is driving Republicans to pursue a massive roll back in health coverage. While it is packaged as health care reform, a straightforward look at this legislation shows that it is fundamentally designed to pare back public commitments to health coverage in order to benefit the wealthy. House Speaker Paul Ryan publically boasted that the AHCA is a ‘‘trillion dollar tax cut’’ that will benefit corporations and pave the way for further tax ‘‘reform.’’ He made clear that repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) taxes is a major aim of the bill. The tax cuts, however, largely go to higher earners and corporations. The one ACA tax left intact is the only one that predominantly impacts working people—the socalled ‘‘Cadillac’’ tax on workplace health benefits. There are terrible human costs to this upward redistribution of wealth. Millions of individuals will again face the dilemma of choosing between getting lifesaving medical treatment and meeting their families’ basic financial needs. The AHCA replaces ACA subsidies that support a minimum level of coverage with tax credits so small that at least 3 million people will be unable to afford coverage in the individual market, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Millions more will find that they can only afford skimpy coverage that will leave them exposed to substantial costs should they face major sickness, undoubtedly increasing the number of medical bankruptcies. The bill allows insurers to require that seniors in the individual market pay five times as much in premiums as younger adults, imposing an ‘‘age tax.’’ The bill also decimates Medicaid, ending the program as we know it—placing seniors, people with disabilities, and children in jeopardy of losing access to care. The AHCA slashes the program by $839 billion dollars over ten years, and CBO estimates that these cuts will result in 14 million people losing their coverage. In using the program as a 
piggy bank, without efforts to improve the services it provides, the AHCA manages to shift resources away from many of the nation’s most vulnerable people as part of its redistribution project. Medicare is not spared either. The bill pulls approximately $77 billion from the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to provide a tax cut to the wealthy, shortening the lifespan of the fund. An additional $28 billion is extracted from Medicare’s trust fund for outpatient medical services, to provide a tax break for pharmaceutical companies. Employerbased health insurance, the nation’s major source of coverage, also gets hit. The AHCA preserves the socalled ‘‘Cadillac’’ tax on workplace health coverage that will impact more than 42 percent of large employer plans when it goes into effect. Economists predict the tax will cause employers to hollowout the coverage provided in their plans, exposing workers to higher outofpocket costs, such as deductibles and copays. In some cases, employers are expected to drop coverage altogether. The bill also eliminates the penalty that employers face when they do not comply with the ACA’s employer shared responsibility requirements. 030 estimates that seven million people will lose employerbased coverage under the AHCA. These sacrifices in health coverage finance stunning tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations. The legislation provides the 400 highestincome households with an average annual tax cut of $7 million each. Large corporations see impressive windfalls. The AHCA gives insurance companies alone $145 billion in tax relief, while medical device makers get $20 billion, and pharmaceutical companies benefit by paying less into Medicare. The reasons for opposing this legislation, which sacrifices health coverage for millions to support tax cuts for the few, are clear. We hope you stand with working people when you make your choice. Sincerely, WILLIAM SAMUEL , Director, Government Affairs Department. 
OFTEAMSTERS , May 4, 2017. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 1.4 million members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and their families, I urge you to vote no on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) today. The Teamsters have long opposed proposals to tax worker health benefits and this legislation retains the 40 percent excise tax on high quality health care plans which would ultimately reduce the health benefits that hard working Americans receive and increase their out of pocket costs. The amendments added to the bill do nothing to allay Teamster concerns nor address the fundamental flaws of the underlying bill. The amendments make the bill worse than before by opening the door to the erosion or elimination of minimum coverage and preexisting condition protections and by allowing insurers to charge older adults much higher premiums. It does not change the fact that the millions of American families will lose health insurance. Congress should be looking for ways to strengthen the middle class instead of promoting policies that will ultimately take money from their hard earned paychecks and reduce, and make more costly, the health care benefits they receive. The American Health Care Act remains fatally flawed Accordingly, I call on you to oppose and vote no on the American Health Care Act when it comes to the floor today. Sincerely, JAMES P. H OFFA , General President. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, this is not how Washington is supposed to work. We are supposed to improve the lives of hardworking people. Instead, this reckless and dangerous TrumpCare bill would undermine both the health and the economic security of millions of Americans, people like Emily Carlson. Emily is a smallbusiness owner and mother of two from rural Abingdon, Illinois. She lives with MS, a lifelong and very expensive preexisting condition. Before healthcare reform, Emily and her husband, Kevin, a farmer, often had to sit around the table at night, go over their bills, and decide between sickness or debt from one month to the next. If this bill passes, that is a choice they are going to have to face once again. For families like the Carlsons, TrumpCare means higher costs, fewer choices, and worse coverage. TrumpCare is a bad deal for Americans, but it is devastating for rural Americans. Right now, there are nearly 700 rural hospitals at risk of closure. This bill will pull the plug on far too many of them, killing thousands of jobs and ripping the economic heart out of small towns across our Nation. It is time to put hardworking families first. Do the right thing, and vote against this bill. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. SHEAPORTER). (Ms. SHEAPORTER asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the American Cancer Society, which states cancer patients and survivors need affordable, accessible insurance coverage with no preexisting condition exclusions or annual and lifetime caps and that highrisk pools have failed to meet these basic needs. 
AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY  CANCER ACTION NETWORK , Washington, DC, May 3, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) is deeply concerned about the reports of additional amendments to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), including one that would allegedly add $8 billion in new spending for state highrisk pools. This amendment is particularly egregious because it would further incent states to apply for waivers from currentlaw market rules that protect patients with preexisting conditions. Historically, state highrisk pools have fallen short of providing coverage of prevention, treatment and followup care for cancer patients and survivors. Segmenting people with cancer and other serious illnesses away from the private marketplace and into high risk pools absent an adequate and permanent source of public funding has never been an adequate solution. Between 1976 and 2010, 35 states created highrisk pools to cover individuals who could not otherwise purchase insurance in the private market, usually because of a pre existing condition. Every one of those risk pools experienced net operating losses year after year. Furthermore, highrisk pools did not result in lower premiums. All of them set premiums above the nongroup market average or standard rate in the state, usually by 150–200 percent. Only a few states provided additional premium assistance for low income individuals, leaving many who could not afford premiums priced out of the program. Most states also imposed waiting periods before covering preexisting conditions. An individual with a prior cancer diagnosis often had to wait 6–12 months before the highrisk pool would cover the costs associated with cancer treatment or followup survivorship care. Most states imposed limitations on coverage with either lifetime or annual limits. And most plans offered deductibles of $1,000 or higher. Neither AHCA, nor the new amendment would fully protect patients from any of those conditions. Cancer patients and survivors need insurance coverage that is affordable, readily accessible, and protects them from preexisting condition exclusions, annual and lifetime caps on coverage and extraordinary outof pocket costs. Past experience has shown that highrisk pools failed to meet these basic needs, yet still were a drain on state budgets. As we have indicated in our earlier letters, there are reasonable fixes that could be made to the current law. We stand ready to work with you to develop policies that improve the law and encourage a robust health insurance market that provides affordable and comprehensive coverage options. Sincerely, CHRISTOPHER W. H ANSEN , President. 
Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this cruel bill on behalf of my constituents, especially those it would hurt the most: people with preexisting conditions, older Americans, veterans, and lower income people. If this bill passes, we will go back to the days when people with preexisting conditions could be denied coverage or charged more, when insurers could decide whether or not to cover basic care like hospitalization, and when sick babies might hit their insurer’s lifetime coverage limit before they could even walk. Under this bill, older Americans will pay more. In fact, Americans aged 50 to 64 would pay premiums five times higher than others. Veterans will lose access to tax credits that make private coverage affordable, and lower income people will be hurt. Taking away Medicaid expansion would put affordable coverage out of reach for millions and set us back in the fight against the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis. Instead of this cruel bill, let’s come together to improve health care, not take health insurance away from millions just to give tax credits to the wealthiest. We are better than that. 
Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to myself. The American Health Care Act has gone through many fits and starts over the last few months. This bill begins to fulfill our promise to the American people by reducing costs for American families. It eliminates ObamaCare’s burdens on small businesses and families and protects those with preexisting conditions. We must continue to work to build on this. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), our majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for yielding, but, more importantly, I thank Congresswoman DIANE BLACK for more than four decades as a nurse, for caring for the sick, for her passion for the unborn, and for her work on this legislation. Now, Mr. Speaker, Americans are a practical people. We know that we can have fair health care that helps those who need it without trapping everyone in a governmentrun system dreamed up by Washington’s central planners. Now, contrary to our freedom, ObamaCare forced the American people to purchase insurance. Contrary to our wellbeing, ObamaCare imposed taxes we cannot bear. Contrary to what is responsible and right, ObamaCare made Medicaid unsustainable for the people most in need. And contrary to common sense, ObamaCare regulations continued to drive up the cost of insurance beyond what people can afford. You want to know how ObamaCare is working? Just read this week’s papers. Now, let me take you all the way back to yesterday. This is the headline: ‘‘Medica, the last insurer selling individual health policies in most of Iowa, likely to exit.’’ Now, 94 of the 99 counties will have no insurer in Iowa. Ninetyfour of the 94 counties in Iowa will have no insurer. Here is another headline from yesterday: ‘‘Aetna will exit ObamaCare markets in Virginia in 2018.’’ Humana left the ObamaCare exchanges. Blue Cross left Nebraska. United Healthcare left all but a handful of markets this year. Mr. Speaker, we have roughly 3,000 counties in all of America. Onethird, 1,022, only have one provider. Soon, more counties will have none. So do you know what doesn’t cover preexisting conditions? A healthcare system that doesn’t have coverage. No options means no coverage. That is the road ObamaCare is leading us down, and doing nothing leaves too many Americans out in the cold. Now, Mr. Speaker, we will not stand for that. We tried the ObamaCare way. It is failing remarkably, and the American people are demanding a change. Now we have a chance to do something great. We could have care without control, stability without centralization, and support without mandates. We have a chance to listen to the American people and repeal and replace ObamaCare. The American Health Care Act will repeal the individual and employer mandates. It will repeal ObamaCare taxes. It will repeal ObamaCare rules. It will repeal ObamaCare subsidies. And it will do what is right by stopping taxpayer funding for abortion providers and by refocusing Medicaid on those who most need it. We replace all of that with a system that protects those with preexisting conditions. Mr. Speaker, I heard a lot about this bill, and this bill is not 2,000 pages. It is less than 130. But, Mr. Speaker, I have heard things on this floor that are not true. So let me state it one more time. We will replace all that with a system that protects those with preexisting conditions and then reduces premiums through the triedandtrue process of fair competition. As the price of insurance decreases, we give those who still can’t quite afford it a step up through tax credits and expanded health savings accounts. This is fundamental and structural reform. Now, Mr. Speaker, since I have had the honor to stand on this floor and serve in this House, this body has done many good things. We have stood time and again for what was best for our country, struggling against other branches for so long. Many times that required us to dig in our heels and stop something terrible. It is good to stop bad things from happening, but it is great to make good things happen. Finally, after years of waiting, we have the chance to do something good today. This bill is not perfect. No bill could be. The question is not: Why can’t it be made perfect? The question is: Do we retreat or do we act? Do we take this great leap to repeal and replace ObamaCare, extend a hand to our fellow citizens most in need and break free from Washington control, or do we continue to wait for a day that is already here in the hope of a better day that may never come? We were not sent here to wait. We are called to action. This is our opportunity. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to read another day of headlines of more people going without insurance, without insurance without preexisting conditions, without coverage. Today we will do something good. That is why today we will act. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for this bill could take away protections for preexisting conditions from almost 6 million people in California who would have access to coverage. Those with diabetes could see their premiums go up by $5,000 a year. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRIST) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. (Mr. CRIST asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible bill. This bill will cut 24 million Americans out of health insurance. This bill will gut Planned Parenthood in the first year, affecting women across the country. And it will cut $850 billion out of Medicaid hurting the poor and the disabled in our country. It is unconscionable. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman from Virginia yielding for the purpose of debate? Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. No. Just for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is engaging in debate. The time of the gentleman will be deducted. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Would the Speaker advise how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 31⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, and I include in the RECORD a statement of the American Hospital Association against the bill. I just want to say this bill can have a very simple slogan: American people are going to pay more and get less. That is what this bill does. 
STATEMENT ON THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT (By Rick Pollack, President and CEO, American Hospital Association, April 27, 2017) The latest version of the AHCA continues to put health coverage in jeopardy for many Americans. Our top concern is what this change could mean for older and sicker patients, including those with preexisting conditions, such as cancer patients and those with chronic conditions. For these reasons, along with our previously stated concerns about the AHCA, we cannot support the bill. However, we urge Congress to continue to work with stakeholders on a solution that provides meaningful coverage. The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen the bill. The changes included put consumer protections at greater risk by allowing states to waive the essential health benefit standards, which could leave patients without access to critical health services and increase outofpocket spending. This could allow plans to set premium prices based on individual risk for some consumers, which could significantly raise costs for those with preexisting conditions. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has not yet scored the amendment. However, CBO previously projected that the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer people covered in 2026. It is unlikely this amendment would improve these coverage estimates. As the backbone of America’s health safetynet, hospitals and health systems must protect access to care for those who need it and ensure that the most vulnerable patients are not left behind. The AHCA continues to fall far short of that goal. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to make one point: It is most shameful to take $882 billion out of Medicaid to help the poor— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not making a unanimous consent request. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia.—and give it to the wealthy. That is the wrong thing to do. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not recognized. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, would the Speaker advise again how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 3
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄4minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ). Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Republican’s paymoreforless healthcare plan. I often repeat the 1966 observation of Martin Luther King, Jr., that, of all the inequalities that exist, the injustice in health care is the most egregious and inhumane. On the day it was passed, I observed that the Affordable Care Act is the Civil Rights Act of the 21st century. Repealing the Affordable Care Act would be inhumane and put egregious forms of discrimination back into our healthcare delivery system. My Republican colleagues and President Trump have promised more coverage and less cost for everyone. However, this plan would allow all States to eliminate essential health benefits, such as maternity and newborn coverage, prescription drugs, hospitalization, emergency coverage, and mental health services. It would also allow States to tax older Americans five times more than younger Americans. Republicans are reneging on their promise to protect Americans with preexisting conditions. Without essential health benefits standards, protections for those with preexisting conditions will exist in name only. Repeal of the essential health benefits would drive a race to the bottom, with insurers dropping coverage for everything from chemotherapy to high cost drugs. It would precipitate a proliferation of junk policies that have historically plagued unsuspecting lowincome communities for years. People with preexisting conditions who need these and other costly services would not be able to find the coverage they need at any price, much less an affordable one. We took a giant step away from this with the ACA, but this Republican bill takes us back to that era where people with preexisting conditions are left in the cold. Adding money to a State slush fund is not a solution. Repealing the ACA would, once again, institutionalize inhumanity and egregiousness. b1330 Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the Democratic leader, for our closing statement. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him, Congressman SCOTT, I thank FRANK PALLONE , J OHN YARMUTH , RITCHIE NEAL, our ranking members, who have done such excellent work on this debate on the values of our country. Mr. Speaker, our colleague, Mr. CLYBURN , began his remarks quoting Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, and I want to join him. I think those words bear repeating. Over 50 years ago, Dr. King said: ‘‘Of all of the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and the most inhumane because it often results in physical death.’’ We come to the floor with the moral force of Dr. Martin Luther King’s words in our hearts: Affordable health care is a civil right, a fundamental right for every person in our country, not just the privileged few. And so, in the spirit of Mr. CLYBURN  and Dr. King, let us be prayerful about how we go forward on this very personal issue about the wellbeing of every person in our country. Speaker RYANonce called this bill an act of mercy. There is no mercy here. Indeed, inequality and inhumanity is exactly what TrumpCare has in store for the American people. But when he said it is an act of mercy, here is what others said. From the beginning, TrumpCare was a moral monstrosity that will devastate seniors, children, and hardworking Americans. That was from me. But don’t take it from me. Sister Simone Campbell said: This is not the faithful way forward and must be rejected. The Catholic Health Association wrote: We strongly encourage the full House to reject this replacement bill. And the United Methodist Church, opposing TrumpCare, this is what they said: People will die because of efforts like this to roll back health care. Lutheran Services in America said: TrumpCare will jeopardize the health care and longterm services and supports of millions of Americans. The Episcopal Church said: TrumpCare falls woefully short of our spiritual calling to care for the least of these, as well as the noble values upon which our great Nation was founded. And all that was said before the Republicans decided to destroy the protections of Americans with preexisting conditions. I grant our Republican friends their position. I respect them and their constituents who sent them here. But I reject the wrong priorities in TrumpCare—tax cuts for the rich at the expense of the health insurance for tens of millions of working families across America. TrumpCare very clearly spotlights the differences in priorities between Democrats and Republicans in Congress. It has stepped forward in the longstanding Republican belief that Medicare should wither on the vine, that Medicaid should be shrunken, and that Social Security should be privatized. If you believe in the health and well being of the American people, you must reject this bill before us now. It is what TrumpCare—here is what it means to the American people. You know, much has been said about policy here today and over time. Much has been said about politics, what are the politics of this. What is really important is what this means to the American people. And they know they are listening. They know what it means to them. It means, TrumpCare does, it forces families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, increasing outofpocket costs. Higher costs. Less coverage. TrumpCare will take away health care from more than 24 million hardworking Americans. A crushing age tax. TrumpCare forces Americans aged 50 to 64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are. It steals from Medicare. TrumpCare shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund and ransacks funds that seniors depend on to get longterm care they need. That is why it is consistent with their wither on the vine for Medicare philosophy. And then, if that were not bad enough, and they couldn’t pass their bill because it was that bad, they moved further away from the American people by gutting key protections. TrumpCare eviscerates essential health benefits such as maternity care, prescription drugs, emergency coverage, prenatal care, and guts protections for Americans with preexisting medical conditions. As bad as TrumpCare was the first time around, you know, it was dead. It died. It died right here on the floor. Now it has come back to life like a zombie, even more scary than before, and it is even worse. If Republicans had their way, Americans with preexisting conditions will be pushed off their insurance and segregated into highrisk pools, where they will face soaring costs, worse coverage, and restricted care. TrumpCare means huge premium increases. It is a frightening future for families who need affordable, dependable care the most. Now, on the floor, the Republicans have recklessly, and some would say fraudulently, claimed that TrumpCare covers Americans with preexisting conditions. It does not. As Robert Graboyes at the conservative Mercatus Center said about the Upton amendment: ‘‘. . . the $8 billion amount is a pittance. Spread over 5 years, it is a fifth of a pittance.’’ As Karen Pollitz from the Kaiser Family Foundation said, the Upton 
amendment will cover the costs for only 1 percent of the individual market. Others have given it up to 5 percent; 1 to 5 percent. Does that mean covering? No. Forcing a vote without a CBO score shows that the Republicans are afraid of the facts. They are afraid of learning the full consequences of their plan to push Americans with preexisting conditions into the cold or, as my colleague from New York said, off the sidewalk. If Republicans thought they were really protecting people, they wouldn’t be afraid of the facts. But they are also afraid of the truth, and the truth that would come forth if we knew the facts. And they are afraid that the American people would find out that this is not a healthcare bill, this is a tax bill disguised as a health bill. This is a bill that is one of the biggest transfers of wealth from the middle class to the richest people and corporations in America. This is a tax bill not a healthcare bill. That is why they have to do it now so they can get on with their tax bill. But the suffering TrumpCare will inflict on the sick is all too clear. That is why this disastrous bill has been condemned by the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, AIDS United, the Children’s Hospital Association, AARP, the March of Dimes. The list goes on and on—the American Cancer Society. Instead of reading all of these pages, I include them for the RECORD . 
Trumpcare—pulled from the House Floor by Speaker Paul Ryan on March 24—already meant higher health costs, more than 24 million Americans losing their health coverage, gutting key protections, a crushing Age Tax, and stealing from Medicare. Amazingly, Republicans have managed to make Trumpcare even worse. The MacArthur Amendment would completely gut the protections for people with preexisting conditions by allowing states to waive essential health benefits and community rating rules, which prevent insurers from charging people with preexisting conditions more. This will make it all but impossible for millions of Americans fighting illness to afford the coverage they desperately need. As seen below, over the last few days, the number of health care, consumer, seniors, children, disability and other groups that are speaking out against Trumpcare continues to grow. A Coalition of Patient Advocacy Groups, Including American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Lung Association, American Diabetes Association, and March of Dimes: ‘‘In March, our patient advocacy organizations collectively urged Congress to ensure that any changes made to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) provide affordable, accessible and adequate coverage and do not result in a loss of coverage for any Americans. The AHCA would do the opposite, causing at least 24 million Americans to lose health insurance, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. . . . We are alarmed by recent harmful changes to AHCA . . . These changes include allowing states to waive the requirement for essential health benefits . . . Another change allows states to waive protections against health status rating. Weakening these rules would enable insurers to charge higher prices to people with preexisting conditions, possibly making insurance unaffordable for those who need it most.. . . The individuals and families we represent cannot go back to a time when people with preexisting conditions could be denied coverage or forced to choose between purchasing basic necessities and affording their health care coverage. Given these factors, we oppose the latest draft of the AHCA. We urge Members of Congress to reject this legislation.’’ [5/1/17] American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women’s Health, National Partnership for Women & Families: ‘‘Rather than support recent gains in women’s access to healthcare and coverage, the MacArthur Amendment and AHCA turn back the clock and reverse hardwon progress.. . . The MacArthur Amendment would enable states to waive EHBs including those for maternity and newborn care, preventive services, and services for mental health and substance use disorders; [and] to waive community rating rules. . . . Supporters of the bill claim this bill maintains protections for those with preexisting conditions, but allowing states to waive coverage of EHB and charge people more based on their health status renders the promise of coverage for preexisting conditions to be meaningless. . . . Women and families must not be made to suffer, lose access to care and coverage, and pay higher healthcare costs.. . . The AHCA and the MacArthur Amendment turn the clock back on women’s health and should not move forward.’’ [5/1/17] Association of American Medical Colleges: ‘‘This week, the House could vote on a new version of the American Health Care Act that includes the MacArthur amendment. . . . The [MacArthur] amendment’s treatment of essential health benefits and health status underwriting dilutes protections for many Americans and would leave individuals with preexisting conditions facing higher premiums and reduced access to care. The shortcomings in the underlying bill remain the same. The original analysis from the Congressional Budget Office indicated that 14 million Americans would lose their health insurance coverage as early as next year, and as many as 24 million by 2024. Nothing in the bill has changed that alters the fact that this legislation would lead to fewer Americans with quality insurance, less affordable coverage for those who have it, and the destabilization of the current Medicaid program.’’ [5/2/17] Children’s Hospital Association: ‘‘On behalf of our nation’s children’s hospitals and the patients and families they serve, Children’s Hospital Association (CHA) continues to oppose the newly modified American Health Care Act (AHCA) and strongly urges the House of Representatives to reject the bill. Recently adopted changes only worsen the AHCA by putting children with preexisting conditions at increased risk of losing health care coverage and failing to correct the Medicaid cuts that would impact over 30 million kids. . . . The block grant option in particular would be devastating to children as it eliminates Medicaid’s EPSDT (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment) benefit which ensures children receive immunizations, mental health assessments and vision, eye and hearing exams as well as other medical services they might need. CHA urgently asks members of Congress to vote against the AHCA.’’ [4/27/17] Children’s Leadership Council: ‘‘The Children’s Leadership Council opposes the American Health Care Act (AHCA) because it would jeopardize health care for millions of babies, children, youth and families. We urge you to vote NO on this legislation. . . . The ACHA’s changes to Medicaid would radically restructure a program that has worked for more than 50 years to support children’s health. The Medicaid cap would shift $839 billion to states, forcing them to cut eligibility, benefits, or provider rates that could have disastrous health consequences. There is no question that the massive cuts to Medicaid, increased premiums likely for millions of families, and eliminating the Essential Health Benefits requirements under current law will seriously harm children and families. . . . This legislation is a dangerous step backward.’’ [5/1/17] Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities: ‘‘The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is strongly opposed to the amended American Health Care Act. The amended American Health Care Act retains the original bill’s proposals to dramatically cut Medicaid services that are vital to people with disabilities and seniors through per capita caps, which CCD has opposed. . . . The newest amendments to the American Health Care Act make the bill even more harmful to people with disabilities. The new amendments would allow states to easily obtain waivers that would allow them to charge higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions, including people with disabilities. They would also allow states to seek waivers from the Affordable Care Act’s requirement to provide essential health benefits, including services for people with disabilities . . . We urge you to oppose the bill should it come to a vote.’’ [4/28/17] National Education Association: ‘‘Apparently, snatching health care coverage from children and families was not enough for House Republican leaders and the Trump administration. To make a terrible bill even worse, a new amendment to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) would allow states to jettison existing essential health benefit requirements and permit insurance companies to charge people with preexisting conditions more than they charge healthy people. . . . If the AHCA and new amendment are enacted, millions of kids and families would effectively lose the health care coverage they need. The new amendment also threatens to make insurance for people with preexisting conditions prohibitively expensive.’’ [4/27/17] American Society of Clinical Oncology: ‘‘On behalf of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), I write to express our strong opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), as currently amended. . . . Studies show that when cancer patients do not have adequate insurance they receive less care, receive it later, and have worse outcomes than those with better insurance coverage. . . . The AHCA as currently constructed will create or worsen barriers to care. It will add costs to the system, decrease access to appropriate treatment and increase existing disparities of care. We are especially concerned with provisions allowing state waivers that could erode important protections for people with cancer, including preexisting condition safeguards, coverage of essential services, and access to affordable health insurance. . . . ASCO strongly opposes passage of the AHCA in its current form.’’ [4/27/17] American Thoracic Society: ‘‘On behalf of the 16,000 members of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), I want to voice my grave concerns with the latest legislative proposal developed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). . . . The ATS opposes any 
legislation that does not ensure affordable health insurance coverage for Americans currently insured under the ACA. We are concerned that allowing states to waive important insurance reforms in the Affordable Care Act will lead to reduced coverage for many Americans and significant price increases for patients with preexisting conditions. Further, we are concerned that reliance on ‘‘high risk pools’’ will not adequately meet the health insurance needs of many Americans with preexisting conditions. We note that previous attempts at implementing statebased high risk pools have been largely unsuccessful. Members of the ATS serve a large and diverse patient population, including patients with respiratory diseases, critical illnesses and sleep disorders such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, sepsis and obstructive sleep apnea. Our patients cannot afford to lose affordable health insurance coverage for any period of time.’’ [4/27/ 17] Lutheran Services in America: ‘‘Lutheran Services in America continues to oppose the drastic and unnecessary restructure of the Medicaid guarantee to a per capita cap system as proposed in the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Furthermore, we oppose the bill’s new provisions that eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions as these provisions would be devastating to people with chronic diseases and disabilities. . . . In addition, the modified bill maintains the AHCA’s drastic cuts and fundamental restructuring of the Medicaid program, shifting significant risks and costs to states, and to the people who need and provide Medicaid services. . . . Lutheran Services in America respectfully urges members of Congress to reject this or any legislation that would erode Medicaid, increase the number of uninsured and/or decrease protections for preexisting conditions.’’ [4/28/17] Planned Parenthood Federation of America: ‘‘The latest Republican proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act is the worst legislation for women’s health in a lifetime. It eliminates the community rating provision, allowing insurers to charge people with pre existing conditions an exorbitant amount for coverage. Despite the fact that the proposal claims to maintain the current prohibition on gender rating, it still allows insurers to once again discriminate against women and charge more for being a woman. Eliminating the community rating provision disproportionately affects women, since insurers can claim having given birth, having had a Csection, or having been a survivor of domestic violence is a socalled preexisting condition. For example, a woman who had breast cancer could be charged more than $28,000 per year for coverage and a woman who was previously pregnant could be charged more than $17,000 per year for . . . They took a bad bill that would result in 24 million people losing their insurance and higher premiums and actually made it worse. [4/27/17] Federal AIDS Policy Partnership: ‘‘The undersigned 77 organizations are writing to strongly urge you to oppose the amended American Health Care Act (AHCA) on behalf of the 24 million or more Americans estimated to lose coverage, including tens of thousands of people with HIV. . . . Healthcare coverage can be a life or death issue for people living with HIV, and in the three years that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage has been available it has made a critical difference. . . . We cannot afford to go back to the pre ACA sick care system that focused on treating disability and disease rather than preventing it. Please support access to healthcare coverage for the more than 52 million Americans living with preexisting conditions, including 1.1 million living with HIV. We hope we can count on you to oppose the amended American Health Care Act.’’ [5/ 1/17] AIDS United: ‘‘AIDS United seeks a health care system that will eventually enable the end of HIV in the United States. AHCA makes major changes to the U.S. health care system that would, if passed, worsen the provision of HIV prevention services for people at risk for HIV and the treatment and care for people living with HIV. . . . AIDS United is especially concerned that the [MacArthur] amendment, far from improving the situation, will make it easier for insurance companies to raise rates on people living with HIV, people with other chronic conditions and the elderly. . . . AIDS United notes that thanks to Congress’s strong response over many years, the U.S. has made substantial progress in responding to the HIV epidemic. However, doing so requires a strong health care system that can ensure that people living with HIV are able to access care and treatment . . . H.R. 1628 will reverse some of the gains that we have made in ensuring coverage for both prevention and treatment. AIDS United urges you to decide to vote no and publicly state your position prior to any vote.’’ [4/28/17] American College of NurseMidwives: ‘‘On behalf of the American College of NurseMidwives, . . . we strongly urge the House of Representatives to vote NO on the revised American Health Care Act (ACHA). The legislation, in its current form, would further impeded access to healthcare and coverage for millions of women and newborns. Midwives stand for improving access to quality care and coverage for women and newborns . . . including, but not limited to, coverage and access to a full range of preventative, reproductive and sexual health services under state Medicaid programs and coverage and access to essential health benefits (EHBs), including maternity and newborn care. The newlyrevised AHCA language will end this guarantee and radically turn back the clock on the progress made in women’s health. Specifically, the ‘‘MacArthur Amendment’’ would enable states to apply for the ability to waive EHBs, including those for maternity and newborn care, to waive community rating rules, and to shift patient with preexisting conditions or illnesses into high risk pools. These provisions, if adopted, could have dire consequences for women’s health and health coverage.’’ [4/27/17] AARP: ‘‘This harmful legislation still puts an Age Tax on older Americans and puts vulnerable populations at risk through a series of backdoor deals that attempt to shift responsibility to states. Older Americans need affordable health care services and prescriptions. This legislation still goes in the opposite direction, increasing insurance premiums for older Americans and not doing anything to lower drug costs. AARP continues to oppose legislation that would impose an Age Tax, eliminate protections for preexisting conditions, weaken Medicare, erode seniors’ ability to live independently because of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts, and give sweetheart deals to drug and insurance companies while doing nothing to lower the cost of health care or prescription drugs. We intend to let all 38 million of our members know exactly how their Representative votes on this bill in newsletters, in our publications, on social media and in other formats.’’ [4/26/17] American Medical Association: ‘‘After reviewing the MacArthur Amendment to H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the American Medical Association (AMA) remains opposed to passage of this legislation. As we have previously stated, we are deeply concerned that the AHCA would result in millions of Americans losing their current health insurance coverage. Nothing in the MacArthur amendment remedies the shortcomings of the underlying bill. The MacArthur Amendment would allow states to apply for waivers for critical consumer protections provided in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including ....  the requirements that health insurers must cover certain essential health benefits, and the ban on health status underwriting. The current ban on health status underwriting protects individuals from being discriminated against by virtue of their medical conditions. Prior to the passage of the ACA, such individuals were routinely denied coverage and/or priced out of affordable coverage. We are particularly concerned about allowing states to waive this requirement because it will likely lead to patients losing their coverage.’’ [4/27/ 17] American College of Physicians: ‘‘The College strongly believes in the first, do no harm principle. Therefore, we continue to urge that Congress move away from the fundamentally flawed and harmful policies that would result from the American Health Care Act and from the changes under consideration—including the proposed ‘‘Limited Waiver’’ amendment—that would make the bill even worse for patients.’’ [4/24/17] American Hospital Association: ‘‘The latest version of the AHCA continues to put health coverage in jeopardy for many Americans. Our top concern is what this change could mean for older and sicker patients, including those with preexisting conditions, such as cancer patients and those with chronic conditions. For these reasons, along with our previously stated concerns about the AHCA, we cannot support the bill. . . . The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen the bill. The changes included put consumer protections at greater risk by allowing states to waive the essential health benefit standards, which could leave patients without access to critical health services and increase outofpocket spending. This could allow plans to set premium prices based on individual risk for some consumers, which could significantly raise costs for those with preexisting conditions.’’ [4/27/17] America’s Essential Hospitals: ‘‘This latest version of the AHCA is not an improvement. It’s simply bad policy that will cut a lifeline of health care for millions of Americans. The legislation also would leave unchanged more than $800 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade, breaking the nation’s safety net and saddling state, local governments, and taxpayers with new costs for indigent care. The nation has spoken on the AHCA: only 17 percent of the public support it and their elected representatives have rejected it once already.’’ [4/26/17] Catholic Health Association: ‘‘It is critically important to look at this bill for what it is. It is not in any way a health care bill. Rather, it is legislation whose aim is to take significant funding allocated by Congress for health care for very low income people and use that money for tax cuts for some of our wealthiest citizens. This is contrary to the spirit of who we are as a nation, a giant step backward that should be resisted.’’ [4/27/17] U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops: ‘‘It is deeply disappointing to many Americans that, in modifying the American Health Care Act to again attempt a vote, proponents of the bill left in place its serious flaws, including unacceptable modifications to Medicaid that will endanger coverage and affordability for millions of people, according to reports,’’ said Bishop Dewane. ‘‘Sadly, some of the recently proposed amendments—especially those designed to give states flexibility—lack apparent safeguards to ensure quality of care. These additions could severely impact many people with preexisting 
conditions while risking for others the loss of access to various essential coverages.’’ [4/ 27/17] American Nurses Association: ‘‘The new bill is an even further departure from our principles; endangers consumer protections put into place by the ACA. [4/26/17] American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network: ‘‘The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) is deeply concerned about a proposed amendment to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) that would create an option for states to obtain waivers from the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and the community rating rule. These two rules work together to guarantee access to comprehensive and affordable insurance that covers cancer prevention and treatment for patients and survivors with preexisting conditions.. . . In short, the proposal could lead to bare bones coverage plans that push significant costs onto patients who access care.’’ [4/20/17] American Lung Association: ‘‘The American Lung Association requests that Representatives oppose the American Health Care Act (AHCA) with the new amendment by Rep. MacArthur. The American Lung Association opposes the MacArthur amendment because would allow states to optout of the Essential Health Benefits (EHB)—resulting in millions of Americans having inadequate care.. . . All Americans—regardless of the state in which they live—need adequate coverage for the range of essential health services and treatments including lifesaving cancer screening.’’ [4/26/17] March of Dimes: ‘‘Women and children need quality, affordable insurance coverage to be born healthy and lead healthy, productive lives. Unfortunately, in its current form, the MacArthur amendment to American Health Care Act will deny millions of pregnant women, babies, and their families the affordable coverage and quality services they need.. . . The MacArthur amendment will offer states and health plans numerous opportunities to charge people with preexisting conditions higher rates, design plans that explicitly exclude the services they are most likely to need, and erect barriers to care.’’ [4/26/17] Families USA: ‘‘America’s families must be heard. By now, it should be clear to House Republicans and the Trump Administration from all the town halls, letters, phone calls and tweets that this is not what people want. They do not want to return to the dark days when insurers were free to charge the sick and old more for coverage and offered policies that covered very little, often leaving people to cope with staggering medical bills. It’s time for President Trump and the GOP to drop this harmful effort to undermine the nation’s health care system. It’s time to move on.’’ [4/26/17] American Psychological Association: ‘‘We are writing on behalf of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychological Association Practice Organization to express our opposition to the American Health Care Act, as recently revised and proposed for floor consideration. Our organizations comprise nearly 115,700 members and affiliates, who are clinicians, researchers, educators, consultants, and students.’’ [4/26/17] Arc of the United States: ‘‘The Arc of the United States is strongly opposed to the amended American Health Care Act. The amended American Health Care Act retains the original bill’s proposals to dramatically cut Medicaid services that are vital to people with disabilities and seniors through per capita caps. The new amendments make the AHCA even more harmful to people with disabilities.’’ [4/26/17] Chronic Illness and Disability Partnership: ‘‘On behalf of the Chronic Illness and Disability Partnership as well as allied organizations, we are writing to strongly urge you to oppose the American Health Care Act (AHCA), with or without the amendment to allow states to waive community rating and Essential Health Benefits protections (the MacArthur Amendment). If enacted, the amended bill will only increase the 24 million Americans estimated to lose coverage under the AHCA, including millions of individuals living with chronic conditions and disabilities. The MacArthur Amendment seeks to deliver cheaper insurance to healthy Americans by undercutting crucial Essential Health Benefits requirements and excluding the most vulnerable Americans from the private insurance market by allowing states to remove crucial consumer protections.’’ [4/27/ 17] Democratic Governors Association: ‘‘This new proposal is nothing more than the reheated leftovers of the failed Trumpcare bill. Just like last month’s bill, this one would slash Medicaid funding, throw millions out of health coverage and leave states holding the bag. The only fresh idea in this proposal is a new way to raise insurance rates on sick people. States are happy to work with the federal government on strengthening health care, but we never asked for the flexibility to jack up premiums on people with preexisting conditions. Congress should again reject this disastrous proposal that would wreck state budgets and cut millions off of health coverage.’’ [4/27/17] National Nurse United: ‘‘The original version of the American Health Care Act posed a mortal threat to the health and well being of our patients, and to the health security of our country. The new version, which incorporates changes negotiated between the House Freedom Caucus and Congressman Tom MacArthur, will be even worse for our patients. This new version has not yet received a score from the Congressional Budget Office, and it should not be considered by the House until a CBO score has been made public.’’ [4/26/17] Leadership Council of Aging Organizations: ‘‘While LCAO is made up of organizations that often have different perspectives on public policies, as a coalition LCAO strongly opposes the American Health Care Act (AHCA) of 2017, which would cause at least 24 million Americans to lose their health care insurance. We strongly oppose the Medicaid cuts and caps that remain the core of the American Health Care Act. Over six million older adults rely on Medicaid. Among the nonMedicare population, Americans aged 50–64 are the most likely to face health challenges and have preexisting conditions. The AHCA will expose these older Americans to significantly higher premiums and health care costs, if they can afford to purchase coverage at all. We are also deeply disappointed that there is a push to vote on the bill without a revised estimate from the Congressional Budget Office on how it will impact Americans. We fear and expect that the proposed changes will increase the number of uninsured beyond the current estimate of 24 million. For these reasons, as well as other harms that would result for older Americans and their families, LCAO opposes AHCA and urges members to vote against it.’’ Common Sense Kids Action: ‘‘On behalf of the millions of American kids and families who rely on comprehensive, dependable health insurance to stay healthy and to get medical treatment when they need it, we are writing to respectfully express our strong opposition to your bill, H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Thanks to current law, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 95% of young children in the U.S. today have health insurance. That’s a remarkable achievement. However, the AHCA will result in 24 million fewer Americans having coverage, including millions of children. Even with changes recently suggested to your bill, America’s kids will be best served by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid and CHIP, not by repealing the Affordable Care Act and block granting or establishing a per capita cap on Medicaid. We urge you to keep our children’s future foremost in your thinking, withdraw your bill, and work on a bipartisan basis to support measures that protect and strengthen children’s health care.’’ American Hospital Association: ‘‘The latest version of the AHCA continues to put health coverage in jeopardy for many Americans. Our top concern is what this change could mean for older and sicker patients, including those with preexisting conditions, such as cancer patients and those with chronic conditions. For these reasons, along with our previously stated concerns about the AHCA, we cannot support the bill. The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen the bill. The changes included put consumer protections at greater risk by allowing states to waive the essential health benefit standards, which could leave patients without access to critical health services and increase outofpocket spending. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has not yet scored the amendment. However, CBO previously projected that the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer people covered in 2026. As the backbone of America’s health safetynet, hospitals and health systems must protect access to care for those who need it and ensure that the most vulnerable patients are not left behind. The AHCA continues to fall far short of that goal.’’ 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, under TrumpCare, families, seniors, vulnerable children, Americans with disabilities, people struggling to overcome addiction, and the sick will lose their health care. Rural hospitals will be closed. Nearly 2 million jobs will be destroyed across America. Seven million veterans will lose access to tax credits for health care. And all of this, to give a massive tax cut to the richest in America. TrumpCare is a billionaire’s tax cut, again, disguised as a healthcare bill. It is Robin Hood in reverse, one of the largest, again, transfers of wealth from working families to the rich in our country. Today, we honor the visions of our Founders, we can, who risked everything. They risked everything, their lives, their liberty, their sacred honor, to advance the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the life, a healthier life, the freedom to pursue your happiness, the freedom from being joblocked or policylocked because of what the Republicans want to do today. Today, we fight to preserve affordable health care as the right of every American, again, not the privileged few. Today, we fight for children like Zoe Madison Lihn. Zoe was born with a congenital heart defect in May of 2010. She faced her first of three heart surgeries at 15 hours old. By 6 months old, Zoe was halfway to her lifetime limit her insurer had placed on her. She 
faced a grim future, not only using up her lifetime limit by preschool but by carrying a preexisting condition that will require attention and care for the rest of her life. Under the Affordable Care Act, Zoe is protected, but TrumpCare puts her future in danger. I wish that our Members who vote for this bill, I hope you make time to sit down with the parents of a newborn with a heart condition, or a young woman who just learned she had breast cancer, the family of loved ones struggling with a disease or a chronic condition, any of the tens of millions of Americans who are rightfully terrified of what TrumpCare will mean in their lives. Mr. Speaker, we have, with this bill, a right, a wonderful opportunity. This is one of the best civics lessons we can engage in. Because of what happened following the election, the American people are engaged. They are paying attention. I am not saying in a political way, I am saying in a personal way. A former Speaker said: All politics is local. In the case of health care, all politics is personal when it comes to health care. And so, this civics lesson will teach the American people a number of things. As special as we think we are when we come to the floor here, most Americans don’t know who their Member of Congress is. But they will now, when they find out that you voted to take away their health care. They will know when you put an age tax on them, or undermine Medicare and Medicaid and the rest. Oh, yeah, they are paying attention because it is really personal with them and their families. So I think we have to get ready for that. I have Members, I have colleagues who have the mantle of being a moderate. You vote for this bill, you have walked the plank from moderate to radical. And you are walking the plank for what? A bill that will not be accepted by the United States Senate. Why are you doing this? Do you believe in what is in this bill? Some of you have said: Well, they will fix it in the Senate. But you have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead. You will glow in the dark on this one. You will glow in the dark. So don’t walk the plank, especially unnecessarily. Our responsibility to the sick and the hurt is Biblical. It is fundamental to who we are. As Pope Francis said: ‘‘Health is not a consumer good but a universal right, so access to health services cannot be a privilege.’’ Today, let us declare, once again, that affordable health care must be the right of every American, not the privileged few. So I ask you, my colleagues, does TrumpCare lower health costs? Does TrumpCare provide better health care? Does TrumpCare protect seniors and families? Is TrumpCare good for our veterans? Is there any caring in TrumpCare at all? For the sake of our values, to honor our responsibilities to our Founders, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, to our veterans who protect us, and to our children whose aspirations are our guide, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this disastrous TrumpCare bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it really is my privilege now to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. RYAN), the Speaker of the House. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. First off, there are a few people I would like to thank. I would like to thank the committee chairs. I would like to thank Chairman WALDEN , Chairman B RADY , Chairman BLACK , Chairman S ESSIONS . I want to thank the members of those committees: Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, Budget, and Rules. I want to thank all the Members who made constructive contributions throughout this entire deliberative, bottomup organic process. I want to thank the President of the United States for his steadfast leadership. b1345 Mr. Speaker, in his address in this Chamber, he called on Congress to act; and today we take the next step to repeal and replace ObamaCare. I want to thank Vice President PENCE , Secretary Price, Director Mulvaney, and all of their teams. Mr. Speaker, there is a fundamental and urgent choice at the heart of this debate. We can continue with the status quo under ObamaCare, and we know what this looks like. It means even higher premiums, even fewer choices, even more insurance companies pulling out, even more uncertainty, and even more chaos. Look at what has happened in Iowa this week. As is the case in so many areas in this country, Iowa is down to one insurer. That, of course, is not a choice. But now that one insurer is saying that it will have to pull out of 94 of the 99 counties in Iowa. This is happening right now. So tens of thousands of Iowans will go from having one option to no options. That is not a choice. This is a crisis, and it is happening right now. What protection is ObamaCare if there is no healthcare plan to purchase in your State? This is the direction ObamaCare is rapidly heading. So we can continue with this status quo or we can put this collapsing law behind us and end this failed experiment. Let’s make it easier for people to afford their health insurance. Let’s give people more choices and more control over their care. Let’s make insurance companies come in and compete for your business. Let’s return power from Washington to the States. Let’s help give people peace of mind. Let’s put the patient, not bureaucrats, at the center of this system. This bill does all of those things. This bill delivers the promises that we have made to the American people. A lot of us have been waiting 7 years to cast this vote. Many of us are here because we pledged to cast this very vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to rescue people from this collapsing law. Are we going to meet this test? Are we going to be men and women of our word? Are we going to keep the promises that we made? Or are we going to falter? No. After all of this—after seeing what is happening in Iowa and around the country, after seeing this law collapsing while we witness it across the country and knowing all this turmoil that is coming, we will not falter. We will replace; and today is the day that we are going to do this. Today this House has the opportunity to do more than just fulfill a promise. We have the opportunity to raise our gaze and set a bold course for our country. We have the opportunity to show that we have got the resolve to tackle the big challenges in this country before they tackle us; to stop the drift of arrogant, Big Government policies in our lives, and to begin a new era of reform based on liberty and selfdetermination, giving people choices and letting them control their own destinies. That is the day that is before us right here. So let us pass this bill to take the next step to put ObamaCare behind us; let us pass this bill to build a better healthcare system for American families; and let us pass this bill to leave this country better than we found it because that is why we are here. That is what is at stake today. That is why I am going to be so proud to cast my vote for this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the Republicans’ latest version of Trumpcare. Trumpcare will cover fewer people, provide weaker protections, and result in higher costs. Trumpcare will eviscerate essential health benefits and protections for preexisting conditions and make it all but impossible for millions of Americans fighting illness to afford the health coverage they desperately need. Trumpcare will mean higher costs for less coverage. It will result in 24 million hardworking Americans losing health coverage. It will destroy protections for Americans with preexisting conditions and gut Essential Health Benefits, such as maternity, prescription drug coverage, and emergency coverage. 
Trumpcare will create a crushing age tax— it will force Americans aged 50–64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are. Mr. Speaker, healthcare should be a right for all, not just the privileged few. I will vote against Trumpcare and urge all my colleagues to vote no. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in strong opposition to H.R. 1628, which is a bill to take away health care from 24 million Americans. Whether you believe it or not, health care is a basic right. This shameful bill steals from the most vulnerable among us, including seniors, veterans, people living with HIV, children, and the disabled. And this new bill is even more dangerous and destructive than when they brought it to the Floor last time. It would, yes, rip away health care from 24 million people. It would reduce benefits, make families pay more for less, and transfer $600 billion in tax cuts to the very wealthy. This is outrageous. Access to women’s health is denied by defunding Planned Parenthood. Medicaid, as we know it, will end. Healthcare costs for working families and seniors will skyrocket. It allows states to eliminate essential health benefits like maternity care, cancer screenings, and emergency care. Mr. Speaker, this is not a health bill at all. This is a massive tax giveaway to the wealthy. Let me tell you, as a woman of faith, I am appalled and I am saddened by the hypocrisy displayed in this bill by people who say they are religious. I want to remind you—in the Scriptures, the Book of Mark, chapter 12:31, we are reminded to love your neighbor as yourself. I hope Republicans remember to love their neighbor as themselves today and vote ‘‘no’’ on this meanspirited, evil and morally bankrupt bill. This is a matter of life and death, and the American people deserve better. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, first of all, the Affordable Healthcare Act is the best thing that has happened to healthcare in the U.S. since the mid 1960’s when Congress passed Medicare and Medicaid. More than twenty million people in our country have health insurance coverage now who never had it before. In Illinois, 36 percent of children receive coverage through Medicaid with approximately 3.1 million people covered overall. There are 649,000 Illinoisans enrolled under the Affordable Care Act, this bill AHCA would repeal and replace the ACA. Implementation of the AHCA will lead to a loss of coverage for 24 million people nationwide. Overall 44,296 Illinoisans covered under the ACA and 252,612 covered under Medicaid expansion will be in danger of curtailed coverage. Healthcare professionals and activists have worked hard over the past fifty years to improve healthcare access and delivery and it would be a shame to have us go backwards. Passage of the AHCA would probably cause real estate taxes in Cook County to go up in order to keep Stroger Hospital and its other health services adequately funded to meet the health needs of the medically indigent in Cook County. Practically every professional healthcare group in America is opposed to the AHCA. It will spell disaster for residents of Illinois. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have rushed this bill to the floor before they even had a chance to print the text, let alone get a CBO score. They are pushing this bill through without any analysis so that the American people won’t know how terrible this bill really is—how many millions of people will lose their health insurance, how much premiums will skyrocket for those with preexisting conditions, how little money they will actually save. And all to score empty political points or to impress Donald Trump, a man who has demonstrated again and again that he does not know or care what is in this bill, and just wants to ‘‘win.’’ This bill is the same terrible legislation the Republicans failed to pass in March, but with amendments to make it even more cruel to the American people. The bill will kick 24 million people off their health insurance and eliminate employerprovided coverage for seven million people. The bill creates an ‘‘age tax’’ that would allow insurers to charge older Americans five times as much as a younger person for the same plan. The bill raises premiums 30 percent for people who allow their insurance to lapse for any reason. The bill cuts $880 billion out of Medicad and forces states to ration care to the millions of families and children who rely on it, in clear violation of Donald Trump’s campaign pledge. The bill gives the wealthiest Americans a trillion dollar tax cut and cuts taxes on drug companies and health insurance companies that pay their CEOs more than $500,000. But that bill wasn’t terrible enough to get the votes of the right wing of the Republicans in the House, so the Republicans made it even crueler. The amendments the Republicans will add today allow states to waive the essential health benefits requirements for insurance plans, meaning you could lose coverage for services as basic as hospital stays, prescription drugs, or doctor visits. States will also be able to waive the guarantee against discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. Of course, the Republicans are saying that insurance companies cannot deny people coverage, but insurers will be able to charge people whatever they want. The Center for American Progress estimates that premiums could increase by over $36,000 per year for people diagnosed with breast cancer. Pregnancy will result in a $17,000 increase in premiums. Asthma, a $4,000 increase. The high risk pools Republicans are touting will do nothing to protect people by sequestering the sickest Americans in pools and then drastically underfunding them. The Republicans are hiding from these numbers behind the socalled Upton Amendment, which provides a paltry $8 billion to cover some extra costs for those with preexisting conditions. But even the conservative Mercatus Foundation found that to be less than a pittance compared with the skyrocketing costs for those who need it. Every day, we are finding new egregious consequences of this legislation. Last night, the New York Times reported that passing this bill will cut special education programs to over 2500 students with disabilities. Yesterday, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities reported that the tax credits Republicans are proposing in this bill will be totally unusable in states like California and New York because of state laws that require coverage of abortion. Reports have come out that sexual assault and domestic violence would, once again, be considered a preexisting condition, making insurance unaffordable for survivors. The Wall Street Journal reported that the bill could allow employers to reinstate lifetime caps and eliminate outofpocket caps for their employees’ insurance plans, leaving the 159 million Americans who get insurance through their employer with no insurance coverage when they need it most. That’s right—if you think that because you don’t buy insurance on the exchange and therefore don’t have to worry about this bill, you’re wrong. I have no doubt that in the time it takes to read this statement another round of articles and reports will come out finding even more abhorrent consequences of this contemptible piece of legislation. So I ask my Republican colleagues—who are you passing this bill for? Are you so out of touch with the lives of real Americans that you no longer understand what it means to struggle to pay your medical bills? Have you traveled so far from the values you claim to uphold that you are willing to force parents to watch their children die of curable diseases because they have reached the lifetime cap on covered costs that your bill reinstates, and they can no longer afford to pay for treatment? Are you willing to gamble away their lives and the lives of their children just to say you passed a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Shame on any member who votes for this cowardly, cruel bill and tries to sell this bill to their constituents as a win for the American people. Shame on this House for even considering a bill that could leave the most vulnerable in our country—children born with disabilities, women fleeing domestic violence, older Americans too sick to buy insurance but too young to enroll in Medicare—at the mercy of insurance companies and fate. Shame on you for playing political games with people’s lives. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the American Care Act. After seven years, the Republicans have released a plan that works to kick people off health insurance very quickly, increases outofpocket costs, and punishes older and sicker Americans. This is not the package that I envisioned. Some of the key features of the Affordable Care Act that millions of people relied on would be gone under this proposal. Under the Affordable Care Act, states could expand Medicaid, but this proposal would freeze enrollment to expanded Medicaid at January 1, 2020. On that date, enrollees who drop off of Medicaid due to income changes would not be able to return to Medicaid coverage if they dropped on for one full month. The proposal also changes Medicaid funding to a per capita cap system which will lead to deep cuts to Medicaid in my home state of Texas. This punishes lowincome Americans who would otherwise have no access to health insurance. This piece of legislation forces Americans to pay more and get less. The average subsidy under the American Health Care Act will likely be about 60 percent of the average subsidy under current law. Deductibles and outof pocket spending in the individual market will have to increase due to the elimination of requirements that insurance plans cover a certain value. Americans will pay more for their 
premiums, more for their care, more on outof pocket expenses and deductibles; all the while giving tax breaks to the wealthy and the tanning industry. One amendment to this bill would repeal the Essential Health Benefits, the ten coverage rules set up by the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act required insurers to cover ten ‘‘Essential Health Benefits’’ from maternity care, mental health, and prescription drugs, to hospitalization and outpatient care. If this is repealed, comprehensive health insurance will become virtually unavailable in the individual market. This means that individuals with pre existing conditions would not be protected. Younger and healthier people benefit, older and sicker people suffer. Another amendment would allow states to waive out of the Affordable Care Act’s ban on preexisting conditions. However, Members of Congress and their staff would be protected from this provision and would be guaranteed coverage of preexisting conditions. Mr. Speaker, the public has spoken about this socalled ‘‘replacement’’ bill. People will live or die as a result of this legislation. The Republican leadership has rushed this bill to the floor without any consideration and I urge you all to consider its harmful effects. Your constituents are asking you to work with us to repair the Affordable Care Act. Work with us. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, include in for the RECORD a letter from common sense kids action: 
COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION , April 25, 2017. Re H.R. 1628—OPPOSE Hon. DIANE BLACK , Chairwoman, House Budget Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE BLACK : On behalf of the millions of American kids and families who rely on comprehensive, dependable health insurance to stay healthy and to get medical treatment when they need it, we are writing to respectfully express our strong opposition to your bill, H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). We have added this bill to our Common Sense Legislative Ratings Tool as an ‘‘Against Kids’’ bill and will communicate our position to our parent and teacher members. Common Sense is the nation’s leading independent nonprofit organization dedicated to helping kids thrive in a rapidly changing world. We empower parents, teachers, and policymakers by providing unbiased information, trusted advice, and innovative tools to help them harness the power of media and technology as a positive force in all kids’ lives. The policy arm, Common Sense Kids Action, is building a movement of parents, teachers, business leaders, and others dedicated to making kids our nation’s top priority by supporting policies at the state and federal level that contribute to the building blocks of opportunity for kids. Access to affordable and quality medical care for kids is certainly one of those key building blocks. Thanks to current law, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 95% of young children in the U.S. today have health insurance. That’s a remarkable achievement. With health insurance, parents are more likely to seek medical care for themselves and for their children, helping to prevent illnesses from developing and shortening their duration when they occur. However, the AHCA will result in 24 million fewer Americans having coverage, including millions of children. This jeopardizes the health and wellbeing of America’s kids and will alarm any parent who understands the importance of health insurance for their children and family. The Affordable Care Act certainly needs to be fixed, but if Congress has the goal of making sure that all families and businesses have access to affordable and comprehensive health insurance, it could improve the law for everyone without forcing millions of kids and their parents to lose access to critical medical care. As Congress continues to grapple with this issue, health insurance programs, we think these facts about children’s health insurance from the Congressional Budget Office and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families are important to keep in mind: Ninetyfive percent of children age 0–5 are insured today. Fortyfive million of those children access health care through two programs: about 37 million through Medicaid (a federalstate program) and 8 million through CHIP, the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Children are the singlelargest group of persons covered under Medicaid. Under the Affordable Care Act, as you know, many states expanded Medicaid with help from the federal government, increasing coverage for kids and families, including coverage for mental health care. Changes being considered, including under the AHCA, would cut funding to Medicaid by as much as $880 billion over the next 10 years. The AHCA, when compared with current law, would result in 24 million fewer Americans with health insurance by the year 2026. Even with changes recently suggested to your bill, America’s kids will be best served by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid and CHIP, not by repealing the Affordable Care Act and block granting or establishing a per capita cap on Medicaid. We urge you to keep our children’s future foremost in your thinking, withdraw your bill, and work on a bipartisan basis to support measures that protect and strengthen children’s health care. Thank you for your consideration of our views and we would be happy to talk with you at any time about this and other issues that matter to America’s children and families. Sincerely, DANNY WEISS, Vice President, Federal Policy.

JOHNSON AMENDMENT REPEAL (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, in light of this morning’s long overdue executive order on religious freedom and free speech, I rise today to thank my colleagues in Congress on their support for a thorough reform of the Johnson amendment, which has hindered the ability of faithbased nonprofits and churches from engaging in free speech and exercising freedom of religion. Since 1954, the Johnson amendment has given the IRS the broad authority to censor the free speech of pastors, churches, and other taxexempt organizations across America. The IRS’ vague interpretation of prohibited forms of speech under this law has led to uncertainty about what speech constitutes a formal violation. Furthermore, when the Johnson amendment was originally adopted, it was passed without debate, committee hearings, or any other procedure we use in Congress today. We need to allow America’s churches, pastors, and other faith leaders to speak freely on all spheres of life, including relevant political candidates and elections. We need to return free speech back to our spiritual leaders and faithbased organizations without fear of government censorship. Thank you, Mr. President, for acting to ensure that America’s churches will again be a safe place to discuss all important matters in life. While today’s actions are a strong start, there is more work to be done to protect religious freedom in the United States of America. f 
WE ARE NOT GOING FORWARD IN HEALTH CARE, WE ARE GOING BACKWARDS (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, in 2010, I was here and voted for the Affordable Care Act. It passed. It was one of the most proudest moments I have had in Congress. My father was a doctor who provided health care. I know what health care is like. I suffered from polio at age 5, and have been a constant recipient of health care. Every American should have had that right. What happened today was cruel, mean, and heartless. It gave $1 billion in tax breaks to the richest people in this country. It took health care from 24 million people. It made the insurance policies that will be available to people less fulsome if they can waive essential benefits, and that includes parts of insurance that were essential under the Affordable Care Act. The policies will be nearly worthless. They will have high deductibles, and they will cost people more and more because the credits are not as much as the subsidies. The poor were hurt, the middle class were hurt, and seniors were hurt. It is a sad day when that was cheered, and a day that will go down as one of the worst days in the history of this House. We are not going forward and providing people with the care they need in health care; we are going backwards. I rue this day. 
HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE (Mr. CUMMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago at a townhall in Baltimore, a young lady came forward. She was 28 years old. She said: I have stage IV cancer. I got married just a few years ago. My husband and I were considering having a baby, but now I have discovered that that won’t happen. The Affordable Care Act saved my life. The last thing she said—and she begged—was: You have got to act now because, if you don’t, I will be dead. Mr. Speaker, the last thing I said to her was that I will give it everything I have got. Just a few moments ago, when I heard the other side of the aisle cheer as the bill was passed, it gave me great pain. But I want to say to her and to the American people: I will fight until my death to make sure that we get you the care that you need. Health care is a right, not a privilege. f 
TRIBUTE TO FATHER GEORGE CLEMENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RUSH) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a true hero in my heart and the hearts of so many in my hometown of Chicago, Illinois: Father George H. Clements. Father Clements, yesterday, celebrated the 60th anniversary of his ordination into the Roman Catholic Church. His path towards divinity began early in life when he became the first Black graduate of Chicago’s Quigley Academy Seminary in 1945. From there, he went on to pursue his education and earned a bachelor of arts degree in sacred theology and a master of arts degree in philosophy from St. Mary of the Lake Seminary. Mr. Speaker, after ordination, Father Clements continued his role as a trailblazer when, in June of 1969, he became the first Black priest of Holy Angels Catholic Church, which we in the First District of Illinois are proud to claim. Mr. Speaker, from that position, Father Clements has had a tremendous impact on lives all across the city of Chicago and all across our great Nation. One such incident of tremendous significance to me personally are his actions that he undertook in the aftermath of the assassination of my dear friend and deputy chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party, Fred Hampton. On December 4, 1969, Fred Hampton was assassinated. December 4, 1969, is a dark day in the history of the civil rights movement and in the struggle for social justice here in our great Nation. Mr. Speaker, that is the day that Fred Hampton, as I said before, was assassinated by members of the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, who worked in conjunction with the Chicago Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Speaker, it is only by the grace of God that I escaped that same fate. Knowing that I was being pursued as a target of the FBI, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, and the Chicago Police Department, this same extraordinary priest, Father George Clements, offered me protection under the very old ecclesiastical right of sanctuary that has been honored throughout many centuries here and all across the world in a church not 
only in America, but in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Mr. Speaker, if not for the heroic actions of Father Clements on that day, I would not be standing here in the well of the House on this very day. Father Clements just didn’t stop on that infamous day of December 4, 1969. Throughout the years, countless others have also benefited from Father George Clements’ boundless love for humanity. In 1980, he started the Catholic church’s first One Church One Child program, an effort to increase the adoption race of AfricanAmerican orphans. He took this noble, gigantic step so to heart that, in 1981 he himself adopted a child; something that had been unheard of in the history of the Catholic church: a Catholic priest adopting a child. b1445 He did not stop there, Father Clements. He has taken personal responsibility for and adopted other children. He has been an excellent father to four wonderful children: Joey, Friday, Stewart, and Saint Anthony. Father Clements’ selfless devotion to humanity did not stop there. After retiring from the Holy Angels Catholic Church in 1994, Father Clements made his way to our Nation’s Capital. He came here to Washington, D.C., to establish the One ChurchOne Addict program beginning here in our Nation’s Capital. Mr. Speaker, as some of us more seasoned folks in this Chamber may recall, this was a time when our Nation’s Capital was known as the ‘‘murder capital’’ of America. This fact did not deter Father Clements from seeking to help those in need, from trying to be a solution to a highly recognized problem. Father Clements’ unboundless love was in full effect once again. Even after all of his years of selfless, sacrificial, hard work, Father Clements still had more to give. In 1999, he established the One ChurchOne Inmate program, which was a shared effort to help prison inmates and their families by helping inmates transition from incarceration to a life as productive and ‘‘spiritually healed,’’ lawabiding citizens. What a remarkable man Father George C. Clements was, and what a remarkable man he is this very day. The Nation, Hollywood has recognized this glorious man. They made a movie after him, called, ‘‘The Father Clements Story,’’ where the awardwinning actor Lou Gossett starred as Father Clements. In short, Mr. Speaker, Father Clements has been a beacon of light during the dark days of our Nation. He has been a community leader, a selfless advocate for the downtrodden, and above all, he has been a true and loyal friend to those who are in need. He is a religious man who walks the walk just as he talks the talk. I can speak no better words for this great American hero, Father George C. Clements, no better words than those that are taken from the Bible, from Holy Scriptures. Let me close, Mr. Speaker, with these very words taken from the Book of Proverbs at 22:9. The Bible says: ‘‘He who has a generous eye will be blessed, for he gives of his bread to the poor.’’ This is the manner, the mind of the man, Father George C. Clements. Mr. Speaker, I honor, I love, I am grateful for, and I am indebted to the remarkable love and work, commitment and dedication of my friend Father George C. Clements. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS), my colleague, my comrade, my cohort, my coconspirator, my friend from the Seventh District of Illinois. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I know that Congressman RUSHhas extolled the virtues of Father Clements sufficiently, and I certainly won’t need 45 or 46 additional minutes to do that; but I can tell you that Father George Clements is an exemplary, extraordinary, unordinary man, a priest of the highest order, but a man who adopted four sons, and he has just been tributed not only here, but certainly back in our hometown of Chicago, Illinois. The thing about his four sons that he adopted, being a single priest, that was not the easiest thing in the world to do. But all four of them have become outstanding individuals everyplace they have been throughout America. Father Clements not only saved my colleague at a time of great peril, at a time of great need, which demonstrated tremendous courage, but down through the years, he has continued to provide creative leadership and great initiatives, especially as related to children and the needs that they had—One ChurchOne Child, One ChurchOne Family, one church helping individuals who were in need of help. Mr. Speaker, I join with Congressman RUSH in paying tribute to this outstanding humanitarian, Father George Clements. 
TRIBUTE TO MS . RUTH LIFE , EDUCATOR , FRIEND , 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I also come to the floor to give tribute to a lady, Ms. Ruth Life, an educator, friend, and community activist. I have been fortunate, Mr. Speaker, to have known many outstanding individuals during my lifetime, but never have I known anyone more outstanding, more passionate, more consistent, more reliable, or more giving of herself than Ms. Ruth Life, whom I met in the 1960s. I met Ms. Life during the time when community activism was at a serious, high level, especially in the city of Chicago, Illinois, where I come from. Ms. Life, like many of our generation, was involved, actively engaged in efforts to make life for people who lived in the communities where we lived and worked better. Both of us worked for the Chicago Public Schools system at that time. We were working in District 10, where Mr. Joseph Rosen was superintendent of schools and Ms. Ida Mae ‘‘Ma’’ Fletcher, as we called her, was the leading school activist. As time went on, I left the teaching profession but continued to run into Ms. Life at meetings and church activities. When it came to teaching, there were none better. As she became the assistant principal at the Roswell B. Mason Elementary School, she was creative, encouraging, and imaginative. When you walked into Roswell B. Mason Elementary School, you knew that teachers were teaching and students were learning. Thirtyeight years is a long time to teach and educate, but Ms. Life spent a lifetime of service to humanity, especially through her church, the People’s Church of the Harvest Church of God in Christ, where Michael Eaddy is the pastor and visionary. Their church has just recently developed a $13 million housing project through their community development association, of which Ms. Life was secretary. As she passes away and moves to another level of being, I can almost hear the Master speaking to her, saying: ‘‘Well done, my good, and faithful servant. You have done exceptionally well here on Earth. Now I invite you to come on up to the bosom of Abraham, where you can rest in peace and spend eternity.’’ Mr. Speaker, I am so delighted to have had this opportunity to exemplify the life of this outstanding woman, Ms. Ruth life. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f
