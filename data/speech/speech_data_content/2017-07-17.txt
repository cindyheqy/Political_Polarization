Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of the Chinese human rights advocate and Nobel Prize Laureate, Liu Xiaobo, who died last Thursday in China, under guard. The world has lost an incomparably courageous advocate who was dedicated to advancing human rights and the rule of law, and paid for them with his own freedom and life. Liu’s passing last week in Chinese custody marked a tragic end to over a decade of persecution by the Chinese authorities who relentlessly mistreated him as he gradually became a symbol of the prodemocracy movement around the globe. In 2010, the Nobel Peace Committee awarded him the Peace Prize for his thoughtful advocacy for reform and for his courageous support of the prodemocracy document Charter 08. A year prior to the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to Liu, in 2009, Chinese authorities tried him for subversion of state power, for which he received an 11year sentence. Given his rising stature in the international community, they imprisoned him in secret locations away from family, supporters, or international media. They kept him from receiving the Peace Prize and put pressure on the committee to rescind the award, in addition to doing everything they could to prevent Liu’s supporters from attending the ceremony in Norway. They routinely censored and continue to censor the internet for references to Liu and other prodemocracy advocates and ideas. China was so afraid of the power of his words and the bravery of his actions that while Liu was suffering from severe illness, Chinese authorities adopted the ultimate cruelty of not letting him leave China for medical help that experts said might save his life. For China, the supreme goal was his silence. The more we care about human rights and freedom, the more we must now mark his death and remember him not by being silent ourselves. I first came to know about Liu’s work a few years after the CongressionalExecutive Commission on China was created as part of the debate over China’s ascension to the World Trade Organization and concerns from Members of Congress over China’s human rights record. In 2000, I coauthored the legislation that created the China commission to help advance and monitor human rights abuses in China. The commission continues to do important work and continues today by shining a spotlight on many issues such as abuses in labor, environment, and freedom of speech and association. While he was the most prominent voice in China against its repression of human rights and democratic values, Liu was not as well known in his life as another brave voice, Andrei Sakharov. His voice and action occurred during the Cold War, where there was a full press against the Soviet Union, including its suppression of freedom. He supported numerous efforts for freedom, including those of another noble warrior for freedom, Natan Sharansky. Like Sakharov, Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, but both were kept in virtual imprisonment and not allowed to go to Stockholm. Liu’s battles for freedom occurred when China’s economic and political power were rising. The United States and other nations were wrestling with how to adapt, and relations with China have been increasingly infused with concerns about security, including the nuclearization of North Korea. So there has been a tendency for concerns in other nations about human rights and freedom in China to take a back seat. This is a major change from the days of Tiananmen Square, and events elsewhere then in China. My son, Andy Levin was in Chengdu during demonstrations there for freedom and he managed amidst all the dangerous turbulence to cable a vivid article about the struggle for freedom there to the Detroit News. Chinese authorities have also relentlessly harassed his widow, Liu Xia (Lew Tsia), by keeping her in isolation, under house arrest for weeks at a time, and monitoring her every move. For as long as she remains there, the 
authorities will continue to see her as a symbol of dissent, and continue to harass her in every way imaginable. The U.S. government at all levels, including the highest, must speak up clearly for her freedom. I end today by leaving you with Liu words to his wife on the last day before his trial for subversion of state power in 2009: ‘‘Even if I am crushed into powder, I will embrace you with ashes. I will calmly face the impending trial, with no regrets for my choices, and will look forward with hope to tomorrow.’’ 
HONORING FORMER SENATOR BOB DOLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish former Kansas Senator Bob Dole a happy 94th birthday, which he celebrated this weekend. Born in Russell, Kansas, 94 years ago, Senator Dole dedicated his life to being a public servant. In 1945, after nearly giving his life in World War II, then 2nd Lieutenant Bob Dole earned two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star for his combat valor in Italy. He would later, of course, win the Presidential Medal of Freedom. After serving as the Representative for the First District, the district I represent, he became Senator Bob Dole in 1968. I well remember sitting in my own classroom of third grade in Ms. Hileman’s class at Jefferson grade school and reading our weekly reader, reading about a very contentious race involving Bob Dole. And, of course, Senator Dole went on to win that race and to serve Kansas until his 1996 Presidential run. To date, Senator Dole has the record for the longest serving Republican leader in the Senate. Currently, Senator Dole keeps a very busy schedule working here in Washington, D.C., and continues public service in a variety of ways. On many Saturdays, he can be seen greeting veterans at the World War II Memorial, something I have had the pleasure of doing with him. His international impact is still felt in programs like the McGovernDole International Food for Education program, which helps fight childhood hunger and poverty by providing nutrition to more than 22 million school children in 41 developing countries. Mr. Speaker, as this body debates legislation and its impacts, we would do well to keep in mind leaders like Senator Dole, who never forgot about the human impact of each bill, who has embodied public service his entire life, and who never forgot where he was from, Russell, Kansas. Happy 94th birthday to my friend, our mentor, our fellow Kansan, Senator Bob Dole. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome home our First Infantry Division Headquarters, who have been stationed in Iraq for the last 9 months, advising and assisting Iraqi security forces. Approximately 150 soldiers in the division returned home this weekend, with the rest returning to Fort Riley later this month. Major General Martin, the commanding general of the First Infantry Division at Fort Riley, was among the soldiers who returned home recently. We thank him for his service abroad and are looking forward to working with him at Fort Riley. This marks the first time that almost our entire division is back home together on one post. However, one aviation battalion is still currently deployed in the Republic of Korea. These soldiers and their families, especially their families, sacrifice greatly, and it certainly does not go unnoticed. They are part of a distinguished division, the Big Red One, and return home just in time for celebrations of the division’s 100th anniversary. Welcome home to General Martin and the rest of his troops. HONORING AMELIA EARHART  
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge one of Kansas’ most wellknown natives, Amelia Earhart. Amelia was raised in Atchison, Kansas, and would be 120 years old this month, and this month also is the 80th anniversary of her disappearance. After taking her first plane ride in 1920, she soared to the top of the aviation world attempting to accomplish the audacious flight around the world. Amelia’s history has helped shape the future Kansas would have in aerospace industry today. Her numerous accomplishments, such as being the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and being elected president of The NinetyNines, a women’s aviation club, has helped pave the way for Kansans today and make her print in history. Thanks, in part, to Amelia, 67 percent of the general aviation fleet has been manufactured in Kansas since 1919. It is an honor to have her from Kansas, and on her birthday, to recognize all she has done for Kansas, aviation, women, and our national pride. 
WHO HAS CONTROL OVER OUR SKIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a very critical issue that has occurred concerning our skies and the control thereof. Our U.S. airspace is the busiest airspace in the world and, alone, is the safest and most successful. We have over 87,000 flights per day in the United States airspace. Our wonderful friends from Canada, just to the north, have only a mere fraction of that. For decades, our air traffic control has been successfully managed under the FAA with the oversight of Congress and the American taxpayer. Like any system, there is always room for improvement and modernization. However, there are some who think that the only way to get to modernization is through privatization. This could not be further from the truth. Congress will soon begin debating an FAA reauthorization bill. Chairman SHUSTER and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure have done a commendable job and worked tirelessly to craft a bill that brings much needed reforms to the FAA. However, I strongly disagree with the idea to give control of air traffic services to a private corporation governed by a board made up of special interests. There are just too many reasons why this is a bad idea. Under the plan, the corporation would operate air traffic control by charging flyers user fees. A private corporation concerned with raising money from user fees will be heavily incentivized to prioritize air traffic services where it can raise the most money. This incentive would be very harmful to constituents like mine in rural areas who could very well see a reduction in air traffic services. Further, a private user fee model would undoubtedly reduce revenues to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, as the administration’s own budget predicts. This fund is critical for upgrades and maintenance in small and mediumsized airports across the country. Reliable air traffic services and airport infrastructure are essential for rural areas to attract business, for economic growth, and for Americans to have access to safe and efficient travel. This plan is bad for rural America. Spinning off air traffic control to a private corporation is also a major liability for the American taxpayer. The administration’s budget predicts that privatization of air traffic control would cost almost $46 billion over 10 years. These costs would be compounded by the fact that the private corporation will be required to hire all current Federal air traffic employees, continue to contribute to their Federal benefits and healthcare, and continue to collectively bargain with their union representatives. This is hardly privatization and hardly modernization. Even more concerning, the taxpayers would likely be on the hook if the corporation took on more debt than it can pay for and is unable to safely operate our skies. Yes, the bill says there is no Federal guarantee for the corporation, but this hasn’t stopped the Federal Government from being forced to bail out other so called private corporations to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our airspace is a public resource and a great national treasure. Control over it should not be handed over to a private board with no oversight from Congress and, therefore, no obligation to 
represent the best interests of the citizens of the United States. b1215 Modernization should continue to be our goal, and Congress can get there without jeopardizing control and safety of our national airspace. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the President to modernize our airspace while making sure that it remains the safest and most accessible in the world. 
RECOGNIZING APPOINTEES TO MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, every year, I have the pleasure of nominating outstanding young men and women from the 27th Congressional District of Texas to the United States military service academies. Recently, I held a lunch for this year’s ten appointees and their families, who have received an appointment to one of the five service academies. I enjoyed visiting with these young folks and their families and would like to recognize each of them for their commitment to protect our great Nation. They are: Jose Aguirre, from Corpus Christi, Texas, a 2017 graduate of Foy H. Moody High School, who will attend the United States Naval Academy; Aaron Jeffrey Frahm, from Corpus Christi, Texas, a 2017 graduate from Marine Military Academy, who will attend the United States Merchant Marine Academy; Specialist David Zane Ledbetter, United States Army, from Victoria, Texas, a graduate of Victoria West High School, who will attend the U.S. Military Academy, West Point; Kaila Celiene Lusson, from Corpus Christi, Texas, a 2017 graduate of Aviano High School, Aviano Air Base, Italy, who will attend the Air Force Academy; Caleb Michael McCann, from Sinton, Texas, a 2016 graduate of Flour Bluff High School, who will attend the Air Force Academy; John T. McNiff, from Corpus Christi, Texas, a 2017 graduate of Incarnate Word Academy, who will attend the U.S. Coast Guard Academy; Kalista Courtney Schauer, from Corpus Christi, Texas, a 2017 graduate of Richard King High School, who will attend the U.S. Military Academy, West Point; Clayton Daley Thompson, from Corpus Christi, Texas, a 2016 graduate of Flour Bluff High School, who will attend the United States Naval Academy; Cassandra Hamer, from Corpus Christi, Texas, a 2017 graduate of Richard King High School, who will attend the U.S. Coast Guard Academy; and Josh Smith, from Victoria, Texas, a 2017 graduate of Victoria West High School, who will attend the United States Air Force Academy. Each of them brings great pride to all of us in the 27th District of Texas. I wish them the best of luck in their academies, and I look forward to hearing great things about their service to our Nation. RECOGNIZING DREW SCOTT  
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I was walking along the Cannon tunnel and was looking at all of the art from the Congressional Art Competition. As Members know, each year, thousands of high school students from every congressional district submit their artwork to their Member of Congress for the annual Congressional Art Competition. Helping inspire these young people to become active in the things they are passionate about, like art, is one of my favorite parts of my job. Today, I would like to recognize Drew Scott, the winner of this year’s Congressional Art Competition for the 27th District of Texas. She is a junior at RockportFulton High School, and she won this year’s contest with an original colored pencil drawing ‘‘Complimentary Calico.’’ It is a drawing of one of her friend’s cats. Earlier this year, I visited Rockport Fulton High School to announce Drew as the winner, and I recently had the pleasure of hosting Drew and her family when they traveled to Washington for the unveiling of her artwork in the Cannon tunnel. I thank everyone who submitted their artwork for this year’s competition. It was an extremely hard decision for the judges. And congratulations to Drew. I look forward to seeing next year’s entrants. I would like to encourage all high school students to participate in this wonderful opportunity. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. FERGUSON ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Strengthen the constitutional commitments of the Members of this people’s House as they return to the Capitol today. Guide and sustain them in Your wisdom and inspire all, especially those in leadership, with the insights needed to assist our Nation at this time. During these warm days of summer, may the discourse on the floor and in committees be noted more for light than heat, that the important work to be done might redound to the benefit of all Americans. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
HOUSE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSES THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed the National Defense Authorization Act with a bipartisan vote of 344–81. This bill represents a strong commitment to enacting accounting reforms and rebuilding our military. As chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, I am grateful that this bill modernizes our forces and begins to close the readiness gap facing our servicemembers, fulfilling President Donald Trump’s pledge to rebuild the American military. This legislation also supports military families by providing the largest pay raise in 8 years and by giving military families greater flexibility when relocating during the school year. The primary function of the national government is to provide for our national defense, to ensure that our servicemembers have the training, equipment, and resources they need to achieve the goal as established by Senator Barry Goldwater, ‘‘Why Not Victory.’’ I appreciate the determined leadership of Chairman MACTHORNBERRY , and I look forward to continuing to work with him to advance the legislation through the conference process. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
CONGRATULATING COMMANDER HUGGAN ON HIS CAREER (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an exceptional member of the United States Navy on the event of his retirement, Commander Doug Huggan. On Friday, July 14, Commander Huggan completed his tour as the commanding officer of the Naval Support Activity Florida. This caps a long and distinguished career. His service to the Navy started as an E–6 airborne command pilot and has taken him around the world, from the European Command to Japan, and finally to Panama City. While at NSA Panama City, Commander Huggan led over 3,000 Active Duty and civilian personnel in performing critical missions, including surface warfare training, explosive ordnance disposal, salvage training, and experimental diving. His leadership over the last 2 years in the Second District is a testament to the core values instilled upon all those who serve in the Navy. Mr. Speaker, please join me in saying thank you to Commander Huggan and his family for their years of service and sacrifice, and wish them luck as they move on to enjoy a new chapter in their life. 
NORTH KOREA IS A SLAVE TRADER (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a new soccer stadium in St. Petersburg, a luxury apartment complex in Moscow, all brought to Russia by North Korean slaves. That is right. These slaves get almost no wages, no holidays, with little food or sleep. Little Kim not only enslaves his own people at home, he runs an international slave trade. The slave network brings in $2 billion to $3 billion every year to the North Korean military complex and helps little Kim evade sanctions. This is statesponsored human trafficking and slavery. The slaves are not just sent to Russia. It is troublemakers like China and Qatar, too, that are slave destinations. Secretary Tillerson has called upon all countries to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions to sever or downgrade diplomatic relations with North Korea in order to financially isolate that country. It is time these countries comply with the United Nations resolutions, and we must send a united message to North Korea: End your slave trade and stop the saber rattling. And that is just the way it is. IF DONALD TRUMP, JR., WERE A DEMOCRAT (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if Donald Trump, Jr., were a Democrat, the media would be defending him for doing what every campaign does: conducting opposition research. The media would be praising him for ending a meeting when it became obvious there was no evidence to back up an informant’s allegations. The media would be pointing out that many countries’ leaders openly supported Barack Obama for President, including those from the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, and Nicaragua. Maybe the real crime is the media’s double standard. In their irrational obsession with destroying the Trump Presidency, the liberal media have forgotten journalism’s profound responsibility: to be fair and objective. f 
b1645 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. BACON ) at 4 o’clock and 45 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2210) to designate the community living center of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania, as the ‘‘Sergeant Joseph George Kusick VA Community Living Center’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2210 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) and the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2210, a bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs Community Living Center in Butler Township, Pennsylvania, as the Sergeant Joseph George Kusick VA Community Living Center. 
Sergeant Kusick, a native of Bruin, Pennsylvania, served in the United States Special Forces during the Vietnam war. During a combat mission, deep in hostile territory, on November 8, 1967, Sergeant Kusick was seriously wounded during an ambush by enemy forces. Wounded, yet refusing aid and initial evacuation, he remained in the midst of battle to help secure emergency extraction for his fellow soldiers. The helicopter that Sergeant Kusick finally boarded was shot down by Viet Cong fire and Sergeant Kusick’s life was lost. He was just 22 years old. Sergeant Kusick was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for ‘‘ . . . gallantry in action, at the cost of his life . . . in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.’’ It is only fitting and appropriate that we honor Sergeant Kusick’s service and sacrifice by naming the VA Butler Healthcare’s Community Living Center after him. H.R. 2210 is sponsored by Congressman MIKEKELLY , from Pennsylvania, and I am grateful to him for introducing it and allowing us to honor and forever remember this great American hero. This legislation satisfies all of the committee’s naming criteria and, as such, is supported by the entire Pennsylvania congressional delegation, as well as by many veterans service organizations. Once again, I thank Congressman KELLY for sponsoring this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 2210, a bill to designate the Community Living Center of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania, as the Sergeant Joseph George Kusick VA Community Living Center. Sergeant Joseph George Kusick was awarded the Silver Star for sacrificing his life in an effort to ensure that as many of his comrades as possible made it home from Vietnam. The resulting recovery effort was to be recorded by the squadron as one of the largest and most hazardous on record. As a radio operator, Sergeant Kusick served as the connection between the 5th Special Forces Group, who found themselves under enemy ambush, and the forward air controller charged with coordinating their evacuation. Although Sergeant Kusick was seriously injured during the ambush, he refused multiple offers to evacuate, ultimately refusing two helicopters, only to board a helicopter that was then shot down by intense Viet Cong fire. His bravery and sacrifice earned him a posthumously awarded Silver Star with the following citation: ‘‘Kusick’s gallantry in action, at the cost of his life, was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.’’ Mr. Speaker, I salute Sergeant Kusick for his selfless bravery, and I support the passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2210. This bill will designate the Department of Veterans Affairs Community Living Center in my hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania, as the Sergeant Joseph George Kusick VA Community Living Center. This is something you have heard already, but I want you to understand something, and if we can look for a minute outside of the people’s House into thinking of who we actually are as a people. This is a young guy, 22 years old, at the very beginning of his life. At a time when most of us are looking forward to so many great things happening to us, he put himself in harm’s way. Now, when you think of what Sergeant Kusick did, it is incredible that this young man, on a hillside in Vietnam under heavy Viet Cong fire, and being seriously wounded himself, when asked: Listen, Sergeant, get on the helicopter. We can get you out of there. He said: ‘‘No, because if I leave, my comrades cannot be saved.’’ What an incredible place to put yourself in, a 22 yearold who just a couple of years earlier was in Butler, Pennsylvania, enjoying all that life has to offer, and all of the potential of that life, and putting the welfare of others and the safety of others before himself. That is an incredible position to put yourself in. We have already talked about the medal that Sergeant Kusick was given, and what it meant to everybody. But there is just so much about Sergeant Kusick, and all of these veterans, and all of these folks who have put themselves in harm’s way. The one thing that comes out all the time is, there is no place quite as unique as the United States of America; there is nothing quite as unique as our men and women in uniform; there is nothing quite as unique as people who are willing to put themselves second and put the lives and safety of others first. That is just not something people normally do. Sergeant Kusick did that on that hillside, seriously wounded, working on the radios. He knew that if he didn’t stay, the other people wouldn’t get extracted. He stayed there, under heavy enemy fire, and watched what was going on, watched the helicopters come in to extract his teammates. And I think of it all the time: Where do people like Sergeant Kusick come from? And do you know where they come from? They come from all of these small towns and cities across America. They don’t think of themselves as being unique. They don’t think of their sacrifice as being exceptional. They don’t think of what they have done as being out of the ordinary because it is just who we are as Americans. As I think about these things, I am called to bring out something that I have read, and this is in a different war at a different time. It is a dedication stone at the Korean War Memorial, not too far from our Nation’s steps. At the point of the triangle leading to the American flag is a dedication which reads: ‘‘Our Nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.’’ A country they never knew, and a people they never met, and they put their life on the line to defend those lives. That is incredible. I would just suggest to people, you can go around this world and hunt for other people like this, and you will find them, but you will not find them in as great numbers as you find right here in the United States of America. I don’t know if Sergeant Kusick was a Republican or a Democrat. I don’t know how he voted. I knew where he grew up, because that is where I grew up. I knew who he was because he is from the same area I am from. The only difference in all of us may be the town we grew up and our last name, but the rest of it is all the same. The same blood that coursed through Sergeant Kusick’s veins is the same blood that courses through all of our veins. And he was so willing, so willing to sacrifice his life for saving others. Well, this didn’t happen by chance. I have got to tell you that what we are doing today to honor Sergeant Kusick was due to the work of The American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and especially the tireless effort of the Third Congressional District Military Veterans Advocacy group, and my friend, Sergeant Art Greathead, who tirelessly did the research on this. We ran through all of the things we have to run through, and for those folks who don’t know, this is not an easy thing to do. This is hard work to get this done, to honor a hero. But that work was done by all of these folks in a way of saying ‘‘thank you’’ to one of America’s fallen heros; ‘‘thank you’’ to one of American’s heros who has been long forgotten in some circles, but not back home. We remember Sergeant Kusick. We honor Sergeant Kusick. We thank him for his sacrifice, and we point to a country that is forever grateful to our women and men in uniform for the great sacrifice that they make. But I want to go back to one other thing: 22 years old. Twentytwo, at a time when life is just starting, never again to be able to celebrate a birthday; never again to celebrate Christmas, or Thanksgiving; never again to celebrate a family reunion, but forever lost—but 
lost for a good reason. He gave his life so that others may survive. The way they were able to identify Sergeant Kusick’s remains—by the way, the helicopter he finally got in after everybody else would have been extracted was shot down, went down in flames. There were dog tags on two of the remains that were recovered. The other body that was recovered did not have dog tags on, but do you know what Sergeant Kusick had? He had his radio pack. To the very end, Sergeant Kusick was doing what he was required to do and what he wanted to do, and he not only gave up his life but gave up his entire future. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate this, and I can’t tell you how much this means to the people of Butler, Pennsylvania, but more than anything else, to Sergeant Kusick for the sacrifice of a life. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I am very thankful that the gentleman has brought Congress’ attention to Sergeant Kusick’s deed on behalf of our Nation. I was reflecting on his youth, 22 years old, and to think that so many younger, his age, step forward to defend our Nation and to give up their lives. I think it is well for all of us in this Chamber to reflect on that sacrifice as we struggle to reach across the aisle and to come to agreement to serve our country, to note the ultimate sacrifice that they put forward. I thank you very much for the effort you have taken to remember a great American hero. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman—our colleagues— for his kind comments, and also especially Representative KELLY for bringing forward this outstanding bill. I encourage all Members to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2210. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. b1700 GRANTING CONSENT AND APPROVAL OF CONGRESS TO AMEND WASHINGTON AREA TRANSIT REGULATION COMPACT Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 92) granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to amend the Washington Area Transit Regulation Compact. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: H.J. R ES. 92 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. C OLLINS of New York). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 92, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.J. Res. 92, introduced by my Virginia colleague, Representative COMSTOCK , concerns the Washingtonarea transit system. The resolution makes needed administrative amendments to the longstanding Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact. 
These amendments are required under section 3026 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation, or FAST, Act. That section transferred from the Administrator of General Services to the Secretary of Transportation sole authority to appoint Federal directors to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board of directors. It further required Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to adopt any necessary conforming amendments to the Washington Area Transit Regulation Compact. The jurisdictions adopted the needed amendments as required. H.J. Res. 92 accordingly grants Congress’ approval to the amendments. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I thank Members on both sides of the aisle, including Congresswoman COMSTOCK , for their good work on this. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 92. I thank my colleague from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ), the chairman of the committee, for leading this measure, and I am very happy to lend my support to the resolution. This resolution would grant congressional consent to amendments to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact Authority pursuant to legislation already enacted by the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, respectively. Established in 1967, the WMATA is an interstate compact agency responsible for operating the mass transit system for the Washington Metropolitan area. As part of a broader effort to promote safety and efficiency in the WMATA Metrorail system, Congress transferred appointment authority for the WMATA board of directors to the Secretary of Transportation through enactment of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act in 2015, the socalled FAST Act. Under the FAST Act, Congress also directed the WMATA jurisdictions to adopt conforming compact amendments. H.J. Res. 92 is a bipartisan measure that would grant Congress’ consent to these amendments to the WMATA compact. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ), who is the chief sponsor of the legislation. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my resolution, H.J. Res. 92, which lends congressional approval to an amendment made to the WMATA interstate compact. As was mentioned, the last iteration of the highway bill, the FAST Act, contained a provision that directed Virginia, Maryland, and D.C. to amend the compact to change appointment authority for the Federal directors on the WMATA board from the administrator of the GSA to the more appropriate Secretary of Transportation. This was a very commonsense change that was made in light of recent incidents and accidents and the real need to have a top priority for safety. The Secretary of Transportation, I believe, is in a much better position to appoint directors to the Metro board than the administrator of the GSA. The States of Virginia and Maryland as well as D.C. complied with this directive and amended the compact, and we are all in agreement here. The previous Secretary of Transportation last year appointed two very wellqualified candidates to serve as the Federal directors on the WMATA board. The final legal step that we are taking today here in this equation is for Congress to lend its approval to the change, and that is what this resolution does. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ). Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend Representative JAMIE RASKIN for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I was ranking member of the subcommittee that had jurisdiction over the FAST Act when we received the request from the region—the Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia region—to transfer the authority to appoint directors to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board from the GSA to the Department of Transportation. For the life of me, I can’t remember why this authority was given to the GSA in the first place. But it may have been because WMATA was considered simply an agency of interest to the Federal Government. On consideration, under the FAST Act, we agreed that the Department of Transportation was, by far, the more appropriate agency to appoint Federal directors—understand there are local directors—but Federal directors to WMATA. There are also Federal directors to the WMATA board. This is of great interest to the region. I recognize it is not monumental for the Congress, but the region very much needs this joint resolution. All three jurisdictions—the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia—have made their administrative changes, but these changes need to be confirmed by this body. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. COMSTOCK  for her leadership with this joint resolution, and I ask that the entire body approve it. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I simply want to, again, commend Mrs. COMSTOCK for her leadership on this legislation. I thank all of our fellow members in the regional delegation in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia for their collaborative work on this issue, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman GOODLATTE for facilitating the resolution’s consideration by both the committee and the House. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this fine legislation. I thank everybody for their good work, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 92. This Resolution would grant Congress’ consent to certain amendments to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact Authority pursuant to legislation enacted by the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, respectively. Congress originally consented to this Compact in 1960 and—from timetotime—the Compact has been amended with Congress’ consent, as needed. The current necessity for H.J. Res. 92 is prompted by the enactment of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2015. In pertinent part, this Act gave sole authority to the Secretary of Transportation to appoint federal directors to the board of directors of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact. To implement this directive, each of the Compact participants had to enact legislation amending the Compact. H.J. Res. 92 grants Congress’ consent to these amendments to the Compact as approved by each of the participating states and the District of Columbia. This bipartisan measure, which effectuates Congress’ directive of 2015, is cosponsored by all of the Congressional Members representing jurisdictions affected by the Metrorail system. I support this commonsense measure and I urge its swift passage. I commend Representative COMSTOCK for her leadership on this important legislation and I thank House Judiciary Chairman GOODLATTE for facilitating its timely consideration by both the Committee and the House. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I support H.J. Res. 92 granting consent and approval from Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to amend the Washington Area Transit Regulation Compact. As Houston is a major transportation hub, I understand and appreciate the importance of this legislation. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), an interstate compact agency, provides transportation services to millions of people each year. It is imperative that the WMATA be safe and effective because it is essential to the commerce and prosperity of the National Capitol Region. The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland intend to create the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to act as the state safety oversight authority for the WMATA system under 49 U.S.C. 5329. In title III of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (section 3026, Public Law 114–94), the Congress provided sole authority to the Secretary of Transportation to appoint Federal Directors to the Board of Directors of 
the WMATA and required the signatory parties to the Compact to amend the Compact as necessary. This compact is created for the benefit of the people of the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland so that there may be an increase in their safety, commerce, and prosperity. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.J. Res. 92. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the joint resolution, H.J. Res. 92. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
GRANTING CONSENT AND APPROVAL OF CONGRESS TO ESTABLISH WASHINGTON METRORAIL SAFETY COMMISSION Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 76) granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to a enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
affecting any right or jurisdiction of the United States in and over the region that forms the subject of the Compact. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. b1715 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 76, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.J. Res. 76 grants Congress’ approval to the Metrorail Safety Commission Interstate Compact, an interstate compact entered into recently by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia. The safety record of the D.C.area Metrorail system and other public transit systems in our country has been a matter of increasing concern for some time. To better address public transit safety needs, including metrorails, Congress included in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century, or MAP Act or MAP–21, and the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation, or FAST Act, provisions strengthening the Federal Transit Administration’s safety oversight authority and related safety requirements for public transit systems. Pursuant to these acts and through the Metrorail Safety Commission Interstate Compact, Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia have committed to establish a new Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to act as the State safety oversight authority for the Metrorail system. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has informed the Judiciary Committee that the new compact’s provisions satisfy the requirements of the relevant Federal statutes. The jurisdictions completed, in March of this year, their adoption by legislation of their respective compact instruments. In the meanwhile, however, due to delays in the adoption of the instruments, the FTA invoked on February 9, 2017, authority to suspend the distribution of transit funds to the jurisdictions until the new safety commission is established. By passage of H.J. Res. 76, we can hasten the day by which Metrorail safety will be improved and funds obligated for other impacted transit systems in the compact jurisdictions can be made available for release. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 76. This very important legislation grants congressional consent and approval to Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact under Article I, section 10 of the Constitution, establishing the Metrorail Safety Commission. Importantly, Federal transit funds have been suspended by the Federal Transit Authority until Congress grants its assent to these amendments to the WMATA compact, as H.J. Res. 76 would do. I want to thank my friend, the distinguished minority whip, STENY  HOYER , for taking the lead on this measure, and all of our colleagues in the Virginia and Maryland delegations and District of Columbia delegation for supporting it in such a strong, bipartisan, and crossPotomac River fashion. I am proud to join them. Mr. Speaker, I did want to take a moment to say a word about the Metro system. WMATA is not just the Metro that serves the Washington area. It is truly America’s Metro system. It is the second largest system in the Nation, behind only New York City. It is 117 miles long. It has 91 stations, and it includes more than 12,000 employees. It is critical to the functioning of the Federal Government because it moves more than 40 percent of the Federal workforce every day to and from work and also during the day for various missions that people go on during the normal workday. It is essential to national security. If we didn’t have the Metro system, what is already one of the most trafficplagued and congested regions in the country would be absolutely paralyzed. It is also the mechanism that moves millions of Americans who come from all over the United States, all of our constituents here in Congress, to visit us. That is how people get to the White House and the Capitol and go to the Pentagon and go to see NIH and visit the museums and the battlefields and so on. So the Metro is critical not just to the people who live and work here every day and make the Federal Government go, but also to all American citizens who rely on the efficiency of the Federal Government and come to Washington to petition for redress of grievances and to partake in the processes of government. I am thrilled that this legislation, responding to the safety needs of the system, is moving forward with speed now. It is essential that we continue to invest in the Metro, to upgrade its safety, to upgrade its efficiency and its reliability. The Federal Government was instrumental in the creation of Metro at the beginning, along with Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. We all send representatives to the board of Metro. The Federal Government has representatives on the board of Metro. We are equal partners in it, and I want to make sure that everyone here in Congress feels deeply invested in the success of Metro, which, after all, gets a lot of our staffers to work every day. With passage of H.J. Res. 76, Congress reaffirms its fundamental commitment to America’s Metro system. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage of this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ). Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Chairman GOODLATTE , for his work on this matter and for yielding the time. I appreciate his leadership in bringing this forward. I rise in support, Mr. Speaker, of this resolution, HJ. Res. 76, offered by the gentleman from Maryland, the minority whip, Mr. HOYER . We have very much a regional partnership that is essential for Metro, and this resolution today reflects that. It lends congressional approval to the new interstate compact between Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to establish an independent State safety oversight program, in this case known as the Metro Safety Commission. The previous iteration of the Metro safety oversight body was known as the TriState Oversight Commission, and in response to various accidents, inadequacies, and outright failures, the previous Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, used the authority that we in Congress, together, working with our regional delegation together, gave him to temporarily take over the safety oversight role of Metro through the Federal Transit Administration. But it was only meant to be temporary control. We still need a permanent body to provide this invaluable safety oversight for WMATA, and the passage of this legislation in the House today brings us one important step closer to that goal. I also would like to mention that, because we had not done this in the timeframe initially allowed, the FTA did give notice to the Metro Safety Commission it had to be in place on or before February 9, and when it wasn’t, 
they suspended some of our Federal funds. Now, with this today, we hope this initial withholding, which equated to $8.9 million and is expected could total $15 million, that now that can move forward. I have a letter that I include in the RECORD , which is signed by our regional delegation in support of now releasing those funds. 
Washington, DC, June 30, 2017. Hon. ELAINE CHAO, Secretary, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC. DEARSECRETARY CHAO, As representatives of public transit customers in the Commonwealth of Virginia, we write to express our concerns regarding the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) February 10, 2017 decision to withhold federal transit grant money in response to incomplete efforts to establish a new State Safety Oversight Program (SSOP) for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). On February 8, 2016, the FTA gave notice that the Metropolitan Safety Commission (MSC), a new SSOP to succeed WMATA’s TriState Oversight Commission, must be in place and certified by the FTA on or before February 9, 2017. On February 10, 2017, with no new SSOP certified, the FTA announced it would exercise its authority to withhold five percent of federal funds authorized in fiscal year 2017 under the Urbanized Area Apportionments Program (49 U.S.C. 5307). The initial withholding equated to $8.9 million, and is expected to total $15 million if he withholding continues to the end of the current fiscal year. This withholding will not just impact funding for WMATA, but for broader infrastructure maintenance throughout Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. The decision to withhold these federal funds has created significant uncertainty amongst state and local governments in terms of budget planning and stability. Should the withholding of funds continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, the governments and their transit systems will be faced with a number of difficult decisions about the manner in which they allocate their limited resources. Under a worst case scenario, they would be forced to make cuts to state of good repair efforts or reduce service to their respective communities, either of which would be harmful to our constituents. We agree safety must be a top priority, but eliminating funding for infrastructure repair would directly contradict a SSOP’s stated goal. Given the FTA must engage in this process with 29 other transit agencies nationwide by 2019, we appreciate the complexity of the issues that were considered in making the decision to withhold these funds. However, we must emphasize—as many of us have expressed previously either directly to you, your predecessor, or the FTA—that the timing of both the notice and the deadline set by FTA were arbitrary in that there seemed to be little or no consideration of the legislative calendars of the Virginia General Assembly or the General Assembly of Maryland. The FTA timetable effectively gave Virginia and Maryland less than one full legislative session to negotiate amongst each other and the District, draft the proposal, navigate it through the respective lawmaking bodies, and sign it into law. The unreasonable requirements FTA put forth were not simply for the SSOP to have a legal foundation by the February 2017 deadline, but to have the program fully certified by FTA, which necessitates months of work after passing legislation, including, but not limited to, appointing commissioners, hiring staff, and leasing office space. We are therefore led to believe that FTA either set their requirements without providing fair consideration to the unique institutional challenges that exist within the jurisdictions, or the FTA set them with a deadline so unrealistic that failure was unavoidable. Given the concerns we have raised in this letter regarding FTA’s shortsighted approach to this matter, and in light of the demonstrated progress which has been made, we respectfully request that your office work with the FTA to explore a compromise in which part of these withheld funds can be released as a show of good faith, as the jurisdictions continue their work to construct a stable SSOP. Lending further justification for this request is the real progress that has been made with respect to organizing the MSC. At the time this is written: Virginia, Maryland, and the District (the jurisdictions) have each enacted legislation to enter into an interstate compact to form the MSC; The jurisdictions have submitted a detailed draft certification plan to FTA for review (though FTA has not yet provided formal feedback on the plan); Joint resolutions have been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate to grant Congressional approval to the MSC compact; The Senate has passed its version of the joint resolution; The House Judiciary Committee, which has sole jurisdiction over the joint resolution, has ordered the House’s parallel version of the resolution to be reported favorably to the full House; and We are requesting that the measure be taken up for consideration as soon as possible. We appreciate the FTA’s important safety work, especially its temporary safety oversight role with respect to WMATA. Without FTA’s diligence, more harm may have come to WMATA’s customers. But we must find an equitable solution to this matter. We look forward to partnering with you, Madam Secretary, as well as the FTA to ensure safety remains the top priority in all transit systems and that reforms are made to accomplish a transit agency that provides safe, reliable service to our constituents. We appreciate your thoughtful consideration of this request. Sincerely, BARBARA COMSTOCK , Member of Congress. BOBGOODLATTE , Member of Congress. ROBERT J. W ITTMAN , Member of Congress. TIMKAINE, United States Senator. MARKR. W ARNER , United States Senator. SCOTT TAYLOR , United States Senator. 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, we in the region have worked together on these issues and, with this congressional approval and with the help of my colleague, Chairman GOODLATTE , took this to the Judiciary Committee, who will now be able to begin the process of improving Metro in connection with our State and regional partners. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), our distinguished minority whip, who has been a longtime champion of the Metro system. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I was tempted to stop at that podium. One of my Republican predecessors used to come over here a long time ago and speak to Democrats from this podium and then walk back and speak to his Republican colleagues. This is truly something that both podiums support. It is a bipartisan effort. I was privileged to work with Congresswoman COMSTOCK ’s predecessor, Frank Wolf, and we worked arm in arm, hip to hip, shoulder to shoulder for a decade with Republican administrations, both the Reagan administration and with the first Bush administration, and this truly is a bipartisan effort to enhance America’s subway. I say ‘‘America’s subway’’ because not only do our people use it that live in the region, but millions of Americans who come to Washington, D.C., to see their Capital use their Metro system. I am proud to be the sponsor of this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it. People throughout the National Capital region depend upon Metro to get to work, reach family and friends, and access shopping and entertainment, as so many of my colleagues have already said. It is the lifeblood of the area’s economy. Nobody probably knows that better than GERRY CONNOLLY , who was the head of one of the largest subdivisions in our region and knows how critically important Metro is to our region. Metro—I have referred to it as the ‘‘ties that bind the Washington metropolitan area together’’—is used by millions of visitors to our Nation’s Capital who come from across the country. It is critical to the functioning of our Federal Government, with Federal employees making up nearly 40 percent of its ridership. They and many military personnel rely on Metro to get to their offices and duty stations on time so they can serve the American people. As anyone who spends time in this city knows, Metro has had its share of challenges in recent years, including, of course, safety issues that have prompted an ambitious overhaul of safety procedure and infrastructure, which was absolutely necessary and too long in coming. Safety must continue to be Metro’s number one priority both for its passengers and for its employees. Our resolution, Mr. Speaker—when I refer to ‘‘our,’’ the entire metropolitan delegation—would provide congressional consent for the establishment of a Metrorail Safety Commission—Mrs. COMSTOCK spoke of that; Mr. R ASKIN has spoken of that; I am sure others will as well—which will provide real enforcement teeth to our region’s commitment to enhancing Metro safety. The safety commission is being launched jointly by Congress, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. 
I want to thank Ms. N ORTON , who, herself, has worked so long and so effectively on behalf of Washington’s Metro system. Thank you very much, Congresswoman NORTON . The Federal Transit Administration is currently withholding approximately $8.9 million, which Mrs. COMSTOCK referred to. This step will be a significant step in making sure that that $8.9 million is released. Maryland, Virginia, and D.C. have all given their approval already, the Virginia Legislature, the Maryland Legislature, and the D.C. legislature. Now it is up to Congress. But today’s resolution is not an end. It is an important step, but not an end. It must signal an ongoing commitment across the region to Metro and, yes, by the Congress itself. I believe that if Metro is to become safer and more reliable, it must have a dedicated funding source. That is not the issue in this resolution, but it is the issue before Metro and before our region and before our country. That is why I will continue to push for more Federal investment in Metro and for WMATA to have every resource it needs to keep its riders and employees safe, which is to say all of the American people who use it on their visits here as well as those of us who live here. I want to thank each of the Members of our delegation, our regional delegation, who work together on behalf of the region; and I want to thank, in particular, Senator TIMKAINE from Virginia, who sponsored this legislation on the Senate side. We have all been working hard to ensure this resolution comes to the floor and to make sure all stakeholders have been at the table. I thank my delegation, the regional delegation, and I thank Mr. GOODLATTE  for bringing this resolution to the floor in a timely fashion; and I thank certainly one of our newest Members but one of our most able Members, Mr. RASKIN . Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ), a distinguished Delegate. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that my friend, Mr. RASKIN from the State of Maryland, has yielded this time to me. First, I want to thank the senior member of our delegation. I thank the acknowledged leader of this entire bipartisan delegation, Mr. HOYER , for being the chief sponsor of this resolution that is bipartisan because it concerns the seamless Metro system, seamless because you can’t get from one part of this region to the other part of this region without Metro and because this subway is the only subway which encompasses more than one State. It encompasses three jurisdictions. Therefore, we are bipartisan because there is no other way for us to exist. The transportation network requires it, and this resolution does, in fact, shows our bipartisanship. b1730 This resolution is quintessentially important, because it creates a safety commission for Metro. Now, along with other Members, we see Metro in at least two different ways. We see it, of course, in light of our own constituents. Metro makes it possible for entire neighborhoods to be created, entire parts of the region to be connected. Metro has promoted economic growth, but far more important than any of our individual jurisdictions is the importance of Metro to the Federal Government. You may have heard the figure 40 percent today; almost half of the Federal employees get to work through Metro. When Metro has a snow day, the whole region shuts down. We are in this Congress by ourselves. If Metro has a snow day, nobody can get to the Congress of the United States or to the Federal Government. Metro is absolutely critical, and therefore, a safe Metro is essential to all that happens in the Congress of the United States, quite apart from the tourist economy that the District, Maryland, and Virginia are a part of, quite apart from our own local economies. More important to us all is the safety commission embodied in this joint resolution. Metro is useless if it is not safe. And we know what happens when it is not safe. In 2009, there was a tragic accident in this region. Nine residents lost their lives, seven of them from the District of Columbia. Anybody could have been on that train. In 2015, there was a smoke accident. One woman was killed, another D.C. resident. So an interstate safety commission is necessary if there is to be a Metro at all. I applaud the local lawmakers from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia for doing their part to support this jurisdiction safely kneading together the three parts of the region, and I urge my own colleagues to give them permission to move forward. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ), my good friend, for yielding time. I rise today in support of this legislation, which I was happy to cosponsor with Mr. HOYER and our colleagues in the metropolitan region. The joint resolution would establish an independent safety oversight commission for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority that will be empowered to create new safety rules, impose fines, issue subpoenas, and direct additional funding toward safety priorities. Consideration of the joint resolution in the United States House follows the passage of companion legislation in the Virginia and Maryland General Assemblies, the Council of the District of Columbia, and the United States Senate. The joint resolution before us represents the culmination of more than a year of multijurisdictional, multistakeholder collaboration, and is an example of the kind of bipartisan cooperation we need moving forward for Metro. For several years now, Metro has been a system in crisis, all lights blinking red. The lack of a strict safety culture has resulted in derailments, falsified track inspection reports, fires, track defects, and, as Ms. NORTON just indicated, has tragically claimed lives. The previous safety oversight body, the TriState Oversight Committee, was admittedly ineffective and failed to safeguard Metro personnel and customers. It was clear the safety crisis at Metro needed further Federal intervention. While I am glad that the U.S. Department of Transportation took action, I would have preferred that the Department act in accordance with the NTSB recommendation that it be the FRA, not the FTA, that provided that day today safety oversight. Very simply, the FRA is and was better equipped to pick up this vital mission and run with it from day one, rather than to learn on the job with a modern, contemporary transit system, as the FTA has had to do. It is my hope that enactment of this joint resolution will finally convince the FTA to reverse its misguided decision to withhold $8.9 million of Federal transit grants from Virginia, Maryland, and D.C. The FTA announced the withholding of that money on February 10, because the jurisdictions had not yet established a fully certified Metrorail Safety Commission before the FTA’s own arbitrary deadline. The decision to withhold the funds, penalizing other transit systems not related to Metro, which is authorized under the Urbanized Area Apportionments Program, was crude and punitive, and the process that led to the decision was anything but neat. The 1year timeline imposed on the jurisdictions to establish and certify the Metro Safety Commission ignored both the unique legislative calendars of the citizen legislatures in Maryland and Virginia as well as the timeconsuming, FTAmanaged certification process itself for State safety oversight programs. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. The 1year timeline imposed on the jurisdiction ignored those unique legislative schedules, but the decision to withhold money as a punishment for missing an arbitrary deadline was announced at a time, ironically, when all three jurisdictions were, in fact, moving simultaneously to enact just such legislation, as was requested. 
This is no good deed going unpunished, Mr. Speaker, and the FTA did not publish its own toolkit, application, or program standard for the oversight program certification process until February 14 of this year, 4 days after they withheld the money punitively from those three jurisdictions. They couldn’t meet their own deadline. As the House and Senate move to enact this joint resolution, I hope to renew my request of the Secretary of Transportation to reverse entirely the FTA’s bad decision to block safety and maintenance investments that are so desperately and obviously needed here in the Metro system in Washington. I ask my colleagues to support the joint resolution before us today and to recognize that it is a big step forward in the region and in terms of bipartisan cooperation. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, may I just inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland has 4 minutes remaining. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, when I was a kid in high school, they built the Metro system here. It was a great feat of bipartisan leadership when they built the Metro, and it changed my life. It was the jewel of our region, and it opened up, to at least one kid, the Capitol, the White House, the museums, the National Gallery, the Hirshhorn, the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, and it was really a spectacular and resplendent addition and feature to the Virginia, D.C., Maryland region. In the intervening years, there has been inadequate investment in safety, efficiency, and reliability in the Metro system, and we need to bring the Metro back to its original glory and we must make sure that, above all, it is safe for the people who ride it. The safety and security of the passengers is essential. So passage of this resolution will ensure the establishment of the safety commission to assume effective oversight of this system and to allow for the disbursal of Federal transit funds to Maryland, Virginia, and D.C. for essential transit services. I urge all of our colleagues to support this bipartisan measure. Again, I want to salute all of the Members who have been involved in this legislation, and I thank House Judiciary Chairman GOODLATTE for facilitating consideration of the resolution by both the Judiciary Committee and by the House. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to say that this has been a good bipartisan collaborative effort. I thank Minority Whip HOYER , Congresswoman COMSTOCK , and the other Members from the region for their work to assure that safety measures do move forward with regard to the Metro here in the Washington, D.C., area. And this legislation is critical to accomplish that, so I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 76. This resolution would grant the consent and approval of Congress for Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact establishing the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission. I support this bipartisan measure for several reasons. Most importantly, this Commission will help improve the safety of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority—also known as WMATA, which provides transportation services for millions of people each year. Last year alone, nearly 180 million riders traveled on WMATA’s commuter rail system. In fact, more than 760,000 riders used that system on just a single day in March of last year. Unfortunately, there have been a series of serious safety violations at WMATA in recent years, some of which have tragically led to deaths and injuries. Even though such dangerous conditions are obviously inexcusable, they nevertheless have persisted for many years. There are numerous causes, which range from aging infrastructure, years of neglected maintenance, uncertain funding, and poor oversight and management. In response to these critical concerns, the District of Columbia—together with the states of Virginia and Maryland—have each passed legislation agreeing to enter into an interstate compact establishing an oversight commission dedicated to improving the safety of WMATA. Clearly, this undertaking will help ensure WMATA’s passengers and workers—as well as the many communities that WMATA serves—have a safe, efficient, and reliable mass transit system. In addition, H.J. Res. 76 warrants our support because it implements Congress’ 2015 directive to the states to establish legal and financially independent state oversight authorities responsible for the safety of fixed rail transit facilities within their respective jurisdictions. By granting our consent and approval of the interstate compact to be established pursuant to this Resolution, we are fulfilling our responsibility to help ensure the safety of our Nation’s rail system. Finally, prompt consideration of H.J. Res. 76 is imperative not only because of ongoing safety concerns, but also because of financial concerns that serve to exacerbate the safety concerns. When Congress issued its 2015 directive, it did so with strings attached. A state’s failure to comply with this directive would result in a suspension of federal rail transit funding. Accordingly, the Transportation Department’s Federal Transportation Authority suspended its distribution of federal transit funds to the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia earlier this year and it continues to do so until the new safety commission is established. Thus, every day that goes by without action on this Resolution, is another day that these jurisdictions are deprived of critical federal funding. So, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the immediate passage of H.J. Res. 76. The safety and reliability of our Nation’s commuter rail transit system should be the standard for other metropolitan areas to aspire to. Unfortunately, much improvement is necessary to reach this critical goal. H.J. Res. 76, however, will hopefully provide an important opportunity to address the system’s safety shortcomings. In closing, I want to thank Representative STENY HOYER , the esteemed author of this critical legislation. His commitment and leadership are to be commended. Accordingly, I strongly support this bipartisan measure and urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it as well. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. J. Res. 76, which grants consent and approval from Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission. As Houston is a major transportation hub, I understand and appreciate the importance of this legislation. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), an interstate compact agency, provides transportation services to millions of people each year. It is imperative that the WMATA be safe and effective as it is essential to the commerce and prosperity of the National Capitol Region. The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland intend to create the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to act as the state safety oversight authority for the WMATA system under 49 U.S.C. 5329. In title III of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (section 3026, Public Law 114–94), the Congress provided sole authority to the Secretary of Transportation to appoint Federal Directors to the Board of Directors of the WMATA and required the signatory parties to the Compact to amend the Compact as necessary. This compact is created for the benefit of the people of the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland so that there may be an increase in their safety, commerce, and prosperity. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. J. Res. 76. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the joint resolution, H.J. Res. 76, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, July 17, I missed three votes to attend to constituent business in my district.

b1915 CONGRATULATING JAMES HAUTMAN (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate James Hautman of Chaska, Minnesota, who recently won the Federal Duck Stamp Contest for the fifth time. This year, James’ design depicts three geese flying at sunset. Since 1934, sales of the Federal Duck Stamp have raised more than $950 million for the conservation of wetlands and national wildlife refuges all over our country. The money raised helps to preserve the habitat of hundreds of species, as well as provide clean water for many communities throughout the Nation. Last fall, a panel of five judges selected James’ submission out of 152 total entries, marking the fifth time that he has won the competition. Only two other artists, Mr. Speaker, have ever won the Federal Duck Stamp Contest five times, including James’ own brother Joseph. Mr. Speaker, I once again extend my sincere congratulations to James Hautman. Minnesotans are proud to see such a gifted artist from our home State get recognized and use his talents for such a great cause. We wish him the best in his future. f 
PUTTING AMERICA’S HARDWORKING FAMILIES FIRST (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, over the Fourth of July district work period, I met with my constituents across Chicago’s west and northwest suburbs. Despite the range of our groups and communities I spoke with, there was one theme that was on everybody’s mind: the urgent need for Congress to take action that puts hardworking families first. Across the country, working families are counting on us to invest in infrastructure, modernize our Tax Code, and help their children get the skills necessary for rewarding careers. Earlier this summer, the House unanimously passed the Thompson Krishnamoorthi Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This bipartisan legislation will modernize and expand career and technical education programs across the country by increasing funding and local control while expanding the cooperation that exists between educators and employers. The House has done its part to advance this legislation and support working families. Now the Senate must act and send it to the President for his signature. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO J. ROBERT MILLER (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COMER. I rise today to pay tribute to my friend, neighbor, mentor, and former Kentucky Commissioner of 
Agriculture, J. Robert Miller. Robert passed away last night at the age of 97. J. Robert Miller was a legend in agriculture, agriculture education, and Kentucky politics. He served as Kentucky’s Commissioner of Agriculture from 1957 to 1971 during the Louie Nunn administration. Before that, J. Robert was an agriculture teacher at Tompkinsville High School and always an active, lifelong farmer. Growing up in 4–H and FFA, my earliest memories include Robert Miller. He was a mainstay at Monroe County area livestock shows and FFA banquets, always helping out and offering advice to present and future farmers. J. Robert Miller was a great man who had a positive influence on countless Kentuckians. 
STOP THE BLOCKADE IN THE MIDDLE EAST (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I always applaud when the United States steps in and takes a leadership role to prevent war. I have traveled to the Mideast for many years as a Member of the United States Congress representing my constituents. I want to express my appreciation to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for the energy that he is putting into engaging Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Jordan, Egypt, and Qatar to be able to stop the blockade and the conflict that may continue to grow against Qatar. This is a region that many of these countries have been allies of the United States, the Southern Command is in Qatar, and, frankly, I think they need to be united against those terrorists that plague them all. I would also say that the UAE, as has been reported in the Nation’s newspapers, hacked into the emails of Qatar and put words in the mouths of their government officials that were untrue. This is not the way to proceed with peace and diplomacy. So I believe we should energetically and aggressively engage these countries to stop this blockade and begin to repair the collaborative efforts to ensure that we fight the war on terror together and not against. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Tillerson. I look forward to working with him as a Member of the United States Congress to bring peace to that region. 
RECOGNIZING PENN STATE CREAMERY IN HONOR OF NATIONAL ICE CREAM DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennyslvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Americans observed National Ice Cream Day, which is celebrated annually on the third Sunday in July. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan made the designation and also named July National Ice Cream Month. Our very own Penn State University is a world leader in dairy production and food science. Over the last 150 years, its Berkey Creamery has been an important Penn State landmark. Penn State has a herd of more than 200 Holsteins that are milked twice daily, which is the start of the university’s delicious ice cream. The methods developed by Penn State’s food and dairy scientists have made the creamery a world authority on ice cream and dairy manufacturing. Penn State’s legendary short course, which takes participants from ‘‘Cow to Cone,’’ has attracted some of the biggest names in ice cream, from Baskin Robbins to Ben & Jerry’s, from Hershey’s to HaagenDazs. For 6 days a year, industry professionals head to Happy Valley for the bestknown program dealing with science and the technology of ice cream. Congratulations to Penn State for being the industry leader, and happy National Ice Cream Month. f 
ENHANCING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE (Mr. CA´RDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I have the honor and the privilege of being a United States Congressman, and with that comes tremendous responsibility. We have a country of over 320 million people—men, women, and children. And right now, we may be days away or even a couple of weeks away from watching the United States Senate possibly change healthcare for America like we have never seen before. I hope and pray that my colleagues in both Houses and the President of the United States try their best to make sure that we enhance healthcare access rather than divert more than 20 million people away from being able to see a doctor. Just last week I was visited by some young folks and I was given this red band called ‘‘Will Power’’ for a little boy named Will, who has gone through many operations. If these bills see the light of day and the President’s desk and gets into law, people like Will just might not be around very much longer. Mr. Speaker, let’s hope and pray that we do the right thing. 
CONDOLENCES TO FAMILIES OF THE 2ND MARINE RAIDER BATTALION (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my condolences to the families of the 15 marines and one Navy corpsman who tragically lost their lives last week. These servicemembers were among the most elite in our armed services, with six marines and the sailor from the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion located at Camp Lejeune. The other nine were based out of Stewart Air National Guard Base located in Newburgh, New York. Many of them had been deployed and served in conflicts in the Middle East. These American heroes valiantly served and placed the needs of our Nation first. As the parent of a marine now deployed in the Middle East, it is with a heavy heart that I offer my condolences to the friends and families of these exceptional Americans. The greatest worry of family and friends is the tragic loss of a loved one who is serving; thus, it is important to honor and remember these brave men and the sacrifices they made to preserve our way of life. We thank them and remember them for their service and sacrifice. Semper fi. f 
CELEBRATING VERA POWELL’S 90TH BIRTHDAY (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 90th birthday of Ms. Vera Powell, who lives in Pooler, Georgia. Ms. Powell was born on July 16, 1927, in Tattnall County, Georgia, about 60 miles due west of Savannah. After graduating from Tattnall County High School, Ms. Powell dedicated her life to her family and raising her three children: Bruce, Linda, and Crystal. In 1994, Ms. Powell moved from Tattnall County to Pooler, Georgia, and became a member of the First Baptist Church of Pooler. Her love of God and fellowship with others turned into a meaningful role with the church’s weekly Sunday school class. Now she has been an active weekly participant, greatly contributing to the fellowship and scholarship with the class for the past 23 years, and is a staple of the church. The members of the congregation look forward to seeing Ms. Powell as she greets them at the church doors every Sunday morning. Ms. Powell’s family and friends celebrated her 90th birthday with a reception on July 16, 2017. Please join me in wishing this remarkable woman a very happy birthday. 
VOTER SUPPRESSION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, it is great to be here with you this evening and to talk about a very important topic. Before I get into the topic of this hour, it is with great honor that I rise today to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour with my dear friend, Delegate STACEY PLASKETT from the Virgin Islands, and also acknowledge our CBC chair, the Honorable CEDRIC RICHMOND  from the great State of Louisiana. For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congress, the constituents that we represent, and all Americans on this very important issue of voter suppression. Before I go into my remarks, Mr. Speaker, we do have some colleagues here that would like to also speak about this very timely and important topic. There have been many developments that have occurred over the last week dealing with commissions that are being formed out of the White House to help aid in voter suppression and other things that have been very troubling. So I am going to ask for the first speaker to rise, and that would be my colleague, also from the great State of Texas, from Harris County and the city of Houston, the Honorable SHEILA  JACKSON LEE, who has been very thoughtful and been a great voice on expanding the rights to vote of all Americans. I thank Representative JACKSON LEEfor taking the time during this hour to come out and talk about this very important topic. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ), the coleader of this hour, along with Delegate PLASKETT , for not only their astute leadership of the hour, but certainly of their astute leadership of the issue. I am delighted to join my colleagues. I thank the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. CEDRIC RICHMOND , for continuing to make sure that the conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus, is heard on these crucial issues. Mr. VEASEY , I am going to focus my issues—because this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. It is an American issue. I do want to personally thank you for your leadership as the named plaintiff of the Texas voter ID litigation, which has been—how should I say? I wanted to say Earth shattering—but it has been groundbreaking in its recognition of the diminishing of the rights of people to vote by a draconian voter ID law. We know that it has been somewhat modified, but your astuteness recognizes that, even in its modification, in the coming elections, we should be very wary of the effort that the State will utilize the voter ID law for voter suppression. So today I want to rise in the backdrop of the Shelby case, which many of us are well aware of. The Shelby case, which occurred in Alabama, was the unfortunate case that turned back the clock on the 1965 Voting Rights Act that had been working for decades with absolutely no problem; but, unfortunately, this conservativeleaning Supreme Court made decisions not on what is good for America, not even on what is good in terms of the law, but decided to eliminate section 5. b1930 I am reminded of the very astute words of Justice Ginsburg, very astute words, when she was appalled that the Supreme Court yielded to what I would consider misinterpretation, that there is no problem with discrimination and there is no problem with racism, and Justice Ginsburg very astutely said: Well, we have been very fortunate that the polio vaccination has all but extinguished polio in the United States. That is great news. But because we have extinguished polio, does that mean we need to get rid of the polio vaccination? And any commonsense thinker, any American, any hardworking American, would absolutely, because they love their children and their families, would have a resounding ‘‘no.’’ So why would you get rid of section 5 when there is documentation, unfortunately and sadly, of discrimination and of racism? Racism is a question of being discriminated against because of race. It does not say Black, it does not say any particular type of race, but it does mention race. That means that section 5 was a protector for all Americans and giving them the added protection of one vote, one person. So, unfortunately, on June 28, 2017— and, by the way, Mr. Speaker, the pending meeting of this established Commission, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, PACEI, is going to be meeting July 19, this week. This is a dangerous phenomenon. The chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach wrote to the Nation’s secretaries of state requesting extensive personal information on American voters—personal information, when we have stood in this well fighting against the PATRIOT Act when it was not written well after 9/11 because its premise was to spy on the American people and to ignore the Fourth Amendment, which is to protect Americans against unreasonable search and seizure. This is unreasonable search and seizure. Let me list for you what this Commission is asking for. Some of this is public knowledge, but listen to this list: the full first and last names of all registrants; middle names or initials, if available; addresses, dates of birth, political party, if recorded in your State; last four digits of Social Security, if available; voter history—voter history—what elections you voted in from 2006 onward; active and inactive status. I would venture to say that if I asked my Republican colleagues if they want their constituents sending this information in I would hear a little bit of grumbling. Canceled status; information regarding any felony convictions. All these are State issues. Information regarding voter registration in another State; information regarding military status; and overseas citizen information. First of all, there is no documentation of massive voter fraud. ‘‘The right to vote, and the sanctity and privacy of the vote, is protected by the U.S. Constitution, including the Fifth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. Due process. All of these allow you to have a degree of privacy. It is an obligation of your administration,’’ which is a letter to President Trump that I am reading from, ‘‘to preserve the sanctity and privacy of the vote, not to undermine it as would be the case if Texas were to comply with the PACEI’s unconscionable request. The only approved government use of voter registration data, outside of voting, is jury selection, not a Presidential Advisory Commission of dubious purpose formed to search for nonconsistent evidence to vindicate your false claim that you lost the popular vote by 2.9 million votes, the largest loss in American history, because ‘millions of people who voted illegally.’’’ As you well know, that was a statement that no one can document by this present administration. So this Presidential Advisory Commission is a doubling down of an executive order to find a problem that does not exist. It is a solution, a false solution, seeking to find a problem. It is a dangerous proposition. It is an invasion of the privacy of the American people. And any good person who believes in the right to privacy, any conservative, liberal, moderate, anyone with any political philosophy who believes in the Constitution of the United States should stand arm in arm together against PACEI. It is the beginning of Big Brother, the arm of Big Brother, the frightening Big Brother, to intrude into the homes of the American people and to secure information that is, in fact, challenging whether you can move from one State to the next, challenging whether or not you can have a voter card canceled or expired, challenging individuals who have been given pardons but had a felony, and challenging military persons who move from place to place. This is an insult, and this is 
clearly voter suppression, not in any way a way to speak to the issue of fraud. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to take this very seriously. I have asked my State to stand down. I have asked the President to pull this request, and I, frankly, believe this executive order should be eliminated. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  two documents related to this. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, July 6, 2017. President DONALD J. T RUMP , The White House, Washington, DC. 
[From Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas] TRUMP ’SVOTER FRAUD COMMISSION IS A  FRAUD AND SHOULD BEDISBANDED NOW Unable to cope with the brutal fact that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2.9 million votes, the largest vote deficit of any president in American history, Donald Trump tweeted that he would have won the popular vote but for ‘‘millions of people who voted illegally.’’ Instead of producing any credible evidence to support this claim, a hoax that has been repeatedly and decisively debunked by experts, the President doubled down and issued an Executive Order establishing the ‘‘Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity’’ (PACEI), appointing Kris Kobach, antiimmigration warrior and posterchild for voter fraud conspiratorialists everywhere, to lead the Commission. It would be more accurate to characterize the PACEI as the ‘‘Presidential Advisory Commission on Vote Suppression.’’ Voter suppression is real but the oftrepeated claim that American elections are rife with voter fraud is a myth. According to a comprehensive 2014 study published in The Washington Post, out of more than a billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014, only 31 credible instances of impersonation fraud were found, and even this tiny number was likely inflated because the study’s author counted not just voter fraud prosecutions or convictions but all credible claims. Numerous other reports have reached the same conclusion. Any lingering doubt regarding the true purpose of the PACEI should be laid to rest by the request made by Commissioner Kobach on June 28, 2017 when he wrote each of the nation’s state secretaries of state requesting that they provide the Commission with ‘‘the full first and last names of all registrants, middle names or initials if available, addresses, dates of birth, political party (if recorded in your state), last four digits of social security number if available, voter history (elections voted in) from 2006 onward, active/inactive status, cancelled status, information regarding any felony convictions, information regarding voter registration in another state, information regarding military status, and overseas citizen information.’’ The information requested by the Commission will not prevent voter fraud. It will violate rather than protect voter privacy. And it will make it easier to craft legislation and devise campaign strategies intended to suppress the vote in urban clusters and among targeted demographic groups, particularly minority voters. It is important that all voters, and the people of the 18th Congressional District of Texas whom I am privileged to represent, be fully protected. While supplying only public voter information may seem secure, the sad 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by holding up this map, which indicates the colors of the individual States that are only slightly adhering to this Commission. The orange and the blue are individual States, some that are not adhering and some that are giving basic public information, but not all the personal information. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I hope we can collectively fight against the suppression of voters, and I thank him for alerting the American people to this severe attempt to perpetrate a wrongness, which is that there is voter fraud, and that we should not violate the privacy of Americans. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my fellow Texan and colleague for her timely remarks. I think the American public really would be interested in what she talked about with the criminal background history that this Commission wants. I know that there are a lot of people—both Democrats and Republicans, quite frankly, people of all political stripes—that made mistakes when they were younger and now maybe they go and vote. They are good Americans. They assimilate themselves into society. They have learned from their mistakes, and they would be very disturbed to know that this sort of information about something that they did when they were 21 years old and now they are 40something years old, they would be very disturbed to know that this type of information was being collected. I thank her for raising that issue. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ), my friend, to also speak on this issue. I thank him for taking the time to come out here today and share some of the concerns that he has. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from Texas for sponsoring this CBC Special Order hour. It is a great responsibility and a responsibility that he has done remarkably well in governing the time and the topics on which we speak. This is a timely topic, Mr. Speaker. In a single decision, the U.S. Supreme Court set ablaze decades of progress by overturning critical portions of the Voting Rights Act. Four years after Shelby County v. Holder, voter protections that many Americans rely on are again under assault. Following that decision, we saw an eruption of unjust voting laws. It is an unfortunate historical fact that, in the absence of Federal safeguards, some States will erect prejudicial barriers to voting. States previously under Federal overview were emboldened and, shortly after the ruling issued, blatantly added discriminatory rules that directly affected minority communities. Sadly, one of the most significant and imminent threats to accessing the polls comes directly from the administration. Since the inauguration, the Trump administration has withdrawn from longstanding legal challenges to discriminatory voter laws and created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity that will investigate the President’s wildly unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. These sorts of actions and rhetoric only reassure States that discriminatory voting laws will be tolerated and upheld in this administration. I urge Congress to take responsibility and restore vital voter protections that have secured the integrity of our democracy for more than 50 years. Although the Shelby decision was one of the most disruptive judicial decisions in recent American history, passing good voting rights legislation will redeem America’s promise of a fair vote for everyone of eligible age. It appears that protecting America’s basic right to vote will be a task reborn with every generation. Obstacles to voting are no longer as blatantly obvious as literary tests and poll taxes. Unjust voter ID laws, voter intimidation, and unfair gerrymandering create barriers to the polls for individuals from all skin colors and age groups. Although these actions appear insurmountable, they are not. Voter suppression is an affront to the Constitution and will not be tolerated. If we continue to resist all attempts to turn back voter protections, we will be successful and once again stand proudly on the right side of history. Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that this Nation appears to be going in reverse. Gains that have been made by people who weren’t necessarily considered citizens when they first arrived here, but property, have had to look to these rulings and laws being created in order for them to have the rights every other American has. The hands that built this great building could not vote, were property. But it is a beautiful symbol of this Nation’s history. The ancestors of the people that helped build these beautiful buildings here will be rolling over in their graves to learn that equality and rights for all are still under attack. So, Mr. Speaker, the CBC and, I hope, the whole Congress will be vigilant in this area, making sure that all Americans, regardless of where they come from, where they started, and when they were allowed and even seen as citizens, have the right to vote in this great country. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, particularly for pointing out about the 
hands that built this building. That is something that is not widely known, that the hands that built this building were not hands of free men but hands of slaves that built this building that we stand under today, that people come and admire from all around the world, and we admire this building as a symbol of freedom. But the hands that built it were not free hands. And of course what followed emancipation in this country—Jim Crow, voter suppression, and all of those things—once we finally got past the late sixties and seventies, to see some of that coming back again is very, very disturbing, and I want to thank him for his timely comments on that. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ). I thank her spending so much time here on the House floor working the Special Order hour, and particularly when it comes to the thing that we are so worried about right now, which is the voter suppression commission. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman VEASEY for yielding. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to stand on this floor, but when I think that tonight I have to stand here and talk about the topic that the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to speak out against is a sad day. Mr. Speaker, I thank my classmate and colleague and friend, Congressman MARCVEASEY , for taking a leadership role and for making that clarion call to ask us to come. b1945 Many of us will come tonight and speak out. Several of us will file our message so it can be recorded. Others will be back in their districts fighting for voting rights. This is something we have to do because, unfortunately, it has been over 50 years since President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which has been the most powerful tool in defending the voting rights of minorities. The Voting Rights Act, as you have heard tonight and you will continue to hear, outlawed the harassment, the intimidation, and the violence that many African Americans experienced when trying to exercise their right to vote. It ended some of the most overtly discriminatory practices in our country’s history by banning literacy tests, appointing Federal examiners in certain problematic areas to register voters and monitor elections, and criminalizing voter intimidation threats and coercion. Also key to the Voting Rights Act, you have heard many of our attorneys explain it and talk about the creation of the preclearance process that required certain places with some of the worst histories of discrimination to gain approval from a Federal court or the Department of Justice before making election changes. However, Mr. Speaker, during my first term in Congress, I became a part of this history. It was in 2013 that the United States Supreme Court struck down this crucial provision of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County v. Holder decision, opening the door for States to reduce—I am going to say that again, Mr. Speaker—opening the door to reduce the electoral power of minority communities. And with that door open, many States are taking this opportunity to pass a slew or a wave of laws, including strict voter ID requirements, early voting cutbacks, and registration restrictions, making it harder for many hardworking Americans to vote. That is just not right. Every citizen should have the right to vote. Following the 2016 election, President Trump falsely claimed that millions voted illegally, perpetuating the myth of voter fraud long used to justify restrictive legislation that suppresses voters in lowincome areas. I stand here today to tell you that it is not true. And when the Congressional Black Caucus hears the President of these United States using terms like ‘‘voter fraud’’ or ‘‘illegally voted,’’ we can read between the lines, Mr. Speaker. He is signaling his intent, in my opinion, to suppress the vote. He is signaling the support for efforts that will make it even harder for poor people, people of color, women, elderly people, to vote, one of the fundamental rights that we have to vote. While the legislative maneuvers to restrict our citizens’ fundamental right to vote should shock the conscience, it has not, and that is why we are standing on this floor today. That is why we are asking Democrats and Republicans to work together to correct this wrong. We have witnessed the history of some 50plus years of what happened to many people in some of our Southern States. Mr. Speaker, it is just not right, and that is why we are here today. As former President Barack Obama said: ‘‘This is something that has constantly been disproved.’’ As a matter of fact, ‘‘This is fake news.’’ Now, one of my colleagues came to the floor tonight and said this is not a Democrat or a Republican issue. Well, let me say it a little differently. This should not be a Democrat or Republican issue; but if it were a bipartisan issue, we wouldn’t be standing here in this Special Order hour demanding and asking that we come together, as Democrats and Republicans, and restore the voting rights. So let me be very clear. The Congressional Black Caucus, through the leadership of our chairman, Congressman CEDRIC RICHMOND , through the leadership of our powerofthehour chair, Congressman MARC VEASEY , and the other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, one of the largest minority caucuses in this House, we stand ready to advocate, we stand ready to protect those who we come here to protect. So as elected officials, we have a responsibility to ensure the right of ‘‘one person, one vote,’’ and part of this responsibility includes making it easier, Mr. Speaker, not harder for citizens to vote. And we will not stop our quest in ensuring justice for all Americans. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative BEATTY . I really appreciate her participating again and her comments, and we are going to take her call and continue to push on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I would like to invite my friend and colleague up from the great State of Pennsylvania, Representative DWIGHT EVANS , to also speak about this subject. Of course, throughout the history of African Americans, Philadelphia and Pennsylvania have played a very critical role. I am glad that my colleague from Pennsylvania is stepping up and speaking about this very timely issue of voter suppression in the wake of Shelby County. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ). Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the great State of Texas, Congressman VEASEY , for his leadership under Congressman RICHMOND , and for what he and Delegate STACEY PLASKETT have been providing over the last couple of weeks. Right now, as Members of Congress, we are in what I call an Article I, section 1 moment. Article I, section 1 in the Constitution grants us this power. We need to harness the power of the process to ensure that accountability and transparency for Philadelphians, Pennsylvanians, and all the American people. We know that voting is a fundamental right, and we know that the Federal Government should not be in the business of dealing with personal information of voters nationwide. Philadelphians, Pennsylvanians, and Americans have a right to privacy. Myself and my colleagues before you today intend to do everything we can to ensure privacy is guaranteed and protected. The Trump administration has yet to instill confidence and garner respect from the American people. Voting is a right that cannot and will not be taken away. The right to vote is a core American value and guiding principle that must be protected and not tampered with in any way. Believe me when I tell you, President Trump, we know what you are trying to do here. We see the actions of your administration for what they are. Our neighborhoods are at risk of voter suppression, and we cannot and will not stand for it. Last week, I was proud to join my colleagues, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Chairman RICHMOND , and the United States Senator from New Jersey, when they stood up last week and introduced a piece of legislation to revoke President Trump’s executive order. 
I am proud to stand with the Governor of my State and my friend, Governor Tom Wolf, who has been very outspoken in speaking out for Pennsylvanians all across the Commonwealth and clearly told the President he will not disclose personal PA voter information. I want to leave you with a quote from Dr. King: ‘‘We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.’’ I have lived my entire life in the City of Philadelphia and know that it is a sanctuary city. We are so much stronger when we celebrate our differences and use them as strengths to uplift us. We will not accept this voter suppression. Together, we will ensure the choir of our voices are heard loud and clear. We have an obligation to build a stronger tomorrow for all of our neighborhoods. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus to send a message, a message and a voice that we will not just sit here idly by. We will not allow this process to just run roughshod. As I said from the beginning, this is an Article I, section 1 moment where we all recognize that we, in Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, recognize that we have an obligation and responsibility to the American public. And this is not about partisanship. This is about a fundamental right, and we don’t take it lightly. So I applaud the leadership, again, of my colleague from the great State of Texas, for what he is providing here, and all the members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments and appreciate him taking time out to talk about this very critical announcement. As soon as everyone in the Black community, Black communities around the country, and elected officials around the country who are concerned about voter suppression and other tools and tactics that have been used to suppress the AfricanAmerican vote, we went to action, and I appreciate that the gentleman was one of the first people to step up and appreciate his participation tonight. Mr. Speaker, my colleague, Congresswoman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , who was not able to make it here this evening, will be including a statement in the RECORD . She represents the 30th Congressional District of Texas and is my nextdoor neighbor. She represents Dallas and the southern suburbs of Dallas. I appreciate her weighing in on this topic as well. Mr. Speaker, the foundation of American democracy is that, no matter who you are, we are all equal once we step into that voting booth. And the courage that has been displayed by brave foot soldiers who risked and, in some cases, gave their lives to guarantee that constitutional promise was fulfilled must never be forgotten, and this is really important to point out. I mean, we have Representative JOHN LEWIS, who is a hero of the civil rights movement. But I always encourage people to watch the documentary, ‘‘Eyes on the Prize’’ so they can see how people were treated, how people were treated by law enforcement, how people were treated by people who were in positions of power, people who were active in the community, people who belonged to the Lions Club, belonged to the Elks Club, the way they treated people who were simply trying to register to vote. There is one scene that I will never forget; it was about a woman who was trying to go and vote, and she was being kicked and shoved and hit and knocked to the ground by law enforcement in Alabama for simply trying to exercise her right to vote that was given to her in the early 1900s when women in this country were finally given the right of suffrage. It is really in their memory that Congress originally passed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. And for years, both Republicans and Democrats reauthorized the Voting Rights Act, agreeing that equal access to the polls must be preserved for generations to come. But sadly, Mr. Speaker, in 2013, that tradition dramatically changed. The Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder struck down section 4 of the Voting Rights Act and made Congress responsible for updating the VRA. The Court has left it to Congress to create a new formula for determining which States and other jurisdictions should be discovered under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to ensure protection against discrimination. But 4 years later, we can confidently say that the Supreme Court ruling set into motion what most of us feared— that minorities and lowincome Americans would have to face unfair and punitive barriers from exercising their most basic right as American citizens, and that is the right to vote. b2000 In the years since the Shelby County decision, Republican legislatures nationwide have been in power to unleash an avalanche of purposely restrictive laws that have been aimed to keep, again, mostly Black and Latino voters away from the poll. Even when you do discovery and when you look into why these laws were passed by State legislatures, it is clear what the intent was. It is a tactic that the Republican Party has indirectly endorsed, since they believe that trying to earn the vote of the growing minority population, that they would rather keep them away from the polls altogether. Prior to Shelby, States with a history of voter suppression and discriminatory practices were required to preclear any changes in their election laws with the Department of Justice prior to enactment. But now, in the absence of an updated VRA, States no longer require the DOJ’s approval. I want to talk about my own State, the State of Texas, which has really served as an incubator for the suppressive tactics that Republicans nationwide have been eager to enact for years. I saw this up close and personal in the 8 years that I spent in the Texas Legislature, where I saw Texas Republicans enact SB 14, which severely restricted the types of IDs that voters could bring to the polls in order to cast the ballot. Texas Republicans claimed that limiting acceptable IDs would prevent widespread inperson voter fraud. As vice chair of the Voter Identification and Voter Fraud Select Committee in the Texas state house, I witnessed how Texas Republicans failed to produce any piece of evidence to prove that massive voter impersonation was occurring statewide. Hearing after hearing—you can go back and look at the record, going back to 2005—I and my other colleagues who served on the committee and who were concerned about some of the voter suppression tactics asked the question: Show us evidence that voter suppression is taking place. We have time here during this legislative session. That was what we would ask over and over again, and not one person could bring any evidence that this had happened. Their flawed argument justified limiting voter IDs and instead favored an approach that would exclude student IDs but actually say that it was okay to use a concealed handgun license as a form of ID. What is interesting about that is that these student IDs, campus law enforcement, which, in the State of Texas, where I am from, again, if a kid has alcohol or if someone is roaming around campus and the police need to be able to verify who they are and identify them, that student ID that is issued by a State university in the State of Texas serves as ID for law enforcement personnel on those campuses to be able to verify whether that student is, in fact, who they are and belongs on that campus. That same ID, again, that is issued by the State of Texas could not be used to go and vote. It just doesn’t make any sense. When the law was enacted, of course, the DOJ blocked the measure. However, hours after the Shelby decision, Governor Perry enacted Texas’ restrictive voter ID law. I became a named plaintiff in the case because I knew that, despite Republicans’ claims that the law would disproportionately disenfranchise Latino and AfricanAmerican voters—the State’s own estimates showed that it would potentially disenfranchise over 600,000 Texans who are registered but do not have one of the required forms of ID. And there are lots of different reasons why people may or may not have an ID. If they were born in a foreign country and they are now American citizens, they may have a hard time getting access to some of those documents. They may not have the money 
or the transportation to go to the county that they were born in to be able to get the documents that they need in order to get one of these IDs. Again, there are costs and there are transportation and geographic barriers that may take place. You may have people who were born in the country by midwives, and they are particularly AfricanAmerican baby boomers and older that migrated from places like Longview, Texas; Marshall, Texas; Tyler, Texas, and they weren’t really even raised in those cities. They were raised in smaller towns outside of those cities and they may not have those proper forms of ID. Remember, segregation was very rampant back then in Texas, and many people were born by midwives, were born in their houses and what have you. There are variations of spellings of last names. I have that in my own family. There are just so many other examples of that. I am proud to report that two Federal courts, including the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is easily considered by most to be the most conservative appeals court in the country, have found the law to be discriminatory in its intent and its effect. Despite this victory, we knew that Texas was only the beginning. We have heard about so many other laws around the country that exclude people from being able to register to vote unless they have a passport, or unless they have their birth certificate, which makes it almost impossible for nonprofits to set up a table at a busy grocery store, for instance, on a Saturday and do any sort of voter registration. There are just all sorts of issues out there. There are organizations like King Street Patriots, for instance, that pride themselves on their ability to try to suppress the minority vote. Again, Texas was only the beginning. And, sadly, Mr. Speaker, unless we can find a new way to come together to do what is right when it comes to suffrage in this country, it seems like this is going to be something that we have to fight for a long time. Now, sadly, I am ashamed to say that our President has also taken a page out of the Republican playbook and has begun to perpetuate the same myths about widespread voter fraud that, sadly, we have been fighting since the Reconstruction era, Mr. Speaker. Very, very, very sad. Nearly 3 months after winning the Presidency, President Trump could not handle the fact that, despite winning the Presidency, he lost the popular vote. And unsatisfied with the results, President Trump does what he does best: he went to Twitter to blame his unpopularity on widespread voter fraud. And, worse, now he has created this Presidential commission on election integrity. It is a sham commission that will, no doubt, work to justify claims that elections are being compromised by our own citizens and serve as a catalyst to continue the wave of voter suppression and intimidation that we have witnessed across this country. I am proud that the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Asian Pacific American Caucus have all gotten together to introduce legislation to ensure that not a single dollar from the taxpayers is spent towards this phony commission. Again, I think that everybody should be concerned about this commission. Any commission that wants to gather private information on citizens, put it in a database, information that—quite frankly, mistakes that people made back when they were in college. There are a lot of people out there that I know, that I went to high school and college with, people that I have known around the Fort Worth and Dallas community for a long time, all around the State of Texas, they made mistakes when they were younger. Maybe it was a DWI. Maybe it was some other sort of issue, but they have assimilated themselves back into society. They are working. They are paying taxes. And the fact that this database would want to take the mistakes that they made in their youth and put them in this database and to look at whether or not they are committing some sort of fraud is just something that—again, doesn’t matter if you are Democrat or Republican, there are a lot of people out there who made mistakes when they were younger. It is just awful that this could come back to haunt them. The fact is that the voter fraud myth has been debunked by various reputable research organizations, including the ACLU, the Brennan Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, and the Pew Research Center, to name a few. But that has not changed the fact that Republicans and now our President want to turn back the clock on voting rights. It is really sad, Mr. Speaker. The commission recently requested sensitive voter information as part of their fake investigation, and we are already seeing the effects. Out of fear of having their Social Security, voting history, party affiliation, again, their criminal background history that I talked about in a concentrated voter base, news sources have already reported voters deregistering to vote. That is sad because that is exactly the type of voter intimidation that Republicans want to nationalize. House Republicans have purposely dragged their feet on updating the VRA and ignored their duty to uphold the Constitution and ensure the sacred right of all Americans to be able to cast their vote. Even as these courts begin to rule against the purposely prejudiced tactics of these GOP State legislatures, it is up to us to bring our voices together and lift the veil on their true intentions. It is our duty now to stand up against these discriminatory practices that are being implemented nationwide, because the President’s sham commission will have its first meeting this Wednesday, and we have to send one message loud and clear: We will not allow voter suppression to become normal. We have to make that clear. I thank my colleagues for working alongside me in this fight, because every member of the Congressional Black Caucus is talking about this in their district when they are going back, townhalls, various other events that are out and about in their respective areas that they represent around our country to let them know what is in store. I have got to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I am confident that we will once again be able to ensure that the sacred right to vote is not denied to a single American. It has been overcome a lot. We are going to continue to overcome this, just like we have after the Reconstruction era, like we did in the 1960s, and we are going to fight this all the way until we get the fairness that we want. I want to remind everybody that there is going to be a voter suppression forum tomorrow that members of the Congressional Black Caucus, along with the House Judiciary Democrats, will host on this very topic, voter suppression in the wake of Shelby County, which is the name of the Special Order that we are working on right now. And Members will hear from Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes and others about the President’s voter fraud commission and the bipartisan backlash that it is facing. The forum will be livestreamed on the House Judiciary Democrats’ Facebook page. I invite all Americans to join in this very important and crucial conversation that is going to be taking place on Wednesday. I thank everybody again that came out to participate for this Special Order hour on voter suppression in the wake of what happened in Shelby County. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to speak out against voter suppression. Voter suppression is a serious issue that threatens the integrity of our elections. While the Congressional Black Caucus members have highlighted their numerous concerns, we should all be deeply involved in combating voter suppression and expanding access to the polls for all Americans—particularly in the wake of the destructive ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. When fellow Texan and former President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, our country was in the midst of wrestling with literacy tests, the purging of voter rolls, and intimidation by those who wished to keep minorities and other vulnerable segments of the population from casting their ballots at the polls. It was a difficult time in our nation’s history, but one that we seemingly overcame together in a broad recognition that all Americans should have equal access to the polls. The positive effects of the Voting Rights Act grew quickly apparent. 
Following passage of the VRA, nearly 1 million black voters registered to vote within just four years, including over fifty percent of the black voting age population in every southern state. We witnessed the number of black elected officials in the South more than double, from 72 to 159, following the 1966 elections. By the mid1980s, there were more African Americans in public office across the South than throughout the rest of the nation combined. More than fifty years later, we are once again faced with the same fight under a different, more sinister guise. The United States Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby v. Holder has brought our nation back to our darkest times in history. Discrimination on the basis of race is a persistent reality throughout many localities in states once protected by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act—including my home state of Texas. Absent these protections, many voters are at risk of losing their fundamental right to vote. On May 11, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order that would create an ‘‘election integrity’’ commission. The stated purpose of this commission was to combat voter fraud, but we know the true meaning behind an executive order of this nature. It is to repeat the egregious mistakes of our past and once again prevent legitimate voters from exercising their constitutional rights to vote. Mr. Speaker, the concerns of the Congressional Black Caucus and the concerns of countless Americans are worthy of our time in Congress. We must speak out against thinly veiled commissions meant to suppress the vote. We must bolster the Voting Rights Act to its former power and encourage others to combat voter suppression and protect unfettered access to the ballot. 
COMMUNITY PHARMACIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise and ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, tonight, as we come before the body, we have come back on a topic we have been here before on. It is really the hidden enemy, I guess if you would, of people and trying to get a drug pricing system, something where their community pharmacist, the independent pharmacist, it is that middle man called the PBM, the pharmacy benefit manager, who simply snuck in many years ago. b2015 It originally started as a good idea so that you could collaborate, you could get better drug pricing, you could get it to the consumer through rebates and through concessions. And as in all things, I guess, good ideas and greed just get in the way sometimes. We are at a point where this is an issue that I want to continue to highlight. We are going to do so in several ways. We are going to talk about some issues. I spoke with colleagues on the floor before about the really terrible actions of many in the PBM community, especially the largest ones that control over 80 percent of the market. There are only three of those that really control almost the entire marketplace of this and control plans that folks would understand very quickly. They control where you go, how much you pay, the formularies. It is down to that kind of a problem. Last year, when the world began to wake up to these issues of pricing and all of this came to light, they began to question why these drugs were costing so much, such as the EpiPen. Well, what they began to find out was that these were problematic issues. But if you wanted to really look at the baseline, you had to look at the pharmacy benefit managers, and you had to understand what they were doing that was causing a great deal of problems. We also have to go back to the basics. Community and independent pharmacists fill a critical niche in the healthcare system, serving the primary healthcare providers for over 62 million Americans. Community pharmacists are some of the most easily accessible health professionals, particularly in our rural areas. Mr. Speaker, this is an area that I really have talked about before. We talk about the healthcare chain being a complete chain, and it is not just the doctors and the hospitals; it is the pharmacist who is typically the face of healthcare for those after they have gone to their doctors or come out from the hospital to get the medicine that will continue to keep them healthy. You see, community pharmacists dispense roughly 40 percent of prescriptions nationwide, and a higher percentage in rural areas, such as mine. These community pharmacists regularly interact with their patients outside the pharmacy. They go to church with them. They go to shop with them at the local grocery store. The pharmacies are the sponsors of kids’ Little League teams. They are the ones who have the closest personal relationships to the healthcare chain, and they are a trusted source of medical care and advice. Pharmacists are also able to better treat patients’ illnesses with their regular interactions, identifying potential risk factors early on. For example, independent community pharmacists play a key role in ensuring a patient properly uses their medication. In fact, 83 percent of community pharmacists perform the critical patientcare role of providing medication adherent services. Patients’ failure to properly take their medication costs the healthcare system almost $3 billion and contributes to 125,000 deaths annually. Facetoface counseling by a trusted pharmacist has proven to be the most effective method for ensuring patients take their medications, saving thousands of lives and billions of dollars annually. Mr. Speaker, independent and community pharmacists provide multiple and valuable services, and we can talk about these services and the importance of a community pharmacist. I would be remiss if I did not mention the recent and tragic passing of someone known well in the pharmacists’ community for his contributions there. While I did not know John Carson personally, his death had reverberations throughout the pharmacists’ community. Mr. Carson was from San Antonio, Texas, and owned and ran his business there, Oakdell Pharmacy, for almost 50 years. He and his wife were tragically killed in a car accident on July 7, but the legacy Mr. Carson left behind as a father, a pharmacist, and former president of both the Texas Pharmacy Association and the National Community Pharmacists Association will live on. Tonight we mourn his passing but celebrate his achievements. I could mention individual pharmacists and their work on behalf of their patients for the rest of the evening, and I could have probably every Member of this body do the same. Instead, I will provide some information that shows the great impact on services the individuals have had. Sixtyfive percent of community pharmacists offer home or work delivery; 68 percent of community pharmacists offer immunizations; 83 percent provide medication therapy and management services; and 67 percent of community pharmacists provide monetary support to five or more community organizations. These are the guys you see sponsoring the Little League teams, the chili cookoffs, and that are true participants in our neighborhoods and towns. Unfortunately, the community pharmacists are in jeopardy across the country, in part, due to anticompetitive behavior and the lack of transparency surrounding practices of the pharmacy benefit managers. They have taken our community pharmacist, and they have abused their trust. Pharmacy benefit managers, especially in the system that we have today, are trying, I believe personally, to get rid of our community independent pharmacists because they have their own chain, their own distribution, and they own the supply chain. When they do, they want to take everything else out, and we have talked about that on many occasions here. So as we continue tonight, we are going to talk about these issues, as we go from pharmacists and what they have done well, some new issues that have come to light, some lawsuits, also some audits that have come out that show the real problem that we are seeing with this community, and also that 
they are having, but also just being run out of business. Imagine, Mr. Speaker, if you were just trying to get up every day and run your own business, and you had a giant conglomerate tell you and tell your customers that they can’t come see you anymore, not give you a reason. And if they are mistaken, they make you correct their mistake. I don’t know how it operates in the rest of the world, but that isn’t the way a business is supposed to operate. At this point in the evening, I have several of my friends from Georgia who are here to talk about these issues. First off is my friend from south Georgia; another one, who has been with me on many of these occasions, a Member who has seen this up close and personal, to talk about the issues that we have tonight. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT), someone we have been working with on the Armed Services Committee on a lot of things that are going on. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our Nation’s community pharmacies which play a critical role in our healthcare system. Many of these independent businesses operate in underserved or rural areas— like many of the counties in Georgia’s Eighth Congressional District, which I represent—where access to carriers is already an issue and would be worse if community pharmacies did not exist. In areas where a doctor can be many miles away, local pharmacists deliver flu shots, give advice on overthe counter drugs, and help with those latenight drugstore runs for a sick child. Many people in our rural communities see their pharmacists much more often than their doctors. There is a very personal relationship between the pharmacist, the patient, and the physician. As pillars in their community, they are also the businesses that contribute greatly to local economies. It is crucial that these pharmacies have an equitable playing field against largescale competitors and middleman pharmacy benefit managers when trying to run a successful business in a challenging and complex environment. I want to reiterate, Mr. Speaker, all they ask for is an equitable playing field. No advantages, just equality. Where I am from, local pharmacists are often a fixture in their communities. These pharmacists have known most of their customers all of their lives. They instill a level of trust that is unparalleled. I frequently stop in at local community pharmacies when I am back home in the district and never fail to appreciate the unique value they add to their customers’ lives. Unfortunately, on some of these visits, I am also troubled to learn how community pharmacies are finding it extremely difficult to serve the people who have depended on them for years and to compete with some of the larger entities in the healthcare marketplace. Take, for example, the increased prevalence of preferred networks in Medicare part D plans. Currently, many Medicaid beneficiaries are told by pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which pharmacy to use based on exclusionary arrangements between those PBMs and, for the most part, big box pharmacies. What most people don’t know is that, in fact, in several instances, these bigbox pharmacies actually own the PBMs that are creating these preferred networks. Patients must pay higher copays just because the pharmacy they want to use is excluded by the PBM, who again, as I said, in many cases, actually own the larger pharmacy that they force you to do business with. The majority of the time, the hometown pharmacy is never given the opportunity to participate in the network in the first place. Another issue I often hear about from community pharmacies is the burdensome DIR fees. Most Americans probably assume that it is a pretty simple transaction when they purchase medication from their local pharmacy. They go in, they pay a copay, and that is the end of it. But for the pharmacy, the transaction is anything but clear and simple. Pharmacy benefit managers use so called DIR fees to claw back money from pharmacies on the individual claims long after the claim is thought to have been resolved. That means that a pharmacy often doesn’t know the final reimbursement amount they will receive for a claim for weeks, or even months. Anyone who runs a pharmacy, or any other small business for that matter, knows you can’t operate when you don’t know what your reimbursements are. When competition is stifled and these small businesses suffer, so do hardworking Americans when they have had their choice to use a community pharmacy instead of a bigbox business taken away from them. Another issue I frequently hear about is the lack of transparency in generic drug reimbursements to pharmacies. Generic prescription drugs account for approximately 80 percent of drugs dispensed. The reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a complete mystery to all of us. Now, if it is unregulated with transparency, that is fine. But it is unregulated without any transparency. Pharmacists are often reimbursed for generics by what is referred to as the maximum allowable cost list created by the pharmacy benefit managers. But the methodologies used to create these lists are not disclosed, nor are the lists updated on a regular basis, which frequently results in pharmacists being reimbursed below the actual acquisition cost for various medications. In recent years, these extra costs that affect prescription drug prices in community pharmacies have fallen on consumers. Take doxycycline, for example. Doxycycline is a drug that is used to treat a number of bacterial infections. As a generic antibiotic, it has been around for decades. I want to repeat: it is a generic that has been around for decades. In 2012, 30 capsules of doxycycline cost approximately $15. In 2017, the same dosage cost $115. That is a price increase of 667 percent. I want to give you a realworld example of the impact this has on lowincome patients in the world. I have a wonderful OB–GYN in my area, and he told me that prior to the price increase, he would simply keep doxycycline in his office, and when he had a patient that needed it, he could simply give the patient—if it was a lowincome patient—the drugs instead of having them go to the pharmacy to pick them up. But with a 667 percent price increase, they could no longer afford to simply give the patients the medication that they need. Nitroglycerin tablets are another example. Nitroglycerin has been used to treat chest pain and stop a heart attack and has seen similar price hikes in the past few years. Again, it is a generic drug that has been around for decades—no excuse in the price increases other than flat out greed. A drug that is even more common that has been affected by the lack of transparency in the drug market is insulin. As you may know, millions of Americans with diabetes rely on insulin. They have to have it, or they will simply die. According to the American Diabetes Association, the price of insulin in America has nearly tripled over the past 15 years, making the drug nearly unaffordable for many diabetic patients. The dramatic price hikes of insulin is ironic since, in the early 1920s, Frederick Banting, one of the scientists who helped to first develop insulin, sold the patent for the drug for $3 because their goal was to make the drug affordable and easy to access for everybody in the world. Now, nearly 100 years later, one vial of Humalog can cost nearly $400 in the United States, where it costs a fraction of that in other countries around the world. In Canada and Mexico, the same dosage of Humalog costs less than half, or sometimes even a quarter of what it costs in the United States. I understand that there is a tremendous cost in developing lifesaving treatments, new drugs, and the next development that is going to save a cancer patient, but these are generic drugs that have been around for decades. These dramatic price increases, the international price disparities, they are occurring, again, on drugs that have been around for decades because of this pricing scam put in place by the pharmacy benefit managers. In the coming months, I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to address the lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical industry, giving community pharmacies an equitable playing field to compete, 
which gives hardworking Americans the choice of affordable prescription drugs and which pharmacy they choose to purchase those drugs from. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, Mr. COLLINS , for hosting this Special Order today. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. We have been talking about this, and I think what is amazing is, the more we have these, and the more we talk about community pharmacists and the issues that we find, people are starting to understand the real problem that exists here. Mr. Speaker, more than 250,000 individuals employed either on a fulltime or parttime basis by community pharmacies, these people’s livelihoods are facing consequential threats due to the often anticompetitive behavior of pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. Many people may have never heard of a PBM. Well, let’s give them a definition tonight. PBMs are middlemen who administer prescription drug plans. In fact, three primary middlemen control 78—almost 80 percent—of the market and control the pharmacy benefits of over 253 million Americans. b2030 PBMs process prescriptions for groups that pay for drugs and control drug formulation to determine what drugs are covered by specific plans. The three major PBMs—Express Scripts, CVS Caremark Health, and OptumRx—produce no tangible product. Let me repeat that. These three produce no tangible product. Yet they have a major impact on the way you and I access medication, on small business pharmacies, and even other small business PBMs. If you don’t believe me, just the other day, I was watching a business show, and there was a PBM—there was a transparent PBM who talked through this whole issue of fees, rebates, and everything else. They said: We show everything. Well, I challenge the three big ones to do it. They don’t want to because— if you started looking at actually what they did, they are what I have said many times—they are monopolistic terrorists. That is all they are in this market. Mr. Speaker, as an example of the major market power that PBMs have, I would like to point you to Express Scripts’ annual average revenue. That one company has average revenue of $101 billion. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am a conservative, freemarket business person. I love to see a business actually make money. But you don’t do it the way they are doing it. I am not decrying their profit. However, I am calling into question the business model of raking in massive profits on the backs of patients and small business pharmacists. You don’t do it that way. I brought this up on many occasions and only get excuses and obfuscations and everything from the PBMs going online and telling about how great they are but never addressing the real issue. The problem is relegated to the wayside far too long and is coming into sharp focus. In fact, Anthem, an insurer, is currently suing to end its contract with Express Scripts. It claims Express Scripts failed to renegotiate lower drug prices and withheld billions in savings. This lawsuit and stories surrounding it have called into sharper focus PBM tactics that community pharmacists have been grappling with for years. In just a few moments, we are going to hear firsthand about how that has actually been going on. Through a variety of practices, PBMs make life difficult and undermine competition for our neighborhood pharmacists and the patients that they serve. For example, PBMs have maximum allowable costs—MAC lists—that determine the maximum amount a pharmacist will be reimbursed for certain generic drugs. However, PBMs’ reimbursement price determinations are hidden, and there is no transparency in the process. PBMs commonly manipulate drug prices using what is called spread pricing. I would encourage, Mr. Speaker, those who listen to this and would want to be a part to look this up. Everything we are talking about is actual fact. PBMs charge employers a higher price for a drug than necessary and reimburse pharmacies at the MAC level, which is typically lower. Spread pricing allows PBMs to skim money from the difference between the high rate they charge for a prescription and the low rate they reimburse pharmacies. Spread pricing is artificially raising the acquisition cost of pharmacy drugs by overcharging at the expense of retail pharmacists, consumers, and health plans. You see, when we understand this, people say: Why is this a problem? Why are we talking about it? This lack of transparency is also a problem when PBMs administer taxpayerfunded programs like Medicare part D, TRICARE, or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Currently, we can’t ensure that the savings generated by costsaving rebates received by the PBMs are being passed along to government programs. PBMs can receive rebates to acquire prescription drugs at lowerthanadvertised costs, and PBMs can then charge the government the full cost for the drug even if a PBM has a significant discount. This deceptive practice increases the cost of prescription drugs for beneficiaries of Federal Government prescription drug programs. Let’s break that down, Mr. Speaker. When we talk about Federal drug programs, these taxpayerfunded programs, we are talking about my taxes, your taxes, and everybody else’s taxes. That is why this is important and needs to be addressed. This is what is the problem. This lack of transparency is unacceptable and jeopardizes the quality of care for millions of patients across the United States. Northeast Georgia has a vibrant pharmacy community, but its pharmacies are being threatened by the unfair practices of the PBM. The fact is—and I have made mention of this before—several pharmacists tell me that if something doesn’t change, we are going to see more and more of those pharmacies disappear within the next few years. I introduced the Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act to help address this situation. My legislation preserves pharmacy access for patients by allowing pharmacists to know the sources PBMs are using to set reimbursement rates for community pharmacists. PBMs’ prices are often based on incentives for manufacturers not disclosed for long periods of time. Oversights of PBMs ensure taxpayers are not footing the bill for generic prescriptions by providing transparency into how drug acquisition costs are determined. The Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act also prevents PBMs from forcing their customers to fill or purchase prescriptions from pharmacies owned and controlled by the same PBM. Let me go back over that real quickly. The PBMs, the pharmacy benefit managers, are allowed to force customers to fill or purchase prescriptions from pharmacies they own and control. There is no transparency here. They are simply controlling a system and running the market out. This means patients can keep the pharmacists they like rather than being improperly incentivized or coerced to use a PBM owned pharmacy. Finally, it would require PBMs to update their MAC pricing list every 7 days, codifying current CMS rules for Medicare part D and expanding it to TRICARE and FEHP. This legislation is vitally important to improving fairness and transparency in drug pricing and reimbursements to independent and community pharmacists. I will tell you this: I’ve heard story after story, and we will continue these tonight. The community pharmacists may be muzzled by PBMs, those that are still. There may be fear of retaliations. But I won’t let those concerns go unnoticed. We are going to continue to take this fight to the floor so there will be a voice for transparency and fairness for community pharmacists, for patients, and for taxpayers. Because if they think they can pull a fast one on the Federal Government at the cost of taxpayers, then they have got another thing coming. They may go in and intimidate and strongarm our community and independent pharmacists. They may threaten them to keep quiet. They may tell them not to go to their elected officials or have a voice to say that we think that there is a better way, or just to be able to compete on a fairness level without anything else except just let us compete. The PBMs may try to strongarm them and to silence them into submission, but they are not going to be able to silence me. 
They can’t audit me, and they can’t do that to the American pharmacist who is simply trying to be a part of this system. There is nobody that can understand that better than my friend from south Georgia. He is a pharmacist by training. He has left the pharmacies behind so that he can come up here and help us continue this fight for patient care and patient health all across this country. He is a champion in every sense of the word of this industry because, as the old saying is, he is one. He comes tonight to talk further and provide insight into this Congress. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). It is good to have him back in the fight tonight. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting this tonight and for his advocacy on the part of the community pharmacy, but, more importantly, on the part of the patients, because that is what this is about. This is about patients, about patient care, about escalating prescription costs. That is what we are talking about here, about unfair trade practices. This is America. Like my colleague mentioned earlier, I am not opposed to anybody making money. That is great. More power to them. But where there is a problem with transparency, there is a problem with PBMs. There is a problem with escalating drug prices. I want to mention that I have been a practicing pharmacist, as Representative COLLINS mentioned, for over 30 years. I have worked with my neighbors and my friends to really provide a helpful voice for their needs. Beneficiaries are facing increased costs in prescription drugs without much of a basis notification as to why these costs are skyrocketing. My friend, Representative COLLINS ; my friend, Representative SCOTT; others—even on the other side of the aisle—Representative PETER WELCH , Representative ELIJAH CUMMINGS , and Representative DAVELOEBSACK , this is a nonpartisan issue. Everybody has to have prescription medications. Whether you are a Democrat, whether you are a Republican, whether you are an Independent, it doesn’t matter. Everyone is the victim of escalating prescription drug costs. The problem is we have got to understand where that is coming from. I thank Representative COLLINS for his legislation, the Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act, to bring about greater transparency in the role that pharmacy benefit managers, the PBMs, have in the drug pricing structure. Many people don’t understand the structure or where the additional fees are originating from, which is often a direct result of the lack of transparency between the manufacturer and the dispenser. Let me repeat that. Many people don’t understand the structure. I will be quite honest with you. I have been working with this for over 30 years, and I still don’t understand it. In fact, I have got numerous examples of where CEOs have said they don’t understand it. It is intentionally—intentionally—complicated so that no one understands it. I had the opportunity last year as a member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. We had the CEO of Mylan pharmaceuticals. Mylan, of course, is the manufacturer of EpiPen. It went up in price. The EpiPen costs $600 for a dual pack. I said: Okay. When it leaves you, the manufacturer, you are the beginning. You are the manufacturer. How much have you got in costs? She responded: I have got $100, maybe $150 in costs. I said: Okay. You are the beginning. I am the end. I am the dispensing pharmacist. When it gets to me, it is $600— $150 at the beginning, $600 at the end. What happened in between? What happened in between? Now, a lot of times it is lost on some of my colleagues here and on the average American because all they are concerned about what the copay is, if the copay is $15 or if the copay is zero. Okay. But keep in mind that somebody somewhere is still paying that $600. In a lot of cases, it is the Federal Government through Medicare part D or State Medicaid plans. Somebody somewhere is paying it. But when you have the CEO of a manufacturer, when I asked her a direct question, ‘‘What happens in between that $150 and that $600?’’ and she says, ‘‘I don’t know,’’ and I am the pharmacist and I say, ‘‘I don’t know either,’’ somebody somewhere has to know. I can tell you it is the middle man. The most effective, the most immediate impact that we can have on prescription drug pricing is to pass this bill that Representative COLLINS has and to have transparency in drug pricing. Sunshine is the greatest disinfectant of all. If we have sunshine, we will have lower drug prices if we have transparency. I want to give a couple of other examples. My colleague, Representative COLLINS , mentioned about three PBMs controlling 80 percent of the market. That is not competition when you have got three companies that control 80 percent of a market. Did you know that Express Scripts, the number one PBM in the country, had gross revenues almost equal to McDonald’s, Ford Motor Company, and Pfizer pharmaceuticals added together? Added together, this one PBM. Now, again, I am not opposed to anyone making money. More power to them. But how are they making it? Nobody knows. Why don’t we have transparency? Everybody wants lower drug prices, and we have all got to do a better job. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have got to do a better job. Pharmacists have got to do a better job. GPOs have got to do a better job. But until we have transparency, we are never going to be able to get it under control. I want to give a couple other examples. The manufacturer of the hepatitis C drug has had so much criticism about the price, and it is too expensive. Gilead pharmaceuticals makes SOVALDI. SOVALDI accused Express Scripts of not warning them to go down on the price of SOVALDI. Gilead said: You never wanted us to go down on that price because you are getting a percentage rebate. The higher the cost of that medication, the higher rebate you are getting. My colleague mentioned about the lawsuit that Anthem has against Express Scripts. Anthem is not going to renew their contract with Express Scripts because they are suing them for billions—that is billions with a ‘‘B’’—of dollars, saying: You owe us billions of dollars. These are reallife examples of what I am talking about. That is why we need to pass the Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act that Representative COLLINS is pushing so hard, and has been, and we thank him for that. I want to also talk about some other bills here continuing in the theme of transparency. We have an opportunity to address the issue of retroactive DIR fees and the impact they have on drug pricing. My colleague, Representative SCOTT, mentioned DIR fees and clawbacks. DIR fees are having a negative impact on the ability to provide accurate and comprehensive services to the beneficiary. Those fees are a large unknown for pharmacists and don’t provide clarity on drug costs to the patient or whether they will be able to accurately meet the needs of their patients. Ultimately, the patient ends up being penalized, and that is an issue that must be addressed. Ultimately, what this boils down to is the patient—the patient, Mr. Speaker, the patient. Let’s stay focused on what we are supposed to be focused on, and that is the patient. We talk about drug costs and we talk about healthcare. We want accessibility, we want affordability, and we want patientcentered healthcare. b2045 That is what we want in prescription drugs, accessibility and affordability. Yes, they need to come down in prices. And again, the most effective, the immediate impact that we can have is to have transparency, transparency in the middleman in what they are doing. That is the reason why Congressman MORGAN GRIFFITH ’s legislation is helpful in bringing about stability. Pharmacies would no longer be penalized for providing the same quality service they always have simply because PBMs have shifted cost under a lack of transparency. With this legislation, we can keep costs down for beneficiaries. Now, I want to talk about another piece of legislation that another good friend, Representative BRETT GUTHRIE  from Kentucky has introduced, H.R. 
592, the Pharmacy and Medically Underserved Areas Enhancement Act, to address the role of pharmacists in rural communities. With this bill, many of the individuals who seek consultation, especially seniors, can contribute to receive quality input and expertise. There are many underserved and rural areas of the country where patients don’t have access to a primary care provider but have access to a pharmacist. Pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare professionals that we have. That is why provider status is so important. That is what we call this, the Pharmacy and Medically Underserved Areas Enhancement Act. Under this legislation, pharmacists can continue to service those rural and underserved areas and fill a role that is vital to the healthcare of these residents in these areas. I also want to compliment and commend Representative GRIFFITH again on his efforts to keep patients’ access to compounded medications intact. In June, he introduced a Preserving Patient Access to Compounded Medications Act of 2017. This bill will provide further guidance for the FDA, medical providers, patients, and compounding pharmacies about what constitutes pharmacy compounding and what is regarded as drug manufacturing. This legislation will provide a crucial balance between public safety and patients’ access to the medications they need. Lastly, the leadership of the Energy and Commerce Committee has been critical in advancing legislation both in the 114th and 115th Congress that will lead to research and development of new drugs and treatments. I commend my colleagues on their hard work and thank my good friends for the opportunity to speak tonight on this issue that is very important to me. Mr. Speaker, the President has identified escalating prescription drug cost as being one of his biggest priorities. He has said himself: If you are on the other side of research and development, you need to beware because we are coming after you. PBMs, you are on the other side of research and development, and we are coming after you. This is too important. It is too important to the patients who are trying to get these medications, who need these medications. All we are asking for here is transparency. All we are asking for is to shine the light on what is going on. I know they make it difficult to understand. It is a shell game. It is nothing more than a shell game. Again, I want to commend my colleague, my friend, Representative COLLINS , for his untiring advocacy on the part of community pharmacists and on the part of citizens who need and depend on their community pharmacists. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend. He has brought out so many things. And you know, Representative CARTER , one of the things that is off the top, when we talk about Mack Transparency, when we talk about this list we talk about, one of things they come back at us, and they say: Well, it is going to increase cost. You know, if you do this, it increases cost. And it is sort of interesting because in Texas, this actually happened in 2013, they did their top 200 drugs, and they were somewhere in the neighborhood of a little over $200. And then in just a matter of 3 years, those average prices of those 200 drugs dropped to below $100. We are both from Georgia when we were talking about it. That is going down. It is not going up. It is because they are actually having to show what they are doing. That is why this—don’t you agree that that is why we are having to do what we are doing here? Mr. CARTER of Georgia. There is no question about it. Let me, if I may. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Continue. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, if I might just give two examples. First of all, there is an example of Caterpillar. Caterpillar has done away with PBMs. They have done away with the third parties. They are doing it themselves. And you know what it has resulted in? Stable drug prices for the past few years. As opposed to the increases that most companies have seen, Caterpillar, when they cut out the middleman, they have had stable drug prices. They said: We can do this better. And they have done it better. Keep in mind—the second thing that I want to point out is, keep in mind, why were PBMs created? First of all, they were created to process claims, insurance claims. But what is their purpose? They will tell you our purpose is to keep drug prices down. Our purpose is to keep drug prices down. Mr. Speaker, how is that working out for you? They are not keeping drug prices down. They are keeping drug prices up. They are one of the reasons why drug prices are going up, one of the primary reasons. I can remember when I started practicing pharmacy in 1980. And I am proud to say that I am that old. I started practicing pharmacy in 1980. We used to buy directly from the drug companies. I would buy directly from Upjohn, from Merck Sharp & Dohme, from Squibb, from whoever. There was no middleman there. Now I can’t even do that. I have to go through the PBM. I have to go through all these different layers and layers in order to get the medication. PBMs, if their purpose is to control drug prices, then what is going on? Because drug prices are escalating. What a tangled web we weave. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is that, and I think the interesting thing is the middleman who produces nothing on their own. That is the thing. They don’t produce anything in this. They are simply—you know, I think I will just sort of describe it like I see it in northeast Georgia. It is like a tick on the back of a dog. They just simply suck profit off and do not do what you exactly just said. They don’t do what they just said. I mean, Caterpillar. You brought up Caterpillar. I will bring you some numbers with Caterpillar. Caterpillar started moving away from PBMs. They suspected that they could save as much as, in a quarter, $150 million in drug prices being spent inefficiently. They went back and did their own formularies. They worked this out so that they are on this straight, and just—the company saved 5 to $10 million per year in just cholesterollowering statins alone, one of the most widely prescribed medications, just in that right there. When you see how PBMs claim to save money, you look at the Caterpillar model. There are other models out there that are finally looking at this and saying: We can do this in a better way. And I appreciate your input tonight. I think that has been—you are just highlighting this that there are ways to do this. This is not the only way. And to go into State legislators, and to go into county offices, and to go into county governments, and the Federal Government, and to pull the wool saying ‘‘we are saving money,’’ while all along we are seeing this tangled web of DIR fees and clawback and no transparency. You know, it isn’t amazing to me that they are spending so much money on advertising right now. It is not amazing to me that they are trying to spend so much money claiming what we are saying is not true. But they never address the point. They never say this is not true. They simply say we are saving all this. I encourage the Energy and Commerce Committee to take these bills up, hold hearings on these things. They are not going to deny it, and they are going to find out that unfortunately what is supposed to be a help has been really falling backwards, and actually, you know—and really, even from the Federal Government, those community and independent pharmacists are not wanting. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, if I could just mention one thing, and I would be remiss if I did not mention this, because the gentleman has just brought up an outstanding point, and that is: What value are they bringing to the system? What value are PBMs, are middlemen, bringing to the system? That is what I would ask. Now, look, pharmaceutical manufacturers need to do a better job. They need to bring their prices down. But I will cut them some slack. At least they are using their profits to go back into research and development. At least they are doing that. PBMs don’t put one red cent into research and development, not one red cent. I repeat what I said earlier. I am not against anybody making money, but, Mr. Speaker, this is causing escalating 
drug prices. The lack of transparency is causing the problems that we are experiencing right now. The most immediate, the most effective impact that we can have on prescription drug prices is transparency. Sunshine is the greatest disinfectant out there, and we need sunshine. Thank you for what you are doing for the patients. Thank you for what you are doing for the people who are struggling to pay for their prescriptions. That is what this is about. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it has always been about that. I have come to this well and come to this floor on many occasions to talk about it. And when you look at the impacts they are having on DIR fees and these clawback fees that are coming back after the fact and not at the time of when there is no really need or cause for it, according to the Community Oncology Alliance, pharmacists lose $58,000 per practice, on average, to DIR fees each year. You know, this makes it completely—I mean, think about that. Mr. Speaker, if you had a business in which you had $58,000 just sucked away for no apparent reason, I mean, this is—we wonder why this is happening, and we wonder why people can’t get their drugs. We wonder why people wonder why can’t I get this drug? Why do I have to wait to get approval here? It is this area right here—DIR fees. And I do applaud my friend, Mr. GRIFFITH from Virginia, who has introduced this bill, and I am a proud cosponsor with him on this. You know, it is amazing today to see when patients—when this happens in Medicare part D, the beneficiaries are going through this process, and really what happens, it increases the problem called the doughnut hole, and they are hitting that doughnut hole sooner, forcing them to pay out of pocket for their drugs. And when patients pass through the doughnut hole into catastrophic coverage, CMS takes on most of the cost of burdensharing. Now, here is where it gets important, Mr. Speaker. When CMS picks it up, the cost increased from 10 billion in 2010 to 33 billion in 2015. You cannot tell me DIR fees are not part of that problem right there. You cannot tell me that what they are doing is now taking—they are simply reaching into your pocket, Mr. Speaker. Maybe you can feel it right now. You can feel that hand going into your wallet. You can feel that tax money being taken out and being taken away, sucked away by PBM through these fees and DIR fees, and they are getting into it through Medicare part D. And 10 billion to 33 billion increase is simply from 2010 to 2015. Pharmacists are at distinct disadvantage when DIR is taken and collected from pharmacies after point of sale. There is a lack of transparency in the detail provided to pharmacists, and the retroactive nature of these fees creates operational and cash flow challenges for pharmacists. Think about having something that you think you have one price on, and they come back and say: No, you messed it up. We talked about so many different things. We talked about how PBMs can come in and audit basically their competitors. We talked about how they can send out letters to a pharmacy’s clients and say: This pharmacy is no longer taking this prescription plan. And then when the pharmacist points it out, they say: Yeah, you are right; you still have the plan. And the pharmacists have the audacity to ask: Would you please send a letter to these people who you just sent a letter to and tell them you were mistaken? And the PBM said: No, we can’t do that; you will have to do that on your own. Is this America, Mr. Speaker? Where do we operate like that? And we wonder why our healthcare system and these community pharmacists are bearing the brunt of it. At the end of the day, it is about people. It is about moms and dads. It is about kids. It is about those folks who simply want a healthcare system that works. And one of the most visible parts of the healthcare system is the community pharmacist, the one who dispenses the drug and asks them: How are you doing? How are the kids? Are you taking your medicine? And they will ask those questions that maybe some of us just don’t want to ask our doctor. You know, you might just ask that pharmacist that question and say: Really, what does this do to me? That is what we need. And as long as they are being frontally assaulted, retroactively assaulted with DIR fees, and generally pummelled out of business, the PBM will continue to just drown our community and independent pharmacists. And as long as that happens, there will be myself and others in the well speaking the truth and pushing our committees to do something about this, because at the end of the day, businesses ought to operate properly. But when you are affecting the taxpayer dollars, when you are going after taxpayers, and you are doing so in a way that takes pharmacists out of the loop, you have threatened them, you have done everything else you can to them, well, the day is over, this Congress will continue to fight. And there are many Members who are learning what is going on, and it is now time I challenge this body and the committees of relevant jurisdiction to take this issue up because we are not going to stop. And we will be back soon, Mr. Speaker, with some more details on this issue and how much it can be effective. And with that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak, and thank you, Congressman COLLINS , for your leadership and persistence on this critical issue. Community pharmacies are so important to our Districts. There is nothing like walking into your local pharmacy, and the pharmacist knows you by name. He knows your medical history. He knows what you need. He knows you. As one community pharmacist described, ‘‘People call me all hours of the day and night. They know where I live, and they come to my house if they need me.’’ These local pharmacies are in danger of disappearing across the Nation. Why? Because PBMs are running them out of business. Pharmacy Benefits Managers, or PBMs, claim to act as middlemen and help pharmacies and manufacturers find the best deals for their patients. It’s a great idea. Despite these PBMs’ promises, I have heard from more and more pharmacy owners in my District who say that many PBMs are in reality ripping them off with various unethical tricks of their trade. PBMs are often dictating the prices charged by manufacturers and pharmacists or insurance plans. PBMs are a key problem behind drug price inflation. One critical aspect of their strategy is gag orders that they impose on pharmacists and manufacturers in contracts, thereby silencing dissenters under threat of being excluded from networks or formularies . . . in other words, under threat of being blocked from buying and selling in the drug market altogether. Often, PBMs use what they call clawbacks. The outright cost of a drug might only be $40, but the patient might have to pay double or more than that price through their insurance. Too many times, pharmacists have to decide between two choices: either violate their consciences by watching often lowincome patients pay exorbitant prices—or tell the patients to buy the drug outright, saving them money. But the second choice comes with a threat . . . because if a pharmacist informs her patients about how to save money, she is violating her contractual gag order imposed by PBMs. A pharmacy consultant recently interviewed by the LA Times accurately described PBMs like this—‘‘The PBMs are sitting at the center of a big black box. They’re the only ones who have knowledge of all the moving pieces.’’ But awareness of PBMs’ deceitful practices is increasing. More and more pharmacists and manufacturers are speaking up and exposing PBMs. One endocrinologist and professor of medicine at the University of Washington recently said, ‘‘It’s becoming very, very common to see patients intentionally withholding their insulin.’’ Doing so can be deadly, but patients are often facing $300 per vial and need two vials a week. There are three PBMs that control the market: ExpressScripts, OptumRx, and CVS Caremark. These three PBMs rake in over $200 billion a year and are responsible for 290 million Americans through their contracts with both private insurers and government programs like Medicare. CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is ‘‘wising up’’ to PBMs. In June, CMS proposed a new guideline for Medicare Part D PBMs. If finalized, this guidance will address PBMs’ common practice of imposing retroactive fees. 
b2100 KEEPING AMERICA’S SKIES SAFE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BACON ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ) for 30 minutes. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I am here to talk for a few minutes about the FAA reauthorization act, better known as the AIRR Act. Now, this particular bill has two components: modernization and privatization. President Trump, being a great businessman, the very astute businessman that he is, has told us that we need to modernize our airspace, our air traffic control facilities, everything that allows us to continue to have the safest and busiest airspace, literally, in the world, and I agree wholeheartedly with our great President that we do need to modernize. The issue that I have is with the privatization part. As mentioned, our airspace is the busiest it has ever been. On a daily basis, somewhere between 87,000 and 88,000 flights take place in the airspace of the United States of America. We have been asked to compare our air traffic control system with that of our great neighbor to the north, Canada, but the issue with that, Mr. Speaker, is that Canada only has a small, small fraction of the air traffic that we have here in the great United States. The U.S. airspace is unique because it is a public resource that is accessible to all users, and it is protected by the fact that the air traffic organization, under the FAA, is directly accountable to Congress, but more importantly, to the American people. Handing over that control of air traffic services to a private corporation, as this AIRR Act wants to do, will put the interests that right now are under the tutelage of air traffic control to a board of directors that may not have the interests of the American taxpayer and the consumer as its foremost priority. Under the plan that is in the AIRR Act, this corporation will not be answerable to Congress. The only thing they will have to do is to provide reports on its operations every now and then. Under this plan, Congress has ceded its oversight over a major component of interstate commerce and, might I add—very important—national defense. There is also very little oversight from our executive branch, the President. Decisions by the corporation to change safety standards or to reduce air traffic services will be subject to minimal scrutiny from the Department of Transportation. Also, as stated, the President will have limited authority to take command of the airspace unless there is a declaration of war. On the cost and the funding uncertainties, I have an issue with this AIRR Act. The CBO predicts that this plan will cost the Federal Government— which, by the way, is us, taxpayers—$21 billion over the 10year budget window, but this doesn’t take into account any other factors that will probably exceed that cost by many, many billions, and that is with a B. The administration’s fiscal 2018 budget paints a fuller picture of the costs, and it estimates a $46 billion cost over the same 10year period. Mr. Speaker, we have got enough budget problems without adding more gasoline to the fire. The problem is that this revenue is critical for filling the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which pays for popular programs like the Airport Improvement Program that communities all across the country rely on for their airport improvements, to pay for infrastructure upgrades, runway overlays, lighting, taxiways, those types of things that are essential for an airport to work. The FAA bill before us authorizes more funding for the Airport Improvement Fund program, which is great, but it is still uncertain where these funds will come from. What makes up for the shortfall? I don’t see it in this bill. Mr. Speaker, I represent a great swath of the great State of Louisiana, good, good people, a lot of them in a rural community that are far away from any major metropolitan areas. My concern with this AIRR Act is that a private corporation concerned with raising money from user fees will be heavily incentivized to go to where the users are: the East Coast and the West Coast. My question and my very much concern is: What happens to all of us in between that East Coast and West Coast? I worry that we will be left out of the mix and be left out of the equation because we will not be as able to contribute to user fees because of the population. Decisions to change air traffic services can too easily be justified by this corporation, this private corporation that is talked about in this AIRR Act, and will face minimal scrutiny from the Department of Transportation. A reduction in air traffic control services means a reduction in enplanements and a reduction in revenue at small, regional airports, just as I alluded to, and this makes it even harder to access the funding from the Airport Improvement Program. All of these factors taken together will exacerbate the problem with access to air travel for 95plus percent of the people in America, and this is hard for rural areas. They have a hard enough time making ends meet. They don’t need the extra costs and the extra burden of traveling to a large city, maybe spending the night at a hotel to catch an early flight, the cost of transportation just so they can catch a flight to some other part of the United States. The taxpayer seems to be on the hook here, too, under this AIRR Act. Under the plan, the Federal Government would simply hand over all the air traffic control assets to the private corporation free of charge, and this will negate decades and hundreds of billions—again, that is with a B—of dollars in taxpayer investments that the corporation will be able to dispose of and sell as it sees fit. The plan will also create a potential multibilliondollar unfunded liability for the Department of Defense to upgrade its systems to be interoperable with the new ATC corporation. What if the private corporation has one set of systems, our Department of Defense doesn’t have that, but they have got to be talking to each other? This is a national security issue. And again, who pays for that? Well, again, the taxpayers would certainly be on the hook to bring the Department of Defense up to speed. Again, this is something that we need to look very, very closely at in this bill. The board of the corporation is not restricted in how much debt it can take on, and this sets up a very dangerous potential for a taxpayer bailout that, although this bill says it won’t happen, I again question because these are the same types of promises that we got with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
and we know what happened then and how much the taxpayer had to dole out to bail them out. I have alluded to the safety and national security issue, and I want to hit that a little bit harder. Under the plan, the oversight from the air traffic safety organization—it is called ATSOS, Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service—sunsets after 2 years. My question with this AIRR Act is: What happens after the 2year window? Who watches the gate? And I do worry about that. What happens if there are major safety breaches? And certainly we don’t want any accidents, but what happens if there is a major accident after 2 years? When it comes to the operation of our skies—safety, safety, safety. It trumps everything because we have lives at risk every day. I go back to my opening remarks. We have the safest system, airspace in the world, and I am concerned that this safety could be jeopardized if our airspace is controlled by a private entity that is primarily motivated by raising revenue. Control of our airspace is a critical function of national security. As Federal agencies, the FAA and the Department of Defense currently share airspace, training systems, assets, equipment, and information. Divorcing ATC, air traffic control, functions from the Federal Government and inserting an unaccountable thirdparty private contractor into the coordination of our airspace will make us more vulnerable to attack. The private ATC corporation that the AIRR Act is touting will have access to highly sensitive information regarding strategic operations in our airspace without the same standards of protection that are required of Federal agencies, so I worry about leaks, those types of issues. There is also a labor issue that, really, nobody is looking at, I am afraid, in this AIRR Act. I know many air traffic controllers personally. I fly in the United States airspace personally a lot. These are good, dedicated people, and I admire the work that they do every day to safely operate our skies; however, the major labor unions successfully negotiated to get every carveout they wanted under this plan. Mr. Speaker, I am a small government guy. I am the guy that stands up on the curb and says we need less government. There are limited areas where I personally believe government, our Federal Government, should be involved, but those are national defense, national security, major infrastructure projects like interstates, maintenance of large river systems, and aerospace and airspace. Everything else, let’s let the States and the local governments handle it. I think they can do a better job. But in this case, in our national airspace where we have both civilian and military operating, again, tens of thousands of times a day, then we need to take a step back and look at our safety record. It has been impeccable for the last several years, and these air traffic controllers are doing a phenomenal job. My concern, again, is that this private corporation that is in this AIRR Act that we will be asked to vote on will be required to hire all Federal air traffic organization employees, but they will continue to contribute to their Federal benefits and healthcare and continue to collectively bargain with their union representatives. So, for me, trying to argue that this model of ‘‘privatization’’—and I will use that in quotation marks—will increase efficiency and keep operational costs down, these labor provisions that we are giving them in this bill are not a very good ringing endorsement. So if we are going to talk privatization, let’s not have a hybrid here. We need to keep it the way it is. The airspace in America, no one can compare the size, the traffic, the complexity. It is just a phenomenal work of art that happens every day and, again, in a very safe manner. Try to compare us in America with any other system, whether it be the United Kingdom, whether it be Canada. It is like comparing apples to oranges. Again, our volume is so massive compared to any other country that you really can’t compare them at all. I want to give you an example. I wrote this down so I would get it right. It says, in 2016, the FAA handled over 16 million flights in the U.S.—16 million, think about that—while NAV CANADA, which is the private corporation that handles Canada’s airspace, only handled 5 million, 5.5 million, in the same year. b2115 It is impossible to say whether a system similar to Canada’s could be adopted in the United States. Mr. Speaker, I have flown in Canadian airspace. I have lost radar contact; I have lost communications; and that is, again, not any shun on Canada. They are a vast, large country with large swaths that are uncovered with radar, I am sure. But again, when I am up there talking to them, the times I have been up there, there may be only one other aircraft in the system or in that area with me. Back in the United States, I have been in many situations in large areas like Dallas, Houston, or Chicago where it is so busy that you have to wait to get a word in edgewise. But when you do, you get very succinct instruction. You get vectored properly the right way, and you get separation of the small guys like myself from the large guys like the big airline carriers. Again, this routine happens thousands and thousands of times a day, and it happens without incident or accident. So again, we have got a system that is working. Again, I am all for modernization. We need new equipment. We need better equipment for our airports and for our air traffic controllers. Again, if it makes the system work more efficiently, I am all for that. But again, why take the air traffic controllers that have done such a great job for so many years out of the loop. Modernization should be a goal of any system, and it doesn’t just mean our airspace. Anything we can do in government to make it better and more efficient, I am all for it. Again, I am your less government guy. But in this instance, privatization of air traffic controllers is not the answer, especially when it means handing over the control of our airspace, the taxpayers’ airspace, to a private board unaccountable to the Federal Government. And I don’t know, Mr. Speaker, but history tells me that they may come running back to Congress for a bailout when times get tough. I hope that doesn’t happen if this bill should pass. Again, I am opposed to the bill. But we know it has happened so many times in the past when we have allowed situations like this to develop. Can the Federal Government do a better job in implementing NextGen technology? NextGen technology is the next generation. Again, we live in a phenomenal world of technology. I am living proof of a pilot that used to fly with what we called steam gauges, where we had to look at things much differently. Now I fly in a cockpit that is completely digital. I am in awe of what I am flying in my little airplane as compared to what I was flying in just a few years ago. But we want that technology to be handled in the proper way. The FAA management issue can be fixed by this Congress. Again, I go back. We have invested billions of dollars in this next generation technology. I simply don’t want to take that pile of money and that technology and hand it to this private corporation and say: ‘‘Here, guys, it is yours now.’’ This is not what we are paid to do up here in Congress. We are paid to watch the taxpayers’ money. Hopefully, part of our job is to watch where this money goes and to make sure it is spent wisely. The uncertainty and the lost time of transferring this air traffic control to a private board will only cause delays. Again, I go back to what we have done in the past with other entities where we have tried to move from a Federal or a government agency to a private agency or vice versa. The transition time is usually lengthy. It is usually inefficient, and mistakes are made. Here, Mr. Speaker, we are not talking just about civilian travel. We are talking about our Department of Defense, so it becomes a safety issue and a national security issue. Modernization and privatization are not synonymous. They are actually two diverse courses that really have no business in the same bill. We should continue to take steps to provide adequate funding for the FAA and remove 
barriers for modernization while maintaining U.S. airspace as the safest and most accessible in the world. Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend everyone who has worked on this bill. There have been, I am sure, countless hours. There are some good things in this bill that we need to do. I have addressed the modernization issue. But again, it is the privatization of our air traffic control that gives me pause and that gives me great concern on some of the issues that I have mentioned here in this short period of time. So I want to take a step back from this AIRR Act. I want to work with my colleagues, see what we can do to get it right and keep our skies safe. Once again I will say: I am the guy that wants less government. This is one of the few areas where government has done a good job, will continue to do a good job, and of those 87,000 flights a day, keep them safe. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. MARINO (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for today on account of travel delays. Mrs. NAPOLITANO (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today and the balance of the week on account of attending to husband’s health situation.
