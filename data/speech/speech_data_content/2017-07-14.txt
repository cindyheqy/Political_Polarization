Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for the victims of human trafficking and for the law enforcement and organizations who are on the front lines combating this growing problem. Human trafficking is a growing problem in Illinois where we rank ninth in the Nation in reported trafficking cases. Cases are on the rise nationwide. As a father of three and grandfather of 11, I am angry. We must wipe out this evil before it does any more harm. I am proud that Republicans and Democrats came together to pass three antitrafficking bills this week. Our work is far from over, but these bills are vitally important to help protect American families. f 
RECOGNIZING RICHARD D EWITT SMITH (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to recognize Richard DeWitt Smith, a native of my home State of North Carolina and a graduate of our alma mater, North Carolina Central University. Tomorrow night, Richard will be honored by the NCCU Alumni Association with the prestigious Alumni Founder’s Lifetime Achievement Award. Richard is most deserving of this great honor. Since graduating in 1981, Richard has been a dedicated alumnus to the university, always exemplifying our motto of Truth and Service. 
Richard continues to serve NCCU and its alumni community in numerous capacities at the local, State, and national levels. He gives of his time, talent, and resources to help students from across the country succeed in obtaining a quality education from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Richard Smith has been married to Jacqueline Beatty Smith for 28 years. They met 40 years ago as NCCU students. Mr. Speaker, time does not permit me to fully describe Richard’s many other contributions; but suffice it to say that Richard Smith is most deserving of this high honor—the NCCU Alumni Association 2017 Alumni Founder’s Lifetime Achievement Award. I am proud of Richard Smith, and I thank him for his extraordinary work. I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating this great American hero. 
HEALTHCARE TOWNHALLS (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, 118,000— the number of people in my district alone who will lose healthcare if TrumpCare passes. 250—the number of people who joined me for a healthcare townhall on Monday in Charlotte. Zero—the number of public hearings the Senate has held on TrumpCare. Despite the potential for 22 million people who will lose their healthcare if TrumpCare passes, Senator MCCONNELL  hasn’t asked to hear from any of them. On Monday, I held a townhall where my constituents shared their stories and asked that I share them with you. Katie Mpelkas, a mother of a 3year old with autism, relies on Medicaid for her son’s healthcare. She is terrified at the thought that without Medicaid coverage her son won’t get the care he needs. Adrienne Gonzalez’s son, diagnosed with autism at age 2, has been receiving care paid for by Medicaid since he was 11 months old. Sadly, their stories aren’t unique. Thirtynine percent of children are on Medicaid for the care they need, and TrumpCare cuts the program by 35 percent by 2036. Our constituents are begging for help. It is our responsibility to fight for them. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BOST). Pursuant to House Resolution 440 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 2810. Will the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON ) kindly take the chair. b0906 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 2018) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, with Mr. SIMPSON (Acting Chair) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole House rose on Thursday, July 13, 2017, a second set of amendments en bloc, offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ) had been disposed of. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 printed in House Report 115–217. 
AMENDMENT NO . 17 OFFERED BY MR . BYRNE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 17 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from Florida, and I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title XXXV add the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, this straightforward and bipartisan amendment would provide important clarity for the recreational marine industry as it relates to workers’ compensation coverage. For decades, Federal law stated that individuals who build, dismantle, or repair recreational vessels less than 65 feet could be covered under State workers’ compensation law instead of the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. Under the Democratcontrolled Congress in 2009, the law was simplified by eliminating the size limitation, which allowed more employers to purchase State workers’ compensation. Unfortunately, in 2011, the Department of Labor issued a burdensome and confusing rule creating a new definition of recreational vessel. This change contradicted legislation passed by the Congress in 2009, and effectively denied recreational vessel repair workers access to more affordable State workers’ compensation insurance. This regulatory confusion and uncertainty is reducing access to affordable workers’ compensation policies and also hurting the overall recreational repair industry. Our bipartisan amendment increases strong protections to ensure that no vessel used for commercial or military purposes is inappropriately excepted from the Federal requirements. This amendment would provide regulatory relief for small businesses, including those in coastal Alabama, while also ensuring the maritime workers receive the protections they need. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Connecticut is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment that is offered by my good friend from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ). I would just note that this is an amendment that has been around the last couple Congresses, and the intent clearly is to carve out a larger exemption from the longshoremen’s act which is a law that goes back to 1927. I would note that if that is the intent, the language of this amendment actually is kind of like legislating with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel because by carving out a larger exemption for recreational vessels above or beyond 55 feet long, basically there is a whole series of Coast Guard rules and regulations that have been enforced by the Coast Guard for many years that this amendment, unfortunately, is going to sweep up and undermine, including the rules related to alcohol on board vessels, waste management, Coast Guard inspection categories, vessel sales to nonU.S. citizens, tonnage taxes, and safety management systems. The Coast Guard is out there every single day making sure that these rules which really protect our ports and make sure that particularly foreign, large, super yachts are paying their fair share, in terms of the costs of environmental protection, and boating safety is enforced. That is, again, what this amendment will undermine. That is why last year the Coast Guard issued a statement pointing out the fact that because of the broad sweep of the language of this amendment, it is really undermining some key missions that the Coast Guard has been doing for decades for the American people. So I would note that, at the outset, obviously there is, I think, another 
issue which is just as significant which is undermining the longshoremen’s act which goes back to Calvin Coolidge. It recognizes the fact that the folks who are engaged in longshoremen activity but also shipyard construction are engaged in a very highrisk type of occupation. The longshoremen’s act was a recognition that State workers’ compensation systems, because of the fact that they varied up and down in terms of protections, really required a Federal minimum standard. That is really something that has obviously withstood the test of time over the last 90 years. Again, if you look at the data, people who were involved in shipyard work, their risk of injury is much higher than many other occupations. I am a proud Representative from a district that has the second largest employment level in shipbuilding according to the American Shipbuilding Association, and these folks are dealing with processes, equipment, and parts that, again, really are much higher risk than even aerospace or other forms of manufacturing. Mr. Chairman, I think what we ought to do is stick to the Coast Guard definition of what a recreational vessel is because that has been on the books for many years, and it is something that I think all of us should listen closely to in terms of evaluating this amendment. I think also we should recognize that we can build a great American shipbuilding sector in this country for commercial and recreational vessels, but we should not do it on the backs of worker protection. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman. He and I have worked together on shipbuilding issues a lot of times, and I appreciate his leadership in that industry. These are recreational vessel companies. They are small companies doing small things on different types of vessels than the ones that Mr. COURTNEY  and I are typically working together on. So trying to apply the same rules when it is a completely different activity to where, when we are usually talking about very large ships, it just doesn’t make any sense. This has traditionally been a Democrat amendment. I have always supported it. I am happy to be here to support it today. I would like for us to continue our tradition of bipartisanship on this issue. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) who is a colleague from another great shipbuilding district and also the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The amendment shifts workers who repair super yachts and large, luxury watercraft out of coverage under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act and into coverage under State workers’ compensation programs. But it doesn’t just amend the longshoremen act. Rather, it creates a problem with the Coast Guard law. The Coast Guard opposed an identical amendment last year because it creates widespread damage to Coast Guard regulatory and enforcement authorities, implicates U.S. treaty obligations, and could affect the collection of tonnage taxes on foreign flagged vessels. The Department of Labor also opposes the amendment because it could lead to uncertainty and foster litigation under the longshoremen coverage. Moreover, by shifting workers out of longshoremen into the weak State workers’ comp laws such as Florida, it could permanently impoverish workers. Last year, the Florida Supreme Court held that the Florida workers’ compensation law was so anemic that it was unconstitutional. If the goal is to provide reasonable insurance rates, then it should be in the insurance industry not by complicating the Coast Guard, by complicating the Department of Labor, and denying workers their benefits under the Longshoremen’s Compensation Act. Mr. Chairman, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Committee on Education and the Workforce opposing this amendment. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. b0915 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, we have heard nothing from the Coast Guard this year in opposition to this amendment. In years past, I think the gentleman is correct, we have heard from them, but this year we have heard no opposition. In fact, a recreational vessel being repaired is the same as a recreational vessel being manufactured to use as a public vessel and should be treated the same in law. The Coast Guard already strictly enforces the existing laws and regulations that determine whether a vessel is recreational and enforces the law against those who would unlawfully use recreational vessels for commercial purposes. So I would suggest to the gentleman that this is not something the Coast Guard opposes. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 18 OFFERED BY MR . HUNTER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title XXXV add the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from California (Mr. HUNTER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, this important amendment would help safeguard U.S. courts against crowding of court dockets by foreign maritime crewmembers. It simply clarifies where the claim must be brought when the case has no meaningful connection to the United States. Specifically, the amendment limits the ability of foreign crewmembers working on foreign ships in foreign waters to sue in U.S. courts when a remedy is available in their home countries or the country of the ship on which they served. If no such remedy is available abroad, the amendment would allow those crewmembers to file suit in the United States, assuming they could meet the same burden needed to file any other suit. To be clear, again, this amendment in no way restricts a foreign crewmember’s access to judicial relief if they are injured or suffer some other damage as a result of working on a foreign vessel. It simply says that they need to seek relief in their home country or the home country of the vessel on which they served before seeking relief in U.S. courts. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this pernicious antilabor amendment that would do nothing but make it easier for U.S.owned but foreignflagged cruise ship operators to exploit and abuse the seafarers they employ. The right for seafarers to seek maintenance and cure for injuries, illness, and damages at sea has been a part of U.S. maritime law for as long as U.S. ships have flown the flag on the high seas. The effect of this amendment is clear: it would restrict foreign seafarers employed on foreignflagged cruise ships from filing claims for damages or expenses related to personal injury, illness, or even death, in a U.S. court. This provision is completely contrary to a general maritime law principle that has been around since at least the 12th century, a principle that has remained applicable because of the international nature of shipping and the plain fact that, even today, ship operators maintain considerable leverage over individual seafarers. This provision also violates an international convention that the U.S. has ratified. Under the Shipowners’ Liability Convention, national laws or regulations have to be interpreted and enforced to ensure equality of treatment to all seafarers, irrespective of nationality, domicile, or race. This amendment would shred that international obligation. It is also contrary to the principles and terms defining seafarers’ rights under the International Maritime Labor Convention. It is also worth mentioning that the amendment before us may be unnecessary because, in many cases, seafarer contracts contain binding arbitration clauses. In any event, it makes no sense to deny access to U.S. courts for foreign 
seafarers seeking compassion for maintenance and cure claims. The cruise lines can easily avoid frivolous lawsuits. All they need do is honor their longstanding customary responsibility to pay for the care and recovery of the seafarers they employ when they are ill or injured. In closing, no one has provided any evidence—much less, compelling evidence—to justify the reversal of longstanding seafarer protections. In the absence of evidence, the House should reject this unwarranted amendment. This vote is purely to injure seafarers, purely to disobey maritime conventions to which we are a party, purely to disobey laws of the sea from the 12th century that we have obeyed since we obtained our independence from England, for no purpose other than to help often Americanowned—not always—but foreignflagged cruise ship lines. There is no purpose for this amendment. The House should reject this amendment as it has in the past. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WILSON ). Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, today, I join with my colleague and friend, Representative DUNCAN  HUNTER , in offering an amendment to the maritime administration title in the NDAA. The cruise industry, which is a vital source of economic opportunity for my constituents, has come to me with concerns about lawsuits it says are clogging U.S. courts and making it more difficult to conduct business and create opportunities in my district and elsewhere. I take these concerns seriously and want to help address them, but I also want to make sure that they are protecting workers and that we don’t shut off opportunities for them to be fairly compensated if they become ill or injured in the course of their employment. The HunterWilson amendment is intended to do just that. It safeguards U.S. courts against further crowding of court dockets, while not denying foreign crewmembers remedies. This provision has been passed in the House five times in the past 3 years, and most recently, the Senate Commerce Committee included it in the maritime administration title of the Defense Authorization bill for FY 2017. I want to thank Chairman HUNTER  and Chairman SHUSTER for their work on this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support the HunterWilson amendment. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I simply associate myself with the remarks of Mr. NADLER . I think he explained the history of this law very, very well. It is a very basic principle. People who work on these cruise ships should be compensated and taken care of if they are injured. There is no reason that the cruise line industry cannot afford to do this. To discriminate against people who happen to be from different countries who are working on these ships makes no sense whatsoever. Our laws apply to whoever is working on the ships and should continue to do so. This is simply an effort to deny workers’ rights from a cruise line industry that can more than afford to take care of the people who work there. These are not easy jobs. I confess, I have only taken one cruise in my life, but the people who work there work very long hours, very hard, in very difficult conditions. If they are injured or sick, they should be taken care of. As Mr. NADLER said, the best way to do that is under the current common practice, which is the cruise line does take care of them and makes sure they get the healthcare they need until they are able to work. But if that is not done, the right to sue in court to protect your rights as a worker should not be taken away. I do not believe that we have a problem in this country that workers are being too highly compensated and have too many rights. We don’t need to take away the few that they have. I urge opposition to this amendment. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2
3⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. This amendment limits the ability of foreign crewmembers working on foreign ships in foreign waters to sue in U.S. courts when a remedy is available in their home country or the country of the ship on which they serve. That is it. They can still sue. Trial lawyers around the world can rejoice because these crewmembers can come back to their home countries and they can sue and sue and sue. They just can’t do it in the U.S. if it didn’t happen in U.S. waters. It is that simple. Again, a foreign mariner operating on a foreign ship in foreign or international waters should avail themselves of the courts in their home country or the vessel’s home country before using U.S. courts. That is it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, it sounds nice to say they can go home to their country from which they came, where presumably the foreignflagged ship operates, but that is not the case. These are often Americanowned ships or Europeanowned ships, and they are flagged in a country of convenience—Liberia, Panama, or wherever—where the worker may have no connection whatsoever, where the ship, for that matter, has no real connection other than flying the flag of convenience, and where there may not be a very decent court system. That is why the practice has been, since before our independence—it has worked well the entire history of our country—that a foreign citizen working on a ship that calls in the United States, if denied the maintenance and cure that the ship is supposed to take care of someone on the high seas, then they can sue in an American court. We have always done this. There has been no showing of hardship whatsoever. Yes, some rich cruise line operators would like, perhaps, to get rid of this obligation, but that is no excuse. This is an antilabor, an antihuman amendment. It ought to be defeated. Mr. Chairman, I urge its defeat, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. HUNTER ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 43 OFFERED BY MR . MCGOVERN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 43 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle F of title V, add the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the McGovern 
Emmer amendment, which would simply create a service medal to be awarded to atomic veterans or their surviving family members in honor of their service and sacrifice to our Nation. Between 1945 and 1962, about 225,000 members of our Armed Forces participated in hundreds of nuclear weapons tests. Now known as atomic veterans, these GIs were placed in extremely dangerous areas and were constantly exposed to potentially dangerous levels of radiation in the performance of their duties. They were sworn to secrecy, unable to even talk to their doctors about their past exposure to radiation. Thankfully, Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush recognized the atomic veterans’ value and service and acted to provide specialized care and compensation for their harrowing duty. In 2007, our allies, Great Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, enacted their versions of this amendment by authorizing a medal to honor their atomic veterans who served with the United States. Regrettably, the Pentagon remains silent on honoring the service of our atomic veterans, arguing that to do so would diminish the service of other military personnel who are tasked with dangerous missions. Mr. Chairman, this is a pitiful excuse. Tragically, more than 75 percent of atomic veterans have already passed away, never having received this recognition. They served honorably and kept a code of silence. Because of that, it most certainly led to many of these veterans passing away prematurely. Past administrations and Congresses have dealt with the thornier issues of legality in compensation. What remains is recognizing these veterans’ duty, honor, and faithful service to our Nation. Time is running out. That is what this amendment seeks to do. I call upon my House colleagues to support this amendment that I, along with my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), have introduced. We owe it to our veterans to recognize their selfless service to our Nation. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ). Mr. EMMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for yielding. I appreciate the opportunity to work with him on this issue. During my time in Congress, I have been privileged to meet with many of our Nation’s veterans. The men and women in our Armed Forces are true heroes and truly the best our Nation has to offer. Yet far too often, they do not get the recognition and credit they deserve. This is especially true when it comes to our Nation’s atomic veterans. From 1945 to 1962, nearly a quarter of a million of our servicemembers played a role in the testing of nuclear weapons, earning them the title, ‘‘atomic veterans.’’ b0930 Since 1990, our Federal Government has taken different approaches to try and recognize and thank our atomic veterans, but we have never given official recognition through an award or medal. Today, that will change with the support of the men and women in this Chamber. With the McGovernEmmer amendment, we have an opportunity to finally acknowledge the incredible sacrifice these courageous individuals made more than half a century ago. Our amendment will require the Department of Defense to issue a service medal to the veterans or surviving families of those members of our Armed Forces who participated in aboveground nuclear weapons testing, were part of the U.S. military occupation forces in or around Hiroshima and Nagasaki before 1946, or were held as POWs in or near Hiroshima or Nagasaki. This amendment has been included in the House NDAA bill for the past 2 years and is supported by the National Association of Atomic Veterans. These veterans left their homes, left their families, and put their lives on the line to protect the freedoms and liberties we enjoy each and every day. I am honored to work with Mr. MCGOVERN and our colleagues here in the House to ensure these brave soldiers get the recognition they deserve. Again, I want to thank Congressman MCGOVERN for his efforts on this issue as well as to thank Chairman THORN BERRY , Ranking Member S MITH, and the entire staff of the House Armed Services Committee for their work on the underlying bill, and I urge adoption of this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, even though I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. I have supported it in the past. And as Mr. EMMER just mentioned, the House has supported it in the past in each of the last 2 years. I admire the persistence of the gentleman from Massachusetts in pursuing this issue. I think it is the right thing to do. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to convince our colleagues across the Capitol or the Pentagon to do this. I know of no opposition to the amendment. I think the House should continue to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. EMMER for his support, and I want to thank Chairman THORNBERRY  and Ranking Member SMITH for their support in the past. As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee has stated, the House has, by voice vote, approved this twice before in the NDAA bills. Unfortunately, the Senate has chosen to not respect the wishes of the House, so I think it is important that we show a strong bipartisan vote on this. So I will ask for a recorded vote because I think it is important to send a signal to the Senate that we are serious about this and we are serious about honoring our Atomic Veterans. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts will be postponed.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN ). Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding, and I now look forward to entering into a discussion with Mr. POLIQUIN for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. POLIQUIN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WITTMAN. I yield to the gentleman from Maine. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the leadership of the Armed Services Committee in the Seapower Subcommittee on both sides of the aisle to accept this amendment and its important modifications to the underlying bill provision limiting the availability of funds for prior fiscal year DDG–51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers. My revised amendment, Mr. Chair, is agreed to by the committee and, importantly, removes the additional, or third, fiscal year 2016 DDG–51 ship from the provision’s proposed requirements. Additionally, sir, and again, as agreed to by the committee, it states the sense of Congress that the Navy should bear the majority of the share line risk for the fiscal year 2017 DDG– 51 Flight III destroyer contract, which will represent the first ships to integrate the Air and Missile Defense Radar, which is 30 times more effective and better than the legacy radar system. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman from Maine for working with the committee to improve the provision, while maintaining progress towards strengthening our fleet in the critical ballistic missile defense mission and capability. Your amendment helps us do just that, while ensuring that we maintain the health and critical skill workforces at our two proven vital destroyer shipbuilders, including Bath Iron Works in Maine. Mr. POLIQUIN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WITTMAN. I yield to the gentleman from Maine. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Chairman WITTMAN for their support on my important amendment. Bath Iron Works is a critical national security asset to our country. It is a source of great pride for all Mainers, and the shipyard employs some 6,000 of our most talented, hardworking citizens who care greatly about their contributions every day to keeping America safe and keeping America strong. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ), a member of the Armed Services Committee. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for including my amendment in this en bloc package. My amendment will authorize Procurement Technical Assistance Centers to assist small business owners in pursuing funding opportunities during all phases of the SBIR and STTR programs. These Federal programs enable small businesses to perform research and development that advances the national interests and has the potential for commercialization. My central Florida district is primed to benefit from these programs since it is home to a large and growing number of small firms that harness the power of technology, produce innovative products for customers in the public and private sector, and, in the process, create wellpaying jobs and generate broadbased economic growth. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER ). Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to also thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Chairman S ESSIONS  for making my amendment in order and allowing floor consideration. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It prohibits telecommunications companies that provide material support for North Korea cyber attacks from contracting with our Defense Department. While my amendment is simple in nature, it strikes at the heart of what I believe to be the cornerstone of North Korea policy. For far too long, China has enabled the North Korean Government to pursue nuclear development, global provocation, and egregious human rights violations. The Chinese Government is simply not a good faith partner on the issue of North Korea. For example, there have been multiple public reports indicating that China’s largest governmentaffiliated telecommunications firm, Huawei, has been subpoenaed by the Commerce Department as part of an ongoing investigation into whether it broke our export control laws by conducting business with North Korea. Additionally, earlier this year, a similar Chinese Governmentaffiliated firm, ZTE, was hit with a recordbreaking billiondollar fine in connection with comparable North Korearelated export violations. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is one of many steps that our Congress needs to take to demonstrate to China we will no longer tolerate its alliance and partnership with North Korea. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ). Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the majority for including my amendment in this bloc. My amendment is straightforward, Mr. Chairman. It recognizes that any U.S. strategy for Syria must acknowledge and respond to the tremendous suffering of civilians, including the millions who have been forced from their homes, who face starvation, cholera, a lack of access to adequate healthcare and education, not as an afterthought, but as an active imperative. The Trump administration has already used the suffering created by the use of chemical weapons as a reason for expanding U.S. involvement in Syria and to launch attacks against the Syrian Government. My amendment would ask the administration for a description of the legal authority relied upon or needed for the use of U.S. military force in Syria, information which is even more critical now, given the recent attacks by U.S. forces against the Syrian Government and reports that we may continue to send more troops into Syria. It is foolhardy and unwise for us to think that the suffering being imposed upon innocent civilians in Syria should not be a consideration in any U.S. response or strategy outlining how military forces or aid will be used there. The humanitarian crisis spawned by 
conflict directly impacts our national security efforts. We ignore it at our own peril. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROSKAM ). Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY , and I rise today in strong support of the Lamborn amendment requiring a report on Iran’s use of commercial aircraft to support terrorist groups in rogue regimes around the Middle East. The Lamborn amendment delivers a simple message to Iran, to Assad, and all companies considering selling aircraft to the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and that is: Congress is watching. Congress is watching midnight flights take off from military bases in Iran and land in wartorn Damascus carrying terrorists, guns, and explosives, which will only be used to shed more innocent blood in the Syrian civil war. Congress is watching as Boeing and Airbus shake hands and cut deals with former leaders of Iran’s National Revolutionary Guard Corps like Hossein Alaei, CEO of Aseman Airlines, who has called to destroy U.S. naval ships sailing in international waters. Congress is watching as iconic American and European companies are choosing to fuel Iran’s terror campaign around the world. Mr. Chair, Congress is watching, and Congress will act to ensure that Western companies do not become complicit in the Syrian massacre. Please support the Lamborn amendment. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ). Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for agreeing to include my amendment en bloc in the NDAA. The amendment that we have is a transitioning of the Virgin Islands Active Guard and Reserve from overseas housing allowance to basic allowance for housing. We know that, in 2013, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness reported that a change would be feasible and would not be difficult to allow Virgin Islands Active Guard and Reserve members to be part of the basic housing allowance. Congress didn’t intend inequitable and unfair treatment to the Virgin Islands Active Guard and Reserve members, and this amendment provides an equitable solution to the disparate treatment of the housing allowance for Virgin Islands Active Guard and Reserve members. We are grateful for the support and are thankful that our servicemembers will now, in their housing, be treated the same as those in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JODYB. H ICE). Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendments offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DESANTIS ) and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER ). As we all know, North Korea has targeted the United States with cyber attacks, and they are well on their way to being able to strike the United States with conventional and nuclear weapons. These two amendments would prohibit the Department of Defense from contracting with telecom companies found to be complicit with North Korean cyber attacks or Chinese companies found to be providing support for the North Korean regime. There is no reason that we should be contracting with countries that are enemies of the United States. I also support the amendment offered by my friend from Michigan (Mr. BISHOP ). Without a doubt, NATO is the greatest military alliance in the world, but that alliance works most effectively when the members of those various countries are pulling their weight and fulfilling their commitments in regard to their own defense budgets. This amendment calls on the President to encourage NATO allies to fulfill their commitments and to recognize those who are currently doing so. I wholeheartedly agree with these amendments, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. NOLAN ). b0945 Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, my first amendment simply declares that none of the funds authorized to be appropriated in this bill can be used to deploy members of the Armed Forces to participate in the ongoing civil war in Yemen. By passing this amendment, we ensure that no hero, no patriot in a U.S. military uniform will be put in harm’s way in a conflict that can only be settled by the parties involved. My second amendment simply cuts off funds to any socalled friendly rebels in Iraq or Syria who make a mockery of our good intentions by misusing American arms and resources, and, in far too many instances, using them against us. We have already spent trillions of dollars, lost thousands of precious lives in these endless wars of choice in the Middle East. It is time to put a stop to it, time to start investing in America and the American people. So I urge the adoption of these amendments en bloc. I would only add that the President, in his last campaign, had a message that we need to embrace, and I think the en bloc group of amendments takes us in that direction. He pointed out we spend $6 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan alone. For one of those trillion, we could have graduated every kid in America from college debtfree. For another one of those trillion, there is your trillion dollars for infrastructure to fix the trains that are coming off the track and the bridges that are falling down. For another one of those trillion, we could have found a cure for cancer or Alzheimer’s or diabetes, and we still would have had $3 trillion for deficit reduction. I applaud this committee for all the work that they are doing and the direction that they are taking us back to in getting us out of these endless wars of choice and start reinvesting in America, the American people, and the American infrastructure. That creates good jobs and the quality of life that we embrace. To be sure, we must have a strong national security. There are evil people and evil forces out there that we need to protect ourselves against, but that doesn’t mean we have to get involved in every civil war and every war of choice in the world. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this en bloc package. I especially want to thank the chairman for including my amendment as part of the other very positive amendments that he has included in this en bloc package. My amendment would condition the allocation of certain funds to Pakistan upon a certification from the Secretary of Defense that Pakistan is not using its military or its funds or equipment provided by the United States to repress minority groups, and to make sure that they do not repress these minority groups who are seeking their own political or religious freedom. At a time of high budgets, we should reserve our aid for friends and allies, and end assistance to Pakistan in particular, which does not meet the standards of decency and freedom that the American people believe have to be part of any decision that we make here. Pakistan has acted as an adversary not only to the United States, but has been aiding our enemies and repressing its own people. Let us not forget that Pakistan harbored Osama bin Laden. This is the prime mover, the man who organized the slaughter of 3,000 Americans. We are fools if we continue to support a regime like that in Pakistan today that represses its own people and is using what we give them to actually do things that make us less safe as a people and put us in jeopardy with the terrorists around the world. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for including my amendment to the en bloc package. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ), a member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including this amendment in the en 
bloc package, because I remain concerned about the lack of a clear plan or strategy in Syria. As the Syrian opposition supported by U.S. and coalition forces fight to liberate Raqqa from ISIS control, we are confronted with the complex and critical question of what comes next. Freeing Syrians from the brutality of ISIS is but one part of a complex, grinding civil war that began with the Assad regime’s heinous violence against civilians and has endured for over 6 years, with over 400,000 Syrians killed, 6 billion Syrians displaced within Syria, and over 4.5 million forced to flee as refugees. We now have over 500 U.S. troops deployed to Syria to advise and assist Syrian opposition forces. However, we have yet to have a clear, comprehensive political strategy that describes what the end goals are for U.S. involvement and how we hope to achieve those goals. This amendment requires just that, and follows a similar effort I led with General and Representative JOHN BACON on Iraq that received bipartisan support in the Armed Services Committee last year. This amendment requires a comprehensive political and military strategy for U.S. policy in Syria to be submitted by the Departments of Defense and State to Congress and the American people within 90 days of enactment. We owe it to our troops, those young men and women whom we ask to risk their lives in Syria today, to tell them what their job is, what it entails, what the end goal is, and why it is worth the risks that they take every single day. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY for yielding and for his great work leading us on the NDAA. I would like to address two amendments that are coming up in en bloc packages. First of all, on Iran, my amendment to the NDAA, No. 361, requires the President, along with various agencies, to provide the House with a report regarding Iran’s use of commercial aircraft for illicit activities. I am doing this with Representative ROSKAM . Diligent research from think tanks, such as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and the American Enterprise Institute, have demonstrated the need for the intelligence community to provide Congress with a report of their activities. In total, Iran Air, Mahan Air, Pouya Air, Cham Wings Airlines, and the Iranian Air Force operated at least 404 flights from Iran to Syria since the Iran nuclear deal was adopted on July 14, 2015. Now, this report does not block the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, but asks the intelligence community to take a serious look at these sales so Congress can determine if they should continue. The other amendment I would like to address, Mr. Chairman, is No. 364 on boostphase missile defense. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY for including this amendment, which was cosponsored by Mr. KINZINGER , Mr. H UNTER, Mr. F RANKS , and Mr. W ILSON from South Carolina, to advance boostphase missile defense programs. As you know, ballistic missiles are at their most defenseless when they are in their boost phase, the initial phase of flight. They are at their slowest, and they have not yet deployed decoys and countermeasures that would make it more difficult to shoot them down in later phases of flight. This amendment will make Americans safer as we move towards advancing this absolutely critical technology. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, neither do I have other speakers on this en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ). Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman MAC THORNBERRY for his extraordinary leadership and for the opportunity to speak on amendment No. 76. In the past few years, we have seen a clear rise in how terrorist and extremist groups use propaganda and sophisticated messaging operations to increase their reach to recruit new members, execute attacks, and raise funds. These violent extremist organizations represent a new type of threat to the United States and our families, and we must identify how existing agencies should work together to address the threat. This amendment requires the President to submit a comprehensive interagency strategy for countering violent extremist groups that pose a threat to American families or their interests. Any plan would identify how to counter the violent messaging, combat terrorist financing, support existing law enforcement activities, support counterradicalization organizations, and offer military support. Additionally, the amendment provides for accountability by requiring an annual assessment of the progress made implementing and achieving the strategy. The time is now to bring a wholegovernment approach to combat violent extremism. This strategy will serve a vital role in this effort. Mr. Chairman, I urge the passage of this amendment and the en bloc package. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ). Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY  for yielding me the time. Mr. Chair, my amendment proposes to increase the authorized funding for the Counterdrug Program by $10 million. For 30 years, the National Guard has successfully performed drug interdiction and counterdrug activities to support our local communities and our national security. The National Guard partners with local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies, and community organizations to effectively combat the supply and demand for illegal drugs. The National Guard Counterdrug Program works. In the past 4 years, the West Virginia National Guard successfully seized more than $500 million of illegal drugs, black market drugs that are devastating our communities and towns. And as our Nation copes with the devastating drug epidemic, we must fund programs to stop drug trafficking and keep drugs out of our communities. For more than a decade, Congress has consistently provided funding above the budget request. It is important that we continue that support. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THORN BERRY and his hardworking staff that helped to make this amendment possible. I urge adoption of this amendment. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, perfluorinated compounds, namely PFOA and PFOS, have been found in public and private drinking water wells in communities surrounding over 600 military installations nationwide, including several in my own district, impacting 70,000 Pennsylvanians. While the military does not dispute its responsibility for the water contamination, the response thus far has been unacceptable. For all of our constituents, they all have the right to safe, clean drinking water, and they deserve to know if PFOS or PFOA have compromised their longterm health. The bipartisan amendment I have introduced instructs the Secretary of Defense to consult with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry to carry out a study on any health effects experienced by those exposed to PFOS and PFOA at military installations or former military installations. While this study alone will not fix the serious concerns about water contamination, it will provide us with critical information about the health impact these unregulated chemicals may have, and aid the Federal Government in conjunction with State and local agencies to reverse the contamination and protect the health and welfare of our residents. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY for yielding time. Mr. Chair, Pakistan has been supporting all kinds of terrorist groups for years, including those with American blood on their hands. But instead of penalizing Pakistan, the government has been rewarding them with hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid. Some of that money goes to support terrorists. Previously, we placed conditions on military aid to Pakistan, but these conditions are only focused on Pakistan cracking down on one terrorist group, the Haqqani Network. Meanwhile, Pakistan is aiding and abetting a long list of terrorists in the region, including the Taliban in Afghanistan. b1000 My amendment No. 100 places a new condition on any aid to Pakistan. The condition requires the administration to certify that Pakistan is not providing military, financial, or logistical support to any terrorists operating in Pakistan or Afghanistan. This forces Pakistan to make a long overdue choice: either go after terrorists or lose millions of dollars of American aid. And that is just the way it is. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BISHOP ). Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY  for his leadership on this matter. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed in the ashes of World War II, bringing decades of considerable peace and prosperity. Still, there are powers today that wish to challenge the order from which millions throughout the world have benefited. My amendment to the NDAA, amendment No. 98, is a straightforward and simple amendment. It would call on all NATO allies to fulfill their mutual defense commitments, secure national and regional security interests, and recognize our NATO allies who are achieving those objectives. The underlying bill takes steps to strengthen our national defense on many fronts. It improves our overseas contingency operations, provides significant resources to rebuild our military, and increases funding for initiatives to deter Russian aggression. My amendment builds upon those principles. As we begin to rebuild our military capability, it is time for our allies to do the same, especially when it pertains to our NATO alliance. For far too long, the United States has shared an unequal financial burden in contributing to the global and regional security that NATO provides. With new challenges from an increasing belligerent Russian state, instability across the Middle East and North Africa, and emerging cybersecurity threats, it is time for all allies to honor their commitment and invest in defense spending. In order for NATO to be completely effective, all NATO members must meet their GDP commitment for defense spending and investment. This is out of fairness—for our effort to evenly share this responsibility and fairness to American taxpayers. My amendment calls on the President to demand that our NATO allies honor their mutual defense commitment they agreed to by committing 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense spending and research and to secure their national and regional security interests. Only 5 of 29 member nations currently honor these commitments. While 24 NATO members fail to meet their NATO commitment, my amendment also recognizes the few NATO allies who actually achieve those objectives. Full commitment from our NATO allies will make a notable difference in our effort to achieve peace around the globe. We must share equally the necessary burden of peace through strength. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) will control the time of the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH). There was no objection. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Congressman LAMBORN ’s amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to require the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Director of National Intelligence to report to Congress on the use of commercial aircraft by the Government of Iran for illicit activities. I am proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of this bipartisan amendment, along with Reps. LAMBORN , ROSKAM, ZELDIN , and S HERMAN . As we are all aware, U.S. firms have reached multibilliondollar agreements to sell or lease hundreds of aircraft to Iran, supposedly to help bring the country’s fleet into the 21st century. I am deeply concerned, however, that these aircraft, intended for civilian use, could instead be used for nefarious purposes, such as transporting fighters to Syria or weapons to Iran’s proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah. Iran is the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism, with a longstanding record of human rights violations. Its support of radical groups throughout the Middle East poses a threat both to our greatest ally in the region, Israel, and also to U.S. interests.. For this reason, we must keep a watchful eye on Iran’s actions, including how it uses dual use exports from the United States. If Iran is indeed only using Americanmade commercial aircraft for legitimate purposes, there should be no concern that a report confirming this would have an adverse effect on American trade. If Iran is using aircraft to conduct illicit activities, we must be made aware, and we must hold Iran accountable. I am also proud to have cosponsored another amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will help hold Iran accountable for it actions. This bipartisan amendment, offered by my Nevada colleague, Rep. KIHUEN , would extend a presidential reporting requirement to ensure that we have an integrated strategy between the Administration and Congress to deter Iran’s nuclear weapons program. Two years ago today, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Iran agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA), which aimed to ensure that Iran’s nuclear program would be exclusively peaceful and that Iran would never obtain a nuclear weapon. I was not a Member of Congress when the JCPOA came to the floor for Congressional approval, but had I been, I would have opposed the agreement. However, I have said since before I first came to Congress that now that the JCPOA is the law of the land, the United States must demand that Iran abide by it completely, and that any cheating or subversion should be dealt with swiftly. Both the Lamborn and Kihuen Amendments that I have cosponsored are manifestations of this principle. If Iran is directly violating the JCPOA by developing a nuclear weapons program, the Administration and Congress must be ready to respond. And if Iran is violating 
the spirit of the JCPOA by taking advantage of new streams of commerce to wage war in the Middle East, it should not matter what financial ties U.S. companies have to the regime. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes both the Lamborn and Kihuen Amendments. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Armed Services Chairman THORNBERRY  and Ranking Member SMITH for their support of my amendment to direct the Secretary of Defense to report on military cooperation between Serbia and Russia. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Aderholt, for cosponsoring the amendment. Countries of the Balkans are a part of Europe. Period. From the former Yugoslavia, three have already entered NATO and two are now part of the European Union. In the wider Balkans, even more countries have joined NATO and the EU and others want to be part of both ....  all, except for Serbia, that is, which is unwilling to put itself on a path to future NATO membership. Frankly, Serbia is not only keeping NATO at arms’ length. As we speak, it is continuing to rearm with Russian weapons. In a deal reached on December 21 of last year, Russia agreed to give Serbia six surplus MiG–29 ‘Fulcrum’ fighter aircraft, 30 T–72 tanks, and 30 BRDM–2 armored reconnaissance vehicles. Rather than forcing Belgrade to pay for these items worth more than $600 million on the open market, the Kremlin just gave them to Belgrade. And, now Serbia is seeking Russianmade S–300 antiaircraft missiles. If I were sitting in one of Serbia’s neighbors, most of which are NATO members, I don’t think I would be comfortable with Belgrade’s tilt toward Moscow. Even more, only last month, Serbia joined Russia and Belarus in what the countries’ called ‘Slavic Brotherhood’ drills very close to NATOmember Poland. This is only the latest in a series of military exercises where Serbian forces are training with Russian troops. According to RFE/RL, ‘‘The first were held in 2015 in Russia’s Krasnodar Krai, which is close to Westernleaning Georgia and Ukraine’s Russiancontrolled Crimean Peninsula. The second were held in November 2016 in Serbia, while NATO was staging a civil emergency drill in neighboring Montenegro.’’ If Serbia wants to become part of the West, this isn’t the way to get there. Frankly, I’m growing increasingly concerned with the choices Belgrade is making on military and security matters. This is why I wrote today’s amendment. We need to take a closer look at RussianSerbian military ties and judge their implications for US national security policy, Serbia’s membership in NATO’s Partnership for Peace, and the impact on Serbia’s neighbors. I know that Vice President PENCE is meeting with Serbian President Vucic on Monday. This occasion represents a good opportunity to present our U.S. concerns about Belgrade’s direction on security policy and a variety of other matters. Mr. Chair, again, I thank the Chairman and Ranking member for their support, and I look forward to seeing the report required by the amendment. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I am proud to have introduced the Apollo I Memorial Amendment to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This year is the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo I spacecraft fire that claimed the lives of three American heroes. With this Amendment we ensure that these three courageous astronauts, who gave their lives in service to our great nation, will be appropriately honored. On January 27, 1967, Astronauts Virgil I. ‘‘Gus’’ Grissom, Edward H. White II, and Roger B. Chaffee were killed in an electrical fire that broke out inside their Apollo I Com mand Module on Launch Pad 34 at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The accident led to a detailed internal investigation and congressional hearings. As a result of their sacrifice, NASA made needed changes to the Apollo program which ultimately resulted in the successful Apollo 11 landing on the moon two years later. My Amendment requires the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to construct a memorial marker at Arlington National Cemetery in their honor. This marker corrects an unfortunate omission, namely, that these three fearless astronauts, who were set to be the ones to fly the first Apollo mission into space, have not received a memorial at Arlington as was done for the Space Shuttle Challenger and Columbia crews. As Arlington National Cemetery is where we recognize heroes who have passed in the service of our Nation, it is fitting that on the 50th anniversary of the launchpad accident we acknowledge the sacrifice of the Apollo I Astronauts. Mr. Chair, it is past time to install a memorial marker at Arlington so that current and future Americans never forget their sacrifice as we continue to reach for the stars. Before closing, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who supported the original bill from which this Amendment was drawn, H.R. 703, the Apollo Memorial Act. I would also like to express my deep appreciation to both Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH of In diana and Mr. POSEY of Florida who both offered to cosponsor this Amendment. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will continue to come together to support this amendment honoring these heroes. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ). Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment No. 80 as en bloc No. 4. My amendment encourages collaboration between the FAA and DOD on unmanned aircraft systems so that the FAA may leverage the unique capabilities and insights of the DOD. These are important activities as the FAA moves forward with incorporating unmanned systems into the national airspace. The efforts highlighted in my amendment are already ongoing activities between the FAA and the DOD, but more work needs to be done, as documented in a 2014 joint report to Congress. The Air Force Research Laboratory located at WrightPatterson Air Force Base, AFRL, in particular, has expertise in these senseandavoid technologies. AFRL is planning to conduct unmanned aircraft research activities at Springfield, Ohio’s, Air National Guard base in Ohio’s Eighth District, upon FAA approval. I am proud of our airmen and the work conducted at both Springfield and WrightPatterson and to offer this amendment to help the FAA make good use of the capabilities located there. I also rise in support of my amendment No. 120 as part of this en bloc package. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. DAVIDSON. My amendment is critical for ensuring Congress reclaims its warmaking powers by prohibiting funding for U.S. operations in Yemen that are not in compliance with the 2001 AUMF. I am concerned about any U.S. operations in Yemen that are outside the scope of the current AUMF and have no identifiable authorization from Congress. My amendment is very simple. If the military operation is within the scope of the 2001 AUMF, it is permissible. If it has not been authorized by Congress, then it is not permissible. I look forward to working with the chairman and my colleagues in the Senate to ensure this provision is adopted in the final NDAA conference report. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this bill. I want to begin by thanking the chairman and all of the members of the committee. As has been noted many times, this is the most bipartisan committee in Congress; and I think, once again, even in difficult circumstances, we have proved that this year. That is, in large part, due to the leadership of Chairman THORNBERRY . I thank him for that. I also thank our staff, which does an unbelievable job. There are hundreds, if not thousands of amendments, that come at them. They manage that. You see the very few that actually come through either in committee or on the floor. They work through literally thousands of ideas and do an amazing job, so I really want to thank our staff for their great work. In particular, I want to thank Vickie Plunkett. This will be her last markup. She is retiring. She has done a fabulous job for our staff. She basically exemplifies everything I just said about how great our staff is, how they work in a bipartisan manner and do a great job to serve our country. So, I thank Vickie for her incredible service to our committee and to the country. Mr. Chairman, I think this is a good bill that we should support because, make no mistake about it, what the chairman and many others have said is true: we face a complex threat environment. The U.S. national security is at risk. I take Mr. NOLAN from Minnesota’s point that spending a lot of money on wars that we didn’t need to engage in does cost us at home, and that point is valid, but so is the point that we face threats we must confront. North Korea is testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is no doubt that their goal is to develop a nuclear missile, capable of striking the U.S. Being from the West Coast—and they always say that it could hit Seattle. I don’t know why they don’t talk about any other city on the West Coast. It could hit a lot of different places. We need to be worried about that. We need to be prepared to stop that. Russia continues to undermine not just our elections, but democracy itself, across Europe, and even down in the Middle East and Africa. We need to be prepared to confront that. We face a terrorist threat. 9/11 killed 3,000 people in this country because we weren’t ready to prevent it. The groups that supported that attack have not gone away; they have metastasized. Now, I will completely agree with some of my friends on the left, who think that the terrorism threat is often overblown. I think it is often also a mistake to demonize the Muslim religion. And even though I know some people don’t do that, they simply want to confront groups like alQaida and ISIS, Steve Bannon, who works right next to the White House, has said that Islam is a totalitarian ideology of subjugation, it is not a religion. He thinks all Muslims are a threat. To the extent that we adopt a national security policy that views the world that way, we make the problem worse. That is what ISIS wants; that is what alQaida wants. They want a clash of civilizations. We should not want that. They have killed more Muslims than any other religion on Earth. Muslims have the biggest stake in this. We must work with them, not against them, to confront that terrorist threat that ISIS and alQaida and others present. On the broader budget issue, as I mentioned a couple of times, the first 6 months of this year, we had a number 
of folks in the Pentagon come over and spell out all kinds of nightmare scenarios about every bad thing that could conceivably happen—some of ones that I mentioned, and hundreds of others that I haven’t. And I understand that. That is their job. Their job is to worry about what could come at us. But, past a certain point, that isn’t helpful. We need a plan, we need a strategy to confront this, and we need to make choices. That is the one thing that I am still concerned about with this bill. It really doesn’t make choices. It continues to spend money in a variety of different places, without a recognition of finite resources and choices that need to be made about how to confront the threats that are most dangerous to us—how to spend that money in the best way possible. That is something that I think we need to work on going forward. We also have the budget problem that I described. And I won’t give the same full speech that I gave before, but I will simplify it and say that there is a consensus in Congress and in the country that we need to balance the budget without raising taxes and without cutting any programs that people might like. That doesn’t work. It simply is not possible. It doesn’t add up. That is why we don’t have a budget resolution. Any budget resolution that the Republican Congress could put on the floor will fail to meet some of the promises that they, and others, have made. We have got to be honest about that, because this bill, again, is $72 billion over the budget caps. It is actually $91 billion over the budget caps, if you add in—well, sorry, $81 billion over the budget caps, if you add in the money that we took from OCO to put into the base. So, if we do not raise the budget caps, this goes away and leaves us, once again, in the land of uncertainty for the Department of Defense. We have to make choices on the budget going forward so that we don’t leave the Defense Department in the lurch, not knowing how much money that they are going to have. So, we still don’t have a budget resolution in front of us. And, lastly, I do want to point out that the rest of the budget does matter. The chairman and I have had a little bit of an argument about this: we are the Armed Services Committee, we should pay attention to that; you know, don’t sacrifice our troops for the sake of domestic—he always says political priorities. That is the one word in his argument that I find not really appropriate. There is nothing political about it. It is a policy choice. It is basically deciding what domestic priorities are important. And, make no mistake about it, the discretionary budget is a zerosum game. I mentioned yesterday the President’s budget: a $54 billion plusup for defense, and $54 billion cut from nondefense discretionary. So don’t tell me that one thing doesn’t have anything to do with the other. But even the socalled budget resolution, the budget agreement that the House Republicans have come up with, but have not yet dared to put to a vote, has a $72 billion plusup for defense, and a $5 billion cut for domestic spending. So, again, the two are absolutely connected. What are we talking about with domestic spending? I won’t go through all of it. I will just mention a couple of things. Yesterday, I mentioned our infrastructure. Bridges are collapsing all across the country. I saw a big story yesterday about how the Memorial Bridge is about to fall down. We have incredible infrastructure needs that lead to the strength of our country that are connected, just like national defense is to the strength of this Nation. But another example, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center—it is close to my district, it is in Seattle— is doing incredible research right now, that figured out how to not use chemotherapy but actually go in, take out the white blood cells that aren’t working, get them to work, and send them back in to successfully fight cancer. This has worked for blood cancers. They just started studies on lung cancer. But, basically, we could cure cancer, without going through the hell of chemo. The President’s budget would cut Fred Hutchinson’s funding by over twothirds. I don’t think curing cancer is a political agenda. That is a very real need that has an incredible impact on the lives of Americans, just like national security. It is like making sure that North Korea doesn’t hit us with a nuclear weapon, making sure that terrorist groups don’t attack us. Curing cancer, stopping bridges from collapsing, these are priorities. b1015 Because we are not making budget choices, these are priorities that get pushed aside. And if you plusup defense and take it from nondefense discretionary, then you are having that very real impact. Now, I am not going to say it has to be dollar for dollar. I think it probably should be, but we can negotiate around that. But to simply gut the nondefense discretionary budget to plusup defense does not make this country safer. We heard yesterday, hey, in a time of war, you make domestic sacrifices. And we have all read about World War II, all the domestic sacrifices that were made at that time. I get that. But you know what else you do in a time of war? Well, you don’t cut taxes. You raise them. Prior to 2001, we had never gone to war without raising taxes or issuing war bonds or, basically, asking for more money. But that, of course, we cannot do. Again, I will say I care enough about the national security of this country, I would raise taxes to pay for it instead of simply adding to the deficit or stopping the ability of somebody like the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center from finding a cure for cancer. That is the choice that I would make. These choices are not being made in this budget resolution, and I think that places us at risk. Lastly, the nondefense discretionary budget is the State Department, it is USAID, it is the Department of Homeland Security. If you are going to have a national security strategy, it can’t just be the military. And you know who will tell you that more often than anybody? The military. They don’t want to bear the entire burden. General Secretary Mattis had the best quote on this. If you are going to cut diplomacy, if you are going to cut development, you better give me four more divisions because that is how many more wars I am going to have to fight. So to say we are going to add all this money to defense, and defense is so important, and if you are against it because of other priorities, then you just don’t care about the troops, is incredibly disingenuous because all of these other things matter to the national security of this country. And all we are getting out of the majority right now is an effort to plusup defense at the expense of everything else. I say an effort because they haven’t actually voted on it yet. It hasn’t actually happened. And it is more likely than not that this bill—good, though, it is—and the great work that has been done on a number of different policy divisions that don’t have anything to do with the money, the good work on acquisition reform to try to make sure we get more for the money that we spend, all of that is in jeopardy because this bill has at least $72 billion in it over the budget caps that is, more likely than not, not going to be there come October 1 or the end of this year. So if we don’t make the choices on the budget that reflect the priorities of the entire country, that actually reflect the budget numbers, then we are doing a disservice to the men and women who serve our country. It is a good bill. It is going to be better once we figure out the budget issues and actually start making the choices that are necessary to make us stronger in every aspect of society. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I fully agree with the gentleman from Washington when he expresses his appreciation to the members of our committee. Each one of the 62 members of our committee has contributed to the bill that is here before us today and, as the Chair knows, we have had more amendments considered over the last 3 days than ever before for a National Defense Authorization bill. So Members of the whole body have contributed in many ways. 
I also agree with the gentleman that our staff on both sides of the aisle, led by Jenness Simler and Paul Arcangeli, have done a terrific job in helping to manage this process and to shape and guide what has been historic levels of interest by Members on particular provisions. Mr. Chairman, I think that you would find among our committee virtually, if not unanimous, agreement on two points. One is we live in an increasingly dangerous world. The second one is we have done deep damage to our military because of the budgets cuts, the continuing resolutions, the erratic nature of funding over the last few years. Certainly, the members of our committee who go out and actually talk to the people who serve have heard, seen, witnessed firsthand airplanes that can’t fly, ships that can’t sail, training that has not gone on, movers—we are trying to save money for the military, so we are hiring cutrate movers, and members of the military are experiencing incredible damage to their household goods as they are shuffled about from place to place involuntarily. Sometimes there are movers with criminal records who can’t actually get on the military base they are supposed to be delivering to. I mean, just example after example of how these cuts have affected the men and women who serve. And as Secretary Mattis says, the only reason we are doing so well around the world is because they have sucked it up and borne the burden. Deep damage that this bill starts to reverse. I appreciate all the Members who support fixing our planes, getting the training, having ships that sail, better missile defense, all the things that are in this bill. I am not going to engage in a detailed discussion about the budget. The gentleman and I discuss this frequently. I would just say, Mr. Chairman, I believe the first obligation of the Federal Government is to defend the country. Article I, section 8 says that Congress has the power and the responsibility to raise and support armies, provide and maintain navies, provide the rules and regulations for the military forces of the United States. That is our job, and I think that is our first job. So I agree that some of the cuts that have been proposed in other domestic programs, discretionary programs, are inappropriate, and we ought to evaluate each of them on their merits. And that continues to be my point when it comes to defense. We evaluate our obligations to the country and to the men and women who serve, based on the merits of this argument. We don’t tie it to other domestic programs. We do not say we are only going to increase defense to fix our planes if we can increase the EPA an equal amount. We don’t tie it to other things. The obligations to the men and women who risk their lives stand on their own, and that, at least in my view, is our first obligation. Now, when we start talking about budgets, we get into all sorts of conversations about how mandatory spending is really where more than twothirds of the budget is; how that is what has been growing; how defense is down to about 16 percent of the budget, and as it has been shrinking, the deficit has been going up. Obviously, defense is not the cause when it comes to deficits. We can also, when we talk about tax, start talking about economic growth and this lackluster growth that the economy has suffered, at least over the last 8 years, and the need to get things going to help with the deficit. Lots of issues to discuss, but the issue before us today is how we fulfill our responsibilities to the men and women who serve and to the country that is relying on us to protect them from missiles, to help protect them from terrorist attacks, to support the men and women who are actually performing those missions. I think this bill advances that cause. A number of Members on both sides of the aisle have contributed to it. I think and hope it deserves the support of most all Members of the House, and I urge support for this en bloc package. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, as we prepare to vote on the final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act I am extremely concerned about the lack of discussion and debate on the issue of Russia. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have heard from the leaders of our military and there is no question about the threat Russia poses to our national security. It is alarming to me that a number of amendments, which purpose was to gain better situational awareness on various Russian activities, were not debated on the floor this week. Despite the fact that Russia has continuously attacked and interfered with our country’s democratic process, while continuing to threaten the democracy and sovereignty of other states, this body has decided to avoid a robust discussion on the concerning actions of Russia. Mr. Chair, it is obvious that we have not adequately addressed the threat Russia poses to our nation. Reasonable amendments like mine that would have assessed Russia’s disinformation and propaganda activities along with its support for separatist activities were not made in order. Mr. Chair, why would we not want more information on these concerning activities? My amendment would have also assessed the suppressive democratic conditions in Russia. Is this body no longer concerned about human rights? I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to fully understand and assess the threats other countries pose on our national security. I have no doubt that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will agree with me that Russia has demonstrated to be a threat to the security of our nation. As such why aren’t we doing more to address this threat? Mr. Chair, this Congress needs to have a discussion on how we can most effectively combat the aggressive actions of Russia, and it is disappointing that we were unable to do this during the consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act. Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to cut waste and strengthen our military installations. This amendment would require the Department of Defense to ensure that there is not usable space available on a military installation before entering into expensive leases or purchasing additional property. To put this into context, you wouldn’t lease space in a parking lot if you already had room in your own garage to park your car. This amendment is needed because, while asking for another round of base realignments and closures, the Department of Defense leased more than 6,000 buildings in fiscal year 2015 instead of using available space that it already owns. That sounds like a waste to me. My Congressional district is home to the Rock Island Arsenal, and we’re proud to have it as part of our community. It houses the Army’s only remaining foundry and employs more than 6,000 hardworking people. But like many of our military installations, it has room for more. We should be using facilities like the Arsenal to their full potential, especially when it means we can reduce overall costs. That’s why I’m offering this amendment today. I want to thank my bipartisan cosponsors Congressmen PAUL GOSAR , DAVE LOEBSACK  and WALTER JONES for their support of this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 122 OFFERED BY MS . TENNEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 122 printed in House Report 115–217. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title VIII, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chairman, my constituents are discouraged. They are fed up with political elites who have failed to represent them, and with special interest groups who, too often, put impractical dogma before practical policy. In the Rust Belt region I represent in upstate New York, the impact of this has been devastating: devastating job losses, economic stagnation, and the massive outmigration of people and jobs, the largest in the Nation. In my district, Mr. Chairman, decline has bred despair, which has spurred a host of other problems. In light of all this, I was elected to Congress with a strong mission to reverse the tide and to revitalize our upstate communities to the greatness and innovation they once experienced. I am the voice for my constituents who have been left behind, and I am fighting to bring my district back on path toward individual prosperity and economic revival. Mr. Chairman, my amendment uniquely achieves both. There is nothing new or groundbreaking about my amendment. Simply put, it reinstates a domestic sourcing provision for stainless steel flatware that was in law for 30 years without issue. My amendment adds stainless steel flatware back into the Berry amendment. For 30 years, Americanmade flatware was covered under Berry. However, the provision was removed in 2006 after Oneida Limited, the only Berry compliant manufacturer, ceased domestic operations. In the void left by Oneida’s departure came Sherrill Manufacturing, a company in my district that, since 2008, has produced 100 percent Americanmade flatware. And since 2008, Sherrill has been among the top providers of flatware to the Department of Defense and GSA, fulfilling more than $6.8 million in Federal contracts over an 8year period. All these products are being produced in the formerly closed factory using refurbished Oneida Limited equipment, and also providing jobs for many of the same employees who lost their jobs from Oneida’s closure after decades of service to that same closed factory. In fact, GSA has repeatedly found Sherrill’s flatware to be offered at fair and reasonable prices, which is why the agency already purchases flatware from Sherrill, independent of any domestic sourcing requirement. Some domestic sourcing requirements may raise costs. No evidence has been submitted to support the claim that my amendment will do that. This alone should allay any concerns that taxpayers would be on the hook for overly expensive flatware, should my amendment be adopted. But if it isn’t enough, then there is this: My amendment retains all existing waivers under Berry, which means that, if Sherrill’s flatware becomes too expensive or is of poor quality or insufficient quality, the DOD can find other sources. Ultimately, Mr. Chairman, whenever we can create domestic sourcing opportunities that reduce our military’s dependence on imported goods and strengthen domestic supply chains without significantly raising procurement costs, we should. And this is what my amendment does. Reinstating the Berry amendment’s domestic sourcing requirement represents a clear continuity in Federal procurement policy, not a stark divergence. As I said, this provision was in effect for 30 years. Thus far, there is one Berrycompliant manufacturer that happens to be in my district and there should not be a problem with that, as we hope many more producers return to the United States, where their businesses were founded to provide robust competition. I also support this amendment for the simple reason that it is good policy. It gives a leg up to a robust domestic supply chain that spans five States while reducing our military’s logistical dependence on imports. Moreover, for the 30year history of the Berry amendment’s flatware provision, there was only ever one domestic producer. Under the Berry amendment, this is all that is required. And in Sherrill’s case, we know it is a producer that has a track record of offering flatware at market rates. Mr. Chairman, in districts like mine across the country that have rusted out factories that line the landscapes of far too many of my communities, today we have an opportunity to fix this problem and restore the once great Empire State and our Nation to the manufacturing strength it once enjoyed. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ), my colleague, for some comments. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and I want to make one thing perfectly clear. American taxpayers want their tax dollars to go to putting Americans to work. This amendment means buy American and hire American. So I just want everyone to be clear. We hear a lot about Buy American, Hire American. This is what this amendment would do, and I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I have tremendous respect and admiration for the gentlewoman from New York and her efforts to represent her district, her people, and try to make life better. It kind of relates to some of the conversations Mr. SMITH and I were just having about tax policy, about industrial policy, about regulations, about how we have, in this country, become less competitive internationally than we should. However, I must oppose this amendment because the bottom line is that it is not a matter of national security where the DOD buys its knives, forks, and spoons. b1030 If Members needed further evidence of the wide range of issues which we deal with in the National Defense Authorization Act, this bill is a key example. I think the gentlewoman accurately described the history. The Berry amendment was passed in 1940 to make sure that food and textiles were procured from the United States to support our military efforts. In the 1970s, they put in a specialty metals provision, and attached to that was a comma that said ‘‘including flatware.’’ So then it turned out there wasn’t anybody here at home that made flatware because of these international competitive issues, and DOD came to us more than a decade ago and said, ‘‘Would you please get rid of that portion of the Berry amendment?’’ and we did. Now the question is: Are we going to start adding back specific sorts of items which DOD may buy and say you can only buy it from one place, whether or not it is critical to our country’s national security? Now, the gentlewoman mentioned that GSA is buying some spoons and knives and so forth from this manufacturer, and that is great. If we do, I hope that happens, and I hope more jobs come to her district. But to put into Federal law that the only place the Department of Defense can buy its knives and forks and spoons is from this one company, I think, starts to get us into micromanagement of industries and takes us away from the focus of this bill, which should be the troops, what is the best thing for them. So with all my admiration for the gentlewoman, I oppose this amendment. We cannot go down the road of adding category after category after category of items to help our districts at the expense of our troops and the best use of dollars when it is not a matter of vital national security. I just don’t think that the knives and forks we use qualify as vital national security. Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ). The amendment was rejected.

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. SIMPSON , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 440, he reported the bill, as amended by House Resolution 431, back to the House with sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico moves to recommit H.R. 2810 to the Committee on Armed Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: At the end of subtitle D of title X, insert the following new section 1039: 
None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2018 for the Department of Defense may be used to plan, develop, or construct any barriers, including walls or fences, along the international border of the United States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. The National Defense Authorization Act has passed Congress 56 years in a row, and that is a testament to the collaborative, bipartisan work the Armed Services Committee has done to support our troops who put themselves in harm’s way every single day to defend our country. This year, the House Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment introduced by Congressman GALLEGO to ensure that none of the funds meant to support our troops and safeguard our Nation’s security can be used for building President Trump’s border wall. The amendment was debated, amended, and ultimately adopted without objection by every single member of the Armed Services Committee. If you ask the people who know the border the best, whether it is companies, lawmakers, border communities, trade groups, economists, or law enforcement officials—both Republicans and Democrats—most agree that building a wall is unnecessary, impractical, ineffective, and, frankly, a complete waste of time and taxpayer money. Furthermore, the United States already maintains approximately 650 miles of border fence in areas that most effectively stop the unauthorized entry of people, vehicles, drugs, arms, and other illicit items. Instead of a costly border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, the Armed Services Committee chose to fully fund military healthcare, raise the pay of military personnel, and improve our Nation’s cybersecurity. They agreed that President Trump’s ongoing effort to build a wall is wasteful and has absolutely nothing to do with advancing U.S. national security interests. I want to emphasize that this amendment incorporated both Democratic and Republican ideas, and passed unanimously in a bipartisan manner. But late Tuesday night, House Republican leadership stripped Congressman GALLEGO ’s amendment from the NDAA with the use of a glaringly undemocratic, procedural gimmick to help Trump fulfill his campaign promise. Republican leadership’s actions to unilaterally open the door for funding the wall through the use of this defense bill is an insult to every single member of the Armed Services Committee, to our democratic principles, and to the spirit of bipartisanship. They chose to undermine the unanimous judgment of the Armed Services Committee without the courage to test their proposal with a vote or even a debate on the floor. You may hear my colleague on the other side of the aisle claim that prohibiting the construction of the wall doesn’t fall within the jurisdiction of the Defense Department. However, I am not sure why the 8 members of the Rules Committee believe that they are more qualified to judge what should be included in the NDAA than the 61 members of the Armed Services Committee or the 435 Members of this deliberative body as a whole. 
Further, I am not sure why the Rules Committee thought that a discriminatory amendment preventing the Department of Defense from providing medically necessary healthcare services to transgendered military personnel was more appropriate for debate than preventing Trump from usurping funds intended for our troops. You may also hear that my Republican colleagues claim that President Trump can’t use any funds in the NDAA to start construction of the wall anyway. But that is not true. Under title 10, the Secretary of Defense could transfer funding for that purpose this afternoon if he wanted, all without approval of Congress. Mr. Speaker, the only way this body can guarantee that Trump cannot use Department of Defense funds to construct the border wall is to put that prohibition in the bill explicitly. The only way we can do that is by passing my motion to recommit to restore Congressman GALLEGO ’s bipartisan amendment in the bill and ensure that our troops are not robbed to pay for a border wall. But I want to be clear: the adoption of this amendment will not prevent passage of the underlying bill. If the amendment is adopted, it will be incorporated into the bill and the bill will immediately be voted upon. We all have an opportunity to stand united to support our Nation’s servicemembers and to protect hardearned taxpayer dollars from the President’s political pipe dream. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my final amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, this is a procedural motion that, in my view, should be rejected. We could spend all day and night arguing provisions that prohibit what is not in the bill. There is nothing in this bill that authorizes a border wall. The focus of the bill is the men and women who serve our Nation in the military and the national security of the United States. And that is what I want to take a moment to talk about. I would suggest that all of us think back just to the events of the last 10 days. On July 4, North Korea launched what most observers believe is an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching parts of the United States. And we know they already have nuclear weapons. On July 9, Iraqi Prime Minister al Abadi went into Mosul to celebrate the ousting of ISIS with U.S. advisers, U.S. airpower, and U.S. intelligence. Also, this week, the Chinese navy conducted drills in the Mediterranean on their way to conduct joint exercises with the Russians in the Balkans. This is just a taste of the world we live in, and there are provisions in this bill that address every one of these incidents, from more missile defense to getting more ships in the water faster and cheaper, to supporting our efforts against ISIS, alQaida, and terrorist groups. But there is another event this week that I hope we all keep in mind. On Monday, July 10, a KC–130 crashed on its way across the country, resulting in the death of 15 marines and one sailor. We do not know what caused this crash, but the early evidence indicates that there was a catastrophic failure when it was cruising at altitude. It will be fully investigated. But in the meantime, I think we always have to remember that, even on routine training missions, even on routine deployments, the men and women who serve are risking their lives for us. We owe them the best equipment, in the best shape, with the best training that our Nation can provide. Unfortunately, that is not what they have been getting. This year, our committee has heard testimony that, under the budget caps, the Army is outranged, outgunned, and outdated. More than half the Navy aircraft cannot fly. More than half the planes in the Air Force qualify for an antique license in the State of Virginia. More than half the planes the Navy has can’t fly. Unfortunately, accident rates are going up. Sometimes I have heard the argument that: Well, we are not going to give them any more money until they can pass an audit or they can do this and that or the other thing. But as everybody rushes out to get on their airplanes, just think about this: What if the board of directors of your airline decided that they are not going to spend any more money repairing planes until there is a bookkeeping problem solved in headquarters? Yet that is exactly what we have been doing to our military. We have not been giving them the planes and other equipment in good repair. Every year for 55 straight years, Congresses and Presidents of both parties have passed into law a National Defense Authorization Act. There is a lot of credit to go around, including the Members on both sides of this aisle who have contributed to this product. I am very grateful for what they have done. But what I am really grateful for are the men and women who serve and inspire us, the men and women who are counting on us. Mr. Speaker, I would just say, whatever our differences on other issues, which we will have time to debate in another time and place, whatever our differences about what is in or not in this bill, we need to put those differences aside and continue to support the men and women who serve and defend us. Let’s not let them down. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No. 356 through No. 378 due to my spouse’s health situation in California. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘no’’ on the Conaway Amendment, ‘‘yea’’ on the Polis Amendment, ‘‘yea’’ on the Jayapal Amendment, ‘‘yea’’ on the Nadler Amendment, ‘‘yea’’ on the Blumenauer Amendment, ‘‘yea’’ on the Aguilar Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Rogers Amendment, ‘‘yea’’ on the Garamendi Amendment, ‘‘yea’’ on the Blumenauer Amendment No. 13, ‘‘no’’ on the McClintock Amendment, ‘‘yea’’ on the Garamendi Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Buck Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Perry Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Harztler Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Gosar Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Rooney Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Franks Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Lamborn Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Byrne Amendment, ‘‘no’’ on the Hunter Amendment, and ‘‘yea’’ on the McGovern Amendment. I would have also voted ‘‘yea’’ on the Motion to Recommit. I would have also voted ‘‘no’’ on final passage of H.R. 2810— National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2018. 
AUTHORIZING CLERK TO MAKE TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING CHANGES TO H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, in the engrossment of H.R. 2810, the Clerk be authorized to correct section numbers, punctuation, and crossreferences, and to make such other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect the actions of the House in amending the bill, and that the instruction in amendment No. 35 printed in House Report 115–217 be changed from page 125 to page 121, and that the instruction in amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 115–212 be changed from page 569, line 12, to page 569, line 14. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to inquire of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come, and I yield to my friend, Majority Leader MCCARTHY from California. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today. In addition, the House will consider three bills that help modernize our energy infrastructure and fully utilize America’s natural resources. First will be H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, sponsored by Representative BILLFLORES . This bill would ensure better coordination between FERC and other agencies in the permitting of new pipelines, while improving accountability by requiring more public disclosures. Next would be H.R. 2883, the Promoting CrossBorder Energy Infrastructure Act, sponsored by Representative MARKWAYNE MULLIN . This important bill establishes a uniform and transparent process for constructing electric transmission facilities and crossborder pipelines. And third, H.R. 806, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act, sponsored by Representative PETE OLSON , which streamlines the compliance process and ensures reasonable implementation of the 2015 air quality standards. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 218, the King Cove Land Exchange Act, sponsored by Representative DONYOUNG . This land exchange will provide the residents of King Cove a safe and reliable transportation route to necessary medical care. I look forward to passing these critical bills in the House. Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the House. Mr. Speaker, if I could take a moment and wish Chairman THORNBERRY  a happy birthday tomorrow. I think passing his bill today was that birthday gift from all. I will notify Members of any changes to our schedule. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that information. Mr. Speaker, I might say that that may be the most expensive birthday present anybody ever has gotten, when you mentioned Mr. THORNBERRY . The chairman has done very well, and I congratulate him on his work and on 
his bipartisan working together with his committee members. The majority leader and I have talked about this briefly, but, obviously, we now have on the schedule 2 weeks left to go to do our business. There is some discussion in the Senate, as the gentleman knows, about them meeting into August. Obviously, one of the problems with that is for, particularly, younger Members. A lot of Members here have children who go back to school the third week in August, so the first 2 weeks are not available to them. Can we give them some direction on whether or not we expect to be here past the scheduled adjournment date of July 31? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. As of now, I have no scheduled changes to what has been announced. I do want to notify the Members, though, when the Senate sends us a healthcare bill, if we are still in session, we will move to the healthcare bill. If we are out, back in our districts, I would give them a notified time appropriate to come back and begin our work. We would not wait until the recess is over. We would begin work. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Members ought to plan accordingly. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, the Appropriations Committee is marking up its bills, but we have not yet adopted a budget and, therefore, have no House approved top line for discretionary spending. Can the majority leader give us any view as to whether or not the Budget Committee may be reporting, before we leave for the August break, a budget establishing an upper line for discretionary spending? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have two good pieces of information I would take from there. The Budget Committee will be marking up in committee next week. Appropriations, as you know, because you were a member of it, I have never seen appropriations work like they have this year, knowing that we have a new administration, knowing that you get the budget late, but they have every single bill, all 12, out of subcommittee already. As of the end of the day, they will have seven out of full committee, and at the end of next week, they will have all 12 done through subcommittee and full committee. So I knew you would be excited. Those are concerns of yours. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for his observation. I might say, if I can, the first year I was majority leader, which was in 2007, we passed all appropriations bills before the August break to the Senate, but I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee is moving forward, and let’s hope that we can honor regular order. Does the majority leader expect us to consider each of the bills that the gentleman refers to as having been passed through subcommittee, some through full committee? Do we expect to consider those discretely one at a time on the floor? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, no decision has been made yet. Knowing that we are in a different situation with a new administration, there is an opportunity to do it differently but be able to make sure we take up all the bills. I will keep the gentleman notified of when decisions are made. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader. Mr. Speaker, in addition, one of the things, obviously, that I think both sides are concerned about, and Secretary Mnuchin has urged, and others have urged us to deal with, is the debt limit. We are not exactly sure when it will be necessary and when the administration will run out of extraordinary measures to ensure that we pay our bills. I have told the majority leader privately and I have said publicly to the press that assuming we have a clean debt limit extension, it would be my intention to urge my Members to support such a clean debt limit extension. Does the gentleman have any thought as to when we might be considering that? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and for the question. Mr. Speaker, I do agree with the gentleman on the premise that it is responsible fiscal policy and it is important to our country’s ability to succeed, that includes honoring the full faith and credit of the United States. The last information I was given, I believe this is public, is that the debt ceiling will not run out until October. There was conversation that that could have been earlier, but we will continue to work with you and Secretary Mnuchin to make sure we pass an extension. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, lastly, I would say that obviously I know the gentleman and I, and I think the overwhelming majority of Members of the House on both sides of the aisle, are very concerned that we ensure that sanctions on Iran’s malevolent actions and Russia’s actions, including involving itself in an American election, is an item of concern. I know the gentleman is working on it. Can the gentleman tell me what he thinks the schedule for that bill might be? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, unfortunately, in the Senate, we had a constitutional challenge on a blue slip on the way they passed their bill. There is concern on this side that we want to make sure we move that bill in a very quick manner and do it correctly. I do believe that there is a bill that moved out of here that there is an addition that should be added, North Korea. That came out of here 419–1, but I believe Iran, the work that Russia has done, and what North Korea has done, it would be a very strong statement for all of America to get that sanction bill completed and done and to the President’s desk as soon as possible. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I share that view that we want to get this done as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, JULY 14, 2017, TO MONDAY, JULY 17, 2017 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, July 17, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
ENSURING VETERAN ACCESS TO SNAP (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week the House debated the National Defense Authorization Act, which I believe is one of the most essential responsibilities of Congress, to fund our armed services. This House works to ensure our servicemen and women have the resources they need to keep America safe. We must also make certain that our veterans, our military, have access to the resources they need to be successful in civilian life. This certainly includes access to nutritional food. Out of the 22 million veterans in the United States, about 1.7 million are in households that currently participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Approximately 46 percent of our veterans are senior citizens, including those who served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. Veterans of all ages may also have widely varying levels of disabilities or limitations. SNAP cannot solve all of the challenges a veteran or a member of an ActiveDuty military family faces, but it can help eligible veterans once they return home. As the Agriculture Committee prepares the next farm bill, we must remain vigilant in our dedication to 
serve those who have given so much in the defense of our Nation. 
IN TRIBUTE TO KAYE FISSINGER (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to Kaye Fissinger, a late resident of Colorado, who passed away at the age of 73. I only got to know Kaye during her time in Colorado the last 11 years of her life. I got to meet her through her work in founding Our Health, Our Future, Our Longmont that initiated a successful fracking ban for the city of Longmont and dealt with the disposal of fracking waste products in the city of Longmont. While, unfortunately, that fracking ban was later overturned by the Supreme Court, the legacy of her citizen activism should be inspiring for all of us. Her friend, Marisa Dirks, said: ‘‘She was a fierce warrior for democracy and for our environment. . . . ‘’ Our mutual friend, Bob Norris, said: ‘‘Kaye was dedicated to many aspects of having a better and safer environment for all.’’ Kaye is somebody who, as a citizen, was able to pull people together and had more effect on keeping people safe than the politicians. Kaye truly helped give voice to the power of the people, and her legacy will live on with all those who were touched and protected by her actions. 
BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, WELCOMES THE VIETNAM TRAVELING MEMORIAL WALL (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, welcomes the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall to Penndel Memorial Field. Fifty years ago, many brave women and men from Bucks and Montgomery Counties were among the tens of thousands who would give their lives in the Vietnam war. The traveling wall is a largescale replica of the memorial here in Washington, D.C. It moves around the Nation, providing remembrance and healing to local communities like Bucks County, where 136 soldiers were killed or MIA during the Vietnam war. I am proud of the PenndelHulmeville Memorial Day Parade Committee, Ed Preston; Mike Fitzpatrick; Rich Rush; Vince and Lori Muscato; Mike Sodano; Tom Preston; Ray Mongillo; Walt Davidson; Vicki McLaughlin; Paul Shanahan; Paul and Alexandria Schnider; Dale Walton, Jr.; Carol Beauchamp; Greg Woodrow; and all the volunteers and veterans for their relentless effort to bring the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall to Bucks County. As we honor those who died in service of our Nation, we, too, thank all of those who have served, and we pause to thank and think of those who are defending our country today. f 
STRENGTHENING DOD’S RESPONSE TO PFOA AND PFOS WATER CONTAMINATION (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the House Armed Services Committee for working with me to strengthen the Defense Department’s response to PFOA and PFOS water contamination issues. These contaminants are plaguing communities due to the use of AFFF firefighting foams across our Nation, including in Horsham and Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, in my district. I have been fighting for Federal resources and responsibility since first learning of these issues. With my amendment, and the $30 million increases each for the Air Force and Navy to combat this issue that we fought so hard for, this bill is an important step in the right direction toward addressing this issue any and every way we possibly can, but our fight continues. My bipartisan legislation, H.R. 3106, would require an enforceable nationwide drinking water standard for PFCs, including PFOA and PFOS, rather than the current voluntary advisory. I will keep fighting to address this issue with the seriousness it merits. 
b1200 BENEFITS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE FUNDING (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my support for the National Defense Authorization Act. The United States of America is the greatest force for freedom, peace, and prosperity. We are the greatest because we have built a military that has the best equipped, the best trained, and the best led fighting force the world has ever known. Mr. Speaker, we all have a moral responsibility to every servicemember who puts their life on the line for America. That responsibility is to give them superior equipment, sound strategy that doesn’t put them in unnecessary danger, and care for their families while they are away. This bill gives our troops a sorelyneeded pay raise, and helps to rebuild our military, thus fulfilling our promise. In the words of George Washington: ‘‘To be prepared for war is the most effectual means of preserving peace.’’ I am proud of this bill, and I am thankful for my amendment to be included in it, that expands veteran opportunities to get credentialed. It allows servicemembers to use the skills they developed in the military to be more competitive in the workforce. It allows them to get credentialed for in demand professions that are valued by our civilian employers. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this bill, and I am thankful for all those who worked on it. f 
SENATE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL SHOULD BE TOSSED IN THE TRASH (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, the new version of the Senate Republican healthcare bill should be tossed in the trash. No amendment will fix the massive damage it will cause to California and the entire country. Women, seniors, and lowincome families across the country are being threatened. TrumpCare threatens to shut down hospitals in my district, which would leave many of my constituents without access to critical healthcare services. People like Doreen from Los Angeles County, will be forced to fight for their lives. Doreen was in remission from ovarian cancer in 2010, when she successfully signed up to receive coverage through the Affordable Care Act, even though she had a preexisting condition. Now she is scared for her life as TrumpCare threatens to take away the healthcare she needs to stay cancer free. I stand up for ‘‘fighters,’’ ‘‘luchadoras’’ like Doreen—a woman, senior, and cancer survivor—who will be left helpless by TrumpCare. Again, the Senate Republican healthcare bill should be tossed in the trash. 
TRIBUTE TO SENATOR LUKE KENLEY (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the most influential legislators in the history of the Indiana General Assembly, Luke Kenley, who has recently announced his decision to retire after 25 years of service representing District 20 in the Indiana State Senate. Senator Kenley was an invaluable resource and mentor during my 6 years of service in the State Senate, and I am grateful that I had the opportunity to learn from him. Senator Kenley has established himself as a champion of physical responsibility and limited government. His accomplishments are too numerous to fully list here, but since 2009, he has led 
the Senate Appropriations Committee, during which time Indiana passed five balanced budgets, cut taxes, invested in priorities, and built a substantial rainy day fund. And Senator Kenley has been the architect of our State’s remarkable fiscal turnaround, and his impact on Hoosiers will be felt for generations to come. With a national debt approaching $20 trillion, I think it is fair to say we could use a lot more of Luke Kenley’s style of leadership here in our Nation’s Capital. I wish him well as he prepares to step down on September 30, and I thank him for his remarkable service. 
FIRST, DO NO HARM (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, those who support the GOP medical bill have forgotten one of the main and first principles of medical care: Do no harm. They said repeatedly that they would protect preexisting conditions. They said that they would protect accessible and affordable healthcare and premiums. But they must have been crossing their fingers when they said it because nothing is further from the truth. Under their latest bill, premiums will soar, particularly for the elderly. Women would have to, once again, worry about preexisting conditions, such as pregnancy. The defunding of Planned Parenthood would hurt many women, particularly lowincome women. And the cuts to Medicare in the bill would be devastating to millions of women, seniors, children, and the disabled. In addition, the diminished subsidies could mean that more people than the 22 million in the last bill who were removed from healthcare under the bill will lose their healthcare. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this disastrous bill. 
CHINA ABUSES ITS OWN PEOPLE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the United States is finally holding China accountable for its longstanding human trafficking abuses. In the State Department’s 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report, China was downgraded to the worst level: tier 3. This means that, in the past year, the Chinese have done little to nothing to end human trafficking, which is nothing more than modernday slavery in this communist nation. China’s crimes include statesponsored forced labor, sex trafficking, and trafficking of children, men, and women from other countries. This puts China alongside some of the world’s worst offenders of human rights: Russia, Syria, and Iran. It illegally detains and tortures its own people, as well as U.S. citizens that are there. It also restricts the fundamental human right to free speech and freedom of religion. China is allowing labor and sex trafficking to flourish in its borders. Now the entire world knows what has been taking place behind their great wall of brutality: abuse. And that is just the way it is. f 
WE CANNOT LET POLITICS GET IN THE WAY OF PATRIOTISM (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow politics to get in the way of patriotism in this House. We might disagree about healthcare, or we might disagree about tax reform, but I know that there are patriots in this House who want to stand together against Russian interference in our elections, patriots who will record their votes for country above party. The Senate passed Russia sanctions 98–2. This is not controversial policy. The controversy, Mr. Speaker, is the refusal to let us vote on it. If you call the vote, Russian sanctions would pass; they would pass with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of patriots, those of us who refuse to let anyone stand in the way of defending our Nation. When this Nation is under attack, we must come together, Mr. Speaker. Let us vote to condemn Russian cyber attacks, let us vote to insulate sanctions from political interference, and let us stand together as patriots to defend the United States. Mr. Speaker, bring the Russia sanctions bill, the one that passed the Senate last week, the one that passed 98–2, bring it to a vote here, let us pass it, send it to the President’s desk, and see whether he will sign it. 
CONGRATULATING SUSQUEHANNA VALLEY EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Susquehanna Valley Emergency Medical Services, a first responder organization in my district, for receiving the American Heart Association’s Gold Plus Award. Only 1 percent of organizations nationwide achieve this designation. The designation recognizes the great length that Susquehanna EMS has taken to improve the treatment of patients suffering from severe heart attacks. Last year, Susquehanna EMS personnel provided lifesaving treatment to 94 percent of patients within the critical 90minute time period prescribed by the American Heart Association. These remarkable individuals who serve have taken incredible pride in their work that has had real lifesaving results in our community. To the dedicated men and women of Susquehanna Valley EMS, I and your community thank you. f 
SANCTION THE KGB, MR. PUTIN, AND RUSSIA (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we are not Republicans and we are not Democrats. We are Americans, and we draw together around the protecting of America’s security. With that in mind, you can imagine my shock as a member of the Judiciary Committee to find out that a KGB agent was in a meeting with Jared Kushner, who now has a security clearance, and Donald Trump, Jr., among others. I was shocked to find out that the lawyer who was present in that meeting had a $200 million lawsuit to stop being sued on the money laundering, and that that lawsuit was settled by the Trump Justice Department for $6 million—$200 million down to $6 million. To the American people, that means that the $200 million that was owed to this government turned out to be $6 million. That is why I will have a resolution to ask the President to step down. And, as well, to introduce a resolution—a constitutional resolution—to begin a constitutional investigation into whether or not we are protected here in this Nation. Our security is our greatest priority. I would also suggest that the sanctions bill that was voted on in the Senate must be voted on in the House now. We cannot still continue to hide the ball. Sanction the KGB, sanction Mr. Putin, sanction Russia. They are, in fact, here to demolish the democracy of this Nation. 
YAKIMA VALLEY’S BEST BEER EXPERIENCE AWARD (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a region in my district, the Yakima Valley, for being recognized as the winner of the World Food Travel Association’s FoodTrekking Award for Best Beer Experience. John Cooper, president and CEO of Yakima Valley Tourism, nominated the region for the award, and this is just one example of the efforts John and his group are making to promote the budding beer and hospitality industries of the Yakima Valley. The FoodTrekking Awards recognize excellent food and beverage tourism experiences all over the world, and it is an honor for Yakima to be selected as 
the winner for the Best Beer Experience among the international applicants. Central Washington’s beer industry is thriving and has greatly contributed to the increase in tourism as well as the overall economic development of the area. As a thirdgeneration hops farmer from the Yakima Valley, I am proud that our fellow growers and our local craft brewers are receiving recognition for their efforts in making our region a unique travel destination. Please join me in congratulating John, his team, and the entire industry for helping bring such a prestigious award to Washington’s Fourth District. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF NEW YORK STATE TROOPER JOEL R. DAVIS (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of New York State Trooper Joel R. Davis. Trooper Davis was tragically killed in the line of duty on July 9, while responding to a domestic disturbance call in the town of Theresa, in upstate New York. Another victim was also tragically killed in this terrible accident. Trooper Davis was a father, son, husband, and a friend to many. He was deeply involved in his community, and also served as the commissioner of a local youth league baseball team. Trooper Davis was wellrespected by all those who worked with him and beloved by everyone. As New Yorkers, we stand in solidarity to mourn the life of Trooper Davis, a dedicated public servant and a life that was too soon lost. At this heartbreaking time, we offer our condolences to his family, community, and colleagues alike. It is at times like these that we come together and pause to extend our gratitude in all law enforcement in our State and across the Nation who risk their lives every day to protect us and to keep us safe. We are grateful for their dedication, service, and bravery of outstanding members like Trooper Joel Davis, who will rest in peace. 
THANKING JANET BOSLEY (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and public service of Janet Bosley. Janet has been a caseworker in my district office and previously served my predecessor, Congressman Matt Salmon. She is a wife, a mother, a grandmother, and I am very happy to call her my friend. Janet will soon be retiring. She faithfully served the constituents of Arizona’s Fifth Congressional District for the past 5 years, and her steady presence in the district has been invaluable. My staff and I are going to miss Janet’s infectious smile and her witty stories. She is one of the most engaging people I have known, and my life has been blessed because of her friendship and example. I wish her the best of luck and happiness as she moves into this new chapter in her life. Thank you, Janet. May God bless you. f 
b1215 THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of discussion as we gather to talk about the role of government and almost everything that we do day to day. I think most Americans, as they go to work and they look at how the government’s role is in their lives, they don’t really give the government a lot of thought. They want to be left alone. They are willing to pay some measure of taxes to have things that we all agree on, like schools, roads, bridges, stoplights, national defense, other things. We like to see efficient government. We like to see it small. We like to see it without waste. If there are things that other services can provide without it being done by government, we like choices. We like privatization. We like the private sector. But there are certain things, Mr. Speaker, that the government does have a role in. This was recognized by perhaps the finest American we ever produced, Abraham Lincoln, when he said: ‘‘The legitimate object of government is to do for the people what needs to be done, but which they can not, by individual effort, do at all, or do so well, for themselves.’’ Mr. Speaker, there are three sectors in which the government does have a role; and we as conservatives might want limited government, efficiency, and lack of waste, and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would want similar things, but they might approach it a different way. We all, as Americans, have a moral obligation to protect the security of the United States of America. We have just seen that with the passage of the National Defense Authorization. But what I would like to address today is a breach in one of our pillars of national security with a proposal with our aerospace. The three areas that we must safeguard and protect are our national defense, our national intelligence, and our national aerospace. We are considering now an AIRR Act, H.R. 2997, which would take the Federal Aviation Administration’s reauthorization, which we have to do, and it will pretty much remove Federal control of air traffic controllers and the control of our aerospace and put it into private industry. Many of us, in a bipartisan fashion, have grave concerns with this. I am one of them. If you look at H.R. 2997, what you will find is that the President has diminished authority. In the 1980s, when air traffic controllers, through their unions, went on strike and they said, ‘‘We are not going to play; we are going to picket,’’ and it put the United States at risk, Ronald Reagan warned them by saying, ‘‘If you do that, you are fired.’’ They said, ‘‘Oh, he is not going to do that. How is he going to control the skies?’’ The President, acting on his constitutional responsibilities, fired them. He took control, as he should have, and air traffic controllers, by the thousands, were removed, and others were put in their place. H.R. 2997 would remove this type of authority that the President of the United States would have. If this bill were to become law, President Reagan would not have been able to do what he did in the 1980s. It also removes title 31 authority. What is that? Well, title 31 authority is how we, through the appropriations process and through the power of the purse, control and oversee government so that we, the people, and their duly elected representatives are able to control the aspects and agencies of government; because without this, without this power of the purse and without this powerful oversight tool, you might have bureaucracies become an entity unto themselves. So title I authority is vital that we have those hearings, controls, measures, and prohibitions so that even if something is decided on, money is not authorized, and, therefore, it gets shut down. Title 31 authority in H.R. 2997 would be removed. There are also no other oversight provisions that would be put in its place. Why? Because what it is doing is it will take the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic control system and it will put it into the hands of a private company. Now, I am all about privatization in business and choices, and there are a lot of things. But going back to the Lincoln quote, there are certain collective things that we cannot do as individuals and that the government has a role. If waste, inability to procure, inability to modernize, or inefficiencies were a condemnation to privatize everything, then why don’t we just privatize national defense? They waste money. They have trouble procuring. They have trouble modernizing. Why don’t we just turn over national defense to the private sector? We would never do such a thing because it would place all of us at risk. 
Yet we are going to take the national aerospace control of the skies, and as it stacks up—and there is a lot that goes on up there, as I will illustrate—we are going to put that into the hands of a private company. This private company would have a board, but it will not have title I authority oversight, and under its current form, the President will have diminished authority only in time of war to take control of the aerospace system. This is a bad idea. It also transfers all DOD intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense intelligence agencies, Homeland Security support to this private entity. Today, the FAA does a lot of things with their air traffic controllers. What do they do? At any given moment, and as many of you flew into Washington, D.C., to come and see your government at work, you flew on an airline. Sometimes there are delays. You get it. There is weather. There are different things. Other times, you are sitting there and it is clear as a bell and you are wondering what is the holdup. Part of the reason, unknown to even the pilots on the tarmac, is that there are missions that our military performs. There are national intelligence missions that are being performed and surveillance missions that are being performed. There are homeland security and border security missions that are being performed. When they take priority, they also take priority for air traffic control and the clearances, and many times things will have to be rerouted to accommodate it. The American public and even the pilots on the planes are none the wiser. Now, under H.R. 2997, the problem that you will have is that all of this authority will now be coordinated with a private entity. I will explain why this is a problem in a moment. As a conservative, I am all about privatization where it makes sense, but when it comes to national security, as a combat infantryman, a veteran of three wars, someone who served my country in uniform for 21 years, we must protect this great Republic, and there is a role for the United States Government when it comes to our national security. When we have strayed from this and tried to privatize certain sectors, our greatest embarrassments with national intelligence have been when we have contracted to private entities for that collection. Think Edward Snowden. Think leaks in government with classified information getting out. Where is that occurring? It is occurring with subcontractors and private entities who we were assured when we passed these laws: Oh, they will be under the same agencies, under the same systems, and everything will be fine. Trust us. And then we in Congress have authorized that. And then what? We sit at our hearings and our committees with our bony fingers and our red faces, saying: Mr. Secretary or Mr. Agency Head, how did you let this happen? All we have to do is look in the mirror. When we take these controls away on things that we must have a government role in—defense, intelligence, and aerospace—we are creating the very construct that causes these problems. Our alliances were shaken. Our country was embarrassed. Our intelligence was placed at risk. Operators in the field were exposed, some even harmed, because contractors let it get out of hand. Look at national defense. We see some of the same things. Some of the most embarrassing episodes that we have had have been with security contractors in national defense. We were told: Hey, you don’t have time for that; we don’t have the budget for that; we can do this more efficiently; you don’t need to do this. Yet some of the most blackeyed moments have been with contractors. Well, what about on the administrative side? That would make sense. I see my colleague, Representative TEDLIEUhere. He and I have been very frustrated in seeing some of these types of decisions being made with contracting. The Office of Personnel Management: Hey, let’s take this away from the Department of Defense, and let’s move all of these classified personnel records, and we will have a clearinghouse, and we can contract that. Everything will be good. You don’t have to devote time and treasure to do this. Yet 25 million exposed records later of those that held security clearances— Mr. LIEUand I both receiving a letter in the mail saying that we had been exposed because we held top secret clearances in the military. And yet when we made these decisions, we said this will be really good if we move this to contracting. It will be more efficient. It will save us money, and it will be just as good. Well, that was not the case. So now that takes us to national aerospace. What are we talking about here? Tens of thousands of aircraft in the air in flights every single day. And if it is so broken a system, when was the last time a major, fatal airline crash happened? Can’t remember? You would have to go back a ways, which I will cover in a moment. But let’s stick with these national security concerns. H.R. 2997 diminishes the power of the President, takes away title I authority, does not replace it with any other congressional controls. Sure, it has congressional review for fee changes or rulemaking, but nothing else. It transfers Department of Defense, Intelligence, Homeland Security, Border Security, all of these things, and it places them under a coordination with a private entity. And they assure us, oh, it will be the same system we have now; everything is going to be just fine. But the problem is that a private entity, unlike today—did you know every air traffic controller in an air traffic control tower takes an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States? Most people didn’t even know that, to include those that crafted H.R. 2997. They take an oath of office. They have to be a United States citizen. Why? Because it is vital to our national security. Now we want to change that because it is efficient, and it is a broken, archaic system. Well, we are all about modernizing. That is common ground we can all agree on. We need to modernize. But we do not need to go the direction that H.R. 2997 has, this AIRR Act. My issues with the bill are purely on policy. There are excellent people that have worked this issue for a number of years. They have the right motives and the right reasons for approaching this issue. But when it comes to national security, we also have a constitutional and moral requirement to support and defend our great Republic, and here is where some of that is put at risk. Let me enumerate a few of them for you. Air traffic controllers and managers who work in air traffic control facilities across the country are routinely involved in operations that deal directly with the national security of the United States. How so? Well, most Americans, to include Members of Congress, are not even aware of this facet of their work. For instance, prior to the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom—this is a true story—an FAA supervisor placed a number of flight plans in front of an air traffic controller in Kansas City. Those flight plans were for B–2 Stealth bombers that were about to depart from Whiteman Air Force Base, fly across the Atlantic and drop their bombs in Afghanistan, opening the rounds of our response to 9/11, and then they would come back to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. b1230 Now, if you and I were sitting on the tarmac in the Kansas City airport and looking outside, we would say, ‘‘Wow, what is the holdup?’’ totally oblivious. Yet this is important work. And their mission was obviously classified at that time, but it was FAA U.S. Government air traffic controllers—not private contractors, not private company citizens—controllers and managers working these aircraft in U.S. airspace many hours prior to the start of the armed conflict. Every time Air Force One takes off from Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., carrying very important people, to include the President of the United States, it is an FAA U.S. Government air traffic controller clearing that aircraft for takeoff. Not just clearing it, then it is an FAA U.S. Government air traffic controller and manager who ensure the security of the airspace flown by the world’s most famous symbol of freedom, the shiny 
blue and white Boeing 747 used by Air Force One and Two as a secure way to transport our President, our Vice President, other officials, as they are called and closely monitored by the FAA and other air traffic controllers and managers anytime Air Force One or Marine One aircraft are airborne. These are operations that go unseen. Many of them and the aspects of them are obviously classified and we could never go into here. But they are vital to our security. They should not be put in a private corporation’s hands where there is no oversight and no control. The FAA air traffic controllers and managers routinely provide airspace security, sometimes for hours on end, at locations across the country as the FBI or State and local law enforcement perform classified missions using government aircraft. In some cases, not even other aircraft know about those missions or what it is that they are conducting, depending upon the sensitivity of what it is that they are doing or is being performed. U.S. air traffic controllers, government employees, and managers also participate in drug interdiction operations with the Drug Enforcement Administration as well as Customs and Border Protection. This might involve providing intercept vectors due to drug aircraft, drug lords trying to sneak things in or whatever it might be, and that has to alter flight plans and do very complicated things. It might also involve protecting the airspace for drone operations. Many people are unaware that the FAA U.S. GovernmentEmployed air traffic controllers and managers are also responsible for military flights, not just the kind that I described at our bases and airports, but this includes specialuse airspace that maybe has been delegated to the United States in other countries, or to do flight training, refueling, attack and bombing missions. And these same governmentemployed air traffic controllers and managers are responsible for military aircraft on secret missions, to include drones and drone killers. They are responsible for the aircraft of military uses to communicate with our nuclear infrastructure so that if we have to, God forbid, defend the Republic in that manner, they are right there in that loop of that system, not some private company. They are also responsible for the airspace above the areas where our missile defense capacities occur and the testing systems that go on with that. You can see why handing these coordinations over to a private company might be a little problematic. And then let’s look at September 11, 2001. It was FAA U.S. Government air traffic controllers and managers who were responsible for putting over 4,000 aircraft on the ground almost immediately, in very short order, after America was attacked by terrorists using planes as weapons, killing 3,000 of our fellow citizens. But it was the rapidity of response because of the way the network is that they were able to make instant decisions, not having to coordinate through some private corporation, that they were able to do so. And I will speak more about that. The airspace above this very Capitol and above the White House, the Supreme Court, and all the monuments that you have enjoyed as you have come to Washington, D.C., or as you work here, the symbols of our Republic, are closely watched over by the FAA, and they are air traffic controllers and managers who have sworn an oath, unlike people in private companies. They don’t swear oaths. Employees of private corporations do not take oaths, nor do they promise to defend against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Privatizing the U.S. air traffic control system will not enhance our country’s national security. Unfortunately, the national security role that FAA controllers and managers perform every day is not well known, even among Members here. But one could list a number of functions that our government performs where we do have a vested interest, the people, in saying we give this authority, we the people, to the government because we can’t do this as individuals. The Federal Government does have a role. So is it about modernization or is it about privatization? We are all in agreement on modernization, but privatization, I am afraid, Mr. Speaker, that a lot of us are like a pack of dogs lapping up antifreeze. It smells good, it might even taste good, but it is not without drastic consequence. Just this week, we narrowly missed having to vote on this bill in its current form next week. This is why I am bringing these points out, so that we do not make this grave mistake that will breach our national security. Well meaning people, friends, colleagues, people with just as much passion as I may have, but yet we the people have to take a step back and protect our national security. There are also, in H.R. 2997, no provisions to prohibit in this private corporation foreign nationals working in it. Today, if you are going to be an air traffic controller, you have to be a United States citizen. You have to take an oath of office. Under a private corporation or whom they subcontract with for air traffic control, this bill, were it to become law—and it cannot, we must prevent it—what would happen is there are no prohibitions in that law against foreign nationals guiding your skies or taking an oath of office where they are as committed to our Republic, Mr. Speaker, as any of us with the oaths that we have to take. The national security concerns are paramount. Until we address them, we should not rush in. We want modernization. I applaud the President of the United States for wanting to bring this issue to the light of the public. We need modernization. We agree with that. In fact, just knowing that we have his support to move towards a modernized plan gives us great comfort because we need that backing from the Executive. But we have to address these national security issues, and right now, this bill does not do that. Even if it did address all of these, there is still a question that remains: Has the government demonstrated that it cannot control the skies and that the FAA’s air traffic control system and its controllers are incapable of keeping us safe? I can see if it is something that is broken and we have to intervene as government and make sure it is more efficient and we have to do the right thing, but in this case, where is all of this brokenness that we are hearing about? Sure, archaic equipment—been there and done that serving in the military. As you heard Chairman THORN BERRY say today, half of the Air Force’s aircraft would qualify for antique license if they were civilian aircraft and registered in Virginia. As a soldier, I live by the motto, ‘‘I will fight with what I have, and I will win where I fight.’’ Whether it is with flintlocks, hatchets, modern rifles, or modern technology, poor is the workman who blames his tools. And our FAA air traffic controllers do a marvelous job with the systems they have. That is why almost a decade ago we worked towards the nextgeneration system to modernize, and it is on track with procured funding like NASA has because it is expensive stuff and it takes time. You don’t want that subject to funding problems. The FAA, as a whole, has those funding problems. You have a continuing resolution or a government shutdown like in 2013, wow, that creates ripples. But if it is about modernization of our control towers, it is on track for the pilots that we might have. And I know, Mr. Speaker, you have put yourself at the wheel of planes, and in this case there are a lot of things that we can see where the FAA does a marvelous job. It doesn’t mean that we have to privatize it. On 9/11, over 4,000 planes were grounded immediately and safely. What a lot of Americans don’t know, Mr. Speaker, is that the FAA’s national operations manager who made that unprecedented gutsy call, he was a government employee, you know, one of those bloated government employees we have got to fire and move out. His name was Ben Sliney. And guess what? That was his first day on the job as the FAA’s national operations manager. Wow, what a first day. But he was good. He had taken an oath to the Republic. He made a gutsy call; 4,000 planes put on the ground, and it helped keep our Republic safer, because it could have been worse. The FAA has clearly demonstrated through its air traffic control system that it can handle the job. When was the last time we can remember a fatal 
accident with a major carrier? 2009, and that was a regional carrier. But also in 2009 there was something else that happened. On the 15th of January, 1 month before the fatal accident in February in Buffalo, New York, with the regional carrier, which was the last time we had a major fatal accident, that was US Air Flight 1549, piloted by Captain Chesley Sullenberger and copiloted by Jeff Skiles. So what we have seen and what we all know is that the heroism of those two pilots that day put the plane down in the Hudson, saving all onboard. And we saw air traffic controllers doing everything with an emergency at one of the busiest airports, providing so many options. Well, Mr. Sullenberger, like so many of us, has grave concerns with H.R. 2997. This is not a man that has any government interest or privatization this or that or is up here lobbying or doing anything, yet he is somebody America trusts. You might be interested in some of his comments, and I am quoting Captain Sully here. He says: ‘‘My real issue, and I think for many people, is that we have a wonderful and unique freedom in this country, this unfettered, wonderful aviation system that anyone can participate in safely and efficiently. In most countries, it’s either too restrictive or too expensive for an average person to fly, and the only way you can go is on an airliner or military flight,’’ meaning other nations. ‘‘It’s just prohibitively restrictive or expensive to do it any other way. That’s something that we need to protect and preserve, and so why in the world would we give the keys of the kingdom to the largest airlines?’’—under this H.R. 2997 he is referring to. ‘‘Because they definitely have their own agenda to lower their costs. Commercial aviation, airline aviation, has become an extraordinarily costcompetitive industry globally, and it becomes more so day by day.’’ ‘‘By removing oversight of the air traffic control system from the FAA and much of the oversight that Congress currently has,’’ Mr. Sullenberger goes on to state, ‘‘and giving it to a group of people, stakeholders basically controlled by the largest airlines, to control access to and pricing of access to the air traffic control system. That is an extreme solution to what’s really a political budget problem.’’ Captain Sully goes on to say, ‘‘It means bad things for everyone who flies, but especially for people who fly in nonairline ways,’’ meaning general aviation. b1245 ‘‘That is a big part of the system,’’ he says. To continue his quote: ‘‘I am worried about access. I am worried about equitability. I am worried about safety.’’ Okay, to pause in his quotations here, Captain Sully was the guy on safety. He would go around and this was his job in the airlines. No man was better when it came to safety standards. And then he demonstrated it that day, that he knew what he was talking about. For him to make these kinds of comments, I think we need to take pause, and take a step back, and listen. To continue his quote: ‘‘There are other, better ways to solve this political budget problem—by giving the FAA, in running the air traffic control system and making capital improvements to the air traffic control system, more predictable multiyear funding—without giving away the keys to the kingdom to the largest airlines to control access and fees and pricing too.’’ Mr. Speaker, I agree with Captain Sully. I think he knows something about it. Modernization. That is an area we can all agree on. American aviation would suffer terribly without the benefit of the public structure of the air traffic control system, including its accountability to Congress, and the FAA. Establishing a private air traffic control company, corporation, board, outside the purview of Congress, with the unilateral power to collect fees without controls from the government, and distribute service, would threaten our national security—as I have spoken to already—accessibility and affordability of flights, not maybe immediately in the transition, but, as you read H.R. 2997, it goes on to say that they can do a lot of things in a couple of years. Pilot generation. Look at general aviation in the examples that they use for comparisons. Many of the proponents of this bill say: Look at Canada. Look at Europe. I love the Canadian people. I have traveled through most of Europe. I even lived in Germany as an exchange student. Yes, in Germany today, a pilot can go from 35,000 feet in Lufthansa or an airliner, and he can glide all the way down to Tempelhof Airport in Berlin. Why? Because he doesn’t have STEVE  RUSSELL , Mr. Speaker, out there in his Cessna 140 in the way. Guess what? In the United States, I have as much right to airspace as a U.S. citizen flying as that Lufthansa pilot, who is, by the way, just coming here to deliver passengers, or any other airline pilot. That is the beauty of our system. What you won’t find in Germany is general aviation. You won’t find access. And as Captain Sully correctly stated, it is a wonderful thing. We have access to that. It is one of our hallmark freedoms in the United States. Now, when he says that we will be handing over the keys to the kingdom, what he means is that it goes to this private corporation, this board, and then they will, for commercial interests, set up—what does that board look like? Well, here it is, right out of the bill. It will have six of its board members who will be on the commercial side of aviation. Now, I have nothing against commercial aviation. American Airlines, love them, they brought me home from three wars. I will always have those memories. Regional carriers probably brought many folks listening to this today. But they have commercial interests, as Captain Sully correctly stated. They will be concerned about those issues. That’s fine. They run businesses. They don’t have to protect our national security. They fly. And so what we see with this board is six of them in the commercial side— commercial, regional jets. And then you have got one general aviation, and then one on the business side, which could support general aviation or not. But that clearly, as you lay out the board, two that will be appointed by the Secretary of Transportation—kind of his only say in a lot of this process— and then two that will be appointed by the board itself. So what you will have is a twothirds lopsided board that will favor the commercial interests rather than aviation as a whole. This is why Captain Sullenberger, and so many others, have had grave concerns about what it does to our freedoms for flying. Now, much of my protest against this bill will have been because of the national security pieces. We could lay all of this other stuff aside. We have to solve these national security pieces in the bill, and right now, they are not there. With modernization, we can get to some of that, but we have the safest airspace in the world. Where is this broken, archaic system that we hear people saying? Canada, love the Canadians. I have driven the Alcan twice. I have been through so much of the country, driven 1,200, 1,300 miles on a dirt road in Canada, a wonderful place. I have lectured in many of their cities in a former life. But Canada has the population of Texas, and if you were to look at the number of flights it handles each day, probably less flights than Texas. Yes, they have a modern system. We are having a modern system with NextGen. What we need to do is solve the acquisition pieces, the modernization pieces—not the privatization pieces. Why? We all know that much of North America’s security is secured by the United States of America. They don’t have to face the same things. That is why they can get away with such a small military. It is not an indictment. It is just the truth. The bill in question, H.R. 2997, strips oversight authority of our national airspace from the President, the Congress, and gives it to this unelected board of individuals, an action that would threaten the United States’ ability to maintain the integrity of our airspace, as I spoke to earlier, Mr. Speaker, on what goes on at altitudes and in missions that most of us really have no clue. It puts at risk thousands of missions that our military conducts in just 
training and safety in our skies every day. It gives private contractors access to classified data. Let’s go back to what we were talking about with Edward Snowden with the leaks that we are seeing out of the intelligence services these days. Where is that coming from? It is coming from the private contractors. It goes lateral. Do you think it is going to be any different because we here in Congress say: Oh, no, no, no? Hey, it is going to be great. This is going to be—rest assured, and I can already predict what is going to happen, Mr. Speaker. The disasters will strike. We will sit in Oversight and Government Reform with bony fingers and red faces going: How did you let this happen? And all we have to do is look in the mirror, because we are much like dogs lapping up antifreeze, to lick up something that smells good, tastes good, with drastic consequences. If we want to maintain the safest and best airspace in the world, we have to prevent the passage of H.R. 2997. Now, this is hard for me to do. Why? Because I don’t like opposing my own party. I don’t like opposing my friends. I have done some terrible things in my life as a soldier. I don’t like conflict anymore. I try to stay as far away from that as I can, and there are two veterans over here giving me thumbs up—combat veterans themselves. But I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I am not saying if you support this bill you are unconstitutional, or that you don’t love your country, or that you don’t want to protect the Republic. I am not suggesting that at all. I have too many friends who have a counterview to mine. But it is my responsibility to expose what is in this bill and why it is dangerous, and why we can’t do it. Mr. Speaker, we need to call on the American public and have them contact their Members of Congress and tell them to oppose H.R. 2997, to not let privatization of our air traffic control system happen; to keep it into the role that, like Abraham Lincoln said, sometimes things that we can’t do ourselves, we need to do collectively, and the government has a role in that. Mr. Lincoln obviously knew what he was talking about. Modernization, we can all agree on that. Let’s work on that. I applaud the President for bringing this issue to the fore. We need to deliver that win for him. But breaching national security of our airspace and risking our safety on an unproven system is not a win. Mr. Speaker, it is not something that we need to support. I yield back the balance of my time. 
DONALD TRUMP, JR.’S, EMAILS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, on July 11, Donald Trump, Jr., released a series of emails regarding his meeting with a Russian Government lawyer and an individual associated with Russian intelligence. Don Trump, Jr.’s, emails are a smoking gun. They prove that the Trump campaign was not only aware of the Russian Government’s efforts to meddle in our elections, they were enthusiastic about accepting Russia’s support. What follows are the contents of those emails. They painted a disturbing picture of a campaign, and now an administration willing to break the law and sell out to an adversary of the United States in order to advance their own petty interests. Our hope is that the American people will carefully consider the content of these messages and what they say about the fitness of Donald Trump and his senior advisers to hold high office. We will begin. There was a comment posted by Donald Trump, Jr., on Twitter on July 11, 2017. ‘‘To everyone, in order to be totally transparent’’— which we now know he wasn’t even in this email—‘‘I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016. The first email on June 3, 2016 was from Rob, who was relating a request from Emin, a person I knew from the 2013 Ms. Universe Pageant near Moscow. Emin and his father have a very highly respected company in Moscow. The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research. I first wanted to just have a phone call but when that didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting. The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official. And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was ‘the most inane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.’’’ End of email. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GALLEGO. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I am going to be reading the email portions of Rob Goldstone to Donald Trump, Jr. On June 3, 2016, at 10:36 a.m., Rob Goldstone wrote to Donald Trump, Jr., the following: ‘‘Good morning. ‘‘Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. ‘‘The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. ‘‘This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump—helped along by Aras and Emin. ‘‘What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly? ‘‘I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first. ‘‘Best. ‘‘Rob Goldstone.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. On June 3, 2016, at 10:53 a.m., less than 20 minutes after that email, Donald Trump, Jr., wrote back: ‘‘Thanks, Rob, I appreciate that. I am on the road at the moment but perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time, and if it’s what you say, I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back? ‘‘Best, Don.’’ Mr. Speaker, ‘‘I love it.’’ His response was: ‘‘I love it.’’ I worked in politics for a long time. I have never been approached with information from a foreign government. But if I were, my response would not be: ‘‘I love it.’’ My response would be: ‘‘This is completely inappropriate.’’ My response would be: ‘‘Don’t ever contact me again.’’ My response would be: ‘‘I am calling the FBI.’’ In this email, Donald Trump, Jr., showed his true colors. This email proves that he lacks basic integrity. The willingness of Jared Kushner to attend that meeting proves that he, too, is no patriot. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, after we finish reading these emails into the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD , we are going to discuss why it is a straightup violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act. On Monday, June 6, 2016, Rob Goldstone writes back to Donald Trump, Jr., in an email at 12:40 p.m., with a subject heading: ‘‘Russia—Clinton—private and confidential.’’ b1300 ‘‘Hi, Don. ‘‘Let me know when you are free to talk with Emin by phone about this Hillary info—you had mentioned early this week so wanted to try to schedule a time and day. ‘‘Best to you and family. ‘‘Rob Goldstone.’’ On June 6, 2016, at 3:03 p.m., Donald Trump, Jr., wrote back: ‘‘Rob, could we speak now? ‘‘D.’’ Then Rob Goldstone replies to Donald Trump, Jr., that same day at 3:37 p.m.: ‘‘Let me track him down in Moscow. ‘‘What number he could call?’’ 
By the way, any email where someone says tracking someone down in Moscow might just raise some red flags. Mr. GALLEGO. On June 6, 2016, at 3:38 p.m., Donald Trump, Jr., wrote back: ‘‘My cell’’—we have omitted that cell number. Unlike Donald Trump, we do not give out individual cell numbers. ‘‘Thanks. ‘‘D.’’ Mr. TED LIEU of California. Then Rob Goldstone replies: ‘‘Okay. He is on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 minutes so I am sure can call. ‘‘Rob.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. On June 6, 2016, just a few minutes after receiving this email, Donald Trump, Jr., wrote back: ‘‘Rob, thanks for the help.’’ From Moscow thanks for the help, he should have said. Mr. TED LIEU of California. The next day, on June 7, 2016, at 4:20 p.m., Rob Goldstone writes: ‘‘Don. ‘‘Hope all is well. ‘‘Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and the Russian Government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday. ‘‘I believe you are aware of the meeting—and so wondered if 3 p.m. or later on Thursday works for you? ‘‘I assume it would be at your office. ‘‘Best. ‘‘Rob Goldstone.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. On June 7, 2016, at 5:16 p.m., Donald Trump, Jr., writes: ‘‘How about 3 at our offices? Thanks, Rob, appreciate you helping set it up?’’ Mr. TED LIEU of California. Later that same day, on June 7, 2016, Rob Goldstone wrote back to Donald Trump, Jr.: ‘‘Perfect won’t sit in on the meeting, but will bring them at 3 p.m. and introduce you, et cetera? ‘‘I will send the names of the two people meeting with you for security when I have them later today. ‘‘Best. ‘‘Rob.’’ By the way, we now know today that one of those names just happens to be a Soviet counterintelligence officer. Mr. GALLEGO. On June 7, 2016, at 6:14 p.m., Donald Trump, Jr., writes: ‘‘Great. It will likely be Paul Manafort, campaign boss, my brother inlaw’’—Jared Kushner—‘‘and me, 725 Fifth Avenue, 25th floor’’ which is Trump Tower? Mr. TED LIEU of California. On June 8, the next day, at 10:34 a.m., Rob Goldstone writes back to Donald Trump, Jr.: ‘‘Good morning. ‘‘Would it be possible to move tomorrow meeting to 4 p.m. as the Russian attorney is in court until 3, I was just informed? ‘‘Best. ‘‘Rob.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. On June 8, 2016, at 11:15, Donald Trump, Jr., writes: ‘‘Yes, Rob, I could do that unless they wanted to do 3 today instead. Just let me know and I will lock it in either way.’’ That is some eagerness that this man has for this information. Mr. TED LIEU of California. On Wednesday, June 8, 2016, at 11:18 a.m., Rob Goldstone writes back: ‘‘They can’t do today as she hasn’t landed yet from Moscow, 4 p.m. is great tomorrow. ‘‘Best. ‘‘Rob.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. This email is from Donald Trump, Jr., sent Wednesday, June 8, 2016, at 12:03 p.m., to Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort. Subject, forward, Russia—Clinton—private and confidential. ‘‘Meeting got moved to 4 tomorrow at my offices. ‘‘Best. ‘‘Don.’’ Mr. TED LIEU of California. So that completes the email chain. Under Federal law, under the Federal Election Campaign Act, you cannot solicit or accept any contribution from a foreign national or foreign country. The law defines a contribution not as just a monetary donation but anything of value, an inkind donation, opposition research, anything of value violates the law. In this case, we absolutely have conspiracy to violate the Federal Election Campaign Act. I am a former prosecutor. I know it is very easy to prove a charge of conspiracy. You just have to have the person take one act in furtherance of the conspiracy. So in this case, when Donald Trump, Jr., replies back to the offer of this incriminating information, Hillary Clinton, and says, ‘‘I love it,’’ that is one act. He then proceeds to set up a meeting. That is another act. He then shows up at the meeting with Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort. That is a third act. That more than completes a crime conspiracy. We have in black and white right here a violation of Federal law. Mr. GALLEGO. The other thing that we have to consider is this: right now, there is a person who is in the White House who has lied on their security clearance—a security clearance that we use to determine whether we shall trust somebody with this top secret information for this country. Jared Kushner was in a meeting with a foreign agent. Now we know that he was in a meeting not just with a foreign agent but a former—‘‘former’’ Soviet counterintelligence officer. Let me tell you something. There is no such thing as former counterintelligence officers if you ever work with the Soviets. Once you are in the KGB, you are always in the KGB. Why was that person in that room? It was not to talk about adoption. He certainly wasn’t there to talk about anything else. But, if anything, he was there to pass information. The fact that Jared Kushner lied in his clearance, lied and omitted it until finally revealed today, really calls into question whether that man should be in the White House right now and trusted with this type of sensitive information. TED, you and I were in the military. We both had security clearances. If we had this type of omission in our security clearance, what would have been our punishments? Mr. TED LIEU of California. Our security clearances would have been suspended immediately. An investigation would have been opened. I am glad you mentioned Jared Kushner because many of us are wondering, why does he still have a security clearance? Why is he even in the White House? Let’s just sort of walk through a little bit of what happened with his security clearance. On the very first security clearance form, known as an SF–86 form, he lied on it. He did not disclose a single meeting with the Russians. If you read the form, it says: if you make a false statement or omit material facts, you can be imprisoned. He omitted all that information. He is then confronted, and what does he do? He revises it. So then he submits a second security clearance form. Now, it turns out he lied on that one, too, because he did not disclose this latest meeting that happened to be with a Russian counterintelligence officer. So then he had to submit a third form. When you look at his explanation, according to media reports, he said that his staff hit the send button too soon. Well, both Representative GALLEGO  and I know that that is not how you submit the security clearance form. It is a pretty involved, elaborate process. You have to do this certification. Not only do you have to send it electronically, then you have to sign the paper and submit that with your signature on it—very elaborate. So now he is lying about the process in which he lied on the three security clearance forms. We don’t know why he has a security clearance. We don’t know why he is even in the White House. Mr. GALLEGO. What is the motivation for omitting this meeting? There are clearly emails, there are clearly pointed emails, saying: Why are you going to be attending this meeting? There is a subject line that says, Clinton emails. There is a subject line that has to do with a Russian agent, a crown prosecutor. Now we know there is a former Soviet counterintelligence agent who just happens to be there, and Jared Kushner omits it from his security clearance. That is not an accident. That is a criminal act, a criminal act that any other citizen in this country, any other soldier, sailor, marine, airman, if we ever did that, we would be quickly prosecuted under the UCMJ. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Would the gentleman yield for a question? Mr. GALLEGO. No. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Would the other gentleman yield for a question? Mr. GALLEGO. I am controlling time. 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. So let me follow up what Representative GALLEGO said. We have a person in the White House now with a security clearance even though he has lied on at least two of those forms. So there actually needs to be an investigation. That security clearance needs to be suspended immediately. But, also, for any intelligence official watching this or reading about this, how can you trust Jared Kushner when he lied on these security clearance forms and makes a mockery of the process? Keep in mind this is the same person who suggested setting up a secret back channel with the Russians at the Russian Embassy. So the only reason you would want to use Russian equipment at the Russian Embassy is to hide information from U.S. intelligence. So even if his security clearance is not suspended, I really hope that people working for him do not trust him. Mr. GALLEGO. If you start seeing and putting it all together, we now know that there is a clear narrative of Jared Kushner’s involvements with the Russians. First, he tries to set up a back channel. Then he omits his conversations and meetings in a security clearance. He continues to lie even though he is continuously brought forth as being untruthful. Now we find ourselves in the situation where there is basically zero trust that this man in the White House with top secret clearance is not compromised. In conclusion, let me close with this. You just heard emails after emails. Imagine this conversation happening the opposite way. Imagine a conversation happening with a Democrat or the Clintons saying, I have information, and the word Moscow is said probably four or five times altogether. Imagine the idea that you are meeting in private, and then imagine all the followup lies that happened. What would be occurring right now? What would be occurring is what we saw last year: consistent oversight. But there is none. There is no oversight right now. PAUL RYAN has not taken the helm and has not done any type of oversight. The House Republicans have abdicated their responsibility and have allowed Donald Trump and all those other members of his family and the administration who have been compromised to continue being a threat to our national security in the White House. This should not be the way. Partisanship should never be above patriotism. But what we are seeing right now is naked partisanship being exposed and pushed as far as possible in the hopes of protecting a faulty President, his administration, and his family. That is not American. That is not what any of us ever signed up for. We swore—whether it was in the Armed Services Committee, whether it was when we were in the armed services, or whether it is when we came here to Congress—to uphold the Constitution of the United States and protect it. Right now we can honestly say that that is not occurring. There is an absolute abdication happening right now of leadership from House Republicans. TED, please close. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Let me conclude by saying that the President said that most people would have taken this meeting. That is just not true. Again, under the Federal Election Campaign Act, if you solicit, or conspire to solicit, or show up at a meeting where you expect to get opposition research from a foreign national, that is a violation of the Federal law. So, in fact, most people would not have taken this meeting unless they were crooked. We have an example here of what happened when the Al Gore campaign got information. They were sent anonymously briefing notes and things that then Bush was being briefed on and so on. They took that package, and they turned it over to the FBI. That is what should have happened in this case. In conclusion, this is a pretty big deal. We have people in the White House who believe they are above the law. The lesson in Watergate is that no one is above the law. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to direct all remarks to the Chair and to formally yield and reclaim time when under recognition. 
DOUBLE STANDARDS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ) for 30 minutes. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that my two colleagues refused to yield any time when they are talking, especially when they are using phrases like naked partisanship. That is very interesting, isn’t it? We could have had a nice dialog here. I was asking for a chance to go into a dialogue so the American people could understand what was being said rather than this incredible naked partisanship of people who disagree, but I won’t yield my time to have a dialogue about it. I am afraid that doesn’t cut it. This is yet another example of what we have seen of people using sinistersounding descriptions in order to basically distract us from some of the corruption and, I might add, questionable activities of their own Presidential candidate in the last election who was defeated because the American people did not trust that candidate. By the way, I would like to have asked—I am sorry that my friends have left and wouldn’t yield any time for a question—whether or not they believe that Hillary Clinton’s activities in Russia while she was a government official, was she involved in money raising from Russian oligarchs to the tune of millions—tens of millions—of dollars? Was her husband involved in raising this money while she was Secretary of State or while she was a candidate for President of the United States over in Russia, millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation? I understand even hundreds of thousands of dollars were put in her husband’s pocket for a speech that he gave in Russia. b1315 These things need to be looked at. Instead, what we are hearing about is sinistersounding words about a meeting where someone said they had some information that would help, yes, the campaign, but the reason it would help the campaign is there was supposedly information that showed that Hillary Clinton was involved in some activity that was contrary to the interests of the United States or contrary to the law. Yes, if someone says to you that they want to give you information, there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, I would hope that my colleagues who just said what is happening on our side of the aisle is naked partisanship, I wonder if the Democratic Party and my other colleagues in this body are calling for Hillary to release all of her emails and to make sure that we have under oath an explanation of these transactions to the Clinton Foundation. Instead, we are hearing all sorts of sinister descriptions of a meeting that was going to give information. I will tell you right now, everybody in this body, if they think that there could be information that is important for our country to know from any foreigner, we should talk to them and find out what it is. It is not illegal to receive information from someone, especially if you are engaged in an activity that is aimed at trying to secure understanding for policies that you plan to implement as a leader in the United States as an elected leader. There absolutely is nothing wrong. By the way, I am the chairman of the Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats Subcommittee. Russia is in my jurisdiction. Should I ever turn down a chance to talk to somebody who has information for me, negative or positive, about Russia? No, I shouldn’t. And neither should the Trump campaign have ignored any community to receive more information about what was being done by Hillary, perhaps, and the raising of the millions of dollars for the foundation. So that was a legitimate thing to ask. Then you determine: Is the information accurate or is it not accurate? If it is not accurate, you don’t want to touch it. But many people were disturbed that there had been a release of emails during the campaign, and a lot of the questions about this whole Russia issue is whether Russia or somebody else actually hacked into the system and released those emails. 
I think what is important is only whether truth was revealed. If someone was talking about releasing negative and false information, the public should be upset about that. But they should not be upset if they are being given a chance to see more information that is accurate information on this issue. I would hope and trust that the American people are smart enough to see a diversionary tactic using sinister words over and over again to describe something that is perfectly legal. In some cases, as I say, talking to anybody to get more information to help you make your decisions is a good thing and not a bad thing. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much my very good friend from California, with whom I have traveled abroad and had some amazing meetings with representatives of countries around the world. As I listened to our friends on the other side talk about this issue, it appears very clear what they are saying is that every Member of the House who has ever met with someone from a foreign country and asked questions, whether they believe what they were given or not, is guilty of a crime and should be damned to hell for all eternity. Basically, is that my friend’s impression? Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that that is what is being said: because those people are so sinister, you don’t listen to them; or, the whole act is sinister, it may be legal. In reality, we are talking about one person meeting with another who may have information. We in Congress and anyone running for public office should be listening and seeing if there is information that is imparted that is important for our country to know. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the fact that the gentleman from California and I have met with the thenleader of Iraq. Neither the gentleman from California nor I cared for the man. He was the Prime Minister of Iraq. He did a great deal of damage to Iraq. He, along with President Obama, dramatically weakened Iraq. I know my friend recalls our conversation with Prime Minister Maliki. We were asking for answers to questions that we considered very serious. For example, I was asking about his commitment to protect the refugees from Iran that he had pledged to protect. My friend from California was asking about the Iraqi pledge to help pay us back for some of our costs in making Iraq free. Those two issues so infuriated Prime Minister Maliki that we got word later when we were on the C–130 that we were being banned from Iraq by the Prime Minister. But to hear our friends across the aisle talk, every time one of them and every time one of us on this side of the aisle have asked even people we consider to be despicable and have done terrible things and we wanted answers, we were committing a crime in demanding those answers. I also know my friend from California got similar treatment from a man we believed was corrupt as the leader of Afghanistan at the time. I don’t find any crime or any harm in asking questions and getting answers, even from people for whom we have no respect. So I think it is a good thing. If anybody has got information, even if you don’t care for them, try to get the answers to those questions. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, well, we know now people are trying to frighten us and others not to meet with people and not to talk to people. I wonder why. As far as I am concerned, I don’t have just a blind trust in whatever our intelligence agencies give us. Let me note that many of the things that are being quoted aren’t even being quoted from our intelligence agencies during this whole national discussion on what Russia’s interaction with us has been for the last couple of years. The fact is that these intelligence reports are filled with weasel words. A weasel word is making it sound like you are saying something, but you put a phrase in that actually doesn’t commit you to defending that particular position as being factual. With that said, I would hope that the American people pay close attention to the sinister words, but also the weasel words, and pay attention to the basic nonsense in telling us that: Oh, a horrible crime has been committed now, because someone in the Trump campaign—whoever it was; I don’t care if it was Donald Trump’s relatives or his son or whoever it was, anybody in the campaign whatsoever—wants to talk to anybody in the world to get information, I think that is a good thing. Whether or not at that point it has to be determined whether it is accurate information, to move forward with accurate information is wrong, but your job, too, is to verify what somebody is telling you before you let it influence your policymaking or the decisions that you are making at that moment. With that said, I would like to change the subject at this point, because I had another issue that I really would like to talk about today. 
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I am the chairman, as I mentioned, of the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats. I am a senior member also of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. I am here, basically, to discuss emerging technology that is unleashing a new economic dynamic, but it could also be negatively impacting on our national security. I have long considered myself a proponent of freedom. Instead of government controls, I have trusted free people and free markets with optimism that technology and innovation would deal with the perplexing challenges to our security and our prosperity. In recent years, one of the more exciting innovations helping reshape the way we live is the introduction of digital currency here and globally. Thanks to this leap in technology, times are changing right before our eyes. Americans have new ways of fighting inflation and handling their personal business obligations. People with bitcoins living under despotic regimes throughout the world now have the opportunity to protect their assets from abusive and corrupt government. Indeed, the security of the blockchain technology will enable a new wave of societal advances that should invigorate our markets and improve lives. However, with all that potential benefit of digital currency, there is also danger. It empowers the good people of the world, but it also can be used by those who have goals that are malevolent and evil. Radical Islamic terrorism is now a horrendous threat that hangs over all the free people in the world, in the United States, and elsewhere. Law enforcement throughout the world is now aware that bitcoin is available for use for terrorists in accomplishing their gruesome missions. What makes it a good deal for terrorists? It is anonymous. They can transfer funds using a digital currency platform without any of the usual safeguards that thwart terrorists and criminal activity. Antimoney laundering and know yourcustomer standards have worked to deal with criminals in recent decades, but now that approach can be technologically undermined by the use of the bitcoin instead of traditional currency. Since digital currencies such as the bitcoin offer a free ability to transfer funds, some of our neighbors, such as Sweden, Thailand, Vietnam, and India, have banned their use. Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that that is a necessary or practical response. Banning digital currencies will not prevent terrorists from using them any more than banning guns will prevent criminals from using them. Instead of banning all the digital currencies because some lack standards, I believe we should encourage digital currencies to implement full anti money laundering and knowyourcustomer standards. These protections should empower both our law enforcement and national security professionals to keep terrorist and criminal financing under control while preserving for the rest of us the freedom to use digital currencies. Thus, with the proper type of regulatory look and seeing what options are available to us, we can prevent terrorists and criminals under control from financing their operations with bitcoins, but the rest of us will still be free to use these new digital currencies and enable America to keep the lead in 
the world in this enthusiastic technological advance. In light of my chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats, and my experience in the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I look forward to joining with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to encourage economic innovation brought by the bitcoins, but also to see to it that digital currencies will have strong standards that will thwart the exploration of this new economic function by terrorists and criminals and other evil forces in the world. b1330 So I look forward to working with my colleagues. I think this is a bipartisan issue. I won’t try to make it sound sinister at all, because this is something we can work on, and we must keep America always in the forefront of technological development. We know with each step forward in technology, there is a potential harm that can be done, but we need to make sure that is taken into consideration, while at the same time that we do not thwart Americans from using the ultimate technologies of the day to secure prosperity and secure freedom and to secure our national security with these new technologies. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TAYLOR ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much my friend from California, DANA ROHRABACHER , making the point that he did. There is nothing either sinister, wrong, criminal, improper when someone is engaged in an election or when someone is not engaged in an election, if offered information that may be helpful, whatever the source. Unless it is a known criminal that is going to advise someone about some potential crime, there is normally nothing wrong with seeking or even getting that information. I doubt there is anybody on this House floor, when offered information from a source about an opponent in a campaign, didn’t at least take some action to see if there was anything legitimate to it. So it is just amazing, when we know that there is certainly probable cause to believe crimes have been committed during the Obama administration, yet we got nothing in the way of support in investigating the probable cause of real legitimate crimes; not those for which there is no known criminal statute that would be applicable or that may have been violated, but simply, you know, there may be times when it is bad taste. But the villainization of Donald Trump, Jr., for inquiring of someone that Loretta Lynch, as Attorney General for President Obama, specifically and personally stepped in to ensure could be in this country, it is just incredible how much is being made of Donald Trump, Jr., meeting with somebody that Attorney General Lynch pulled all kinds of strings to get her in and keep her in the country. And then when you see that picture of this same person sitting right behind the Obama Ambassador to Russia, Ambassador McFaul, and you know at these hearings, especially an appointed and confirmed official like an ambassador, they don’t want somebody directly behind them who is not supportive and not capable of reaching up and handing them a note with information that may be helpful and them answering a question. We have had countless hearings, and I have seen it done countless times. You want somebody behind you that can help provide answers to questions that you may not can answer without their help. So there she is, this person that these same friends who pulled all kinds of strings to get her in this country. They are all upset that she ever talked to Donald Trump, Jr., and he has—I admire the fact that he immediately saw that this was a worthless meeting and walked away from it. So pretty amazing. It was good judgment to walk away from it, once he found out what she was about. I wish that President Obama, Loretta Lynch, and Hillary Clinton had as good a judgment in their meetings with people instead of telling our enemy—and I do consider the man with whom President Obama was meeting an enemy. He was not a friend of the United States. And what does President Obama do when he doesn’t think the microphone can pick him up? He says: Tell Vladimir Putin—President Obama’s close buddy—tell Vladimir, my buddy, that I have a lot more flexibility once I am past this election. ‘‘Okay. Yeah. I will pass that on. Dah, dah, I will pass that on.’’ Clear intent; there is no mistaking. The intent is: I will be able to give away more of America’s defenses the way I canceled our missile defense system in Poland once I am reelected because then I don’t care. I won’t be running. I can’t be defeated in another election. So I will be able to give away a lot more of America’s defenses. And what did our friends—who are now so upset about Donald Trump meeting with a Russian lawyer, finding out she was not worth meeting with and leaving—do back then? Nothing. They defended President Trump’s actions either vocally or by their silence while we were raising questions. I can’t end this week without expressing my grave disappointment with Congress over a specific detail of the National Defense Authorization Act. There are a number of things in there that bother me that I think are big mistakes and that I don’t think we should be doing. I think we are wasting money, but compromises have to be made. We are making a form of sausage called ‘‘laws,’’ so we have got to compromise on some things. But there are some things that are so important that there cannot be a compromise. It is too important. It will result in lives being saved or lives being lost, depending on what we do here in Congress. So our friend, Congresswoman VICKY HARTZLER , realized before I did that the law, as would be in the National Defense Authorization Act, with all the compromises that had to be made under the great leadership—and I am not being sarcastic—of Congressman MACTHORNBERRY —did a masterful job handling all the problems that arose— but the law of the NDAA was and will be, under this new law, such that President Obama and his administration would say, the way it is worded, the way it is, authorizes us to decide that an appropriate use of this very limited more and more precious money for our military to defend us can and should be used whenever someone requests a sex change operation. The reports are that, with the hormonal treatment, it can be around $130,000 or so per person. Military commanders advise that they have been told: If you have a military member under your command that asks for a sex change operation and you say something like ‘‘have you really thought this through?’’ or they say something like ‘‘why don’t you talk to a counselor?’’ or ‘‘let’s talk about this’’ or ‘‘you give it some more thought,’’ those are careerending statements that that commander would have made; that if someone requests a sex change operation, you don’t ask questions, you don’t refer them to counseling, you don’t suggest that they give it more thought. You just sign them up. Now, the problem there, too, is that apparently they are advised that they have about 2 years minimum that this servicemember will be out of commission, cannot be deployed, you can’t be sending them anywhere because you have months of hormonal treatment leading up to the sex change surgery. And then even if there are no complications, the followup and the rehab is quite significant. So you better count on at least a couple of years minimum where that servicemember, that military member cannot be sent anywhere, cannot be ordered deployed. They are useless in defense of our country as far as filling the immediate needs of the military, and that is astounding. Now, potentially, some might submit that we have come to find out about maybe the greatest political lobbying by any group of our medical practitioners. And those who compile the diagnostic statistic manual, referred to as DSM—we have had I, II, III, IV, V— each time, they have been subjected to political lobbying because they didn’t 
want people who were thinking about a sex change operation—and even though their chromosomes would not change— still indicating they are male or female, they wanted to have surgery to change. That was considered to be a very serious illness, psychiatric illness. But with a lot of lobbying, it eventually got downgraded, and the most recent downgrading in the DSM is to something called a ‘‘dysphoria.’’ It went from ‘‘disorder’’ to ‘‘dysphoria.’’ But dysphoria, if you look it up, it still is—well, one psychiatrist just said it means confusion, basically. If you have got transgender dysphoria, you are confused. It is the opposite of euphoria. You are not well, you are not happy, you have got behavioral problems because you are not happy with your gender. Well, for most of our country’s history, we understood that, in our military, it is not to be a societal experiment. We want people who can fight, hopefully not to their death, but to the enemy’s death to stop those who would kill us or take our freedom. And it is heartbreaking that—when the amendment came to the floor last night for a vote to prevent any of that precious money that is going to save the lives of our military members, the amendment lost by five votes, 214–209. In other words, if three people had changed their vote, that amendment passes, and no money could be used out of that precious money they need for bulletproof vests, they need for uparmored vehicles to save their lives when an IED hits them, all of these things that are so important to our military. b1345 We are told to account for $3.5 to $3.9 billion over 10 years they are projecting to be spent, but that, of course, means that is before word gets out that if you want a sex change operation, if you can get through basic training—I am not sure about that, you may not have to get through basic—but if you can join the military and demand a sex change operation, then you are not deployable. They can’t send you to combat for at least 2 years. We will pay you as a military member. We will provide you, free, the hormonal treatments. We will take that money that could save another member’s life and we will spend that on this expensive surgery to change your organs, maybe cut them off or add some, and then we will spend more of that money that could save other military members’ lives and spend it on your followup and your rehab, all while you can’t help them because you are going through this transition. This is a difficult time, and it breaks my heart. And it is not a civilization ending thing that happened last night, but when the book one day is written about the rise and fall of what so far has been the most free and greatest nation in the history of mankind, this would be something listed as a symptom of why this country lost the next great war, because they were more concerned about playing societal experiments than they were with defending their lives and their freedom. I see my friend, as good a friend as I have here in Washington. I yield to my friend, STEVE KING. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. And I have no better friend in this city either—or this country, for that matter. Mr. Speaker, I am just called to come to this floor to add a few words to the topic that the gentleman from Texas has courageously brought forward and so few others would want to even speak to: the societal experiment that is going on in our military, the greatest military in the history of the world. When the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) talks about how history will be written one day, this isn’t a civilization killer, but it is an indication of a civilization killer. I think of the circumstances in a little bit older history, back in the 16th century and the 17th century when the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim armies were sweeping across the countryside, and whoever they captured, they pressed into slavery. And when they pressed them into slavery, they wanted to have their crack troops—they were called Janissaries, and there were other troops too, as well. But what they did in order to keep them from reproducing was that they did reassignment surgery on those slaves that they captured, that they had put into their Janissary troops, and that reassignment surgery was they took them from being a virile, reproductive male into being a eunuch. Now, they were suitable to work in the harem, but they found out when they put them out in the field to do battle against the enemy that they didn’t have the testosterone to take on the fight. And so over a period of time, a generation or two, they finally realized: I guess we are going to have to stop turning these men into eunuchs if we are going to have them as a fighting machine. That is the Janissaries. And the old history through that is replete with narrative after narrative of them taking out the knife and actually cutting the flesh off of these anatomically complete men. Some would die from that and some would live, but none of them had the will to fight. And so they decided that they were going to keep anatomically complete men, men that were producing testosterone, in their crack Janissary troops, where they fought well. That is a lesson of the military, the Ottoman military from 200, 300, 400 years ago. And today we are here thinking somehow we are going to make the military better by letting people line up at the recruitment center who have planned that they want to do sexual reassignment surgery, know that it is expensive, and believe: I can just get into any branch of the United States services—the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, maybe become a Navy SEAL—and then submit to sexual reassignment surgery and go from a man to a woman. By the way, it doesn’t look like there are going to be any women becoming men after they go through SEAL training. I don’t think that is going to happen, at least currently. But there is no way that this enhances the capabilities of our military. There is no way it enhances the morale of our military, and you will never see a platoon that is made up by all of the folks that are likely to line up to sign up into our military. This policy clearly enacted, clearly advertised, is a neon sign for people who want to have sexual reassignment surgery. They will line up at their recruiter’s office and they will go into the military, and the military will be saying: You know, we had to turn this person away because they were too heavy, and this one had flat feet, and this one had a bad eye, and this one had a congenital defect of one kind or another, but if they don’t have those and they want sexual reassignment surgery, we will cut them up and remake them into something different, to the tune of $3.5 or $3.9 billion over a 10year period of time, and put them off in the recovery room for 2 years before we can put them to work and use them. And, by the way, they are likely then to be discharged to come back into society if their only purpose was to get the free surgery. And can you imagine someone who has now gone into Walter Reed Hospital, taken up a bed in Walter Reed Hospital, maybe a roommate with someone who was hit by an IED, someone who lost a couple of legs, amputated in the dangerous, dangerous service of the freedoms of our country, can you imagine those two beds, side by side, and one of them missing a couple of legs, or an arm, or an arm and a leg, or two arms, and the other one saying, ‘‘Well, I just came in for sexual reassignment surgery’’? I won’t say the next thing that is in my mind. I think the public understands the image of what this is. This is one of the most appallingly stupid things I have ever seen the United States Congress do, and it has got some competition, but I don’t even know what is second, it is so bad. And the longterm thinking of this, the implications of this are awful, Mr. Speaker. We need to reverse this somehow. I would add, also, that Bob Gates, the former Secretary of Defense, testified before the United States Congress that we had an obesity problem with our young people in America that is a national security risk, it is a national security concern, and we ought to be adopting Michelle Obama’s Healthy, HungerFree Kids Act that cut the calories down on these kids, because we didn’t have enough of them that were available to meet the physical standards to get into the military, and it 
was a national security risk. Those were his exact words, ‘‘a national security risk.’’ Well, if we can put the kids on a diet in school because it is a national security risk for getting people to meet the weight standards of our military, isn’t this a national security risk when you have all of these resources that are redirected from F–35s and pension plans and a raise for our military and housing on our bases, and the list goes on and on, redirect those resources to sexual reassignment surgery and then have them mustered out of the service as soon as they get what they went into the service for in the first place? This is idiocy on the part of the United States Congress. I salute the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ) for introducing this amendment. I had a similar amendment that was turned down in the Rules Committee. But this is something this Congress made a significant error on. Twentyfour Republicans and every single Democrat voted against this. I thank the gentleman from Texas for bringing up the topic, and I would be happy to yield back to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his comments. In fact, some people sometimes think that we exaggerate, but my very good friend from Iowa and I have stood there on the mountaintop outside of Vienna where Western civilization stood there in the gap, and it was all at risk. The odds were that Western civilization was going to end with the fall of Vienna. If the radical Islamic group that had taken so much of the territory already, if Vienna fell, then the rest of Europe would fall. There would be no stopping this radical Islamic movement through Europe, and there is a good chance we are not even here in this fashion today. I thought about that and my friend and I standing up there getting a briefing from an individual that knew the history so well, that this is where one group was, this is where the siege was, that is where the Polish group brought cannons, and no one in the Islamic group thought it was possible to get cannons up there. I thought about that and reflected on that as President Trump was speaking in Warsaw, Poland, and it was clear how desirous the Polish people have always been for freedom: Yes, you can practice what religion you want to, but don’t come try to take over our country and tell us we can’t pursue Christianity. I did not realize until President Trump gave that speech that there in Warsaw, when Pope John Paul II, came, that they were screaming ‘‘We want God’’ as a group—amazing. So as I recall, though, it was a Polish prince or king that came down, King Jan Sobieski who came to the aid of the Viennese people. They were under siege. They were going to be defeated. It meant the fall of Western civilization; perhaps we headed into a new Dark Ages. And this Polish king comes down, determined, gets cannon up on this mountaintop that no one who was in the 2 years of seeking a sex change operation and sex reassignment, as they call it, could possibly help do during that 2year period. They got cannons up the mountain in position to help stop the obliteration there of the Westerncivilized Vienna, to stop the fall of that radical Islamic empire from taking over and destroying Western civilization, making slaves of all of those whom they overtook. And some, of course, in their party believed that if an individual refused to become a Muslim, they should be killed. Others believed in the more humane treatment that, no, you make them slaves, and as long as they keep paying their tax, which is really an admittance that there is no God greater than the Islamic God, as long as they are willing to subjugate themselves and worship at the altar by paying that fee to show that they were subservient to the Islamic God, then they could be allowed to live. Those were two problems back in that day: Do we let the people live if they won’t become Muslim, or do we just go ahead and kill them? And many humane thinkers thought: Well, no. As long as they will submit to our god, pay the tax to show they are submitting to our god; and Christianity’s God, they have got to forget talking about that or they do need to be killed. Just pay the tax and they can go about still living. If Vienna doesn’t stand, if it falls, as was anticipated, we are done. And I can assure my friends here in the House that there was no one who was out there defeating the radical Islamic desire to wipe out Western civilization who had undergone a sex change operation in the prior 2 years. This is a risky time in our history. As others have pointed out, no matter what societal experimentations people want to undertake, what type of lifestyles people want to undertake, the military is intended to protect our freedom so that we can pursue these things. And I know President Obama was fond of saying: Gee, Guantanamo is a greater recruiting tool. But as I have talked to Muslim friends—yes, I do have them around the world. As I have talked to Muslim friends in other parts of the world, whether Afghanistan, Egypt, other parts of the Middle East, North Africa, they say: You have got to understand, some of the things you do in the United States make for incredible recruiting posters for radicals in our Muslim faith. When it is advertised that the United States Congress is in favor of taking men and surgically making them into women with the money that they would use to protect the Nation otherwise, or taking women and doing surgery to make them men, the United States Congress would rather spend that money on that surgery than defeating radical Islam, then it is an advertising, just a bonanza for the radical Islamists. My Muslim friends tell me, they then agree, the recruits: You are right. If that is how stupid they are, their society has no right to remain on the Earth. We need to take them out. They are too stupid. A disappointing night last night and a disappointing week. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBINSON FANS, INC. AND ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Robinson Fans, Inc. and its celebration of 125 years as a solely owned family business. Small businesses like Robinson Fans, Inc. are important to both the economy and the community of Pennsylvania’s third district. This year, the occasion of its 125th Anniversary, is an appropriate time to celebrate the hard work and outstanding achievements of this small business. Robinson Fans, Inc., founded in Monongahela, Pennsylvania in 1892, has been operating in the town of Zelienople, Pennsylvania for over a century. This business has helped power locomotives, allowed commodity giants to dig the world’s deepest mines, and employed numerous members of the community throughout the years. It has enhanced both the community and the economy, providing jobs and economic opportunity for generations of Pennsylvanians. Robinson Fans has been victorious through some of America’s worst hardships, including the Great Depression and several recessions, an economic feat of enormous scale. It has survived and thrived through multiple generations with new management and operation tactics that kept the business successful. Robinson Fans is now on its sixth generation. This is a remarkable accomplishment, considering most companies do not last beyond 20 years and only 3 percent of familyowned businesses make it to the fourth generation, according to the Family Business Institute. As a supporter of small businesses like Robinson Fans, I am proud of its efforts and achievements in both the community and the economy. I am sure all my colleagues join me in applauding the valiant efforts of this business and other small businesses that continue to offer economic opportunity to our constituents and make our country a better place. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes: 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise to speak on House consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH and the Armed Services Committee for their work on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and Judiciary, I take our role in Congress as stewards of our nation’s security seriously. I offer my thanks and appreciation to the men and women of the armed services who place themselves in harm’s way each day for the safety and security of our nation’s people. The National Defense Authorization Act’s purpose is to address the threats our nation faces not just today, but into the future. This makes our work vital to our national interest and it should reflect our strong commitment to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Services receive the benefits and support that they deserve for their faithful service. This bill encompasses a number of initiatives designed to confront the military challenges posed by violent extremism, terrorists engaging in ground wars, making more efficient the work of protecting America, addresses defense of our nation’s computing networks and infrastructure, the medical health needs of men and women in the armed services, and extends economic and education opportunity to small minority and women owned businesses. We live in a dangerous world, where threats are not always easily identified, and our enemies are not bound by borders. Russia’s aggression towards the United States has long been understood, but in 2016 the stakes were raised in terms of how far they would go to harm our nation and Democratic institutions when they interfered in our national election. Since September 11, 2001, we have kept a steadfast commitment to ending the threat of global terror. Boko Haram, ISIL, and AI Shabaab remind us of how fragile our nation’s security could be without a well trained and equipped military. The introduction of cyber offensive actions against the United States and our interest has altered the definition of war and with it our understanding about what is needed to combat a unique type of enemy that fights under no flag, for any nation, and can cause harm to computing networks. I appreciate the House Armed Services Committee’s continued support of our national defense and support a number of provisions in H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, such as authorities that support ongoing operations. The amendments offered to this bill offered opportunities to address these and other Administration concerns that will improve the bill. Let me discuss briefly the amendments I offered that were adopted by the House and included in the final version of the bill. 1. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 56 calls for increased collaboration with NIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer and provides $10 million in appropriations. 2. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 76 dIrects the Department of Defense to prepare contingency plans to assist relief organizations in delivering humanitarian aid in South Sudan and to deescalate conflict. 3. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 83 directs the Secretary of Defense to prepare against deployment of North Korean nuclear ICBMs to prevent damage or destruction of satellites critical to U.S. national defense and global communications. These Jackson Lee Amendments are straightforward, and make improvements to the bill. There were 14 additional Jackson Lee Amendments that were not included in the Rule for consideration of the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. The Jackson Lee Amendments to H.R. 2810 are in four categories: 1. National Security Amendments that protect and promote national security, national defense and U.S. foreign policy interests; 2. Counterespionage and Deterrence Amendments that uphold the interests of American citizens at home and abroad. 3. Healthcare, technology and knowhow, and Opportunities for Women Amendments that promote advances in PTSD and Triple Negative Breast Cancer Research and Professional Development and Business opportunities for women. 4. Cybersecurity Amendments that support the work of the DOD to ensure defense of our nation against cyberattacks. I have submitted six amendments that protect and promote national security, national defense or U.S. foreign policy interests: 1. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 175 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide technical assistance by U.S. military women to military women abroad combating terrorism, human and narcotics trafficking and their impact on women and girls. 2. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 166 condemns the actions of Boko Haram and directs the Secretary of Defense to provide technical assistance to Nigeria in establishing a central missing persons’ database and a Victims Relief Fund. 3. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 187 expresses Sense of Congress that the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program is an important U.S. foreign policy and national defense instrument of value and asks Secretary of Defense to make maximum use of it. 4. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 184 directs Secretary of State to inform Congress of the feasibility of providing training, equipment and logistics to improve air traffic control systems in African countries where U.S. military operations require it. 5. The Jackson Lee Amendments No. 76 and No. 83 that were accepted by the Rules Committee and are under consideration by the House addressed the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, and North Korea’s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Program. These six Jackson Lee amendments would have enhanced the effectiveness of the NDAA 
by protecting and promoting U.S. foreign policy and national security interests. I have submitted three amendments to defend against espionage and provide deterrence against threats to the United States: 1. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 177 authorized the Secretary of Defense to work with local partners in providing security at civilian nuclear research centers to assure nuclear weapons do not fall into the possession of terrorists or rogue nations. 2. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 181 required the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the programs employed to ensure Department of Defense National Security Education Program students studying abroad are trained to recognize, resist, and report against foreign governmental recruitment efforts. 3. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 179 directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct and report to Congress the results of a study on whether requirement to notify Voting Action Officer within 10 days of registration in service member duty reassignment state imposes significant burden on military voters. Two of these amendments sought to address known threats to our national interest and one would have assured that changes in voter registration rules for persons serving in the military would not impose an undue burden to their right to vote at a polling location instead of by absentee ballot. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 177 (Secure Nuclear Material in developing nations) There is a wide array of peaceful uses for nuclear material such as nuclear power plant power generation; radiation treatment for cancer and other medical conditions; as well as research at academic and research institutions. China and India are both pursuing nuclear power as an option to dependence on fossil fuels, while oilrich Gulf nations are considering nuclear power with the hope of exporting more oil. There are 65 reactors being built around the world, and 69 percent of them are in Brazil, Russia, India and China. India has no fossil fuel resources and is expanding its use of nuclear power to address shortfalls in electric generation capacity that is out stripped by economic growth. India goal is to have nuclear power be the source for 50 percent of its electricity needs by 2050. I have submitted six amendments to protect women and health: 4. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 224 provides $2.5 million increase in funding to combat PostTraumatic Stress Disorder. 5. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 180 enforces the title and section ‘‘Minority and Business Ownership’’ to include HUZ and disadvantaged businesses. 6. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 226 directs the Secretary of the Navy to report to Congress on the ability to apply desalination technologies for drought relief for both military and civilian purposes. 7. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 431 directs that the Office of Women’s Business Ownership shall include a focus on outreach and engagement of minority women owned businesses. All six of these amendments enhance the NDAA. I have submitted two amendments to ensure greater cybersecurity capacity and resource allocation for the purpose of protecting America’s Cyber Defense interest: 1. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 182 directs the Secretary of Defense to develop plans for early detection, mitigation, and defense against statesponsored cyberattacks regarding elections and voter engagement efforts. 2. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 183 directs the Secretary of Defense to develop effective countermeasures to defend networks against attacks by cyber weapons. Both of these Jackson Lee amendments offered improvements to the NDAA’s protection of America’s cyber security. In addition to these Amendments, I am in support of the AUMF Amendment offered by Representatives WALTER JONES and J OHN CONYERS that was not made in order by the Rules Committee. Congress has an obligation to the American people to debate the issue of war. Our military is now in theaters of war without Congressional approval which is in contravention to the Constitution because it states that only Congress has the power to declare war. We must continue to direct our efforts as a body to ensure that our troops remain the best equipped and prepared military force in the world. They are not just soldiers they are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters—they are some of the people we represent as Members of Congress. Support for them is a sacred obligation of Congress, both to those who are at risk on battlefields and serving as the guard against threats around the world, but they are also those who have returned home from war. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, we rise today to pay tribute to the life and service of Mr. Mike McGarvin. Mike was the beloved founder of the Poverello House, a homeless shelter in Fresno which provides programs and support services to hundreds of people every day. For decades Mike touched the lives of countless disadvantaged people in the Fresno area using one simple message, ‘‘Listen with compassion; give with a warm heart and a smile.’’ Mike, or ‘‘Papa Mike,’’ as he was affectionately known by many, was born in San Francisco, California in 1944. After early struggles in life, he found solace in a coffee house in San Francisco called Poverello that served those in need. The coffee house was run by a priest, who later asked Mike to volunteer there, an opportunity that proved to be life changing. After seven years of volunteering at the San Francisco Poverello, Mike and his wife Mary moved back to her hometown of Fresno where he worked as a photographer for the local newspaper, The Fresno Bee. After observing Fresno’s homeless population, Mike was reminded of the kindness shown to him at Poverello in San Francisco, and he pledged to find a way to give back. Mike initiated his legacy by passing out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to the homeless and the hungry from the back of his car. Soon after, he purchased a small storefront and opened the Poverello House to help those in need in Fresno, naming his small outfit after the place in San Francisco that saved his life. Since its modest beginnings, the Poverello House has grown. It now provides three meals a day, 365 days a year to those in need as well as many other services, such as clothing distribution, emergency food bags, a medical clinic, the Men’s Resident Rehabilitation program, and temporary overnight shelter for men and women. The Poverello House is truly a source of salvation for countless individuals in our community. Mike has been recognized many times throughout his life for his invaluable work, including an honorary doctorate from California State University, Fresno and the Pope John XXIII Award from the Italian Catholic Federation in honor of his years of humanitarian service. Mike will be remembered by all for his boundless kindness and deep compassion. He leaves a legacy of service and selflessness, both through the Poverello House and in the hearts of the people whose lives he touched. He is survived by his wife of 46 years Mary, daughter Clare, and grandson Tyler. Mr. Speaker, we ask our colleagues to join us in honoring the life and achievements of Mike McGarvin, whose passion for service and kindness has forever changed the lives of those in need in our community. I join Mike’s family and the Poverello House in honoring his life. He will truly be missed. f 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Village of La Grange Park as it celebrates its 125th Anniversary. The Village was founded July 14, 1892, when 300 residents living in the southwest comer of Proviso Township came together to form what was then a unique suburb—a bedroom community with no business district or rail transportation. La Grange Park prides itself in being one of Illinois’ most lively and inclusive villages, in addition to being one of the most economically successful. Originally settled in the 1840s by Chicago residents who fled the rapid population growth of the city, La Grange Park quickly became a prominent lllinois farming town. From its quiet beginnings, La Grange Park has grown into one of the Chicago area’s most livable communities for its 13,579 residents. In recent years, the Village has seen an influx of new residents, as young families have been drawn to the award winning private and public schools that serve the community, including Nazareth Academy, Lyons Township High School and RiversideBrookfield High School. LaGrange Park also cherishes its senior citizens, providing three firstclass senior living facilities. Today, La Grange Park is still home to many residents of Irish, Italian, and German heritage, but the village has come a long way 
from its humble beginnings as a farm town. With its gorgeous homes, safe communities, good schools, and over 13,000 residents, it’s no wonder that La Grange Park was named one of ‘‘The Best Places to Live’’ by CHICAGO Magazine. The village is also home to many prosperous businesses and attractions that draw visitors from other various parts of the Midwest. La Grange Park’s contributions to the 5th District of Illinois and the state in general, cannot be understated, and I am truly honored to be a part of this historic recognition. Mr. Speaker, I ask you all to join me in celebrating the Village of La Grange Park during this momentous occasion, and may they enjoy many more years of continued success.

Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, July 13, 2017, I was absent from the House because I was unavoidably detained. Due to my absence, I did not record any votes on the Motion to Adjourn, first vote series, and second vote series. I would have voted ‘‘aye’’ on Roll Call 354, Roll Call 355, Roll Call 362, Roll Call 369, and Roll Call 371.

RECOGNIZING THE 52ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 52nd Anniversary of the Older Americans Act, a landmark bill signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on July 14, 1965. The Older Americans Act provides critical support services for tens of millions of senior citizens and their families. With 10,000 Americans turning 65 every day, our country has an obligation to keep these programs strong. Older Americans should be able to live a life of dignity and independence. However, that promise is under attack by the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans. Trumpcare will hurt older Americans by gutting Medicaid by $722 billion and allowing insurers to charge older Americans more money for less coverage, no matter their health status. Not to be outdone, Trump’s very first budget would eliminate programs like Meals on Wheels and senior employment services, forcing countless older Americans into a life of hunger and poverty. We cannot break our promise to our seniors. Democrats will continue to fight to protect the Older Americans Act and ensure every American can live their full life with dignity. 
Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize four constituents who received prestigious Fulbright awards during the 2016–2017 academic year. They are, Ms. Tyra Beaman of Glen Allen, Virginia, Ms. Ellen Korcovelos of Henrico, Virginia, Mr. Colfax Phillips of Richmond, Virginia, and Ms. Eileen Wang of Glen Allen, Virginia. These scholars will be joining alumni of the Fulbright program who have and will continue to be extraordinarily successful in their lives. Fulbright scholars go on to excel in nearly every seclor of our economy, as well as serving in the highest levels of government and Congress. According to the United States Department of State, more than 370,000 individuals from the United States and over 180 countries have participated in the Fulbright program since 1946. The Fulbright Student Program boasts that ‘‘The Fulbright U.S. Student Program is the largest U.S. exchange program offering opportunities for students and young professionals to undertake international graduate study, advanced research, university teaching, and primary and secondary school teaching worldwide.’’ This program is a terrific way for students to gain worldwide perspectives and learn valuable lessons from other countries. They are also taking with them the values that made America what it is today. They will build lifelong relationships and be ambassadors for America for years to come. Congratulations. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIREMENT OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL LARRY WYCHE 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to Lieutenant General Larry Wyche, Deputy Commanding General, United States Army Materiel Command, and Senior Commander of Redstone Arsenal in my home state of Alabama, on the occasion of his retirement following more than 42 years of exemplary service to the United States Army. Lieutenant General Wyche began his career as an enlisted soldier rising to the rank of Sergeant and he will retire with three stars. Those stars were not easy to come by. They were hard earned. Lieutenant General Wyche has been critical in transforming the manner in which Sustainment is provided to our Nation’s Warfighters and he has been a champion for the health and welfare of the Organic Industrial Base—our arsenals, manufacturing depots, and ammunition plants. Lieutenant General Wyche has shaped and led the daytoday operations oflhe U.S. Army Materiel Command, a $58 billion logistics enterprise, staffed by more than 120,000 Soldiers, Civilians, and Contractors for more than two years. The command has a presence in all 50 U.S. states and 155 countries. As Senior Commander of Redstone Arsenal in my district, Lieutenant General Wyche was in charge of the security and wellbeing of the more than 70 tenants, Soldiers, Army Civilians, and Families. Under his watch, the quality of life for residents and employees alike greatly improved. Lieutenant General Wyche’s many stellar achievements are too many to recite, but they have had far reaching effects at home and abroad. As a major, he deployed with the XVIII Airborne Corps to Haiti and did his part to restore democracy to that country during Operation Uphold Democracy. His bravery and courage were also tested in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. Lieutenant General Wyche began his career earning stripes and retires having earned every one of his three stars. We thank him for his leadership. On behalf of all those touched by his service, we wish Lieutenant General Wyche and his wife, Denise, and their family, good luck, good ground, and Godspeed. Army Strong. 
IN HONOR OF THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF EASTERSEALS SOUTHERN GEORGIA 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I consider it my great honor and pleasure to extend my sincerest congratulations to the Easterseals Southern Georgia program as it celebrates 60 years of serving individuals living with disabilities and their families. The Easterseals Southern Georgia will celebrate this significant milestone with a celebration on July 15, 2017 at the Doublegate Country Club in Albany, GA. Easterseals Southern Georgia was brought to life by Mr. and Mrs. Carl Huie after they spent nearly eight years traveling back and forth from Atlanta with their daughter Carlton whose health was ailing. After struggling to find a facility that accommodated her daughter’s needs, Mrs. Huie vowed to start a rehabilitation center in Albany to serve the disabled people of Southwest Georgia. After nearly two years of letter writing and talking with every women’s group in Albany, Mrs. Huie convinced the Junior League of Albany to take on the sponsorship and they began working toward establishing what would become the Easter Seal Guild. In 1954, the Devane Home in Albany was rented, and later purchased for use. The center officially opened on November 25, 1957 and on November 21, 1961, the Easter Seal Guild was formed, boasting 25 charter members. However, in 1990, the Easter Seal Guild dissolved and Easterseals Southern Georgia became a direct affiliate of the National Easterseals Organization. Through the changes, the program continued to grow into a multifaceted organization, becoming even more responsive to the needs of the region it set out to serve. The programs for adults and children created by Easterseals Southern Georgia over the years have helped families of individuals who are amputees and those who suffer from traumatic physical and emotional injuries, developmental or intellectual disabilities, and mental illnesses by providing programs that are customized to their needs. The Easterseals Southern Georgia continues to provide these and new services to help ensure that each group’s needs are met. Beyond working to provide opportunities to adults with disabilities, Easterseals Southern Georgia opened ‘‘Megan’s House’’ to serve families of children with disabilities. The house was so successful that the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities provided funds for a second home in Waycross, Georgia, and the U.S. Congress provided federal funds in 2009 for a third home in Valdosta, Georgia. Since its inception in 1957, Easterseals Southern Georgia has served over 70,000 citizens in need and has aimed to ensure that those with developmental disabilities have valued roles in the community by administering training and other services that support individual choices and opportunities. Easterseals has expanded its area of outreach to underprivileged adults and children in Northern Florida and East Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and the more than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Congressional District in expressing our profound gratitude to Easterseals Southern Georgia for providing citizens with disabilities the longlasting skills needed to be outstanding members of their communities. 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to commemorate the life of my constituent Mr. Joseph ‘‘Joey’’ Noufal from Leesburg, Virginia, who passed away on May 31, 2017, at the age of 48. Throughout his life, Mr. Noufal was an esteemed entrepreneur in our community and a devoted husband, father, and friend. Revered for his sincerity and beloved for his contagious smile, generosity, and compassion, Mr. Noufal embodied an innovative and zealous character. His legacy endures and he will always be remembered and missed by many. Originally from Beirut, Lebanon, Mr. Noufal immigrated to Northern Virginia during his childhood. From a young age, he developed the essential entrepreneurial qualities of reliability, creativity, and determination by working in his family’s salon. Later on, he earned his Associate’s Degree in Graphic Design. As an awardwinning hair stylist, he successfully ran Noufal Hair Color Studio for more than a quartercentury. Throughout his career, Mr. Noufal garnered numerous international certifications and made house calls to royal families and foreign dignitaries. Additionally, Mr. Noufal operated various business ventures involving franchising, coffee distribution, and corporate cleaning. Recently, Mr. Noufal and his wife, Vicky, celebrated their 23rd wedding anniversary. Together, they have three sons, Alexander, Brandon, and Mason. Mr. Noufal often remarked that his greatest accomplishment in life was being father to his sons and a partner to his wife. He is also survived by his mother, six brothers, and two sisters. Mr. Noufal leaves behind a remarkable legacy and an extensive entrepreneurial career to the Commonwealth. His unyielding strength and devotion to his work and clients attested to his selfless character and genial demeanor. He will be greatly missed by the countless lives he has touched. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the life of, and bidding farewell to, Joey Noufal. May he rest in peace, and his family be comforted. 
THE HOUSE’S RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP’S REMARKS ON U.S.RUSSIA CYBERSECURITY COOPERATION 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my distress over the House’s response to President Trump’s recent comments on cybersecurity cooperation with Russia. The U.S. Intelligence Community has overwhelmingly concluded that Russia actively sought to influence the 2016 election through an active disinformation campaign, and covert cyberattacks. Yet this past weekend, in an act that confounded Republicans and Democrats alike, President Trump bragged about discussing with Vladimir Putin the possibility of establishing a joint cybersecurity unit with Russia. The idea that we would cooperate with Russia on cybersecurity, which would necessarily mean sharing some of our strategies, defies logic. Naturally concerned by this reckless announcement, this week several of my colleagues and I offered amendments to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Vear 2018 to prohibit such cooperation. However, House Republicans refused to bring a single one of them to the floor for consideration. Not only has our President refused to fully accept the overwhelming evidence that Russia actively sought to influence our elections, he now continues to place our national security at risk by floating the absurd idea that we should actually cooperate with Vladimir Putin, who ordered this campaign against our democratic institutions, in order to guard against future cyber threats. Mr. Speaker, it would be laughable, if it were not so shameful, that House Republicans are refusing to do anything to even consider prohibiting such a dangerous course of action by President Trump. Why not let the full House vote on this proposal? If any of my colleagues do think it’s a good idea to work with Russia on cybersecurity, let them come to the floor and explain themselves. What will it take before House Republicans take a stand against Russia’s actions? If we do not do it, then I promise you it will happen again in the next election. f 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 13, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes: 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the Franks Amendment No. 13 to H.R. 2810, the ‘‘National Defense Authorization Act’’ (NDAA), which would require the federal government to conduct so called strategic assessments of Islamic religious doctrine. I am shocked and appalled at this blatant attempt to single out Muslims for a religious test in a direct violation of the Constitution and our nation’s founding principles. It frankly astounds me that such a hateful, discriminatory, and incoherent piece of religious bigotry has been made in order for this bill and is under consideration today. To illustrate the sheer absurdity of this amendment, I would like to offer the amendment’s sponsor a brief lesson on the history of religious persecution and freedom in the United States. In 1620, a group of Englishborn Puritans braved the Atlantic Ocean in order to found Plymouth Colony in the New World of America—they were fleeing, above all else, religious persecution in England, where discriminatory religious tests were common practice and the law. On September 17, 1878, two and a half centuries later, 39 delegates signed the United States Constitution; in Article 6, Section 3 of this Constitution, they wrote that ‘‘no religious test shall ever be required . . . under the United States.’’ In the First Amendment, they went even further: ‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’’ Every child in America knows these facts about our nation’s founding. The essential human right to freedom of worship, without fear of persecution or discrimination, is explicitly written into our genetic code as Americans. What we do not teach our children is to associate any particular religion with the violent acts of a few extremists who claim to belong to that religion. We understand that such an accusation would be irrational, intellectually dishonest, and ineffective at identifying and combatting the real roots of violent extremism. It would be remiss for me to neglect to point out that the Ku Klux Klan was founded and continues to identify as a Christian organization, or that racial terrorist Dylann Roof, who murdered nine innocent churchgoers in cold blood, was himself a member of a Lutheran church. Yet Representative Franks’ amendment does not require any strategic assessments of ‘‘violent or unorthodox’’ Christian doctrine. Instead, Amendment No. 13 wrongfully casts the specter of terrorism upon all Muslim communities and individuals through the use of coded language like ‘‘strategic assessments.’’ Nowhere does this Amendment acknowledge the fact that many Muslims, both domestically and abroad, have been contributing wholeheartedly to the U.S.’s mission to end violent extremism. Amendment No. 13 mandates the identification of key Islamic leaders who practice any form of Islam, with no exception for those who have never violated any laws—this is not only a completely nonsensical proposition, but a dangerous violation of the principles of religious liberty, individual privacy, and equal protection as established by the First Amendment. Amendment No. 13 requires the Secretary of Defense to create a ‘‘team of experts’’ to determine which practices and beliefs of the Islam are legitimate or acceptable—another direct violation of the Constitution. Mr. Chair, this Amendment is a stain on our national honor and pride as Americans. 
Muslim Americans make up a vital part of our nation’s diverse, multicultural fabric; every day, they make valuable contributions to the arts, the economy, academia, government, military services, and much more. If it is passed, Amendment No. 13 would only further stigmatize and alienate a vibrant community of Americans who have been subject to harassment and discrimination for years, and especially under the Trump Administration. We are better than that and I urge all Members to join me in rejecting this terrible legislation. 
INSURING SOCIAL SECURITY SOLVENCY FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security held a hearing to discuss the Social Security Administration’s Annual Trustee Report. This report is a strong reminder that Congress must act to address the Social Security Trust Fund shortfall to ensure the stability of Social Security for generations to come. The longer Congress delays dealing with this impending crisis, the fewer options we will have to address the shortfall. Social Security is an essential program that prevents elderly Americans from falling into poverty once they reach retirement age or are disabled. Currently, Social Security covers 61 million seniors, and 171 million Americans pay into the system. The Trust Fund is divided into two divisions: OldAge and Survivors insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI). These funds cover the 41.2 million retired workers, the 8.8 million disabled workers, and their families. The long term viability of Social Security is undoubtedly under threat. The Baby Boomers are beginning to retire which is putting significant pressure on the fund. Since Social Security collects fewer revenues than it previously did, it will be forced to draw from the 2.8 trillion dollars in asset reserve. The Social Security Administration Trustee’s report estimates that reserves are in danger of depletion by 2034. We cannot let this happen. A reduction in benefits for our seniors would be devastating for many of my constituent, who depend on Social Security payments as their only income in retirement. If benefits decrease, seniors who have paid into the system could be forced to choose between paying for their groceries, their utility bills, or their essential medication. There are commonsense steps that Congress can take to stabilize the program and insure it’s presence for the next century. The Ranking Member of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, Congressman JOHN LARSON , has introduced H.R. 1902—the Social Security 2100 Act. I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 1902, which would simultaneously increase benefits for current and future seniors, reduce payroll taxes for middle class and working class Americans, and secure the solvency of the program until 2100. This is accomplished by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share by raising the payroll tax cap on incomes above $127,000. There are reasonable solutions that both Democrats and Republicans should be able to support. Congress cannot afford to abandon our seniors. We must address the Social Security shortfall now. Therefore, I call an Speaker RYANto bring H.R. 1902 to the floor for a vote. 
INTRODUCTION OF HOUSE RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF VIETNAMESE AMERICANS 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing a House Resolution recognizing the accomplishments and contributions of Vietnamese Americans. I represent part of one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the United States, and I am proud to recognize the valuable contributions of 1.7 million Vietnamese Americans currently living in the United States. The United States is home to the largest number of individuals of Vietnamese descent outside of Vietnam. Additionally, Vietnamese Americans make up the fourth largest Asian American population. Currently, more than 70,000 reside in California’s 46th Congressional District. In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, approximately 800,000 Vietnamese refugees fleeing persecution resettled in the United States. Today, Vietnamese Americans contribute to American society through their work in business, education, science and technology, engineering, mathematics, literature and the arts, gastronomy, the armed forces, and public service at every level of government. Vietnamese Americans add to the rich cultural and religious diversity of our Nation. As a member of the Congressional Vietnam Caucus, it is critical that we continue to represent and celebrate our Vietnamese families, friends, and neighbors, and recognize their significant contributions to American society. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I was regrettably detained on July 13, 2017 during Roll Call No. 360, the Blumenauer Amendment No. 13 to H.R. 2810. Had I been present, I would have voted AYE on Roll Call No. 360. HONORING WORLD WAR II VETERAN ED GREEN HON. LOU BARLETTA 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize my good friend Ed Green for his many years of service to this country, beginning with his time in the U.S. military and continuing thereafter with his many philanthropic endeavors. During World War II, Ed proudly served as a member of the Navy, operating in a largely clandestine capacity. He lived and worked aboard armed Merchant Marine vessels, consistently risking his life to ensure the safety of those at home. Upon his honorable discharge from the Navy, Ed continued his selfless dedication to helping others. He became an active member of the Freeland American Legion Post 473, a group committed to mentoring youth and promoting patriotism, honor, and devotion to service members and veterans within its community. Ed was also involved with the longstanding Veterans of Foreign Wars 5010. He served as Commander of the Military Order of the Cooties Pup Tent 38 in order to help bring smiles to the faces of fellow veterans and residents of the VFW National Home for Children. Ed’s service to his community extended to various local philanthropic projects. For 60 years, he placed flags on the headstones of veterans at Vine Street Cemetery, and when the Standard Speaker newspaper ceased printing flags next to the obituaries of veterans, Ed was responsible for having the newspaper reinstate the practice. Additionally, he spent more than 50 years fighting for disability ratings from the Veterans Administration for hearing loss. He took the lead in organizing countless events during the past many decades, including Flag Day, Veterans Day, and Memorial Day celebrations that took place at locations such as the Laurel Mall and Calvary Cemetery. There is no doubt as to the profound impact Ed has had on the lives of those around him. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Ed for all he has sacrificed to serve our country and for all he has contributed to the Hazelton community. 
HONORING THE CAREER OF COMMAND SERGEANT MAJOR SCOTT C. SCHROEDER 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of Command Sergeant Major Scott C. Schroeder. After 31 years of dedicated service, Command Sergeant Major Schroeder became the Command Sergeant Major for FORSCOM—a post he held for 3 years. After enlisting in the United States Army in 1983, he began his career as an electronics mechanic at Fort Bliss, Texas. Serving at military installations all over the world allowed Command Sergeant Major Schroeder to gain 
valuable experience that would help shape his long career. While stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina’s Eighth Congressional District, he served with the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, and 82nd Airborne Division. Deployed on numerous operational assignments all over the globe and through some of our nation’s toughest times, Command Sergeant Major Schroeder stood ready to answer the call to serve our great country. Some of his most notable engagements were Operation Desert Storm in Saudi Arabia as part of the 82nd Airborne, and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq as part of the 101st Airborne Division. Throughout these operations, he delivered on the promise to keep America safe and confront our enemies head on under the most difficult conditions. While fighting our nation’s battles overseas, Command Sergeant Major Schroeder had a full family at home. Residing in Charlotte, his wife of 26 years, Marla and he have 3 children. This country cannot repay the debt we owe to Command Sergeant Major Schroeder and his family; the Schroeders are true American heroes. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the retirement of Command Sergeant Major Scott C. Schroeder. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, one cannot overstate the immediate and extraordinary threat posed by antimicrobial resistance throughout this nation and around the globe. With that in mind, I wish to recognize the exceptional work being done in Southern Arizona to combat this scourge. We know from the Centers for Disease Control that each year in the United States, at least two million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and some 23,000 die as a direct result. Experts suggest that based on current trends, antimicrobial resistance could become the world’s single greatest killer, surpassing heart disease and cancer, and posing a serious economic threat as well. In light of this, there is an urgent demand for the development of new antimicrobial compounds and faster diagnostic techniques to address this critical issue. Residents and visitors in Arizona’s Third Congressional District and surrounding areas are fortunate to have access to exceptional medical services, including those provided by Tucson Medical Center, Southern Arizona’s locally governed nonprofit regional hospital and leading provider for emergency and pediatric care. TMC is among the first facilities in the nation to adopt the newest superbugfighting technology. Using the Accelerate Pheno system, developed by Tucson’s Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., TMC health professionals can rapidly detect and identify bacteria as well as determine which antibiotic is most appropriate, and they can do this up to 40 hours faster than was possible using conventional techniques. I urge all the nation’s health facilities to prioritize efforts to combat antibiotic resistance using the best available technology, and recognize TMC and Accelerate Diagnostics for being leaders on this critical issue. f 
COMMEMORATING BASTILLE DAY AND THE PEOPLE OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Bastille Day. On this day we are reminded of the extraordinary resilience and democratic values that have made France an inspiration to the entire world. Today also marks the oneyear anniversary of the devastating and tragic loss of life last year in Nice. We remember to keep the injured and the deceased in our hearts, and we remind ourselves of the strong, persevering character of the French Republic. Time and time again, all throughout history, the French were able to demonstrate strong leadership through tragic times, and that is why the United States stands in unyielding solidarity with the people of France, which like the United States, is one of the most welcoming nations in the world. Mr. Speaker, for centuries Paris has been known to the world as the City of Light. The title is richly deserved, because Paris has been a world leader in the march of human progress in the arts, culture, science, democratic theory and governance. I am proud to mention that in my own city of Houston, we commemorate Bastille Day with special celebrations that feature art, dancing, and food. France embraces the challenges and opportunities of the modern world. France, and the values it cherishes, showcases a nation that has faced and prevailed against the most sinister of lethal adversaries. However, we will always ensure that they never confront these adversaries alone; they will be joined by the United States and the other countries of the civilized world. The French are justly proud of their national motto; ‘‘Liberte´, e´galite´, fraternite´,’’ (liberty, equality, fraternity) and no perpetrator can ever succeed in leading them to renounce their heritage of freedom and justice. 
NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT (H.R. 3003) AND KATE’S LAW (H.R. 3004) 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3003 & H.R. 3004. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) is a misguided attempt to defund communities that have enacted separation ordinances so called ‘‘sanctuary cities’’. This legislation would force state and local law enforcement to comply with potentially unconstitutional federal immigration policies, or risk losing critical federal funding. Intimidating our communities by threatening to withhold federal funding will not fix our nation’s immigration system. H.R. 3003 will add to the workload of our already overburdened local law enforcement, and drive a wedge between them and the communities they serve. Chiefs of police across our country support the enactment of separation of ordinances in the cities they serve and protect because it builds trust and keeps communities safe. I include in the RECORD a letter from the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, which St. Paul Chief of Police Todd Axtell is a member, that explains their strong opposition to this legislation. The federal government should not mandate that local law enforcement turn into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. Kate’s Law (H.R. 3004) is also a step backwards for our country. For the first time in our history, the United States would prosecute individuals who voluntarily present themselves at the border to seek asylum or to seek protection as a victim of human trafficking. This legislation would punish previously removed individuals who approach the border to apply for admission even if the individual has no criminal record or history of reentries. I stand with my fellow Americans in upholding this country as a welcoming one for immigrants, and with my Democratic colleagues in supporting our local law enforcement with the tools they need to keep all our communities safe. 
LAWENFORCEMENT  IMMIGRATION TASKFORCE , June 28, 2017. DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS : As law enforcement leaders dedicated to preserving the safety and security of our communities, we have concerns about legislative proposals that would attempt to impose punitive, ‘‘onesizefitsall’’ policies on state and local law enforcement. Rather than strengthening state and local law enforcement by providing us with the tools to work with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a manner that is responsive to the needs of our communities, these proposals would represent a step backwards. Attempts to defund socalled sanctuary cities regularly sweep too broadly, punishing jurisdictions that engage in wellestablished community policing practices or adhere to federal court decisions that have found federal immigration detainers to violate constitutional protections. We oppose these approaches and urge Congress to work to encourage—rather than compel—law enforcement agency cooperation within our federal system. We believe that law enforcement should not cut corners. Multiple federal courts have questioned the legality and constitutionality of federal immigration detainers that are not accompanied by a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Even though the legality of such immigration holds is doubtful, some have proposed requiring states and localities to enforce them, shielding them from lawsuits. While this approach would reduce potential legal liability faced by some jurisdictions and departments, we are concerned these proposals would still require our agencies and officers carry out federal directives that could violate the U.S. Constitution, which we are sworn to follow. Immigration enforcement is, first and foremost, a federal responsibility. Making our communities safer means better defining roles and improving relationships between 
local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. But in attempting to defund ‘‘sanctuary cities’’ and require state and local law enforcement to carry out the federal government’s immigration enforcement responsibilities, the federal government would be substituting its judgment for the judgment of state and local law enforcement agencies. Local control has been a beneficial approach for law enforcement for decades having the federal government compel state and local law enforcement to carry out new and sometimes problematic tasks undermines the delicate federal balance and will harm locallybased policing. Rather than requiring state and local law enforcement agencies to engage in additional immigration enforcement activities, Congress should focus on overdue reforms of the broken immigration system to allow state and local law enforcement to focus their resources on true threats dangerous criminals and criminal organizations. We believe that state and local law enforcement must work together with federal authorities to protect our communities and that we can best serve our communities by leaving the enforcement of immigration laws to the federal government. Threatening the removal of valuable grant funding that contributes to the health and wellbeing of communities across the nation would not make our communities safer and would not fix any part of our broken immigration system. Our immigration problem is a national problem deserving of a national approach, and we continue to recognize that what our broken system truly needs is a permanent legislative solution—broadbased immigration reform.

*Signatures updated as of June 28, 2017 5 PM ET. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. TED LIEU 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained on July 13, 2017 during the Roll Call No. 369 vote, the Hartzler Amendment No. 10 to H.R. 2810. Had I been present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 369. 
COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PEORIA HEIGHTS FIRE DEPARTMENT 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Peoria Heights Fire Department of Peoria, Illinois, for celebrating their 100th Anniversary. In 1917, Peoria Heights Fire Department was chartered to provide protection for the village and its inhabitants. Since then, the department has grown immensely; it now provides fire suppression, fire prevention, technical rescue response, and emergency medical services. Over the past 100 years, these men and women have shown their dedication and service to the greater Peoria area by working countless hours to keep our neighbors, friends, and families safe. Peoria Heights Fire Department protects a total of 6,800 inhabitants and is known throughout Central Illinois for their hard work, dedication, and sacrifice. Today, we thank and celebrate them for their dedication to serving the greater Peoria area. I extend my sincere congratulations to Peoria Heights Fire Department for a successful 100 years, and I wish them another 100 years of success and good fortune. 
RECOGNIZING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF ALABAMA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD’S 115TH EXPEDITIONARY SIGNAL BATTALION ON THEIR DEPLOYMENT TO THE MIDDLE EAST 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the men and women who proudly make up the Alabama Army National Guard’s 115th Expeditionary Signal Battalion as they deploy to the Middle East in defense of our nation. The 115th has a rich history of service to America. The unit was organized in December 1940 as the 2nd Battalion, 151st Engineers, a little less than a year before our nation would enter World War Two. In early 1941, the unit was called into federal service to participate in maneuvers in Louisiana as the War Department geared up for the threat of war. In January of 1942, just after America entered the war, the unit moved to Alaska to help protect American territory from the Japanese. Service during World War Two also included deployments to England and France. The unit would be called into federal service once more in 1963. The men and women of the 115th would again answer our nation’s call to service after the attacks of September 11, 2001 amidst our efforts to neutralize terrorist threats around the world. The first call to support the War on Terrorism would be in 2003 as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, returning home in 2005. Then, in 2011, the unit would be sent to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Now, in 2017, like so many Alabama Guard Units, the 115th which has companies in Florence, Haleyville and Huntsville, is once again standing up to serve our nation. The unit will be sent to the Middle East to support and defend our nation’s vital interests abroad. Mr. Speaker, Congress’ appreciation along with our continued admiration for these men and women and the service they provide to the United States of America are reflected here today. f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF ROSEANN BURKART SERRANO 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and achievements of Mrs. RoseAnn Burkart Serrano. Mrs. Serrano dedicated her life to serving her family and her community. She was a volunteer, member, manager, board member, and president of many organizations, both in Le Grand and in the surrounding areas of Chowchilla, Merced, Fresno, Mariposa, and Planada. Mrs. Serrano is a shining example of what it means to make a difference in the world, and she serves as a model of determination and selflessness for all who knew her. Born in Fresno, Mrs. Serrano graduated from San Joaquin Memorial High School in 1962 before earning a degree in Liberal Studies from Fresno City College. Mrs. Serrano continued her education at California State University, Fresno, where she was a music and history major. At Fresno State, Mrs. Serrano served as the district secretary for the college Catholic organization and met her future husband, David Serrano, through her membership in the Newman Club at the St. Paul Newman Center. After their marriage, Mrs. Serrano began working with her husband at his agricultural business, and she soon became an integral part of Serrano Farms. Besides being a fulltime homemaker and mother, Mrs. Serrano irrigated, ran machinery in their almond orchards and cotton fields, and managed the farm’s business records and payroll. In addition to her role at Serrano Farms, Mrs. Serrano was active in numerous organizations, such as California Women for Agriculture, USDA Farm Services Agency Committee, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the Plainsburg Elementary 
School Board. Mrs. Serrano also volunteered in more local settings, from planning the Le Grand Community Day and Our Lady of Lourdes Parish Dinner, to serving on the Plainsburg Election Board and helping the Plainsburg Library. Additionally, Mrs. Serrano was a regular accompanist and choir singer at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, where she became the local goto pianist and organist for weddings and funerals. Mrs. Serrano was recognized for her accomplishments and service on numerous occasions. In 1994, she and her husband were awarded the State of California Governor’s Small Business Award for Small Business Person of the Year. In 2008, they were also recognized as Le Grand Community Day Citizens of the Year. In 2014, the California Agricultural Leadership Foundation at California State University, Fresno selected Mrs. Serrano as a ‘‘Common Threads Honoree,’’ honoring her for community service and philanthropic endeavors. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and achievements of Mrs. RoseAnn Burkart Serrano. The Merced community mourns Mrs. Serrano’s passing, but rejoices in her lasting impact and legacy. She could always tell when someone needed her help or a smile, and she was always willing to extend her hand in friendship and open her heart with compassion. Her wisdom, mentorship, and persevering spirit continue to inspire her family and countless others to strive for excellence and serve their communities. 
Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent in the House chamber for Roll Call vote 367 on Thursday, July 13, 2017. Had I been present, I would have voted No on Roll Call vote 367. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 13, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes: 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose the Perry amendment, that would strike section 336 of the National Defense Authorization Act bill under consideration by the House. Section 336 is a commonsense and essential provision that simply acknowledges the fact that climate change is an urgent and direct threat not only to our national security, but also to our armed forces and our military installations around the world. This amendment would weaken our national security by preventing our military from planning and preparing to best meet these threats. Despite the consensus view of the world’s climate scientists that human actions are accelerating climate changes through our excessive carbon emissions, there continue to be some Members of this body that hope if we don’t assess the threat too closely, it will go away. As Members of this body, we have sworn to protect the public welfare from all threats, foreign and domestic. And make no mistake, our changing climate—fueled by humanity’s enormous carbon emissions—is exactly such a threat. But don’t take my word for it. The words of Defense Secretary James Mattis that are included in the text of this bill are instructive, and deleting them through this amendment will make them no less true. He said, ‘‘I agree that the effects of a changing climate—such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, among others—impact our security situation . . . [and] it is appropriate . . . to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment . . . into [our] planning.’’ And as former Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Gordon Sullivan has stated: ‘‘Climate change is a national security issue. We found that climate instability will lead to instability in geopolitics and impact American military operations around the world.’’ The bipartisan language of section 336 goes on to state that, ‘‘a threefoot rise in sea levels will threaten the operations of more than 128 United States military sites, and it is possible that many of these atrisk bases could be submerged in the coming years.’’ For my district in South Florida, we don’t have to look to the future to see the threat posed by rising temperatures. Climate change is a threat today. Sea levels have already risen nine inches in the last several decades and, according to FIU’s Sea Level Solutions Center, we could see up to another six inches of sea level rise in just over a dozen years. Today ‘‘king tides’’ cause flooding in low lying communities several times a year. We cannot afford another six inches, let alone another three feet of ocean water. And our marine ecosystems and corals are also under attack from increased acidification caused by carbon dioxide absorption in ocean waters. As Members of Congress, we have a duty to the taxpayers of this country not only to protect our communities from the worst effects of climate change, but also to ensure that we spend wisely on national defense and international assistance for humanitarian and disaster response. It is therefore imperative that our military leaders be allowed to assess the vulnerabilities to our military installations and ensure we build in resiliency so that our military is ready to meet the challenges ahead. Simply put, we should give our military leaders the tools they need to protect the American public. Section 336 does exactly that and this amendment must be rejected. Whether out of concern for our national defense, our public health, our environment, the economic wellbeing of our communities, or for all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this illadvised amendment. RECOGNIZING OUR NATION’S COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PROFESSIONALS DURING PRETRIAL, PROBATION AND PAROLE SUPERVISION WEEK 2017 HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the nation’s community corrections professionals and the vital role they play in enhancing public safety throughout the United States. In honor of the invaluable contributions of these dedicated public servants, the American Probation and Parole Association (APPA) and its associated members have designated the week of July 17 through 23 ‘‘Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2017.’’ I thank the thousands of men and women who perform these important public safety duties, and urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in support of APPA’s weeklong recognition efforts this year. In my congressional district, the nation’s capital, thousands of women and men serve as pretrial, probation and parole officers or administrators. As public servants, these constituents, along with many other Americans, commit themselves on a daily basis to helping improve the lives of those involved in the criminal justice system. The work of these professionals ultimately results in stronger and safer communities for all. Community corrections professionals are responsible for the supervision of adult and juvenile offenders in communities throughout our nation. These trained professionals go above and beyond the call of duty by connecting their clients to supportive services, community based resources, employment opportunities, housing programs and other evidencebased practices that help individuals successfully complete supervision and reenter society. Community corrections professionals strive to provide these services and support, while simultaneously providing client surveillance, crime prevention and restorative justice. In honor of Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2017, I take the opportunity to recognize those who carry out community corrections and supervision services here in the District of Columbia, including the officers and professionals of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA). CSOSA and the Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Columbia (PSA) are dedicated to reducing recidivism and enhancing public safety in the nation’s capital. CSOSA and PSA are recognized as model community supervision entities because of their use of evidencebased practices and community partnerships. On any given day, CSOSA is responsible for supervising approximately 11,000 individuals on probation, parole or supervised release, while PSA supervises over 17,000 defendants over the course of a year. Charged with having to balance issues of public safety with social services and reentry support, the employees of CSOSA and PSA help to enhance the security of everyone who lives, works or visits the District. Mr. Speaker, again, I extend my gratitude to these public servants for their commitment, 
compassion and contributions to healthier and safer communities throughout the United States. I ask the House of Representatives to join me in acknowledging the impact community corrections professionals have on the quality of life of all Americans throughout our country by recognizing July 17 through 23 as Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2017. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, July 12, 2017, I was absent from the House during the second vote series because I was unavoidably detained. Due to my absence, I did not record any votes for the second vote series. Had I been present, I would have voted: nay on Roll Call Votes 350 and 351, and aye on Roll Call Vote 352. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding Man of God, and friend of long standing, Reverend Dr. Ralph Walter Huling, who will celebrate his 30th anniversary as the distinguished pastor of St. James Missionary Baptist Church in Columbus, Georgia. An anniversary worship service will be held on Sunday, August 6, 2017 at the church at 5214 St. James Street in Columbus. Dr. Huling is a native of Columbus, Georgia. He served our nation honorably as a Chaplain Assistant in the U.S. Army. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Science degree from Troy State University in Phenix City, Alabama and went on to earn a Doctorate in Pastoral Theology from Anderson Theological Seminary in Camilla, Georgia. He utilizes his education to further the next generation by serving as an Adjunct Professor of Psychology at both Chattahoochee Valley Community College and Columbus Technical College. Throughout his pastoral career, Dr. Huling has played a leading role in several religious affiliated and communitybased organizations. In addition to serving as Pastor of St. James Missionary Baptist Church, he has also pastored at New Hope Baptist Church in Lumpkin, Georgia for 24 years. He is the President of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance; faculty member of the National Baptist Convention; certified dean in the National Baptist Congress of Christian Education; moderator of the Mt. Moriah Baptist Association; and International Instructor in the Germany Congress of Christian Education. In addition, he has served as the President of the Columbus Clergy Class. Not one to rest on his laurels, Dr. Huling is an active member of many civic organizations where he continuously seeks to pour his time and energy into his community. He is the President of 100 Black Men of Columbus; 2nd Vice Chairman of the Urban League Board of Directors; Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Enrichment Service Program; and a member of the Who’s Who Board of Directors for NonProfits of Georgia. He serves on the Board of Directors of Head Start and the Board of Directors for the Golf Authority in Columbus, Georgia. Dr. Huling is a strong advocate for restoring the family unit. He retired as a Family Service Coordinator from the Muscogee County School District. In addition, Dr. Huling wrote a book titled, ‘‘The Biblical and Cultural Concepts of Marriage and Family Life.’’ He travels around the world teaching and counseling couples and those seeking to be married. He has received numerous humanitarian awards including the President Award from the Georgia Family Service Coordinators Association. Dr. Huling has achieved much in his life but none of it would be possible without the love and support of his loving wife of 35 years, Dorothy; his daughters, Nekita and Daisha; and grandson, Nolan. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me, the congregation of St. James Missionary Baptist Church, and the more than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Congressional District in extending our sincerest congratulations to the Reverend Dr. Ralph Walter Huling. A man of great accomplishment, he is an outstanding mentor, strong leader, and prominent community activist, but above all, he is a faithful servant of God. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Borough of Saxonburg in honor of their 185th Anniversary. Located in Butler County Pennsylvania and home to approximately 1,500 residents, Saxonburg is a quaint town with a significant history. Named for the German state of Saxony, Saxonburg was founded in 1832 by immigrant John Roebling, an admirable architect and engineer. Roebling, whose presence can still be seen and felt today, is responsible for designing the town of Saxonburg and creating an agricultural community that offered immigrants a new life in America. Roebling revolutionized the art of bridge building when he invented the wire rope from his workshop in Saxonburg, which now serves as a museum and historical landmark for tourists. On July 16, 1842, Roebling was granted a patent for his wire rope invention, marking this year as the 175th Anniversary of Roebling’s impact on bridge construction and worldwide transportation in general. Although Saxonburg has seen many improvements and updates, there has also been a collective effort to maintain its original and unique character. There are countless historic landmarks and structures that have been preserved and maintained, telling the story of days gone by. Saxonburg captured the designation of a historic district on the national level in 2004 and on the state level in 2008, which is a testament to the overall importance of this specific area. If you have the privilege to visit Saxonburg, you will gain a solid understanding of its iconic legacy and unique roots. Present day citizens of Saxonburg are justifiably proud of their past, especially as they reach these type of momentous milestones. Therefore, as the people of Saxonburg celebrate the anniversary of their founding, I congratulate them on the past 185 years of experiences and accomplishments and wish them continued happiness and success moving forward. f 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Sonia Sepulveda Dempsey, who was recently inducted into the Rio Grande Valley Sports Hall of Fame. Sonia began running competitively when she was in the seventh grade. While a student at Edinburg High School, she qualified for state three times. Sonia excelled on the track and was recruited heavily by many colleges and universities in the state of Texas. She eventually chose to attend Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where she joined their Track and Field Program. During her college years, Sonia was part of the second fastest relay team in Baylor’s history. Inspired by her first grade teacher, who she refers to as her ‘‘haven,’’ Sonia became an educator following her graduation from Baylor. She currently works as a testing facilitator at Edinburg North High School, where her husband serves as the band director. Sonia has been an educator for two decades. She also periodically gives motivational speeches to student athletes, a testament to her passion for athletics and commitment to student athletes. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Sonia Sepulveda Dempsey on the occasion of her induction to the Rio Grande Valley Sports Hall of Fame, and recognize her contributions to education and student athletes in South Texas. Today, I am proud to honor Sonia Sepulveda Dempsey. 
TRIBUTE TO GARY GREENE, ESQ. AND HIS BIG BAND OF BARRISTERS 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Big Band of Barristers and to recognize their founder, attorney Gary S. Greene. Gary Greene, Esq. and His Big Band of Barristers perform music from the Golden Era of Big Band Swing. Gary S. Greene organized the band in December 2011 as an adjunct to the 75member Los Angeles Lawyers Philharmonic and the 100member chorus, Legal Voices. These musicians are civil litigators, trial attorneys, in–house counsels, sole practitioners, partners at law firms, judges and justices, paralegals, law students and the like. 
The members include conservatory graduates and professional musicians as well as some who only played in their youth. The mission of these musical groups is to bring the legal community together in harmony to perform concerts and raise funds for organizations providing legal services for those who cannot afford them as well as for other charitable causes and civic events. The Big Band has performed concerts for the American Diabetes Association, the American Legion, Shriners Hospitals for Children, The Thalians, Magen David Adom, the City of Hope, Hollywood Remembers World AIDS Day, Ascencia (raising funds for housing for the homeless), the Beverly Hills Bar Association’s 80th and 85th Anniversaries, Loyola Law School’s 50th Anniversary and for justices of the California Supreme Court. On Friday evening, July 14, 2017, Maestro Greene and the Big Band of Barristers will perform in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress. Speakers at this program include the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, and Thomas V. Girardi, Esq. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my House colleagues to join me in congratulating Maestro Greene and his Big Band of Barristers along with the Los Angeles Lawyers Philharmonic for all their achievements. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity, on behalf of myself and my constituents, to honor Colonel Christopher T. Drew, District Commander for the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)—Chicago District. Throughout his command, Colonel Drew has shown unwavering dedication to improving the quality of life for the people of the District under his command. Colonel Drew will relinquish his command to Colonel Aaron W. Reisinger on July 21, 2017, at which time he will complete his exemplary career in the United States Army. In 1992, Colonel Drew began his selfless twentyfive year military career in the United States Army. Throughout the years, Colonel Drew completed tours in Texas, New York, California, Missouri, and Kansas, before arriving in Chicago. He was also deployed several times, serving in Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. Colonel Drew handled every assignment with courage, honor, and merit. He is regarded as a most gifted teacher who excels at bringing people together to solve problems and helping individuals become the best versions of themselves. For his distinguished service, Colonel Drew is the recipient of numerous awards and citations, including two Bronze Star Medals, two Defense Meritorious Service Medals, four Army Meritorious Service Medals, four Army Commendation Medals, five Army Achievement Medals, one Joint Meritorious Unit Award, and two Meritorious Unit Commendations, as well as the Sapper Tab, Ranger Tab, Air Assault Badge, and Parachutist Badge. Colonel Drew took command of the USACE—Chicago District in 2014. During his time as District Commander in Chicago, his leadership has played a significant role in the organization’s accomplishments, most notably in Northwest Indiana. The USACE initiated an ecosystem restoration project at the Portage Lakefront Park in 2015, in which sixtyfive acres were restored, complementing the investments made previously by the USACE to open up public access to Lake Michigan. In East Chicago, Colonel Drew joined city officials to break ground on a shoreline restoration project that will enhance amenities to allow residents to enjoy the lakefront, while benefiting a diverse ecosystem. Stormwater and sanitary sewer projects were initiated by the Colonel’s leadership, in partnership with local sponsors in various communities, which improve water quality throughout the region and ultimately improve the quality of life for residents in numerous communities. Work continues on the Little Calumet River Flood Control and Recreation Project, which protects residents along the river and creates opportunities for increased economic development, and the dredging of the Indiana Harbor Ship Canal carries on apace. These projects and others stand testament to Colonel Drew’s commitment to the USACE’s mission to work with its partners to energize the nation’s economy through its civil works projects, as they likewise improve the quality of place in areas such as Northwest Indiana, I am grateful for his generosity of spirit, his meticulous work ethic, and his dedicated life of service. Colonel Drew’s outstanding career is exceeded only by his devotion to his beautiful family. He and his amazing wife, Rochelle, have two beloved children, Ian and Amara. Mr. Speaker, Colonel Drew has selflessly served his country and his fellow Americans. He has been a steadfast and proven leader throughout his remarkable career, one that has been instrumental in producing and developing the talents of the next generation. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Colonel Christopher T. Drew for his honorable service to the United States of America and in wishing him well upon his retirement. 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 2810, the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. As a Member of Congress, one of my most sacred duties is to help promote and ensure the safety and security of our nation. We are truly grateful and indebted to the brave men and women who have sacrificed their lives to protect our freedom and democracy. This legislation takes great strides towards ensuring that our military is equipped with the most advanced, state of the art technology and military capabilities to defend and protect our nation from ongoing and emerging threats across the world. The FY 2018 NDAA bill authorizes $630 billion for base budget requirements as well as $64.6 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. Additionally, this legislation contains several provisions that would equip, supply, and train our troops; provide resources for them and their families; and set national security policy for threats at home and abroad. I am particularly pleased to see that this bill prioritizes the readiness of U.S. Cyber Command, cyber mission forces, and cyber warfare tools and capabilities, including initiatives to strengthen the cyber workforce and strengthens congressional oversight of these capabilities. While I am supportive of the funding allocated to these critically important defense programs, I continue to have strong concerns about Congress’ inability to make difficult funding decisions as it relates to our national security priorities. The hard reality is that the overall top line discretionary budget authority in this bill will likely prove to be fiscally unworkable at the end of the legislative and budget process. Ultimately, I am deeply concerned that many of these initiatives will potentially be funded at the expense of vital domestic spending programs. While robust funding of our national security is paramount, it is equally as important that we continue to provide essential funding for domestic programs that help educate our children, ensure every American has access to quality and affordable healthcare, and repair our deteriorating infrastructure. We cannot have a safe and secure country if our people lack the resources necessary to be financially and socially secure. Funding for vitally important programs that help millions of Americans across the country prosper should not be an either or proposition. I urge my colleagues to support the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. f 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Edward Carl Deutschman for his outstanding service to our nation. A longtime resident of the central coast of California and a fellow sailor, he passed away this June at the age of 93. Not long after graduating high school in 1941, Mr. Deutschman enlisted in the Navy and attended the Del Monte PreFlight School in Monterey. Today, this site is the center of the renewed Naval Post Graduate School, one of many prominent military institutions in my district. During WWII, Mr. Deutschman was soon assigned to the USS Intrepid and flew over the Pacific Ocean on many combat missions. He flew a Corsair as a member of the Grim Reaper VF–10 Squadron in April of 1945, providing vital air cover for Marines. Mr. Deutschman was also a lead pilot during the amphibious assault of Okinawa—the final and largest of the Pacific island battles during World War II. Later he participated in an air raid over Tokyo. The antiaircraft fire was so intense that, as he later put it, ‘‘you could almost get out of the plane and walk on the stuff coming up.’’ Years after, he maintained close ties to the pilots who fought beside him, reuniting with them each year to reminisce in old stories and enduring friendships. Mr. Deutschman returned to the mainland and swapped his cockpit for the classroom. Armed with an undergraduate degree in business from California State University–Fresno 
and a graduate degree in education from the University of Southern California, he discovered his passion for teaching. Over more than thirty years as an elementary school teacher, principal, and assistant superintendent, Mr. Deutschman made a positive impact on the lives of thousands of students. In his retirement, he returned to California’s Central Coast and continued his goodwill on behalf of organizations like the Grey Bears, Boy Scouts of America, Rotary International, and as a board member of Good Shepherd Housing. Edward Deutschman represented the best of his time, not only as a solider and educator, but as a dedicated family man to his late wife Katherine Bell Thomas, children Kathleen Deutschman Scott, Robert Edward Deutschman, granddaughter Tigest Scott Macauley, and greatgrandsons Ibrahim Macauley and Abdul Rahman Macauley. On behalf of California’s 20th District, it is my honor to recognize this American hero, Edward Carl Deutschman.
