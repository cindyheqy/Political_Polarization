Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my appreciation and that of the Samoan people for the April 23 visit of Vice President MIKE PENCE , who was accompanied by the Second Lady and their daughters to my home district, the United States Territory of American Samoa, upon the conclusion of his historic 10day visit to strategic Asian and Pacific partners. Upon his arrival to Pago Pago, the Vice President remarked that he was glad to be back on American soil. This historic visit to American Samoa marks only the third time a sitting Vice President has graced our shores and follows in the footsteps of past visits from Vice Presidents Quayle in 1989 and Biden in 2016. Previous visits to our beautiful islands from White House dignitaries include First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in 1943, President Lyndon Johnson in 1966, and President Jimmy Carter’s son, Jeffrey, who represented his father at the inauguration of our first elected Governor in 1977, who happens to be my father, Peter Tali Coleman. Madam Speaker, pursuant to legislation I introduced in February, which was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President Trump on May 31, the Vice President came to American Samoa at my humble request to dedicate our veterans clinic to the memory of the late former representative of American Samoa, Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, with whom the Vice President served the entirety of his tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2003 to 2013. While in American Samoa, the Vice President also reviewed the troops comprised of Reserve companies who are part of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Infantry of the U.S. Army based in Hawaii. Headquartered at Ft. Shafter in Honolulu, the 100th Battalion, 442nd Infantry is the only infantry unit in the entire United States Army Reserve. Samoan soldiers who are part of the battalion have fought and served bravely in conflicts from Desert Storm to Afghanistan and Iraq, and others, since the companies were relocated to American Samoa in 1980. Madam Speaker, American Samoa takes particular pride that Vice President PENCE was able to celebrate with us the 109th anniversary of the establishment of the United States Army Reserves, which just happened to line up perfectly with his visit. While the Vice President’s journey was well covered by international and domestic media, most outlets outside of the Pacific failed to report a significant statement he made, which I have called the Pago Pago Declaration. This important statement made on our soil was well noted and well received in the Pacific Islands. Specifically, the Vice President spoke of the challenges the U.S. faces in Asia and the Pacific and confirmed to the audience assembled that, as quoted by Radio New Zealand International and broadcast regionwide: ‘‘We’re here to stay, we’re here for peace, we’re here for the prosperity of all of our people, and we are proud the American flag flies in American Samoa.’’ Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD this Radio New Zealand International story. 
[From Radio New Zealand, Apr. 25, 2017] AMERICAN SAMOANS TOLDUS I SCOMMITTED  
TOREGIONAL PEACE  The United States Vice President has told American Samoans that his country is committed to peace and stability in the AsiaPacific region. Mike Pence made a brief stopover in the US territory yesterday where he was greeted by Governor Lobo Matalasi Moliga his wife, the LieutenantGovernor Lemanu Peleti Mauga, Chief Justice Michael Kruse, House Speaker Savali Talavou Ale’a and congresswoman Aumua Amata Radewagen. Secret Service agents restricted access and only a few leaders were allowed to shake hands with the VicePresident. Governor Lobo apologised to traditional leaders who weren’t able to conduct a traditional ava ceremony because of security restrictions. Mr Pence, who was with his wife Karen, thanked American Samoans for their support and prayers. He said it was an important time for the AsiaPacific region. Mr Pence said he was in the territory on behalf of President Donald Trump to symbolise the US commitment to the area. ‘‘We’re here to stay, we’re here for peace, we’re here for the prosperity of all of our people and we are proud the American flag flies in American Samoa,’’ he said. 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. The People’s Republic of China and other external powers are gaining visibility and influence in the region, including the neighboring Independent State of Samoa. Due to the new influence of foreign interests in the region, members of American Samoa’s territorial legislature, the Fono, just days prior to the Vice President’s arrival, expressed to me, during my appearance before a special joint session, their concern about the rise of foreign influences in the region. I am certain the Pago Pago Declaration will help to allay their concerns and will be welcome in capitals across the Pacific from Port Moresby to Papeete, Tahiti. Moreover, Madam Speaker, I anticipate that the Pago Pago Declaration will be a component of the evolving Trump doctrine that is under development by the administration, which I expect will be fully articulated when the U.S. participates in the Port Moresby APEC summit in November of next year. Madam Speaker, we, in American Samoa, recognize the strategic importance of our location in the center of the Pacific Ocean and are proud of the contributions we make to our Nation’s security. As always, we stand ready to do our part to advance the spirit of the Vice President’s Pago Pago Declaration, which I expect will have a long lasting and positive effect on the region. I want to, once again, thank the Vice President and the administration for their attention to the Pacific territories, a region that too often goes unnoticed in Washington. 
MCGOVERNDOLE INTERNATIONAL FOOD FOR EDUCATION PROGRAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the George McGovernRobert Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, one of America’s signature child nutrition and food security programs. Established by Congress in the 2002 farm bill, over the past 15 years, it has provided lifesaving meals in school settings to over 14 million of the world’s most vulnerable children. Administered by the Department of Agriculture, this bipartisansupported program provides U.S. and international organizations with U.S. commodities, grants, and technical assistance to strengthen child nutrition and education. It receives a modest $201 million each year. Regrettably, the President’s FY 2018 budget would cruelly eliminate the entire program. McGovernDole is named after two Senators who worked in a bipartisan way during their long tenures in the Senate to end hunger, especially among children in the United States and around the world. They continued their work together after leaving the Senate. They are models for what can be accomplished when Members of Congress actually put petty partisanship aside and make the welfare of children and families become your number one priority. And even though George McGovern is no longer with us, Bob Dole continues to champion this cause. On March 20, in a statement to The Washington Post, he said: ‘‘Eliminating the McGovernDole program would have a disastrous effect on the planet’s most vulnerable children. Without a reliable source of nutrition, these children face a lifetime of stunted physical and mental development and unrealized opportunity. This global school meals program remains one of the proudest achievements of my lifetime. It embodies the very best of America’s values. Saving this program means saving lives. It’s as simple as that.’’ Madam Speaker, working through partners like the U.N. World Food Programme, Catholic Relief Services, World Vision, Save the Children, Counterpart International, and many more, McGovernDole has reduced the incidence of hunger among schoolaged children. It has increased school enrollments and attendance. It has increased the support of families and communities for education, especially for girls. It is a proven success. Instead of eliminating it, we should be strengthening and expanding it. Now, I have had the privilege of visiting some of these programs around the world. In Colombia, I visited a program in Soacha, on the outskirts of Bogota. On barren hillsides, surrounded by shanties housing thousands of internally displaced families, children were receiving a school breakfast and lunch. Mothers and grandmothers were training as cooks preparing the meals. Clearly visible in the cafeteria were USAID bags of grains, beans, and lentils. One mother came up to me and said: ‘‘Please thank the American people when you go back home. I couldn’t feed my children. I couldn’t send them to school. I was afraid my son was going to join the paramilitaries or guerrillas just to get food. Now my son is getting fed and he is staying in school. Please tell the American people thank you.’’ In Nairobi, Kenya, in the largest slum in the world, I went to a McGovernDole breakfast and lunch program. The school principal showed me how they store and prepare U.S. commodities that feed her students and how all the students know that this program is from the American people. I ate porridge made from yellow peas grown by American farmers. The kids dug into this food like it was manna from Heaven. One little boy would take a bite and then scoop a small amount out of his bowl and put it in his pockets. He was taking food home to his younger siblings who don’t get anything to eat. Outside of Nairobi in Maasai country is a school for girls where McGovern Dole provides a hot lunch. I helped cook and serve the meal of U.S. bulgur wheat and locally grown vegetables. One student told me how grateful she was to be able to go to school every day and eat every day. She grew up in a village over 100 miles away. When she was 12, her father told her that she had to marry a much older man. She refused. Her father ordered her to go to her uncle’s house and get his machete and bring it back to him. She knew that he was going to kill her. She ran away, walking alone for days, because she had heard of this school. And when I met her, she was 15, healthy, and well fed, and at the top of her class. I knew I was talking to someone who will some day be a leader in her country. In the very best way, she will never forget us. And when we take food away from children, families, and schools, those communities will never forget us either. They won’t forget that we took away their children’s future. I wouldn’t forget it if it were my child. Would you? Madam Speaker, there are many ways to advance U.S. national security and economic interests abroad. Education and child nutrition are very much at the top of the list. So I urge my colleagues to visit McGovernDole programs when they travel abroad and to support continued funding of the program in FY 2018. It is yet another way that we can all work together to end hunger now. f 
ATTEMPT TO REPEAL AND REPLACE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, this morning, the American public woke up to news accounts that the Trump White House and Republican leadership in Congress is going to again this week make another attempt to try and repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Republican Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY gave a speech in Texas a few days ago on Saturday where he promised that this is the week that the Republicans will repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. For those of us who were in the Chamber here just a short time ago in March when the first attempt was made to butcher the healthcare system with the socalled American Health Care Act, what we saw was the culmination of a process that was hyperpartisan starting in January in which the committees rushed through a piece of legislation without even giving the Congressional Budget Office a chance to analyze the cost and the impact in terms of the uninsured rate in America. And then finally, as the hour approached when a vote was scheduled to 
take place, the facts caught up with the legislation. The Congressional Budget Office determined that 24 million Americans would lose their health coverage, that the Medicare trust fund would be weakened because of the raid on the trust fund by reducing a Medicare tax surcharge for millionaires; and it would reduce the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 4 years, a program that is revered and probably the most popular insurance program in America in which, again, collection of healthcare stakeholders from all across the country, the American Hospital Association, the nurses, the doctors, the March of Dimes all came out universally opposing this measure. And finally, the Quinnipiac poll showed what the American public thought of this bill. They came out with a poll that showed only 17 percent support in the American public for the Republican healthcare bill. Again, the Quinnipiac poll comes from my State, the State of Connecticut, and was very supportive and friendly in terms of its polling data in terms of the Trump campaign last year, so it is certainly not a partisan poll. So why are we revisiting a measure which was so universally denounced and despised? Well, there has been a new amendment that has been offered in an attempt, again, within the confines of the Republican majority, to try and win votes to pass this bill this week. Again, they have a majority with roughly 240 seats. They need only 216, and that is really what has been the focus of the majority leader in terms of trying to line up a vote this week. The amendment, the socalled MacArthur amendment, again, revisits some of the issues, which, again, some of the more conservative members of the Freedom Caucus were complaining about, and what it proposes to do is basically give States the ability to wipe out essential health benefits—in other words, the basic patient protections that were built into the health insurance law 8 years ago. b1215 It does nothing in terms of trying to ameliorate the impact of the Medicaid cuts, which is the program for lowincome and working Americans, which the ACA expanded and has done great work in terms of reducing the ranks of the uninsured. That is the measure which we now have before us this week. Well, once again, the stakeholders who have to live with this have weighed in with their thoughts. This is what the American Hospital Association said: ‘‘The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen the bill.’’ Again, it is a bill that was so unpopular, poorly drafted, and not ready for prime time that the Speaker pulled it from a vote on March 24. The American Hospital Association, which is the largest trade association for hospitals in America—they represent thousands of hospitals—have said that, in fact, this makes it even worse. By weakening the essential health benefits—and I come from Connecticut. We know a little bit about insurance in that State. What we know is, if insurance companies can redesign healthcare plans, the essential health benefits will be the first to go. The ones that will be the first to go will be maternity care, behavioral health, and emergency coverage because those are the most expensive items that are included within the health insurance plan. I would say, well, that is true. On the other hand, those are the essential benefits that families need. Look at what has happened since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2007 to infant mortality, for example: because of the Medicaid coverage, 57 percent of the live births in America are now women—and particularly young women—who get the benefit of Medicaid coverage. So they get prenatal care. They get the help that they need to make sure that a healthy delivery occurs. That is why infant mortality rates have been coming down in this country since the Affordable Care Act passed. To allow States to eliminate or give insurance companies the ability to eliminate maternity care, again, is just going exactly in the opposite direction. A goal all Americans support is to reduce infant mortality and to promote healthy live births. The American Hospital Association was joined by the American Medical Association, which is the largest trade group which represents physicians all across the country, and came out against the bill. America should listen. The people in Congress should listen. We should not take up this bill. It is time for a true bipartisan process to improve America’s healthcare bill. Let’s not vote on this this week. Let’s listen to the American people. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 17 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. WEBER of Texas) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day. We ask Your blessing upon this assembly and upon all to whom the authority of government is given. Help them to meet their responsibilities during these days, to attend to the immediate needs and concerns of the moment, enlightened by Your eternal spirit. We thank You for Your gifts of patience and perseverance that have led to agreements on the funding of government. It is difficult work calling for true leadership. Continue to bless those Members who continue to work toward solutions that redound to the benefit of our Nation. Please send Your spirit of peace upon those areas of our world where conflicts continue and threaten to break out. May all Your children learn to live in peace. And may all that is done within the people’s House be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
APPRECIATING CAPTAIN TAYLOR FORCE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Captain Taylor Force of South Carolina was a graduate of West Point, a veteran who had served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he was an MBA candidate at Vanderbilt University when he was, at random, stabbed to death by a Palestinian terrorist in March of 2016 as he innocently departed from a bus as a tourist in Israel. He was only 28 years old. His merciless murder at the hands of Palestinian terrorists is even more gruesome because of the Palestinian Authority program of paying out hundreds of millions of dollars to terrorists and their families in support of mass murder. I am grateful to support the Taylor Force Act, legislation that restricts all aid from the Palestinian Authority until the Secretary of State confirms they do not provide financial rewards for terrorists in their murderous activities. I appreciate the leadership of 
Senator L INDSEY GRAHAM , Congressman DOUGLAMBORN , and Congressman LEEZELDIN for introducing the Taylor Force Act. As Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas travels to Washington to meet with President Trump on Wednesday, I am confident that President Trump will show his commitment to ending financial rewards for terrorists. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
AMERICANS LOOK TO THE STARS (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, human history is punctuated by explorations of the world around us. We are a nation of explorers. It is part of our national identity, and finding new planets and looking for evidence of life beyond our Earth fascinates most Americans. The discovery of life elsewhere in the universe would alter our priorities for space exploration and affect how we view ourselves. In just the last two decades, we have confirmed the existence of 3,000 exoplanets, planets outside our solar system. Probing the cosmos encourages the next generation of young students to pursue careers in astronomy, astrophysics, and astrobiology. We must continue to look at the Stars. They offer us a glimpse of the past and hope for the future. 
HONORING BRAZOSWOOD HIGH SCHOOL (Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Brazoswood High School band was awarded one of the highest honors: the Sudler Flag of Honor by the John Philip Sousa Foundation. The Sudler Flag of Honor is given to distinguished high school bands that have demonstrated particularly high standards of excellence in concert activities over a period of several years. There is a 7year minimum process, with countless documents, recordings, letters of recommendation, and performances at not only the State but the local level as well. Of the nearly 50 Sudler Flags that have been awarded since 1983, almost 30 of them have gone to Texas high school bands. The Brazoswood Buccaneer Band is the most recent addition to this prestigious group, and they are the only band to have been awarded the Sudler Flag in 2017. My sincere congratulations to the students; the alumni; the band; Mr. Brian Casey, the band director; and the principal, Rita Pintavalle, on this outstanding achievement. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina). Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 4:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 6 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1630 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. POLIQUIN ) at 4 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 910) to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide a safe harbor related to certain investment fund research reports, and for other purposes, as amended.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today I rise in support of H.R. 910, the Fair Access to Investment Research Act, which I have had the pleasure of working on with my friend from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER ) in this Congress and nowGovernor Carney in the last Congress. Mr. FOSTER , I had the pleasure to speak with Governor Carney this weekend and tell him of our great collaboration in this Congress, and he sends his warmest regards for the process. This bill, Mr. Speaker, is a commonsense, bipartisan, bicameral effort to increase access to research and information on exchangetraded funds, or ETFs, an important and rapidly growing investment vehicle in the United States and around the world. Before coming to Congress, I worked in the banking and investment industry for nearly three decades, and I have witnessed firsthand the explosive growth in the ETF industry. Since I started my latest firm in the late 1990s, I have seen the exchangetraded fund selection grow from about 100 funds with about $100 billion in total assets to today’s 2,000 funds with about $2.4 trillion in investment assets. However, despite this rapid growth in the popularity in the ETF market and their increasing importance to retail investors, most brokerdealers do not publish research on ETFs due to anomalies in our securities laws and regulations. The SEC has implemented safe harbors for research in support of various asset classes, including listed stocks, corporate debt, and closedended funds, and Congress has provided explicit safe harbors for research related to the offerings of emerging growth company securities. However, despite their similarities to those asset classes, ETFs do not benefit from similar safe harbors. An ETF safe harbor is also not a novel concept to the Commission, and there is bipartisan consensus that this is something that the SEC should have done years ago. In addition to providing feedback on this bill for the past 3 years, the SEC, itself, has looked at granting a safe harbor for ETF research on multiple occasions but never quite got around to it. The Fair Access to Investment Research Act simply directs the SEC to provide a safe harbor for research reports that cover ETFs so that these reports are not considered offers under the Federal securities laws. Because ETFs are continuously brought to the market, a safe harbor is necessary for brokerdealers to publish this research. It also holds the SEC accountable to Congress by providing an interim safe harbor if the SEC does not act within a 270day period, which would be effective until the Commission finalizes its rules in this area. Providing this safe harbor will increase access to investment information for consumers and improve the efficiency of our capital markets. Given the importance of ETFs to the market and to the 6 million or so U.S. households that hold ETFs, steps to facilitate research and allow investors access to this useful information are long overdue. Mr. Speaker, we want more information for our consumers about how their investments work, how an ETF fits into their investment portfolio, how it is consistent with their time horizon and their goals, and what the transaction costs are. What are the unique strategies around that ETF? Does it, in fact, use leverage or not? All these kinds of details will help our consumers know more about these products. As our Capital Markets Subcommittee ranking member, Mrs. MALONEY , stated so eloquently at our markup earlier this year: It makes sense to get more research out there on ETFs. After all, if you are concerned with the growth of ETFs, then the last thing you want is less research. True it is. This bill in no way undermines or eliminates any investor protections in the Federal securities laws or the SEC’s ability to oversee the registration and sale of ETF securities explicitly, containing a rule of construction that the applicability of the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the Federal securities laws are in no way limited by this legislation. This safe harbor would also only apply to bona fide research and in no way limits FINRA, the Federal securities regulators, and the SEC’s ability to regulate sales and marketing literature that is used for ETFs. I would like to thank, again, my colleagues, Mr. FOSTER and Governor Carney, Senators HELLER and P ETERS for their work in the United States Senate, my chairman, the ranking member, and Mrs. MALONEY and the staff on both sides of the aisle for their hard work on this proconsumer, commonsense proposal to make more information available to America’s investing households. In March, H.R. 910 passed the House Financial Services Committee by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 56–2, 
and a similar version of this legislation passed the House in the last Congress by a vote of 411–6. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for his years of hard bipartisan work that went into this bill. I am proud to support this bill today because I believe that it will strengthen the abilities of investors to make informed decisions. This legislation would add transparency in the financial markets that will ultimately benefit consumers. Exchangetraded funds are valuable and popular tools for investors to get exposure to diversified risk through a single security with low costs. My wife and I use them ourselves. They are, however, like the iPhone, very simple on the outside but incredibly complicated products on the inside. They often can be thoroughly understood only by those with the background and the time to analyze the way the ETF is constructed, as well as each of the underlying securities and the sectors they are targeting. Retail investors and retirement savers often do not have this time and often do not have the expertise in the markets. Highquality research can help them make informed decisions about which ETFs to invest in, equipping them to make decisions on how to diversify across different sectors and indices. ETFs are continuously issued, so they present unique potential risks to underwriting brokerdealers under the Federal securities laws. Generally, the Federal securities laws prohibit a brokerdealer from participating in a securities offering from publishing research 15 days before or 30 days after the issuance for very good reason. This is to prevent research that could hype the security ahead of the offering or try to puff its price afterwards. ETF pricing, however, reflects a wide variety of data across many issuers and classes of securities. Because they are continuously brought to market, it is necessary to provide a clarification in the law that research is permitted to be published continuously, because they are also continually traded on the exchanges. The antifraud provisions of the securities laws will still apply. To be clear, this bill does not vitiate any rights of investors or responsibilities of broker dealers with respect to the accuracy and truthfulness of statements. Specifically, section 2(c)(1) provides that the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the securities laws are not limited by anything in this bill. Moreover, this applies only to bona fide research, and FINRA can require sales materials to be posted to the public. Section 2(c)(2) preserves the powers of the SROs to oversee all of the practices of brokerdealers, including the publication of these reports. Lastly, the bill provides for a statutory safe harbor should the Commission not be able to promulgate a rule in the 270day period established by the bill. This statutory safe harbor is only available to research on funds that have been reported to the SEC for the last year, ensuring that it is true to the purpose of the bill to provide research to be used by investors for existing securities. Statutory safe harbors exist elsewhere in the Federal securities laws, most notably section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. A statutory private offering exemption can be perfected without relying on regulation D. In practice, though, that does not happen, and I trust that the SEC will prescribe an appropriate set of rules consistent with section 2(a) of this bill so that the regulatory safe harbor will be effective. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for his comments and his constructive help on designing and completing the legislative process on this bill. Mr. Speaker, an integral process of getting this bill completed was certainly by our staff, and I want to pay particular attention to Holli Heiles of my personal staff, who, this day, leaves the world of the personal staff and moves to the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments of the House Financial Services Committee. I want to thank Holli Heiles for her outstanding work on this bill and for her outstanding work on behalf of the people of the Second Congressional District of Arkansas, as well as to congratulate her on her move to the committee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I again thank my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) and nowGovernor Carney, as well, for working on this bill over the past years. I look forward to it being signed into law. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work done together on this bill. I don’t have any other speakers on this particular bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BACON ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 910, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

b1645 SMALL BUSINESS CAPITAL FORMATION ENHANCEMENT ACT Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1312) to amend the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980 to require an annual review by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the annual governmentbusiness forum on capital formation that is held pursuant to such Act, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1312 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act’’. 
SEC. 2. ANNUAL REVIEW OF GOVERNMENTBUSINESS FORUM ON CAPITAL FORMATION. 
Section 503 of the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 80c–1) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(e) The Commission shall— ‘‘(1) review the findings and recommendations of the forum; and ‘‘(2) each time the forum submits a finding or recommendation to the Commission, promptly issue a public statement— ‘‘(A) assessing the finding or recommendation of the forum; and ‘‘(B) disclosing the action, if any, the Commission intends to take with respect to the finding or recommendation. ‘‘(f) FORUM FINDINGS .—Nothing in this section shall require the Commission to agree to or act upon any finding or recommendation of the forum.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1312, the Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act, which would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to respond to the recommendations from its annual forum on small business capital formation. Small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy, and, according to the SBA, have provided 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all net new jobs over the past 40 years. These small 
businesses are intimately familiar with their businesses and the regulatory environment, and who better to provide insights to regulators and lawmakers on how to best provide and promote capital formation and remove unnecessary regulatory barriers and burdens? Nearly four decades ago, in 1980, Congress recognized the importance of our smallbusiness owners and their having a voice and sharing their recommendations with the SEC, and Congress required the SEC to conduct an annual forum to review the current status and issues surrounding small business capital formation. But while the Commission is required to conduct this forum, its obligation goes no further. Though the SEC often praises this small business forum and the insights and recommendations from the small business community, the SEC has no obligation to respond to or act on the forum’s recommendations and findings and has rarely done so. For example, many of the provisions of the JOBS Act came from recommendations from the small business forum, but it was Congress who had to move forward with these ideas, not the SEC. This commonsense bill introduced by Mr. POLIQUIN and Mr. V ARGAS would require the SEC to formally respond to these recommendations just like they legally have to acknowledge and respond to recommendations from their Investor Advisory Committee. Similar legislation passed the House last Congress by a nearly unanimous vote, and, earlier this year, H.R. 1312 passed the House Financial Services Committee by a unanimous vote. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill, and I thank, again, my good friends from Maine and from California for their hard work on this bipartisan bill that ensures the voice of our small business community is heard. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1312, a commonsense measure that will ensure the SEC responds to recommendations that will reduce barriers to small businesses’ capital formation. Access to capital is the lifeblood of every business. As ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, I hear this on a near daily basis. It is as true today as it was 65 years ago when Congress created the Small Business Administration. Since that time, Congress has taken steps to better understand the needs of our small businesses and find ways to improve access to capital. In 1980, we created the GovernmentBusiness Forum on Small Business Capital Formation at the SEC. This body helps policymakers learn about unnecessary impediments to small business capital formation and address how they can be eliminated or reduced. However, the SEC isn’t currently required to act on the forum’s recommendations. The Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act changes the SEC’s obligation by requiring the Commission to respond to the recommendations made by the annual Government Business Forum. This bill is modeled after a similar provision in the Dodd Frank Act requiring the SEC to respond to the recommendation of the Investor Advisory Committee. However, there are important distinctions between the recommendations of the IAC and the forum. Specifically, the IAC is limited by statute to 23 members. By contrast, the forum is open to all public and private participants. As a result, the IAC has only issued 12 recommendations since its first meeting in 2012. During the same timeframe, the forum issued 98 recommendations. While I understand the desire to have the SEC respond to each of the forum’s recommendations, I would remind my colleagues that the SEC has the important duty to police our financial markets. Therefore, I hope my colleagues will remember these additional duties and set appropriate funding levels for the SEC to ensure agency resources are not being diverted from its crucial examination and enforcement activities. I would like to thank Mr. POLIQUIN  and Mr. VARGAS for crafting this bipartisan bill to ensure that the voice of our small business community is heard. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate the gentlewoman from New York’s views and her helpful work on this legislation. We have lost over the last 20 years some 50 percent of our public companies. When I was getting out of college, one of the great dreams in business would be that you could have a company that was so successful that you could go public. Over the years, obviously that process has made it more and more difficult for our entrepreneurs to pursue their dream of a public company. So what better way to make sure their voice about our rules, our laws, the process of being public, and the process of registering and disclosing is all made in a way that does not discourage our entrepreneurs and our smallbusiness people from pursuing that dream of going public. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), my distinguished friend who serves on the House Financial Services Committee and is a gentleman who is a voice for small business at every meeting of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I appreciate it very much. I do want to thank the Congresswoman from New York and also Congressman JUAN VARGAS of California who stepped up as the lead cosponsor of this legislation. As Mr. HILLmentioned a moment ago, about twothirds of our new jobs in the last decade have been created by small business. This is the bloodline of our economy, and certainly in Maine, Mr. Speaker, where we are a State and a district of small businesses, this is very particular to my interest. Those of us who have run small businesses know that one of the biggest challenges you have is how to borrow money—access to capital—because unless you have access to capital and unless you have the funds you need to grow and expand, you can’t create new opportunities and new jobs for our kids and our grandkids. So access to capital is absolutely critical when it comes to growing our economy and providing more opportunities for the next generation. As has already been said today, the SEC holds these annual forums where smallbusiness leaders who are on the ground creating jobs and those in the public sector get together, and they review and explore new ways and better ways to change the regulations and the rules we have in this country such that access to capital is enhanced. What better idea; what more common sense do we need than to have a bill, H.R. 1312, that I am very proud to sponsor, that requires the SEC to assess every recommendation by this forum every year—not necessarily act upon it, but take it off the shelf, assess it, and determine if action should be taken. I want to thank all the folks who have participated in our forums over the years, both the public and the private sector, and I ask, Mr. Speaker, that all my colleagues in this House, Republicans and Democrats, please support H.R. 1312. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1312, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
U.S. TERRITORIES INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT OF 2017 Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1366) to amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 to terminate an exemption for companies located in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and any other possession of the United States. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1366 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Section 6(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a–6(a)) is amended by striking paragraph (1). (b) EFFECTIVE DATE AND SAFEHARBOR .— (1) EFFECTIVE DATE .—Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. (2) SAFE HARBOR .—With respect to a company that is exempt under section 6(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a–6(a)(1)) on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, the amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect on the date that is 3 years after the date of the enactment of this Act. (3) EXTENSION OF SAFE HARBOR .—The Securities and Exchange Commission, by rule and regulation upon its own motion, or by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally, under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a– 6(c)), further delay the effective date for a company described in paragraph (2) for a maximum of 3 years following the initial 3 year period if, before the end of the initial 3 year period, the Commission determines that such a rule, regulation, motion, or order is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today I rise in support of H.R. 1366, the U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act, and I thank my friend and colleague from New York for her exceptional efforts in designing and bringing this bill to us today. H.R. 1366 repeals a provision in the Investment Company Act of 1940 that exempts investment companies in Puerto Rico, Guam, and other U.S. territories from registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, so that they have to play by the same rules as their mainland counterparts. When Congress first enacted the Investment Company Act in the 1940s, a nonregistration exemption for investment companies in the noncontiguous territories made a lot of sense as it was extremely expensive and difficult for the SEC to send staff to travel to these territories and inspect the local companies. In fact, Mr. Speaker, back in the 1940s, Eastern Air Lines bragged of their 6hourand10minute service between New York and San Juan one way for $1,700 in today’s money. So, in fact, it was challenging to get to the territories. But with all the significant advances in technology and travel, these logistical barriers no longer exist. As such, this bill repeals this archaic exemption and provides a reasonable and safe harbor to allow those companies currently subject to the exemption to transition. Similar legislation passed the House in the last Congress by voice vote, and, earlier this year, H.R. 1366 passed the House Financial Services Committee by a unanimous vote. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1700 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1366, legislation that will close a loophole in our securities laws and better protect the investors and retirees of the U.S. territories. The Investment Company Act of 1940 governs investment companies, such as mutual funds, closedend funds, and ETFs. Its purpose is to protect investors and provide oversight of these companies. In doing so, it regulates various transactions among affiliates, sets leverage limits, outlines recordkeeping requirements, and describes how securities may be redeemed. These matters sound technical, but they provide fundamental protections to most U.S. investors. I say ‘‘most’’ because, due to a historical artifact, all funds located in and sold only to residents of U.S. territories are exempted. The reason is, in 1940, territories like Puerto Rico were considered to be too distant from Washington, D.C. Obviously, modern air travel makes that a nonissue today, as regulators routinely travel to Hawaii and Alaska to conduct oversight. In addition, many of these financial products are now traded electronically, truly eliminating the need to visit in person. The consequence of exemption falls squarely on the residents of U.S. territories. Investment companies can sell products to them without the important oversight, disclosure, and conflict ofinterest requirements to which mainland companies are subject. As a result, many investors and retirees have been subject to investment losses, some resulting from behavior that would have been prohibited if the 1940 act applied to the island’s investment companies. To address this matter, H.R. 1366, the U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act, applies the 1940 act to currently exempt investment companies that are located, organized in, and sold to residents of these territories. I would like to point out that this bill is identical to legislation that passed the House last Congress twice with overwhelming bipartisan support. In order to permit investment companies to comply with the legislation, it provides for a 3year compliance period, with an option, at the approval of the SEC, for an additional 3 years. This time period balances the need to bring the investor protections of the 1940 act to the territories with enough time for affected entities to fully understand and comply with the 1940 act. It is important to note that if investment companies need further relief from any specific requirement of the 1940 act, they are able to request such relief through the SEC under existing law. Earlier this year, past SEC Chair White testified that the exemption should be removed. I want to thank Congressman DUFFY  and Congressman MACARTHUR , two of my colleagues from the Puerto Rico Task Force, for cosponsoring this bill. I also want to thank Puerto Rico’s new Member of Congress, JENNIFFER  GONZA´LEZCOLO´N, for cosponsoring it as well; and Senators HATCH and M ENEN DEZ, who have put forward a companion bill in the Senate. All of this support means a great deal to me and to those investors on the island. Finally, I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member WATERS for working with me throughout the last 2 years in a highly productive manner. We met with stakeholders, heard their concerns, and fine tuned the bill. I am confident we developed an approach that would apply the 1940 act in a manner that is sensitive to investors and investment companies alike. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank my friend from New York for her leadership and her voice on behalf of Puerto Rico and the islands in this regard, and for her long public service and particular leadership in this time of important change in Puerto Rico. Recently, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to take an alltooquick trip to San Juan to assess the current economic conditions on the island. It was too brief in that it was less than a day, which seems completely unfair to any visitor to the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. I want to thank my host, our distinguished delegate from the Commonwealth, JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZCOLO´Nfor hosting me on that visit. I thank her for her cosponsorship on this bill and her leadership on the island here in Congress. We are grateful to have her as a new Member of this body. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N). 
Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act. I am a cosponsor of this bill, and I thank Representative VELA´ZQUEZ for introducing H.R. 1366 and the Members who have joined in supporting this important legislation. The U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act will close a loophole in the current law. By passing this bill, Congress will bring to Puerto Rico’s investors the same protections enjoyed by investors residing in the 50 States. Under current law, investment funds that are located and organized in the U.S. territories and sell to only residents of the territories are exempted from the Investment Company Act of 1940, which governs entities, such as mutual and exchangetraded funds. Because of this exemption, investment companies located in the U.S. territories can sell their products to territory residents while not being subjected to the oversight, disclosure, and conflictofinterest requirements that govern investment companies located in the States. As a result, investors residing in Puerto Rico and the other territories have experienced investment losses, some of which likely would have been prohibited had the 1940 act applied to the territories. For example, UBS operating in Puerto Rico served as an adviser to Puerto Rico’s Employees Retirement System and, in 2008, led the underwriting of a $2.9 billion bond issue for the government pension agency. UBS then placed $1.7 billion of those funds into UBS managed mutual funds that UBS then sold exclusively to customers on the island. This investment would have been forbidden by the Investment Company Act if these funds were sold in the States. The Puerto Rican investors holding these bonds have suffered massive losses and are claiming that UBS did not properly disclose the risks of these funds. On the island, hundreds of these customers have filed arbitration claims with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and seek more than $1.1 billion in damages. UBS continues to lose these cases for failing its fiduciary responsibilities. Today’s vote on H.R. 1366 will help end such outrageous investment abuse and gives Congress another opportunity to align the laws governing Puerto Rico and the other territories with the laws governing the 50 States. H.R. 1366 will remove the territories’ exemption and make the Investment Company Act of 1940 apply to companies that are located, organized in, and sell to residents of the territories. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 1366, the U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Closing the U.S. territories loophole in the Investment Company Act of 1940 will give millions of investors and retirees—mostly in Puerto Rico—the peace of mind that their hardearned money will receive the same level of protection afforded to those on the mainland. I want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, and all the cosponsors for their hard work in bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1366. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FOLLOW THE RULES ACT Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 657) to amend title 5, United States Code, to extend certain protections against prohibited personnel practices, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 657 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Follow the Rules Act’’. 
SEC. 2. PROHIBITED PERSONNEL ACTION BASED ON ORDERING INDIVIDUAL TO VIOLATE RULE OR REGULATION. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Subparagraph (D) of section 2302(b)(9) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting ‘‘, rule, or regulation’’ after ‘‘law’’. (b) TECHNICAL CORRECTION .—Such subparagraph is further amended by striking ‘‘for’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 657, the Follow the Rules Act, introduced by Congressman SEAN DUFFY of Wisconsin. Less than 1 month ago marked the 28th anniversary of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. That bill was a landmark accomplishment establishing enforcement mechanisms to protect those who help identify waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government. It also protects those who, in good conscience, refuse orders that could violate the law. Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered the case of Dr. Timothy Rainey. Dr. Rainey, an employee of the State Department, refused an order to violate the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Dr. Rainey’s supervisors subsequently took away his responsibilities as a contracting officer representative. He argued it was because of his refusal to obey the order. Thus, the Federal Circuit considered whether Federal managers can retaliate against employees who refuse to obey an order that would violate a government rule or regulation rather than a statute. Unfortunately, the Federal Circuit has a record of misinterpreting the law on whistleblowers. That is precisely what happened here. The court held such employees were not protected. Ironically, the court relied on a significant 2015 Supreme Court decision, DHS v. MacLean, which reaffirmed the protections of the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Federal Circuit’s decision puts Federal employees in an impossible situation. It forces them to choose between following their superior’s orders or following the agency’s rules or regulations. In many ways, an agency’s rules and regulations are the standing orders of the head of the agency. My colleague, Representative DUFFY , introduced the Follow the Rules Act to fix this problem. H.R. 657 makes clear that employees are protected from retaliation for disobeying orders that would violate an agency rule or regulation. Refusing to obey such orders is exactly the type of action for which Federal employees should be protected from retaliation. This legislation has bipartisan, bicameral support. It passed the House by voice vote near the end of the last Congress. b1715 I hope that this legislation will be signed into law this Congress and Federal employees will be protected in trying to do the right thing. I thank Representative DUFFY for his leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When we are going to pass a bill on a bipartisan basis, it might be useful to acknowledge the bill has a Democratic cosponsor. I am proud to be the lead cosponsor with Congressman DUFFY on the Follow the Rules Act—in fact, he asked me to play that role—and I rise 
clearly in strong support of the legislation which will protect, critically, whistleblowers who disclose waste, fraud, and abuse. I want to thank my colleague, Representative DUFFY , for working with me in a bipartisan way on this important bill. We initially introduced the bill together in the 114th Congress, and it passed the House without opposition. Unfortunately, the Senate did not act. Hopefully, this Congress we will be able to persuade the Senate to enact this important protection. This bill would clarify that, under the Whistleblower Protection Act, an employee who refuses to obey an order that would require the employee to violate a law, rule, or regulation is protected. Congressman DUFFY and I introduced the bill to address a misinterpretation of the Whistleblower Protection Act by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the case of Rainey v. MSPB in 2016, as my colleague from Kentucky suggested. In that case, a contracting officer, Dr. Timothy Rainey, was ordered by his supervisor to tell a contractor to rehire a terminated subcontractor. Dr. Rainey, in principle, refused because carrying out that order would have required him to violate the Federal Acquisition Regulation by improperly interfering with the contractor’s personnel decisions and requiring the contractor to act contrary to the terms of the contract. What reward did Dr. Rainey get for doing the right thing? He was stripped of his duties and given a negative performance rating. The Federal circuit, God knoweth how, held that an employee who refuses to obey an order is protected only if the order would violate a law, a statute, but not if the order would violate a rule or a regulation. Talk about looking at angels on the head of a pin. The court’s ruling was contrary, clearly, to the Whistleblower Protection Act and the intent of this Congress. In enacting the Whistleblower Protection Act, Congress clearly intended that protections granted to government employees who blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse be construed broadly. We clearly had in mind not only laws, but rules and regulations as well. Congress and the American people rely on whistleblowers to make government efficient, honest, and effective, and we in Congress want to support those people. As a member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rely on whistleblowers to help us with our oversight and reform work. Without them, rooting out mismanagement, abuse, and corruption would be very difficult. The underlying principle of the Whistleblower Protection Act is that employees should be protected from retaliation if they do the right thing, even if it means disobeying orders from their superiors. Given the Trump administration’s attacks on the Federal workforce, it is especially important now, more than ever, for this Congress to uphold whistleblower protections for all of our public servants. We cannot tolerate the issuance of gag orders to silence dissent, and we cannot permit the firing of agency employees who have differing political views from our own or who might object to administration actions. If the administration and my colleagues are serious about draining the swamp, we need to do all we can to ensure that Federal employees are allowed to perform their jobs free from political pressure to violate laws, rules, and regulations. Protecting whistleblowers has been and should continue to be a bipartisan—indeed, nonpartisan—issue and something on which we can find common ground. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this important bipartisan legislation. I am proud to cosponsor it with my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ). Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ). Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, those of us in this institution talk about we are a country of laws. However, over time, more and more of the statements that we have to live by are not laws. They are rules and regulations. Therefore, when the Whistleblower Protection Act was passed in 1989, I am not sure at the time whether it was intended to cover rules and regulations, but, as a practical matter, I think Federal employees will run into problems in which they are asked to disobey rules and regulations even more than statutory laws themselves. On June 7 of last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in Rainey v. Merit Systems Protection Board that, while laws were covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act, rules and regulations were not, at least if you weren’t a Federal employee. Why is it relevant that we have to make up for the problems caused by this decision? Dr. Timothy Rainey was a State Department employee who, while serving as a contracting officer in 2013, was ordered by his superior to violate the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Dr. Rainey refused and was subsequently removed from his duties. When Dr. Rainey invoked the right todisobey provision of the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Merit Systems Protection Board ruled the law only protected him from violating Federal laws, but such protections don’t apply to rules or regulations. Dr. Rainey appealed the case, and the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the Protection Board ruling and, in doing so, exposed a glaring inconsistency in the application of the act. What does this mean? Federal whistleblowers play an important role in exposing mismanagement, the rampant mismanagement at Federal agencies, and supporting the oversight work of Congress. Critical to them is the Whistleblower Protection Act which provides Federal workers with certain legal safeguards to disclose information that an employee reasonably believes evidences gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a violation of the law. This ruling will take away the protections when they stand up to bad actors in the Federal workforce. In effect, this ruling will give permission to supervisors in positions of authority to force Federal workers to violate the rules and regulations that Congress, through law, directs the agencies implement. Regardless of your opinion about certain rules, we should not leave, exposed, Federal workers who are just trying to follow the rules instead of obeying supervisors who want them to disobey the rules and regulations. The bipartisan Follow the Rules Act, which I am an original cosponsor of, will close this loophole created by the court’s ruling and ensure that Federal employees have protections for refusing to violate the rules and regulations in addition to the law. I ask support for this bill. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my friend from Wisconsin. I think he laid out the case very well. I think the ruling of the circuit court in many ways tells us about the perils of a very juridical view of what a statute is all about. To refuse to take into account context, history, legislative history, and congressional intent that is reflected often in the kind of debate we are having here on the floor I think is not in the spirit of trying to interpret the laws as Congress intends them. Sooner or later I think Congress is going to have to address this kind of fundamentalist, originalist approach to laws that I think is nonsensical and leads to this kind of cherrypicking about what it was Congress intended to protect. I agree with my friend from Wisconsin. I think this bill is necessary because we have to clarify the law, apparently, for the courts and protect people like Dr. Rainey. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 657, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 1242, the 400 Years of AfricanAmerican History Commission Act, introduced by Congressman BOBBY SCOTT of Virginia. H.R. 1242 establishes a historical commission commemorating the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Africans in Virginia in 1619. The bill creates a commission to plan programs and activities in 2019 to recognize the arrival, influence, and historical importance of Africans in America. Congress has previously established similar commissions to celebrate historical anniversaries. For example, there was a commission on the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, Virginia, and the 450th anniversary of the founding of St. Augustine, Florida. As we reach the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Africans in Virginia, establishing this commission allows for the opportunity to acknowledge the horrible impact slavery has had in America. This is an opportunity to commemorate the resilience and contributions of African Americans in our country. While that chapter in our history is a painful one, this is a story that must be told to acknowledge how profoundly unrecognizable our Nation would be without the contribution of African Americans. The commission will work with State and local groups to coordinate the commemoration and public education. The commission will be funded by private donations, not taxpayer dollars, and will terminate shortly after the anniversary activities conclude. The bill authorizes the commission to provide grants to further the historical and cultural activities carried out in commemoration of the anniversary. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved this bill on March 28, 2017. I thank Congressman SCOTT for his leadership on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1242, the 400 Years of AfricanAmerican History Commission Act, introduced by my friend and colleague from Virginia, BOBBY SCOTT. Senator T IMKAINE of Virginia has introduced a companion bill in the Senate. In the 400 years since the first Africans arrived at Point Comfort, Virginia, African Americans have made an indelible contribution to our Nation. They have been pioneers in the arts and sciences. They have led the charge for civil rights and spoken out against injustice against anybody. They have also ascended to the highest level of politics, athletics, and business, and sacrificed for our country in every military engagement from the American Revolution to the presentday fight against terrorism. African Americans have played a crucial role in the establishment and evolution of our Nation: Crispus Attucks, a Black man, became the first casualty of the American Revolution in my hometown of Boston when he confronted British soldiers in what became known as the Boston Massacre. James Armistead, a slave who fed false information to the British, helped the Patriots’ cause to secure victory in the Battle of Yorktown. Abolitionists, from Sojourner Truth to Frederick Douglass to Harriet Tubman spoke out against slavery and fought to realize the meaning of Thomas Jefferson’s founding creed that all men are created equal. And African Americans helped our country awaken its collective consciousness during the epochal civil rights movement, with the courageous actions of so many from Rosa Parks in the Montgomery bus boycott to the persevering spirit of our colleague JOHN LEWIS and the Freedom Riders, and the bold vision, of course, of Martin Luther King, Jr., that ‘‘injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere.’’ The bill before us today would recognize those accomplishments while acknowledging the sorry, tragic history of slavery in America and the subsequent era of discrimination and economic deprivation after the Civil War. H.R. 1242 would establish a commission charged with celebrating the rich history of African Americans in the United States. Along with States, community groups, and nonprofit organizations, the commission would plan and execute anniversary activities throughout the Nation and encourage the publication and distribution of scholarly research on AfricanAmerican history. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1242. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1730 Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on this side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 17
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), my friend and the author of this bill. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1242, the 400 Years of AfricanAmerican History Commission Act, which was introduced earlier this year by Senators TIM KAINE, MARKWARNER , ROYBLUNT , and CORYBOOKER . I was proud to introduce the House version, which has the support of Representatives TAYLOR , RICHMOND , W ITTMAN , B EYER , M CEACHIN , LEWIS, COMSTOCK , CONNOLLY , GRIFFITH , GOODLATTE , and many others. I would like to thank Chairman CHAFFETZ , Ranking Member C UMMINGS , Mr. COMER , and Mr. C ONNOLLY for their assistance in bringing the bill to the floor today. This bill would establish a commission to begin the planning of programs 
and activities across our Nation to recognize the contributions of African Americans since their first arrival as African slaves in the English colonies at Point Comfort, Virginia, in 1619, almost 400 years ago. Slavery was an abhorrent institution, but the history of Virginia and our Nation cannot be fully understood without first recognizing the role played by the slave trade. This institution was the foundation of the colonial and early American agricultural system. The 20 slaves who arrived at Point Comfort in Hampton, Virginia, in 1619 were the first on record to be forcibly settled as involuntary laborers in the English colonies. This bill will establish a commission to recognize and highlight the resilience and contributions of African Americans since 1619. From enduring slavery to fighting in the Civil War, to working against the oppressive Jim Crow laws, to struggling through the civil rights movement, the rich history of African Americans in the United States and their contributions to our Nation began hundreds of years ago. Obviously, this history does not end there. The commission established by this bill will be charged with the important task of planning, developing, and implementing a series of programs and activities throughout 2019 to tell the full story of African Americans over the last 400 years. This 15member commission will include historical experts instead of politicians. Therefore, the true legacy of African Americans will be truthfully told. It would be a great disservice not only to African Americans, but to all Americans, if we fail to appropriately recognize this important milestone in our Nation’s history. Mr. Speaker, I again thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee, Mr. COMER and Mr. C ONNOLLY , for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend BOBBY SCOTT for his leadership. This is an incredible service, not only to my Commonwealth of Virginia and his, but, frankly, to all Americans. This isn’t just an issue for African Americans or some subgroup. All of us are formed from our history, as we know from the popularity of the opening of the new AfricanAmerican museum here in Washington, which is an incredible contribution, I think, to our Nation’s culture and our discussion. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1242, ‘‘400 Years of African American History Commission Act’’, which establishes the 400 Years of AfricanAmerican History Commission to develop and carry out activities throughout the United States to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Africans in the English colonies at Point Comfort, Virginia, in 1619. Through this bill, the commission must: 1. Plan programs to acknowledge the impact that slavery and laws that enforced racial discrimination had on the United States; 2. Encourage civic, patriotic, historical, educational, artistic, religious, and economic organizations to organize and participate in anniversary activities; 3. Assist states, localities, and nonprofit organizations to further the commemoration; and 4. Coordinate for the public scholarly research on the arrival of Africans in the United States and their contributions to this country. The commission may provide: 1. Grants to communities and nonprofit organizations for the development of programs; 2. Grants to research and scholarly organizations to research, publish, or distribute information relating to the arrival of Africans in the United States; and 3. Technical assistance to states, localities, and nonprofit organizations to further the commemoration. The commission must prepare a strategic plan and submit a final report to Congress that contains a summary of its activities, an accounting of its received and expended funds, and its recommendations. The commission would submit a final report to the Congress and terminate on July 1, 2020. H.R. 1242 would authorize the appropriation of the necessary amounts for those purposes. The commission would consist of 15 members who would serve without pay but would be reimbursed for travel expenses. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1242 would not increase net direct spending or on budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10year periods beginning in 2028. Enacting H.R. 1242 would not affect revenues. H.R. 1242 contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. August of 2019 will mark 400 years since the first documented arrival of Africans who came to English America by way of Point Comfort, Va. Not only is it appropriate to establish a commission that would recognize the contributions of African Americans, but it is historically significant to acknowledge that the ‘‘20 and odd’’ Africans (as it was recorded) were the first recorded group of Africans to be sold as involuntary laborers or indentured servants in the English colonies. The commission would be charged with highlighting the resilience and contributions of African Americans, as well as acknowledging the painful impact that slavery and other atrocities have had on our nation. African Americans have contributed to the economic, academic, social, cultural and moral wellbeing of this nation. Could we claim America as the most innovative nation on earth without the invention of the modern traffic light, the perfection of the carbon filament or the use of the mathematics that propelled Apollo astronauts to the moon? AfricanAmerican culture is American culture, and AfricanAmerican discoveries are American discoveries. Without the accomplishments of African Americans, the United States could not boast the ingenuity and cultural richness that we cherish. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1242, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 6:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 5 o’clock and 33 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HOLDING ) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m.

b1911 So (twothirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, May 1, I was delayed in my travels back to Washington due to a delayed flight. If I had been present, I would have voted: ‘‘Yea,’’ on rollcall 237, passage of H.R. 910— Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 
2017; ‘‘Yea,’’ on rollcall 238, passage of H.R. 1312—Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act; and ‘‘Yea,’’ on rollcall 239, passage of H.R. 657—Follow the Rules Act. 
RECOGNIZING MEG DALY (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Meg Daly, who is the founder of The Underline, a wonderful 10mile linear park and urban trail in my congressional district that will serve to connect hundreds of Americans across MiamiDade County through safe, alternative methods of transportation. In 2013, Meg had an unfortunate accident that broke both of her arms. Since she couldn’t drive herself to attend physical therapy, she took the Metrorail near her home and walked underneath the train tracks to reach her destination. That is when Meg took notice of the underutilized land right below the Metrorail and envisioned its transformative potential for community mobility, positive economic impact, and enhanced quality of life. The Underline counts with overwhelming support across MiamiDade, providing for a safe and healthy space for our community members to express themselves. From free yoga classes to artistic festivals to projects to restore Miami’s urban green space, each day The Underline is getting closer to becoming what Meg has envisioned. Congratulations to one of our community’s leaders, Meg Daly. 
b1915 DISABILITY DISCHARGE OF PARENT PLUS LOANS (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, today I introduced the PLUS Loan Disability Forgiveness Act, a bill to relieve the burden of student loan debt on parents whose children become permanently disabled. While most student loans are forgiven if a student becomes totally and permanently disabled, parent PLUS loans are not. It is simply wrong that a parent struggling with a child’s disability is not afforded the same loan forgiveness as other borrowers. My bill would extend disability discharge to parent PLUS loans. It would allow families to focus on healing, not servicing debt. It would help lighten the $1.4 trillion owed by student borrowers and their families. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these parents, who are just trying to help their children succeed. MODERN DAY SLAVERY IN LIBYA (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, after the United States toppled the Government of Libya, the nation became a failed state, one that is a brothel of slavery. Fleeing persecution from terrorists and vast famine, west Africans hand their life savings over to drivers who will take them to Niger, then off to Europe. But these refugees are labor trafficked as slaves to Libya instead. They are bound to the slave block and sold at the auction of slavery. The slave drivers force them to work inside private prisons for little or no food. Meanwhile, the slave masters demand ransoms from the families. If the families don’t pay the ransom, the refugees are sold again to larger prisons and the demand doubles. If the ransom is never paid, the slaves are eventually murdered. Mr. Speaker, human slavery still exists in north Africa, and it is a scourge on humanity. But the United States should be very careful about taking out a regime like it did in Libya without understanding the longterm consequences like what happened in Libya. And that is just the way it is. f 
PRESIDENT OBAMA’S LEGACY (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, one of the most important parts of President Obama’s legacy is the recognition that Americans should not be discriminated against based on preexisting conditions. This principle was enshrined in law by the Affordable Care Act, and now millions of Americans across the political spectrum support these vital protections. Even yesterday, President Trump, an avowed opponent of the Affordable Care Act, stated unequivocally that he was opposed to discrimination based on preexisting conditions. The bill under consideration by this House, the American Health Care Act, does not represent that same bipartisan principle. My colleagues are advancing a measure that would let States turn back the clock for millions of Americans and begin that discrimination again. Today, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill for the sake of all those it would harm. For the sake of anyone who has survived cancer, battled diabetes, or was simply born a woman, I urge you, vote ‘‘no.’’ 
NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOL WEEK (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Charter Schools Week and the 25th anniversary of the opening of the very first charter school. With nearly 3 million students attending public charter schools across the country, 43 States, and the District of Columbia, it is the fastest growing choice option in public education. Minnesota is a leader in developing new innovative ways to educate our students and was the very first State to allow charter schools. Today, Minnesota has 164 charter schools that serve about 57,000 students in kindergarten through the 12th grade. Our State usually ranks among the top in having charter school friendly laws and developing high quality and independent charter school options. As cochair of the Charter School Caucus, I believe it is important that we do continue to create and develop this educational option. America will continue to lead the world in innovation and ideas if our students receive the best education possible from early childhood all the way through graduate school, and that means ensuring a child’s ZIP Code does not determine the outcome of their education and the quality of their education. f 
TELL ME IT ISN’T SO (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, a few of us were at the United Nations this morning and this afternoon, and what we heard most was the importance of empowering women in developing countries who have experienced violence, sexual violence. Tell me it isn’t so that the President of the United States has discontinued Let Girls Learn, fostered and supported by Mrs. Obama, which is an important key element of the Peace Corps, which is attempting to help these girls learn and empower them. Tell me it isn’t so that the President of the United States, not recognizing the Constitution and freedom of speech, is trying to expand or change the libel laws that if you don’t like what they say about you as a politician, you can undermine and you can charge First Amendment privilege, First Amendment press, and others with a violation of those laws. Tell me it isn’t so that America is going back on her values and her commitment to helping people around the world, particularly vulnerable women and children, and, of course, denigrating the First Amendment and the freedom of the press. Tell me it isn’t so. 
FLEXIBILITY FOR WORKERS (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1180, the 
Working Families Flexibility Act, introduced by my friend, the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY). The House will be considering the bill later this week to give private sector employees the same flexibility offered to many local, State, and Federal Government workers that have had it for many years now. The legislation will give employees the option of choosing to receive compensatory time off from their employers instead of overtime wages. It does not change the 40hour workweek, and it does not weaken employee protections. We are simply giving American workers more choice. The bill does not allow for employees to coerce anyone into choosing one option over another. It would be a voluntary decision made between the employer and the employee. Everyone needs flexibility in their schedule to balance between work and personal time, and we should be giving American workers the option to choose what is most important to them: overtime wages or time off. It should be their decision, not the government’s. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S BROKEN PROMISES (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, add job creation and infrastructure to the list of President Trump’s broken promises. After 102 days in office, the socalled ‘‘greatest jobs President that God ever created’’ has failed to present a single job or infrastructure bill. At the same time, his slashandburn budget would cut investments in job growth and infrastructure, imposing a $2.4 billion cut on the U.S. Department of Transportation. Included in those cuts are drastic reductions of the Federal support for Amtrak and the outright elimination of the TIGER grant program. The President’s budget proposal also phases out the New Starts grant program, making critical infrastructure projects, including New Jersey and New York’s Gateway Program ineligible for Federal funding needed to move forward. As I speak, New Jersey rail commuters are probably facing massive delays and disruptions to their already nightmarish commute. President Trump’s proposed cuts to vital Federal infrastructure programs will only make the problem worse. It has been an ugly 102 days for President Trump, and, unless he tackles jobs and infrastructure, as promised, it is going to get uglier. 
HONORING MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on May 1 to recognize Silver Star Service Banner Day. Today is a day when we honor the service and sacrifice of our Active Duty men and women from all branches of the service from all wars. Silver Star Service Banner Day started in 2007 and is sponsored by the Silver Star Families of America, which is dedicated to supporting and assisting wounded, ill, injured, and dying Active Duty veterans and their families. May is also National Military Appreciation Month. All month long, we have the opportunity to honor, remember, recognize, and appreciate those who serve and have served. Our military men and women continue to play a major role in the development of our country documented through a history of uncompromising honor, dedication to duty, and genuine love of country. Personally, I am a proud military dad, as my son Logan continues to serve in the United States Army and my daughterinlaw, Carley, is now a veteran. Mr. Speaker, we are the home of the free because of the brave, and I want to thank all who serve this great Nation. Mr. Speaker, only two individuals have ever offered to willingly die for you. One was Jesus Christ and the other was the American soldier. One died for your soul, the other died for your freedom. f 
THANK YOU TO CONGRESSWOMAN ROSLEHTINEN (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as the senior woman in the U.S. House, I wanted to say thank you to Congresswoman ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , the senior Republican woman in the House, and to say with poignance I received her decision recently to retire from our beloved House. ILEANA has been the first Cuban American elected to Congress, the first Latina elected to Congress, and the first Republican woman from Florida to be elected to Congress. She ably chaired the Committee on Foreign Affairs during her tenure, and there were many sessions when new Speakers were sworn in when she and I tabulated the results of that very important election. I can remember when her children were born. I can always say she handled her service with great distinction, with great honor, with great humor, and she made friends on both sides of the aisle. I am glad that she is staying through the remainder of this session, but I must say that this House will lose a spark of brilliance and of wit when she chooses to leave us. I will also say that it has been a particular joy to serve with her because no matter what the issue, no matter what the time of year, no matter what the hour of day, she always approached her position with great professionalism. I regret her leaving, but I know her service has made a difference. For women across America, since she first arrived in 1989, our numbers have quintupled. We now have over 100 women who serve in this House with distinction, and she has helped blaze that path. Mr. Speaker, I reserve my opportunity to say more about her in the days ahead. f 
b1930 ELECTRIC RELIABILITY AND FOREST PROTECTION (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, with all of the wildfires we have in the West each year in the summer and the fall, did you know that if a utility has a rightofway through Federal forests, through the Forest Service, it can still take months for these utilities to receive Forest Service approval to remove trees from transmission line rightsofway even if the trees are already in contact with electric transmission lines? We have had blackouts for large portions of several States that have happened from this; and the power lines, when they contact a tree, can start more wildfires even. Yet, still it takes months sometimes to get the Forest Service to approve the utilities to go out there and do a commonsense removal of these trees and other material. Well, we have a remedy that passed last week in the Natural Resources Committee. Working with my colleague, Representative KURTSCHRADER  from Oregon, we passed H.R. 1873 through committee to streamline the red tape to have preapproval for utilities to be able to do the necessary and commonsense work through these already existing transmission rightsof way through our forests, preventing fire, preventing blackouts, and just good common sense. 
GI INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to highlight H.R. 758, the GI Internship Program Act. I am a cosponsor of this important legislation with my colleague from Illinois, BRAD SCHNEIDER . If implemented, this bill would expand the use of the existing post9/11 GI Bill benefits to include internships as an option in place of a traditional degree program. The GI Internship Program Act would allow veterans to gain practical skills and work experience to help ease 
their transition back into the civilian workforce. Under current law, the post 9/11 GI Bill only allocates money to veterans for traditional postsecondary education in the classroom, but for many veterans this is a path not meant for them. For example, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over 300,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs at the end of 2016. This gap could be filled by the veterans who use their post9/11 GI benefits as a stipend to support them while receiving onthe job training as highskilled technical workers. Further, these jobs can be filled at no additional cost to the employer because the cost would be covered by the preexisting GI Bill. This bill would allow businesses all over the U.S., both large and small, to meet their employment needs and help our skilled veterans to enter the civilian workforce. As long as employers comply with the program and intend to hire the veterans after the internship is over, the veterans will continue to receive funding. This bill is a win for American job growth and, most importantly, a win for our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure. 
JOB FLEXIBILITY FOR WORKING FAMILIES The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RUTHERFORD ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act. I would love to take credit for this idea. It is not my own. It is a bill that has been carried by other Members on several occasions. I have had the privilege to carry this bill the last few Congresses, and I am excited that we are going to debate this bill tomorrow and, God willing, have a vote on it. The Working Families Flexibility Act is a simple amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Fair Labor Standards Act has been the law of the land since 1938. In 1985, the Fair Labor Standards Act was amended to allow compensatory time. That is paid time off in lieu of cash wages for overtime for public sector employees. But, oddly enough, private sector employees were left out of the equation. This bill, H.R. 1180, simply provides that the private sector can have access to compensatory time in lieu of cash wages for overtime. This doesn’t eliminate overtime, but, rather, gives flexibility in the workplace for hardworking Americans to make a decision about how to use their time. Every time an hourly wage employee works an hour of overtime, they would be eligible for an hour and a half of paid leave only if the employer first offers this as a benefit, but, most importantly, that the employee elects voluntarily to choose compensatory time over cash payments for overtime. Congress cannot legislate another hour in the day, but what we can do is provide flexibility for hardworking moms and dads all over this country that may want to use their accrued overtime to coach a soccer game, help with an aging parent, take their child to the pediatrician, or, quite frankly, accrue the time to go on a mission trip somewhere. But this is an opportunity for us to provide this benefit for employees all over this country, like I said, hardworking men and women that just want flexibility. It is voluntary. It must be done through a written agreement between the employer and the employee. But, most importantly, outside of being voluntary, the employee can opt out at any time. The employee can cash out, so to speak. There are cashout provisions in this bill. So if the arrangement between the employer and the employee is not working out, meaning the employee can’t find the appropriate time to utilize the compensatory time, the employee can say: Do you know what? I would rather have my cash payments for overtime. And within 30 days the employer must provide those cash payments that that employee has rightfully earned. I just think this is a great opportunity for us to provide this benefit to so many folks out there who are just trying to balance their life and work, their children, their parents, and all of the things that come with that. As a working mom, I certainly can relate to all of the pushes and pulls that parents have on them in wanting to just provide for their family. Again, at the end of the day, this time belongs to that individual, therefore, he or she ought to be able to make a decision about how to use their time. I have several Members who are here tonight that are going to speak on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ). I thank her so much for her willingness to speak on this issue. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for yielding, my good friend, MARTHA  ROBY, who has been such a leader on this issue. It has been my great privilege to be a sponsor of the Working Families Flexibility Act in the 113th Congress, in the 114th Congress, and now again in the 115th Congress. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017, which will remove a Federal restriction on private sector employees who would like the option of comp time compensation in lieu of cash for their overtime work, the same as public sector employees. Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a voluntary choice made by employees for cash overtime or for comp time. The last thing our Federal Government should be doing is dictating how our smallbusiness employees and entrepreneur compensation operates. Mr. Speaker, in November, Missourians and many Americans spoke loud and clear: it is time to get government out of the pocketbooks and off of the backs of hardworking Americans. Americans are also desperate for job flexibility. I know I was also as a working mom when I worked at Ralston Purina in St. Louis, Missouri. They want to have a better balance of obligations of their daytoday jobs while taking care of family and family matters. The Working Families Flexibility Act will help us do just that. For the past 30 years, public sector employees have enjoyed the benefit of choosing voluntary paid time off, or comp time, instead of cash wages as compensation for working overtime hours. Private sector workers, who make up an incredibly large portion of our economy, should also reap this benefit. It is simply common sense. Amending this overtime restriction through this legislation will help bring our workforce standards into the 21st century and allow our workers to do their jobs while still providing them with the voluntary flexibility to raise a family, pursue a college degree, care for aging parents, or tend to the day today obligations that come their way. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Working Families Flexibility Act, as it safeguards workers’ time and wages, and protects their use of the comp time they have earned. Most importantly, as we work each day to get our economy back on track, this legislation empowers the American worker with more options and flexibility that will ultimately lead to a better quality of life. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for taking the time to speak on this bill. I appreciate her willingness to speak on behalf of the Working Families Flexibility Act. In doing so, she is speaking on behalf of so many hardworking American families. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure. And I must say, since we do have time, that her being a champion of this in the last three Congresses that I have had the pleasure of working—and my constituents in Missouri’s Second District have sent me—it is wonderful to see a working mom like her, who is juggling all of those dayto day needs, to stand up for private sector workers who deserve the same kinds of options and flexibility that our public service has enjoyed for some 30 years. So I thank her for being a 
champion in this way. She is a wonderful legislator and a wonderful mother, too. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), our majority leader. During my time in Congress, I don’t know anyone who has been a stronger champion for finding ways to help families using conservative, commonsense ideas. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman MARTHAROBYis an amazing woman. She is a Congresswoman, she is an attorney, she is a wife, but, most importantly, she is a mother to two beautiful children. She has the same concerns and the same challenges that everybody else across this country has: Does she have enough time? Does she have the flexibility? Just going through her own life, listening to her constituents, she came forth with this bill. She has worked hard to bring the Working Families Flexibility Act to this floor. She has done it before, and it passed in this House. One of the things I admire most about her is she does not give up. Because it is not about her; it is about the rest of America, and it is also about fairness. In 1978, Congress granted this choice to government employees. Twentynine years later, it is past time we end the double standard and offer the same deals to workers in the private sector. You can work and work overtime, but then you have the choice if you want to take that in pay, or would you like to have comp time? Maybe there is a child sick, or maybe you have a family member that comes down with a disease, or another choice. You can go and spend time. You get to direct it. I think that is great policy. That is why government workers have it. But why can’t they have the same standards in the private sector? Do you know what would happen? Higher productivity. It would actually move America’s economy. Why? Because the individual has choice. Instead of being concerned and worried about something that is happening away that you need to be at, you put that time in. And instead of taking the money, you put it into flexibility. b1945 When we look at the future and think about the economy we want to have, yes, we want great employees; we want happy employees; we want employees with great productivity. But we don’t want that just to happen in government. We want the private sector to have the same fairness that government has. It is a great idea. But I will tell you, the work that Congresswoman MARTHA  ROBYhas done has led this charge. It has passed this House before, and we are going to find time in a very busy week to have the flexibility to do this bill tomorrow because you know what? The rest of America is waiting for it. I want to congratulate Congresswoman ROBYfor her work on it, for not giving up, for listening to constituents across this country, but also for every working family in the private sector to let them have a choice to have the flexibility to be where they need to be after they put the overtime in. It is only fair, and, to me, it is the American way to solve a problem. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader for bringing this bill to the floor and giving it the recognition and the time that it deserves. I appreciate the leader taking his time to be here and speak on behalf of the Working Families Flexibility Act. I would like to turn now to my friend and my colleague, also from Missouri (VICKY HARTZLER ). I just want to point out, though, as I move to her comments, we have to recognize that the workforce has changed. More than 70 percent of mothers today work outside of the home, and the gentlewoman here is certainly one of those who understands that as she has worked so hard and now Tiffany is about to graduate from high school. It seems like yesterday that we were bringing our babies to the floor together. But 70 percent of mothers today work outside of the home. Fifty years ago, that number was less than 30 percent. So the workforce has changed tremendously, but our policies have not kept up with that change. I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ). Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. I appreciate the gentlewoman championing this issue, and we have brought our kids here and know the challenges of juggling work and family—and we are not alone. As you said, many, many families in this country are facing these same challenges, and that is why I am so excited about your bill and so proud to sponsor it and stand with you tonight. The family is really the foundation of our country, and to have strong families, we need to be able to make ways to encourage them to be together, especially for those special, special events. I know there are many, many moms and dads out there working today who would love to be able to have the flexibility of the workplace where they can take off and spend some time with their kids at the soccer game, or when they get that phone call from the school that their child is sick, please come pick them up, to be able to have that flexibility to do that and to take them to the doctor or to stay home with them if they are sick. Then, as families age, many families need to be with their parent or need to go to the doctor with them. These are just commonsense things to allow that flexibility where you could work some overtime and choose, instead of having the extra money, you could choose to be able to use that to spend time with your family, those people that mean the most to you. That is just precious. It is priceless to be able to do that. And it is really sad now that, in our country, only half of the American workers have this option, and they are workers who work for the government. But yet, if you work for that small business in town or that manufacturer making a product and shipping it overseas, proud, made in U.S.A., sorry. Our government right now says, the Fair Labor Standards Act says, you don’t get that option, but if you work for the Federal Government then you would, and that is just not fair. So I applaud you for drafting this bill so that every American family would have the option to be able to spend time with those people that mean the most to them. It is just common sense. The time has well passed for us to pass this. I just commend you for putting this forth again. I am very excited about this bill, proud to stand alongside you and look forward to what I believe should be—should be—a unanimous vote tomorrow because this is such a great bill. So thank you so much for allowing me to come down and to share my support, and the people of the Fourth District of Missouri would just love to have this. Keep up the great work. We will look forward to bringing this across the finish line. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman and all of her comments and her support as a working mom who understands all of the pushes and pulls that so many American families face. I want to spend a little bit of time, while I have the opportunity, to talk about some of the myths about the Working Families Flexibility Act. There is so much misinformation, false information that is out there about this bill. Trust me, we are on social media responding to the information that is being put out there that is incorrect because we want to make sure people understand. This bill is not intended to hurt people. It is intended to help people and offer a muchneeded benefit to provide people flexibility in the workforce. The first myth I want to address is that this will result in employees working longer hours for less pay. The fact is that the Working Families Flexibility Act safeguards workers’ time and wages. Receiving paid time off or compensatory time for working overtime hours under this bill is completely voluntary. An employee who prefers to receive cash payments for overtime hours worked is always free to do so. Employers and employees are required to complete a written comp time agreement, a voluntary written agreement, and an employee can withdraw from this agreement at any time and receive cash wages for accrued comp time. 
Comp time is accrued at the same rate as overtime cash wages, so employees who work more than the 40 hour week will accrue paid time off at a rate time and a half for the overtime hours worked. Workers can cash out— meaning, say ‘‘I want the money instead of the time’’—whenever they choose, and employers are required to provide those cash wages that that employee has accrued within 30 days of receiving that employee’s request. Another myth is that the Working Families Flexibility Act will allow employers to control when workers use their comp time. The fact is that the Working Families Flexibility Act protects employees’ use of the compensatory time that they have earned. The Working Families Flexibility Act allows workers to use their comp time whenever they choose as long as they provide reasonable notice and the leave is not overly disruptive. The unduly disrupt provision included in H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act, is the same standard used today for public employees who are using this benefit to receive comp time, and this has worked for over 30 years. As my colleagues have already stated, this is a matter of fairness. If it is good enough for government employees, it should be good enough for private sector employees as well. All existing labor enforcement remedies, including action by the Department of Labor, are available if a worker believes he or she has been unfairly treated. I can’t put enough emphasis on this, that the anticoercion, the anti intimidation provisions that are currently a part of the law, of course, apply to the Working Families Flexibility Act. And it even promotes greater workplace flexibility while protecting the needs of the employer, but the employee is very protected from that type of behavior and coercion by the employer. I have some other myths and facts that I am going to go over, but I see that the chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee has joined us. I really appreciate the gentlewoman, the chairwoman, and all the work that she has done to support the working Families Flexibility Act. I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX). Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman ROBYfor leading this Special Order, but a special thanks to you for introducing H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017. Everyone in the private sector, men and women, are grateful to you for doing this. I may repeat some of the things that some of my colleagues have already said, but, Mr. Speaker, they bear repeating. This proposal, this bill, is about freedom, flexibility, and fairness. Workers, not the Federal Government, should have the freedom to choose what is best for them and their families. Hardworking men and women need more flexibility to balance work, life, and family, and there should be fair workforce policies that don’t put private sector employees at a disadvantage to those in the public sector. Across the country, there are moms and dads who wish they had more flexibility to make their child’s baseball game or dance recital, students who can’t find enough time to study for college finals while working full time, and individuals who are struggling to care for an aging relative. There are many workers who want flexible work arrangements instead of rigid 9 to 5 schedules so they can attend to their personal needs. This bill will improve the quality of life of many Americans by offering workers eligible for overtime pay a choice between paid time off and cash wages. Outdated Federal labor rules currently prohibit private sector workers from exercising this choice. More than 30 years ago, Republicans and Democrats amended the law to give public sector workers the option of comp time. This was a positive step, but it created double standards. It is time to ease this double standard by leveling the playing field between private sector employees and government workers when it comes to workplace flexibility. That is exactly what this bill does. It is a commonsense idea that should receive the support of workers on both sides of the aisle. As my colleague from Alabama said, the decision to choose comp time is completely voluntary and requires a written agreement between the worker and employer. Those who want to continue receiving cash wages as overtime pay are always free to do so. It also explicitly prohibits employers from coercing workers into electing comp time. Mr. Speaker, this bill is, again, about fairness, and it is so difficult for me to understand how Democrats would be opposed to that. We should have the same rules in the private sector as we do in the public sector. I think that Democrats have run out of excuses not to provide workers this choice. All we are doing here is giving a choice. No one, Republican nor Democrat, should think they know what is best for individual workers and their families. Mr. Speaker, when we vote on this bill this week, I hope all of our colleagues will come to their senses and see that they are discriminating against the private sector by denying them the opportunity to take their overtime as comp time and that they will vote with us. Again, I thank my colleague from Alabama for her leadership on this Special Order, but particularly her willingness to introduce this bill and take the lead in promoting it. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, and again, I appreciate her leadership for moving this bill through committee and for getting it ready through the Rules Committee so that we can be here on the floor tomorrow. Again, I appreciate her leadership on this and many, many other issues that she does on a daily basis to fight for Americans, in this case, Americans that are subject to the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act that would benefit from this amendment in the private sector. b2000 I want to go back. I have two more myths that I would like to address. Here is the myth: the Working Families Flexibility Act will allow employers to force workers to take comp time instead of cash payments for overtime. The fact is that the Working Families Flexibility Act prohibits worker coercion. The decision to use compensatory time is completely voluntary. An employee who prefers to receive cash payments for overtime hours worked is always free to do that. It explicitly prohibits an employer from directly or indirectly intimidating, threatening, or coercing; or attempting to intimidate, threaten, or coerce an employee into taking or not taking compensatory time. An employer who violates these anticoercion provisions will be liable to the affected employee for double damages which includes both the amount of the comp time and an equal amount in cash wages. In addition to new provisions prohibiting coercion, H.R. 1180 ensures all existing enforcement remedies, including action by the Department of Labor, and are available to workers if an employer fails to pay cash wages for the overtime hours worked. Myth: this bill is unnecessary because current law already allows for workplace flexibility. The fact is that the Working Families Flexibility Act empowers workers with more options. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, private sector employees may only use paid time off during the same paid period in which it is accrued. Paid time off cannot be saved by the employee for future use outside of that pay period. The law currently allows public sector employees to accrue comp time to be used at their discretion so long as reasonable notice is given and the leave does not unduly disrupt the workplace. My amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Working Families Flexibility Act, H.R. 1180, provides private sector employees with comp time benefits similar to what is already available in the public sector. Here is how it works: an hourly wage employee would be able to voluntarily enter into an agreement with their employer to put all of some of their accrued overtime towards paid time off instead of cash wages. A working dad could use the timeandahalf overtime he has earned to take a paid hour and a half off of work. No employee, again, could ever be forced to take the paid 
time off, just like no business would be forced to offer this benefit. Upon introducing this bill 4 years ago, I heard from a very special lady named Karen DeLoach. She worked as a bookkeeper in an accounting firm of my hometown, Montgomery, Alabama. Like most in her line of work, Karen would put in many hours during the busy season and build up a lot of overtime. Karen once approached her boss and said: Well, can I accrue my overtime to use as paid leave rather than taking the cash payments? Because, see, Karen gave her time to serve on a mission trip in Nicaragua every summer, and she wanted to do so and go on her church’s mission trip without interrupting her regular paycheck. Montgomery, Alabama, is the State capital, and Karen had heard her State employee friends talk about how they swapped their overtime pay for comp time in their jobs. She never imagined that a similar arrangement at the private business at which she worked would be against the law, but that is what her boss informed her. He wanted to give it to her, but he couldn’t under the law. To his credit, he wanted to offer it to her, but he wasn’t about to break the law. Karen’s story isn’t unique. As I have already referenced, just think of all the parents in this country with young kids or caring for elderly parents or a military family with one or both of the parents deployed or about to deploy. They need time to get ready to take care of their responsibilities. So the Working Families Flexibility Act is not going to end or solve the debt crisis or fix ObamaCare or simplify the Tax Code. I am proud of our ongoing efforts here in Congress to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to put forth a tax policy that is fair, flatter, and simpler, and to continue to cut out wasteful spending. This bill doesn’t solve those problems. But the fact that we can’t solve those problems overnight shouldn’t stop us here in the House of Representatives from doing what we can do right now to help make life a little easier for working moms and dads. That is what the Working Families Flexibility Act does, helping Americans better balance the demands of family and work. I want to thank all those Members who have come here to the floor tonight to speak on this bill. As a working mom myself, I certainly understand all too well how challenging it can be to balance our responsibilities. Again, I have sponsored this bill this Congress, of course, and the past two before that. I have heard criticism from labor unions and their allies saying that this bill is somehow antiunion or antiworker. This is just simply untrue. Of course, many in Big Labor will reflexively attack any proposal that would change a single word of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Ironically here, labor unions, see, they oppose this, but they themselves can and often do negotiate similar agreements for their members already. That seems a bit unfair. So it is okay for those who are members of unions to negotiate similar compensatory time arrangements, it is okay for those who work in the public sector under the law to utilize compensatory time, but it is just not good enough for the hourly wage employee in the private sector. That is more than unfair. The legislation is completely voluntary for both the employer and the employee. It does not affect the 40hour workweek or change the way overtime is calculated. It strengthens provisions for workers and increases penalties for abuse. It contains strong anticoercion provisions that would prohibit an employer from directly or indirectly trying to intimidate or coerce workers into taking comp time. Workers have the option under the Working Families Flexibility Act to cash out at any time. If for some reason this agreement, this voluntary agreement, just isn’t working out, an employee can always take the cash, no questions asked. And, finally, for workers represented by a labor union, any comp time arrangement would have to be negotiated under this bill as part of the collective bargaining agreement, just as they already do. Mr. Speaker, as I finish tonight, I just want to say again, as a mom, a working mom, a family where both parents work outside of the home, I certainly understand for some of us the time, our time, the time that has been accrued by an hourly wage employee, is more important than the cash wages. That may not be true for everybody. That remains in that the employee can determine what he or she wants to do with their time. Again, I am grateful for the many people who have worked so hard on this bill over the years. I am grateful for the opportunity to represent Alabama’s Second District and to represent so many hardworking American families here tonight in this hour. I look forward to the debate tomorrow here on the floor on this bill. I would urge all of my colleagues to please vote in favor of H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
CELEBRATING NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS WEEK AND SUCCESS ACADEMY (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Charter Schools Week, I want to highlight my recent visit to Success Academy Harlem 1, which is 1 of 41 charter schools in the largest and highest performing public charter school network in New York City. Success Academy current serves 14,000 students and has more than 16,000 families on its wait list. Founded in 2006, Harlem 1 is Success Academy’s first school, and founder Eva Moskowitz served as its first principal. With a focus on developing the whole child, Success Academy aims to make its schools joyful places of learning. I am here to tell you that these schools are getting results, and they are joyful. Five of the top five schools in the State of New York in math and two of the top five schools in English are Success Academy schools. Every student in every school deserves an excellent education, but unfortunately we are falling far short of that goal as a nation. Thankfully, innovative charter schools like Success Academy Harlem 1 are providing thousands of families with new hope and opportunity. f 
THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY AND ITS IMPACT ON MINORITY COMMUNITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour with my esteemed colleague from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ). For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, Congress, the constituents we represent, and all Americans. This evening, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ), my friend and colleague, I first thank him for his continued leadership of the caucus and on issues impacting Black America and other minority communities across this great Nation. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ), my colleague, for joining me in chairing this evening’s Special Order hour, and my other CBC colleagues who are joining us to speak on important issues. Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to address the first 100 days of the Trump Presidency and its impact on minority communities like the district I represent and those of my fellow CBC colleagues. Specifically, we will highlight 100 actions taken by this administration in the last 100 days with less than positive impact to the communities we represent. The President hails his first 100 days as the most successful in the history of the United States. These actions, however, do not spell success for low income and minority communities. Actions that, in turn, roll back Department of Justice protections designed to ensure police accountability; actions that threaten to further restrict voting rights and undermine the public education system; actions that threaten 
access to quality affordable health care for millions of Americans, including children, seniors, and those with preexisting medical conditions; actions that propose gutting programs, HUD, and others that provide housing assistance for extremely lowincome families and the homeless; meanspirited actions that break up families and make immigrant communities less safe; and actions that roll back important environmental protections which serve to, among other things, ensure safe air and drinking waters in communities like Flint, Michigan, and mitigating the effects of climate change in vulnerable coastal communities like my home district of the United States Virgin Islands. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus has reached out to President Trump and is willing to work with his administration to continue to build upon the greatness of this country— and not just for the privileged few but for all. As representatives of a congressional district that is home to the only HBCU outside the continental United States, I take exception to the administration’s Education Secretary viewing HBCUs as pioneers for school choice, even though these institutions were founded because White colleges and universities refused to admit Black students. This statement illustrates a lack of understanding of the history of the African Americans and the Black community. President Trump’s proposed budget for the Department of Education plans to eliminate afterschool and teachersupport programs, as well as slashing funding for Federal supplemental education opportunity grants, Pell grants, and instead divert Federal funds to private school vouchers. This plan would be devastating to communities like my home district where almost onethird of the children live below the poverty line and where public schools are already struggling to make the best with limited funds and resources. b2015 President Trump’s budget proposal would also cut the Department of Health and Human Services’ budget by $12.6 billion, a 16 percent cut. In my home district of the United States Virgin Islands, HHS funds critical early childhood education; and nutrition programs provide assistance to seniors, lowincome families, and funding for mental health programs. Mr. Speaker, these and other actions that my colleagues will speak about are not to criticize the President, but more to highlight the importance of funding of these programs and, more importantly, highlighting how important these programs and government functions are to American families and to the safety and progress of our communities. America, stay woke. There are still more than 1,300 days to go. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ). Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for all of her hard work on this Special Order hour. I enjoy coanchoring with the gentlewoman because of her commitment and wanting to get out these important messages. I think the message we want to talk about today is the first 100 days. I don’t know about you all, but I am disappointed in these first 100 days. There were a lot of things that we were told were going to happen, and many of those things just hadn’t happened. There has been a lot of flipflopping. I know that you have seen that. We saw it on Syria. We saw it on NATO. We saw it on many other things that there was a whole lot of talk that happened in 2016, but there ain’t a whole lot of walking that has happened in 2017 as far as followup is concerned. That is the sort of thing that all Americans should be worried about in these first 100 days that ended on Saturday. Many of us hoped that the rhetoric, that the foolishness, the tweeting, that those types of things would stop. That hasn’t stopped. A lot of us actually hoped that—hey, if you want to talk about bringing some jobs back to somebody, I am for bringing jobs back. I am more committed to jobs and having jobs here in this country, and he hasn’t done anything when it comes to jobs. There has been absolutely no follow up whatsoever when it comes to helping the American man and woman reopen factories, when it comes to helping the American man and woman help pay for their child care. When it comes to things like DavisBacon and putting more money on the table at the end of the night and in the bank accounts, absolutely nothing has been done, and that is what we should be concerned about. The President promised on the campaign trail that he was going to help these hardworking Americans that I talked about earlier. One of the things that he talked about was the Buy American, Hire American. Ain’t nothing happening on that. We know that not only did Trump fail to deliver on these promises, but that he has actually worked against the best interests of American workers. He has also gone on to contradict himself on his commitment to job training. Instead of investing in job training and these crucial programs, the Trump administration has proposed $2.5 billion in cuts for the Department of Labor. We have, by many estimates, about a half a million or more jobs in this country that are highskilled manufacturing jobs that we can’t fill. These are jobs that could fill factories back up in the Rust Belt. These are jobs that could fill factories back up in Texas. These are jobs that could be filled up in other parts of the country. You want to cut back on job training when we need to be training people for these new jobs? These are new manufacturing jobs that deal with robots, deal with programmers and different areas like that where the young people don’t necessarily have the skills that they need to be competitive. You hear about these companies that have come to America, they locate here—foreign car manufacturers, for instance—and they have to work with the local community colleges to get the kids on par to work these new manufacturing jobs. Now is not the time to cut back on job training. So that is what bothers me in these first 100 days. The administration has rolled back worker protections that keep Americans safe while on the job. Last month, President Trump changed the law so that employers now only have 6 months to report workplace injuries and illnesses instead of the previously required 5year reporting window. Scaling back the requirement does not allow the Department of Labor to get a full picture of a given workplace. It makes it more difficult to spot a trend of endangering employees. Trump also gutted another worker protection that would have made it harder for companies to secure Federal contracts if they have a history of labor law violations. That protection is now gone. It is gone. It has disappeared. Above all else, President Trump has still not put forward a single, concrete, jobcreating bill like he pledged. He betrayed his promise to make rebuilding America’s infrastructure a top priority of this administration. He has failed to mention a word about protecting the DavisBacon Act which, as you know, would ensure that workers are paid fairly should an infrastructure bill come together. Again, when you are talking about money, I mean that is a very serious topic. Money decides whether or not you can pay your bills, whether or not you can put food on the table, whether or not you can buy your kids clothes, whether or not you can make the car payment. The DavisBacon Act is a basic fundamental. If you cannot protect that, those prevailing wages that give people the opportunity to earn a good income, again, then you are just talking and you ain’t walking. That is what I am worried about in these first 100 days. You are going to hear a lot from the Congressional Black Caucus tonight about how the President has failed to deliver on so many of his campaign promises, how he is trying to take away health care from 24 million Americans. Highrisk pools are absolutely terrible. One of the things the Obama administration did was it gave people who have preexisting conditions the chance to have affordable healthcare insurance. Thinking about taking insurance away from 24 million people, thinking about taking those protections from individual families that have those preexisting conditions, I think, is absolutely terrible. 
There are just so many policies that actually directly affect the American family. Remember, the very first day— and there have been so many bad things that have happened in these 100 days that we don’t even have enough time to cover all of them tonight, but you probably remember the very first day, the firsttime homebuyer program was suspended. There is nothing that exemplifies what it means to be American as it means to own a home. That is the first day, the first action, the most antiworker, most antifamily action that anyone could take—got rid of the firsttime homebuyer program. He got rid of the firsttime homebuyer program that helped individuals have a piece of the American Dream: homeownership. We have seen the statistics about what homeownership means to the American family, what that means for the stability of American families, kids being able to have that backyard to play in, being able to go to that neighborhood school, to have that home to call your own to raise your family. It is so much more than just a home. It is really the foundation of who we are as Americans. Getting rid of the firsttime home buyer program, that is not doing anything to help American families. That is not doing anything to help American workers. I am glad that we have so many great voices here tonight within the CBC that are going to talk about these first 100 days and about the failings of these first 100 days and about how the people that were there, the people that thought that there were going to be some real changes, how they have been misled. They have been misled. They have been taken down this road, and it is not a road of prosperity. It is a road of less prosperity. It is a road of dismay, despair, less money, more expensive insurance, no insurance, and it is going to hurt the American worker and the American family. So I just really appreciate everything that the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) is doing today and hope that we can continue to get the media and the newspapers and the cable TV news people out here to really focus in and hone in on some of these problems that we are seeing coming out of the White House at 1600 Pennsylvania. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) is correct about staying focused and, in the lexicon of the young people, to stay woke about what is happening. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) gave some great examples about some of the things that happened in this first 100 days that should make us aware how this is, in some ways, an assault on distressed communities, on minority communities. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) spoke to some of them. One of the things I wanted to highlight is a booklet that the Congressional Black Caucus has put out about 100 actions that have taken place in these 100 days: President Trump’s proposed budget would eliminate the Economic Development Administration at the Department of Commerce. In 2015, EDA invested 38 percent of its funds in highly distressed areas, including communities with high minority populations, such as the gentleman from Texas’ and mine. President Trump’s proposed budget would eliminate the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. People ask, What is that? This is an organization which channels investments into communities in need of capital for housing, small businesses, and community facilities. That is its sole function. President Trump said that the private sector already did a good job making investments in these communities, which demonstrates how out of touch and illinformed he and his administration are. His administration needs to tell him and give him the facts about what is going on in minority and underdeveloped communities. As we will hear from our colleagues, there are areas in which environmental protection and climate change, social justice for environmental justice needs to take place. President Trump’s proposed budget would cut environmental protection agencies, environmental justice programs that work to ensure the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, and national origin or income with the respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. It would simply cut it out of place. The proposed budget would cut the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s coastal programs, which would affect populations, including minorities living along the Gulf Coast and other coastal areas. At this time, we have other members of the Congressional Black Caucus that are here to talk about environmental justice. This freshman Member has really stepped in and just taken a hold of actions and demonstrating a love for his constituents in coming here this evening and wanting to address environmental justice areas. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ). Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, every Monday, Representatives PLASKETT  and VEASEY lead our Caucus’ discussion on issues of great importance to the American people, and I am glad to be joining them this evening to discuss a critical priority that is often overlooked: environmental justice. Our country is built upon ideals like liberty, justice, equal protection for all Americans, yet we still fall short on those goals in important ways. While I believe we are making progress, this is a critical moment. Over the last 100 days, we have seen how eager the new administration is to undo our recent achievements, from selecting EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a man who does not believe in climate change, to overturning critical antipollution protections. The Trump administration has shown a dangerous contempt for proven science. The administration has even favorably discussed pulling the United States from a global climate change prevention pact, a move that could have disastrous, unknowable consequences for every generation to come. Mr. Speaker, the list goes on and on and on; but at this point, Mr. Speaker, before I continue, I want to bring forward my good friend—he has got a fabulous first name like I do—Congressman DONALD PAYNE , Jr. He is from the 10th Congressional District of New Jersey. He is a fierce advocate for environmental justice in his hometown of Newark. I thank the Congressman. His voice and advocacy will help us move toward sounder policies and more just outcomes, and I look forward to working with the gentleman. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ). Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from the Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ). It is the birthplace of my mother: Dinwiddie County, Virginia. My grandfather was a smalltime tobacco farmer, and I learned to cut tobacco at 8 years old. I am from Newark, New Jersey, the Garden State. We didn’t raise much tobacco there in the Garden State, but my friends used think I was going on vacation when I would leave. I said I wasn’t going on vacation; I was going to work. That is what we did for the summer. It was a great experience, and I always have great, great memories of the Commonwealth of Virginia. b2030 Mr. Speaker, last month, as part of a partnership with the National Newspaper Publishers Association, I wrote an oped on environmental justice issues. I will repeat what I wrote then, which is that environmental justice should be a national priority, not a problem confined to minority communities. AfricanAmerican communities are disproportionately burdened with pollutants. Across the Nation, communities of color suffer from higher rates of exposure to air pollution, higher rates of lead poisoning, and higher rates of water pollution. Every single day, children in my home city of Newark, New Jersey, are exposed to harmful levels of pollution from the port and other sources that rob them of their health, just because of where they live. One in four Newark children has asthma. The hospitalization rate for Newark children is 30 times the rate of 
the national average. Asthma is the leading cause of absenteeism in school age children in the city of Newark, New Jersey. Yet, too often, environmental justice is an afterthought, or often it is missing entirely in the discussion of the challenges facing African Americans. The Trump administration threatens to make the problem even worse. President Trump has prioritized rolling back environmental regulations, from emissions rules for power plants to the mandate that Federal decisionmaking must be taken into consideration on climate change impacts. President Trump proposed slashing the EPA’s budget by 31 percent, cutting enforcement of the Agency’s clean air laws by $129 million. With threats of excessive cuts to the EPA, air quality across the Nation may even be worse than expected. In the American Lung Association’s ‘‘State of the Air’’ report, my district and many other metropolitan areas ranked as having the most polluted air in the country. However, only one third of counties have ozone or particulate pollution air monitors. We must fight to ensure that funding for air monitors are for all our communities. So what can we do to protect our communities from environmental degradation? The Newark City Council has been a leader in that area and has passed a firstinthenation ordinance requiring developers to request environmental permits to inform the city of any environmental impacts. As a result, decisionmakers and the public will be able to make informed decisions about sustainable development. Other municipalities would be smart to follow Newark’s lead. Last November, I joined Amy Goldsmith and Kim Gaddy of the Clean Water Action and the Coalition for Healthy Ports for an environmental justice tour of the Port of New York and New Jersey. We were also joined by Congressman FRANK PALLONE from New Jersey. Organizations like theirs are doing excellent work in the fight against healththreatening pollution. Expanding partnerships on the environmental justice initiatives must be a central part of our strategy to secure environmental protections. To those listening at home: I encourage you to make it clear to your elected officials that you will hold them accountable for any efforts to dismantle environmental protections and any failures to fight for environmental justice. And to my colleague from Virginia, it is really noteworthy that you have taken the lead on this issue. As I stated in my presentation, Newark, New Jersey, is 30 times greater propensity for asthma in children than the national average. I mean, that is almost criminal. And we as a home, myself, not just have heard about it, but have lived it. My middle son—I am the father of triplets. My middle son has grown up with asthma; the days we had to keep him inside. He has been fortunate to have not—knock on wood—have many instances throughout his childhood of asthma attacks, but the one that I did see really brought me to tears. To know that there are numbers of children throughout this country who don’t have the opportunity to go to the doctor, who rush to the hospital with asthma attacks, and who, God forbid, sometimes don’t make it to the doctor is just—to think that that could be my boy brings tears to my heart. So I am willing to make this fight not for just my son, but for the hundreds of thousands of children throughout this country who suffer from this disease, and make sure that the EPA stays intact to fight these dreaded diseases, especially in minority communities, in our young people, and throughout the country. I will close with the drinking water issue in Flint. The Congressional Black Caucus went out to Flint when the issue first came up. Ms. PELOSI was there as well, and we talked to the people of Flint and heard firsthand their heartbreak and not being able to think they could trust anyone. Their government had let them down, had lied to them, had given them poison to drink and said it is okay. It looked like rusty water, but they told them that it was fine to use it for baths or whatever. So I am sitting there on that stage listening to all this and I am thinking in the back of my head: I am from Newark, New Jersey, the third oldest city in this country’s history. So Flint, Michigan, can’t be that old because Lewis and Clark went West. So the third oldest city, what were my pipes like? What was the condition of my water system? And I went back and I saw several mayors from my district, and I said: I suggest you start looking at your water systems. And that was on a Friday. That Tuesday we got a report from the Newark school system. They found lead in the drinking water in 44 schools in Newark that next—not even a week. So we know how important these issues are, and we will continue to fight for what is right in our communities. I appreciate the opportunity and your leadership on this issue. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ), from the great city of Philadelphia. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my great colleague from the Virgin Islands for the great introduction. I really appreciate her leadership, and my colleague from Texas’ leadership. This discussion that we have been having is relating to the President’s 100 days. And I think it is 102 at this particular point. The question that I and members of the Congressional Black Caucus have constantly been raising is: What do we have to lose with President Trump’s cuts to the EPA? As I always said: What don’t we have to lose? We have a lot to lose. In the time that I met with the organization in my community—a number of organizations—called Mothers for Clean Air, they were extremely concerned about the cuts to the EPA. The President’s budget cuts $2.6 billion from the EPA budget. They were concerned about the impact that that would have. As a matter of fact, I talked to a mother who talked about her twins and what kind of effect that would have. The President wants to cut programs like Pollution Prevention Programs, Lead Risk Reduction Programs—which has been a problem in the case of the city of Philadelphia, a problem that we thought we dealt with, but with a cut on the lead reduction program, that would just reinforce the program—the Water Quality Research Programs, and the Environmental Education Programs. Who do you want to help when you cut 31 percent of the EPA budget? No one. The cuts would be horrendous and have a dangerous negative impact on not only our communities of color, but everyone nationwide. Two weeks ago I sent a letter to EPA Administrator Pruitt outlining how the plan to cut fundamental EPA programs would have a negative impact on our children and most vulnerable in Philadelphia, all across the State and the Nation. Last week marks 3 weeks—3 years, I should say, since the city of Flint, Michigan, decided to switch their water supply from the Detroit area water system to the Flint River water system, which resulted in lead contamination within the city. It is 3 years later and, sadly, not much has changed for the communities in Flint. Three days is too long to go without clean drinking water. Three years is simply heartbreaking. Mr. President, we have seen how various communities across the U.S. are at greater risk of health problems due to overexposure to unsafe drinking water. Now is no time to cut funding for Americans in need. As Questlove says: ‘‘Without science, we are truly operating blindly.’’ The cuts to the EPA would have an increasingly harmful impact, especially for communities of color and hardworking families who do not have the means nor the resources to fight back against their local governments about the safety of the water they drink or question old paint in their house. According to the State Department of Health, in 2014, more than 10 percent of the children from Philadelphia had elevated levels of lead in their blood because they were exposed to lead based paint. Exposure to leadbased paint is a chronic problem that goes undiscussed too often. No level is safe for our children to be exposed to, just as no level of lead is safe for our children to drink. 
Yet, the President says rather boldly that things are moving in the right direction. I would like to know what community he is talking about. He clearly couldn’t be talking about the community that I am from. Now, more than ever, we need to keep the resistance alive, speak up and speak out for our communities at risk. I will not stand silent while the vital EPA programs that protect and enhance the lives of all Americans are at risk of being cut. Together, we are the voice of the people, so there is no way we will be silent. We will continue this message. Ms. PLASKETT. I thank the gentleman, Congressman EVANS , for keeping us focused and giving us the information we need to understand what real communities are going through and the environmental justice that we need to be fighting for in this administration. I appreciate that so much. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ), who has been the person who was at the forefront of this evening, bringing issues of environmental justice to our minds and exposing and explaining to the American people the assault on environmental justice that is taking place right now, and appealing to President Trump to be mindful of those communities who are going to be affected by the cuts and by other interest groups that are going after the basic needs that Americans have to stay healthy and stay alive. b2045 Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman. As has been demonstrated tonight, on nearly every facet of environmental policy, we are in danger of backsliding irreparably. I want to talk about an area where that danger is especially great and where stakes are especially high. Today, and for much of our history, certain communities have been the victims of profound environmental injustice. Lower income, rural, tribal, and especially minority communities are at an increased risk of exposure to the negative impacts of pollution and climate change. For far too long, communities of color have been on the front lines of environmental and economic injustice, shouldering the health burdens of living in areas with higher rates of dangerous fossil fuel pollution and lower rates of income and employment. Mr. Speaker, an AfricanAmerican child born in the United States has twice the chance of developing asthma than a White child and is four times more likely to die from an asthma attack. This is not a coincidental statistic ginned up for shock and awe but the daytoday reality that African American families across the United States have been dealing with for decades. Rooted in America’s legacy of segregation and redlining communities of color while simultaneously restricting their government services, employment opportunities, and environmental protections, AfricanAmerican families have historically borne the brunt of the worst health impacts of polluting industries and have received dwindling economic opportunities due to systemic racism. This is why we see coal plants, oil refineries, and natural gas plants, which spew some of the most toxic substances around into the air and contaminate water supplies, are frequently located in communities of color—communities that have little political or economic power to protect themselves. These disparities, Mr. Speaker, are unacceptable, and they did not arise in a vacuum. In many cases, they have been the avoidable results of government action or inaction. For example, according to the FY 2015 Annual Environmental Justice Progress Report, ‘‘Many lowincome, minority, and tribal communities are disproportionately impacted by air pollution and are not able to participate in environmental decisions due to barriers preventing them from meaningfully engaging in the political process.’’ These voices deserve to be heard. Their silence—particularly their enforced silence—is unacceptable, and it is incompatible with our, small D, democratic values. The practical consequences of that silence are dire: poorer public health, diminished economic opportunity, and decreased quality of life. To address these grave human and civil rights issues, the environmental justice movement was born—a movement grounded in the belief that all citizens, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic class, should share fairly in the benefits of environmental resources and the burdens of environmental hazards. As policymakers, Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility to embrace that vision—to correct and prevent environmental injustice. We can and we must do better. It is not enough to avoid repeating past mistakes. True equity requires a recognition that some communities have been hurt much more and, as a result, need more resources and targeted assistance. If we succeed—if we achieve equitable policies that promote environmental justice—our world will become a more fair, more liveable, and more sustainable place. But if we fail, public health will suffer. People will lead shorter and harder lives. None of us should be willing to accept that outcome. Mr. Speaker, I think it is worth noting that the environmental justice movement began in 1982, when North Carolina established a toxic waste landfill in Warren County—a poor, rural, majority AfricanAmerican locality—over the objections of the residents. In the more than 20 years since, many environmental justice organizations have formed. During the Clinton administration, the pursuit of environmental justice became a Federal priority. Sadly, though, these improvements have not been enough to fix longstanding problems, and, again, the progress we have made is under grave threat. Left unchecked, this administration would devastate communities of color and many other vulnerable groups as well. Today, the Trump administration is rolling back budgets, cutting offices, obscuring scientific information, and attacking legislation aimed at curbing environmental justice. That is why, on March 7, we witnessed the resignation of Mr. Mustafa Ali from his post as leader of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental Justice Program. For more than two decades, Mr. Ali helped lead our Nation’s efforts to secure justice and positive change for vulnerable communities that have seen their public health threatened and the quality of their air, water, and land degraded. In his letter, Mr. Ali said: ‘‘Communities of color, lowincome communities, and indigenous populations are still struggling to receive equal protections before the law. ‘‘These communities, both rural and urban, often live in areas with toxic levels of air pollution, crumbling or nonexistent water and sewer infrastructure, lead in the drinking water, brownfields from vacant former industrial and commercial sites, Superfund and other hazardous waste sites, as well as other sources of exposure to pollutants. ‘‘Despite the many challenges we face regarding the impacts of pollution and a changing climate, we have just as many effective tools and programs with long track records of assisting vulnerable communities in meeting their goals of improving public health and enhancing the environmental quality of their local communities.’’ Mr. Speaker, I know my Democratic colleagues are eager to use these tools to secure just outcomes and better lives for the people we represent. Mr. Speaker, I urge my friends in the majority to join with us. Mr. Speaker, in concluding, I would like to thank my colleagues for joining me this evening to discuss environmental justice. Together, we have amplified a simple truth: regardless of the color of your skin, how much money you make, or where you live, every American is entitled to clean air, clean water, and access to our public lands. Again, when we fail to achieve those goals, public health suffers, quality of life suffers, and people lead shorter and harder lives. We know that climate change is real. We know that it is being caused by human activity. If we fail to act, we know that there are going to be terrible consequences for the entire human community. We also know that vulnerable populations and marginalized communities are poised to suffer the most—just as they have in the past. That kind of environmental 
injustice has a long history, and it must stop. That is why, this past week, I announced the creation of the United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force alongside my colleagues, Congresswoman JAYAPAL from Washington State and Congresswoman BARRAGA ´Nfrom California. We are going to fight every day to prevent climate change and to mitigate its worst effects. We are going to advocate for policies that correct and prevent environmental injustice. We are going to defend every American’s right to clean air, safe water, and healthy communities. I think I can speak for all three of us when I say that we look forward to working with you all. Millions of working families are counting on us, Mr. Speaker, as their Representatives in the House and the Senate to serve them and to make wise decisions to improve their lives. We must confront environmental and economic injustices through fierce participation in the planning processes in at risk areas moving forward. That means demanding more stringent environmental compliance and enforcement that protect communities of color from fossil fuel pollution and demanding greater investments in clean energy deployment in historically AfricanAmerican communities that will create union and familywage jobs with upward mobility. I know my colleagues on this side of the aisle are committed to making this change, and I challenge our friends in the majority to join us. I urge them to support greater transparency, objectivity, and outreach in environmental policymaking. I urge them to support processes that improve twoway communication between decisionmakers and the people their decisions affect. I urge them to help ensure that the decisionmakers are confronting the full effects of their choices—including how consequences are distributed and by whom they are borne. Protecting the environment, Mr. Speaker—creation care—is my passion. I commit to you that I will continue fighting each and every day to address climate change and sea level rise, push for renewable energy and green technologies, and do everything I can to leave this planet a better place for future generations. Mr. Speaker, I am an Eagle Scout, and I know that we are supposed to leave the campground better than the way we found it. The time is now to continue fighting for perhaps the most important issue of the 21st century— the environment. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) for her indulgence. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. MCEACHIN for his passion and for his commitment to these issues of environmental justice. Particularly in the Virgin Islands, we know that climate change is real. We feel it, and we see it in how we operate and how our environment is changing, whether it be mosquitoes and Zika, before that chikungunya and dengue. We know that the effects of climate change are impacting our health and impacting the livelihoods of our environment. The Congressional Black Caucus supports policies that ensure that all Americans also have access to a clean and healthy environment. Studies have long shown an unsettling correlation between race and the location of hazardous waste facilities. For example, a 1983 Government Accountability Office study found that 75 percent of hazardous waste landfills in eight southeastern States were located in predominantly poor and minority communities. The places where minorities live, work, and learn are significantly compromised by air, water, land, soil, noise, and light pollutants. Black Americans and other minorities are predisposed to health issues directly linked to environmental and toxic waste. We cannot take away funding to support the eradication of these health hazards. We must continue to push for that. We are not here as the Congressional Black Caucus simply to disparage our President. We are not here to point out his fallacies. But we would be doing a grave disservice to the people that we represent, not just minorities but all Americans, if we do not stand up and discuss the issues that are of grave concern to us, to ask for support and funding, to ask that there not be a rollback on many of the gains that we have had that have supported and helped our community. At the beginning of the 115th Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus launched: ‘‘What Did Trump Do?’’ It was a rapidresponse messaging document we used to inform our external stakeholders. This ‘‘What Did Trump Do?’’ is a special #staywoke edition. We are listing 100 actions President Trump and his administration have taken over the last 100 days. It was developed by 78 million Americans that the CBC collectively represent, including 17 million African Americans, as well as millions of Americans we do not represent. We want this information to be before the American people to show that work must still be done. We talked about environmental areas. I am going to list some of the things that have happened in the 100 days that we need to be cognizant of, that we need to make sure that these things do not take place, and that they not become embedded in this great America in which we live. On February 28, Attorney General Sessions said that the DOJ would pull back from using its legal authority to monitor police departments responsible for repeated instances of police misconduct and abuses by backing away from legal commitment first enacted into law by Representative JOHN CONYERS as part of the 1994 crime reform legislation. Sessions sent a signal to the AfricanAmerican community that the police misconduct laws will not be equally and fully enforced. On that same day, the President signed a bill that rolled back a regulation restricting gun purchases by the mentally ill through a use of background checks. Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Obamaera order to reduce the use of privately operated prisons. The use of privately operated prisons creates a financial incentive to lock people up using African Americans, Latinos, and poor people. In addition, in comparison to the governmentoperated prisons, privately operated prisons are less safe and secure for both staff and inmates, don’t provide the same level of rehabilitative services like educational programs and job trainings which increase the likelihood that those who are released from prison will return to a life of crime. Finally, although privately operated prisons are said to be more cost effective than government prisons, they are not because those that are in those prisons will continue to, in many instances, come back causing a burden not just on the American people and taxpayers but on the families and the communities in which those individuals reside. Other things that have happened in these first 100 days: President Trump appointed Candace E. Jackson as Acting Assistant Secretary for civil rights at the Department of Education. Ms. Jackson once said that affirmative action promotes racial discrimination and claims she was discriminated against for being White. Secretary DeVos hired Robert Eitel, an official with deep ties to the forprofit college industry, to be a Special Assistant to the Department of Education. This hire presents a serious conflict of interest and raises questions about whether Eitel can put students’ needs above the interest of his former colleagues. President Trump’s proposed budget for the Department of Education hurts lowincome students from preK through college by undermining public education through the elimination of afterschool and teachersupport programs and diverting Federal funds to private school vouchers, eliminating support for college students, gutting Federal workstudy, and slashing critical funding for Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and Pell grants. All of these cuts would have severe consequences for our Nation’s students—not just African Americans but Latinos and students in large urban areas. No afterschool programs, no support for teachers—what will our children do? b2100 What will those families do that need those children and that support? 
On March 9, EPA Administrator Pruitt said that he did not think that carbon dioxide was the primary driver of global warming even though that is the public position of EPA, NOAA, and NASA. We can go on and on. We have a document with over 100 actions that have been taken in the last 100 days. In housing and homeownership, President Trump’s proposed budget would cut the Department of Housing and Urban Development by $6 billion. HUD is responsible for providing housing assistance to extremely lowincome families and the homeless and reinvesting in American cities and counties. Those same proposed budgets would end the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which assists families with energy costs, including home energy bills, energy crises, weatherization, and energyrelated home repair. These are some of the many examples of what has happened. We give these examples not merely to degrade what has happened with this administration, but to show that work must still be done and that we, as Americans, must stay woke to what is happening in this country. We must keep our eyes vigilant and on the prize and ensure that Americans will see what is really happening and not be moved by the media, by the tweets, but see actual facts. We are working in real facts here to let you know what needs to be done and that we, the Congressional Black Caucus, as Members of Congress, are asking our colleagues across the aisle and in the Democratic Caucus to support us and to support the issues that are relevant not just to African Americans, but to all Americans this day. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota). Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands? There was no objection. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to expose the cavalier disregard of environmental justice by our President during his first 100 days in office. In a short period of time, President Donald J. Trump made clear his agenda—anticlimate, antiscience, and antifact. The current administration has already taken significant steps, in lockstep with Congressional Republicans, to roll back and erase the progress made by the Obama Administration to protect our health, our public lands, and our precious environment. Since taking office, President Trump has signed a number of executive orders reversing many of President Obama’s environmental protections—promoting cleaner air, cleaner water, and more sustainable energy production. The current White House is on a fast track to derail decades of progress and set our nation back in the effort to combat climate change. The Clean Power Plan, which established comprehensive carbon emission standards and put the United States at the forefront of global environmental stewardship, was one of Trump’s first targets. Instead of investing in technological and scientific innovation to make America a leader in greener, cleaner, sustainable energy production and consumption, President Trump has used his office to support the interests of corporations and interests in big oil and dirty coal on the backs of hardworking Americans. Furthermore, the current administration has promulgated efforts to expand environmentally detrimental offshore drilling, allow the dumping of mining waste, and potentially force an exit from the 2015 Paris Agreement which brought the world’s powers together in agreement to curb our collective carbon emissions. The proposed budget goes even further in rejecting evidencedbased policymaking. From proposals to cripple the Environmental Protection Agency and zeroout critical programs at the Department of Energy like ARPA–E, this administration has abandoned our nation’s effort to protect our planet and be a global leader. Our administration’s blatant disregard toward the health, economic, and national security risks associated with global climate change is shortsighted and will only further endanger Americans’ health, security, and economic stability. While we will all suffer from the consequences of shortsighted federal policy, the heaviest burden is bound to fall on those already marginalized. Minorities and working class families are already struggling to make ends meet, but study after study shows that they are the most vulnerable to environmental injustices. Subject to downwind and downstream pollution, children and families who are economically disadvantaged often lack the political voice to keep industries from polluting their communities and frequently bear the brunt of deregulatory regimes. Take Flint, Michigan for example, where young children have been exposed to toxic levels of lead from their drinking water. That is wrong and should be unheard of in the world’s most powerful nation. I urge my colleagues to consider the kind of country we want our children to live in. Where is the freedom in living in a community where there is no access to clean drinking water, or a city where children are forced to stay inside because the air is so polluted? We can and must do better, Mr. Speaker. The actions the President has set forth thus far do nothing to Make America Great Again; rather, his first one hundred days has only made America more polluted, less safe, and less secure. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand firm in their resolve to hold this and future administrations accountable to keeping our air clean, our water safe, and our environment sustainable for future generations. We have far too much to lose, Mr. Speaker, and future generations deserve our better judgement.
